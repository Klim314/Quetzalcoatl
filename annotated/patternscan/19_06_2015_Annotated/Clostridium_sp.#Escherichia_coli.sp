TI  == identification and catalytic residues of the arsenite methyltransferase from a sulfate-reducing bacterium, clostridium sp. bxm.
AB  == arsenic methylation is an important process frequently occurring in anaerobic environments. anaerobic microorganisms have been implicated as the major contributors for as methylation. however, very little information is available regarding the enzymatic mechanism of as methylation by anaerobes. in this study,  one novel sulfate-reducing bacterium isolate, clostridium sp. bxm, which was isolated from a paddy soil in our laboratory, was demonstrated to have the ability of methylating as. one putative arsenite s-adenosyl-methionine methyltransferase (arsm) gene, csarsm was cloned from clostridium sp. bxm. heterologous expression of csarsm conferred as resistance and the ability of methylating as to an as-sensitive strain of escherichia coli. purified methyltransferase csarsm catalyzed the formation of methylated products from arsenite, further confirming its function of as methylation. site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrated that three conserved cysteine residues at positions 65, 153 and 203 in csarsm are necessary for arsenite methylation, but only cysteine 153 and cysteine 203 are required for the methylation of monomethylarsenic to dimethylarsenic. these results provided the characterization of arsenic methyltransferase from anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacterium. given that sulfate-reducing bacteria are ubiquitous in various wetlands including paddy soils, enzymatic methylation mediated by these anaerobes is proposed to contribute to the arsenic biogeochemical cycling.

TI  == phytase modulates ileal microbiota and enhances growth performance of the broiler chickens.
AB  == phytase is well studied and explored, however, little is known about its effects  on the microbial ecology of the gastrointestinal tract. in total, 400 one-day-old female ross 308 chicks were randomly distributed to four experimental groups. the dietary treatments were arranged as a 2 x 2 complete factorial design, with the factors being adequate (pc) or insufficient calcium (ca) and digestible phosphor  (dp)(nc) and with or without 5000 phytase units (ftu)/kg of escherichia coli 6-phytase. the gastrointestinal tract ph values, ileal microbial communities and  short-chain fatty acid concentrations in the digesta were determined. the reduction in ca and dp concentration significantly affected ph in the crop and caeca, and addition of phytase to the nc resulted in a ph increase in the ileum.  the reduction in ca and dp concentration significantly lowered, while phytase supplementation increased ileal total bacterial counts. additionally, the deficient diet reduced butyrate- but increased lactate-producing bacteria. the addition of phytase increased lactobacillus sp./enterococcus sp. whereas in case  of clostridium leptum subgroup, clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale cluster, bifidobacterium sp. and streptococcus/lactococcus counts, a significant  ca and dp level x phytase interaction was found. however, the recorded interactions indicated that the effects of phytase and ca and dp levels were not  consistent. furthermore, the reduction of ca and dp level lowered clostridium perfringens and enterobacteriaceae counts. the analysis of fermentation products  showed that reducing the ca and dp content in the diet reduced total scfa, dl-lactate, and acetic acid in the ileum whereas phytase increased concentrations of these acids in the nc group. this suggests that p is a factor which limits fermentation in the ileum. it may be concluded that phytase plays a role in modulating the gut microbiota of chicken, however, this is clearly linked with the levels of p and ca in a diet.

TI  == characteristics of metroxylon sagu resistant starch type iii as prebiotic substance.
AB  == resistant starch type iii (rs3 ) was produced from sago (metroxylon sagu) and evaluated for its characteristics as a prebiotic. two rs3 samples designated sago rs and hcl-sago rs contained 35.71% and 68.30% rs, respectively, were subjected to hydrolyses by gastric juice and digestive enzymes and to absorption. both sago rs and hcl-sago rs were resistant to 180 min hydrolysis by gastric acidity at ph  1 to 4 with less than 0.85% hydrolyzed. both samples were also resistant toward hydrolysis by gastrointestinal tract enzymes and intestinal absorption with 96.75% and 98.69% of rs3 were recovered respectively after 3.5 h digestion and overnight dialysis at 37 degrees c. sago rs3 supported the growth of both beneficial (lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) and pathogenic microbes (escherichia coli, campylobacter coli, and clostridium perfringens) in the range of 2.60 to 3.91 log10 cfu/ml. hence, prebiotic activity score was applied to describe the extent to which sago rs3 supports selective growth of the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria strains over pathogenic bacteria. the highest scores were obtained from bifidobacterium sp. ftdc8943 grown on sago rs (+0.26) and hcl-sago rs (+0.24) followed by l. bulgaricus ftdc1511 grown on sago rs (+0.21). the findings had suggested that sago rs3 has the prebiotic partial characteristics and it is suggested to further assess the suitability of sago rs3 as a prebiotic material.

TI  == development of rice bran treatment process and its use for the synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates from rice bran hydrolysate solution.
AB  == rice bran treatment process for the production of 43.7 kg of hydrolysate solution containing 24.41 g/l of glucose and small amount of fructose from 5 kg of rice bran was developed and employed to produce polyhydroxyalkanoates in recombinant escherichia coli and ralstonia eutropha strains. recombinant e. coli xl1-blue expressing r. eutropha phacab genes and r. eutropha ncimb11599 could produce poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) with the polymer contents of 90.1 wt% and 97.2 wt%, respectively, when they were cultured in chemically defined mr medium and chemically defined nitrogen free mr medium containing 10 ml/l of rice bran hydrolysate solution, respectively. also, recombinant e. coli xl1-blue and recombinant r. eutropha 437-540, both of which express the pseudomonas sp. phac1437 gene and the clostridium propionicum pct540 gene could produce poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate) from rice bran hydrolysate solution. these results suggest that rice bran may be a good renewable resource for the production of biomass-based polymers by recombinant microorganisms.

TI  == bacterial community structure associated with elective cesarean section versus vaginal delivery in chinese newborns.
AB  == objectives: increasing attention is being paid to the potential for cesarean birth to influence the taxa of the bacteria that compose the infant intestinal microbiota. the present study characterized the diversity of the intestinal microbiota in newborn infants delivered vaginally (vd) or by cesarean section (cd). methods: a cross-sectional study was performed using fecal specimens collected on days 2 and 4 of postnatal life from 25 vd infants and 16 cd infants. profiles of the fecal microbiota were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis in combination with 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequencing of the clones corresponding to the degenerating gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) bands. results: on days 2 and 4 of postnatal  life, vd and cd infants did not differ in the richness and evenness of the fecal  bacterial community; however, the taxa of the fecal microbiota were significantly different between the 2 groups. in vd infants, escherichia coli, bacteroides sp,  and bifidobacterium longum were the dominant microbes. in cd infants, staphylococcus sp, clostridium sp, enterobacter sp, and streptococcus sp were more common. conclusions: these results demonstrate that delivery method has a profound influence on the structure of the intestinal microbiota in chinese newborn infants. this is in accordance with data reported in other regions.

TI  == microbial evaluation of sandboxes located in urban area.
AB  == this paper presents the results of a study on the degree of bacteriological pollution of sandboxes situated in fenced and unfenced housing estates located in an urban area in olsztyn, poland. heterotrophic plate counts (hpc22, hpc37), enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and  clostridium perfringens determined by cultivation and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) methods were used as indicators of the sanitary state. their maximum number in the sand samples reached values of up to 5.4x10(7), 2.6x10(6),  3.3x10(4), 2.1x10(3), 1.8x10(4), 1.9x10(1) and 1.2x10(4)cfu/g, respectively. it was found that values of culture-independent method were two-four orders greater  than those obtained by the cultivation method. among identified enterobacteriaceae, pantoea spp. and enterobacter cloacae were the most numerous, whereas escherichia cells were detected only occasionally. pathogenic bacteria of the genus salmonella sp. were isolated from sandboxes also when e. coli were absent. bacteria from staphylococcus genus were isolated irrespective of the site and time of sampling. additionally, the presence of molds and yeasts was studied. maximum counts of these microorganisms amounted to 1.0x10(5) and to 3.5x10(4)cfu/g. aspergillus, penicillium, alternaria and trichoderma genera were  most numerous among molds, whereas trichosporon was detected most frequently among yeasts. sandboxes in the fenced housing estate and those located in the area which is not close to trees were less polluted than the sand collected from  sandboxes in the unfenced housing estate. potentially pathogenic bacteria of the  genus salmonella spp. were identified in analyzed sandboxes, also when toxocara and e. coli were absent. it seems that assessing the contamination of children's  play areas basing only on fecal bacteria counts and by monitoring number of parasites' eggs may be insufficient to evaluate microbial pollution of sandboxes  and may not fully reflect their safety for children.

TI  == metabolic engineering of ralstonia eutropha for the production of polyhydroxyalkanoates from sucrose.
AB  == a sucrose utilization pathway was established in ralstonia eutropha ncimb11599 and r. eutropha 437-540 by introducing the mannheimia succiniciproducens mbel55e  sacc gene that encodes beta-fructofuranosidase. these engineered strains were examined for the production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [p(3hb)] and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate) [p(3hb-co-la)], respectively, from sucrose as  a carbon source. it was found that beta-fructofuranosidase excreted into the culture medium could hydrolyze sucrose to glucose and fructose, which were efficiently used as carbon sources by recombinant r. eutropha strains. when r. eutropha ncimb11599 expressing the sacc gene was cultured in nitrogen-free chemically defined medium containing 20 g/l of sucrose, a high p(3hb) content of  73.2 wt% could be obtained. in addition, r. eutropha 437-540 expressing the pseudomonas sp. mbel 6-19 phac1437 gene and the clostridium propionicum pct540 gene accumulated p(3hb-co-21.5 mol% la) to a polymer content of 19.5 wt% from sucrose by the expression of the sacc gene and the escherichia coli ldha gene. the molecular weights of p(3hb) and p(3hb-co-21.5 mol%la) synthesized in r. eutropha using sucrose as a carbon source were 3.52 x 10(5) (mn ) and 2.19 x 10(4) (mn ), respectively. the engineered r. eutropha strains reported here will  be useful for the production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (phas) from sucrose, one of the most abundant and relatively inexpensive carbon sources.

TI  == identification of aminoglycoside and beta-lactam resistance genes from within an  infant gut functional metagenomic library.
AB  == the infant gut microbiota develops rapidly during the first 2 years of life, acquiring microorganisms from diverse sources. during this time, significant opportunities exist for the infant to acquire antibiotic resistant bacteria, which can become established and constitute the infant gut resistome. with increased antibiotic resistance limiting our ability to treat bacterial infections, investigations into resistance reservoirs are highly pertinent. this  study aimed to explore the nascent resistome in antibiotically-naive infant gut microbiomes, using a combination of metagenomic approaches. faecal samples from 22 six-month-old infants without previous antibiotic exposure were used to construct a pooled metagenomic library, which was functionally screened for ampicillin and gentamicin resistance. our library of approximately 220mb contained 0.45 ampicillin resistant hits/mb and 0.059 gentamicin resistant hits/mb. pcr-based analysis of fosmid clones and uncloned metagenomic dna, revealed a diverse and abundant aminoglycoside and beta-lactam resistance reservoir within the infant gut, with resistance determinants exhibiting homology to those found in common gut inhabitants, including escherichia coli, enterococcus sp., and clostridium difficile, as well as to genes from cryptic environmental bacteria. notably, the genes identified differed from those revealed when a sequence-driven pcr-based screen of metagenomic dna was employed. carriage of these antibiotic resistance determinants conferred substantial, but varied (2-512x), increases in antibiotic resistance to their bacterial host. these data provide insights into the infant gut resistome, revealing the presence of a varied aminoglycoside and beta-lactam resistance reservoir even in the absence of selective pressure, confirming the infant resistome establishes early  in life, perhaps even at birth.

TI  == dietary supplementation with soybean oligosaccharides increases short-chain fatty acids but decreases protein-derived catabolites in the intestinal luminal content of weaned huanjiang mini-piglets.
AB  == the improvement of gut health and function with prebiotic supplements after weaning is an active area of research in pig nutrition. the present study was conducted to test the working hypothesis that medium-term dietary supplementation with soybean oligosaccharides (sbos) can affect the gut ecosystem in terms of microbiota composition, luminal bacterial short-chain fatty acid and ammonia concentrations, and intestinal expression of genes related to intestinal immunity and barrier function. ten huanjiang mini-piglets, weaned at 21 days of age, were  randomly assigned to 2 groups. each group received a standard diet containing either dietary supplementation with 0.5% corn starch (control group) or 0.5% sbos (experimental group). the results showed that dietary supplementation with sbos increased the diversity of intestinal microflora and elevated (p < .05) the numbers of some presumably beneficial intestinal bacteria (e.g., bifidobacterium  sp, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, fusobacterium prausnitzii, and roseburia). soybean oligosaccharide supplementation also increased the concentration of short-chain fatty acid in the intestinal lumen, and it reduced (p < .05) the numbers of bacteria with pathogenic potential (e.g., escherichia coli, clostridium, and streptococcus) and the concentration of several protein-derived  catabolites (e.g., isobutyrate, isovalerate, and ammonia). in addition, sbos supplementation increased (p < .05) expression of zonula occludens 1 messenger rna, and it decreased (p < .05) expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1beta, and interleukin 8 messenger rna in the ileum and colon. these  findings suggest that sbos supplementation modifies the intestinal ecosystem in weaned huanjiang mini-piglets and has potentially beneficial effects on the gut.

TI  == investigation on antibacterial and antioxidant activities, phenolic and flavonoid contents of some thai edible plants as an alternative for antibiotics.
AB  == this study was aimed to examine the antibacterial and antioxidative properties of seven edible plants from thailand to develop alternative antibiotics as feed additives. the plants include citrus aurantifolia swingle (lime) fruits and its leaves, sesbania grandiflora l. (agati sesbania) leaves, piper sarmentosum roxb (wild betal) leaves, curcuma domestica valeton (turmeric) roots, morinda citrifolia l. (beach mulberry) leaves, cassia siamea britt (siamea cassia) leaves, and cocos nucifera l. (coconut) peels. the plants were extracted by methanol, n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, butanol and water. antibacterial activities with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) were determined by agar diffusion assay against escherichia coli, burkholderia sp., haemopilus somnus, haemopilus parasuis, and clostridium perfringens that were considered pathogenic  strains in livestock infection. methanol extracts of c. aurantifolia swingle fruits and leaves showed the broadest spectrum of antibacterial activities except for c. perfringens. butanol extract of s. grandiflora l. leaves showed the strongest activity against burkholderia sp. with mic, 135 mug/ml. p. sarmentosum  roxb leaves showed antibacterial activities against e. coli, burkholderia sp. and h. parasuis. ethyl acetate and water extracts from c. domesitca valeton roots showed mic of 306 mug/ml and 183 mug/ml, respectively against only c. perfringens. antioxidative activity was determined by 2-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl photometric assay. the methanol extracts of c. aurantifolia swingle fruits and p. sarmentosum roxb leaves showed the highest antioxidant activity among all the extracts with 3.46 mg/ml and 2.70 mg/ml effective concentration 50% (ec50) values, respectively. total contents of phenolics and flavonoids were measured from the plant extracts. methanol extracts of s. grandiflora l. and chloroform extracts of c. domestica valeton were found to have the highest amount of total phenolics, 41.7 and 47.8 mug/ml, respectively. flavonoid content of methanol extracts in s. grandiflora l. t was 22.5 mug/ml and the highest among plant extracts tested. these results indicated that c. aurantifolia swingle, s. grandiflora l., p. sarmentosum roxb, and c. domestica valeton have antibacterial  and antioxidant activities and can be used as alternative antibiotics or potential feed additives for the control of animal pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == characterization of rumen bacterial strains isolated from enrichments of rumen content in the presence of propolis.
AB  == propolis presents many biological properties, including antibacterial activities, and has been proposed as an additive in ruminant nutrition. twenty bacterial strains, previously isolated from enrichments of brazilian cow rumen contents in  the presence of different propolis extracts (llos), were characterized using phenotyping and 16s rrna identification. seven strains were assigned to streptococcus sp., most likely s. bovis, and were all degrading starch. one amylolytic lactate-utilizing strain of selenomonas ruminantium was also found. two strains of clostridium bifermentans were identified and showed proteolytic activity. two strains were assigned to mitsuokella jalaludinii and were saccharolytic. one strain belonged to a bacillus species and seven strains were affiliated with escherichia coli. all of the 20 strains were able to use many sugars, but none of them were able to degrade the polysaccharides carboxymethylcellulose and xylans. the effect of three propolis extracts (llos b1, c1 and c3) was tested on the in vitro growth of four representative isolates  of s. bovis, e. coli, m. jalaludinii and c. bifermentans. the growth of s. bovis, e. coli and m. jalaludinii was not affected by the three propolis extracts at 1 mg ml(-1). c. bifermentans growth was completely inhibited at this llos concentration, but this bacterium was partially resistant at lower concentrations. llos c3, with the lower concentration of phenolic compounds, was  a little less inhibitory than b1 and c1 on this strain.

TI  == screening of lactobacillus strains of domestic goose origin against bacterial poultry pathogens for use as probiotics.
AB  == lactobacilli are natural inhabitants of human and animal mucous membranes, including the avian gastrointestinal tract. recently, increasing attention has been given to their probiotic, health-promoting capacities, among which their antagonistic potential against pathogens plays a key role. a study was conducted  to evaluate probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from feces or  cloacae of domestic geese. among the 104 examined isolates, previously identified to the species level by whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and analysis of 16s-23s regions of rdna, dominated lactobacillus salivarius (35%), followed by lactobacillus johnsonii (18%) and lactobacillus ingluviei (11%). all lactobacilli were screened for antimicrobial activity toward salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, pasteurella multocida, and riemerella anatipestifer using the agar slab method and the well diffusion method. lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus plantarum exhibited particularly strong antagonism toward all of the indicator strains. in the agar slab method, the highest sensitivity to lactobacillus was observed in r. anatipestifer and p. multocida, and the lowest in e. coli and s. aureus. the ability to produce h(2)o(2)was exhibited by 92% of isolates, but there was no correlation between the rate of production of this reactive oxygen species and the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus sp. all lactobacilli showed resistance to ph 3.0 and 3.5 and to 2% bile. the data demonstrate that lactobacillus isolates from geese may have probiotic potential in reducing bacterial infections. the antibacterial activity of the selected lactobacilli is  mainly due to lactic acid production by these bacteria. the selected lactobacillus strains that strongly inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria,  and were also resistant to low ph and bile salts, can potentially restore the balance of intestinal microflora in geese and could offer an alternative to antibiotic therapy.

TI  == composition, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of methanol extracts of some acinos miller species.
AB  == gc and gc/ms analyses of the methanol extracts obtained from the aerial parts of  six acinos miller species from serbia and montenegro were performed. seventy-four constituents, accounting for 84.9-99.0% of the total composition of the extracts, were identified. the common feature of the a. suaveolens, a. majoranifolius and a. alpinus methanol extracts was the high content of monoterpenes, while the common feature of the a. graveolens, a. arvensis and a. hungaricus methanol extracts was the prevalence of sesquiterpenes. the total flavonoids, polyphenols  and tannins content, as well as antioxidant activity (frap and dpph assay) of the methanolic extracts were investigated. the highest antioxidant activity was observed in the extract of a. alpinus which had high levels of all polyphenol classes examined. a disk diffusion method was used for the evaluation of the antimicrobial activities of the extracts against a panel of microorganisms (bacteria: bacillus subtilis, clostridium pyogenes, enterococcus sp., micrococcus flavus, sarcina lutea, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis and escherichia coli; fungi: aspergillus niger, candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisiae). the preliminary bioassay results indicated that the methanol extract of a. alpinus could be a possible source of antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds.

TI  == effects of dietary supplementation with gynura procumbens (merr.) on egg yolk cholesterol, excreta microflora and laying hen performance.
AB  == abstract 1. the present study investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with gynura procumbens on egg yolk and serum cholesterol and triglycerides, excreta microflora, laying performance and egg quality. 2. a total of 160 hy-line brown layers (45 weeks old) were randomly assigned into 4 treatments on the basis of laying performance. each treatment had 4 replicates with 10 birds each. 3. dietary treatments were basal diet supplemented with 0 (control), 2.5, 5.0 and 7.5 g/kg diet g. procumbens during 56-d feeding period. 4. serum (d 21, 42 and 56) and egg yolk (d 28, 42 and 56) cholesterol and triglycerides concentrations were linearly reduced with increasing dietary concentrations of g. procumbens. 5. increasing dietary concentrations of g. procumbens linearly reduced the excreta total anaerobic bacteria (d 28), clostridium sp. and escherichia coli (d 28 and 56) populations. 6. overall egg production and egg mass were linearly increased,  and overall feed efficiency was linearly improved with increase in dietary g. procumbens. 7. dietary increasing concentrations of g. procumbens linearly improved egg yolk colour (d 28 and 56) and breaking strength of eggs (d 56). 8. the results obtained in the present experiment indicate that dietary supplementation with g. procumbens could reduce the egg yolk cholesterol, suppresses harmful excreta microflora and improves layers performance.

TI  == a novel esterase from paenibacillus sp. pbs-2 is a new member of the beta-lactamase belonging to the family viii lipases/esterases.
AB  == screening of a gene library from paenibacillus sp. pbs-2 generated in escherichia coli led to the identification of a clone with lipolytic activity. sequence analysis showed an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 378 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 42 kda. the esterase displayed 69% and 42% identity with the putative beta-lactamases from paenibacillus sp. jdr-2 and clostridium sp. bnl1100, respectively. the esterase contained a serx- x-lys motif that is conserved among all beta-lactamases found to date. the protein pbs-2 was produced in both soluble and insoluble forms when e. coli cells harboring the gene were cultured at 18 degrees c. the enzyme is a serine protein  and was active against p-nitrophenyl esters of c2, c4, c8, and c10. the optimum ph and temperature for enzyme activity were ph 9.0 and 30 degrees c, respectively. relative activity of 55% remained at up to 5 degrees c with an activation energy of 5.84 kcal/mol, which indicates that the enzyme is cold-adapted. enzyme activity was inhibited by cd(2+), cu(2+), and hg(2+) ions. as expected for a serine esterase, activity was inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. the enzyme was remarkably active and stable in the presence of commercial detergents and organic solvents. this cold-adapted esterase has potential as a biocatalyst and detergent additive for use at low temperatures.

TI  == porcine group a rotaviruses with heterogeneous vp7 and vp4 genotype combinations  can be found together with enteric bacteria on belgian swine farms.
AB  == group a rotaviruses (rva) are an important cause of diarrhea in young piglets, resulting in significant economic losses. however, the role of rva in the etiology of piglet diarrhea on belgian swine farms was previously unreported. in  the present study, different techniques, including fast antigen detection tests,  virus isolation, rt-pcr and rt-qpcr have been applied for detection of rva in diarrheic (n=28) and asymptomatic (n=6) fecal samples collected on belgian pig farms. rt-qpcr was shown to be most sensitive. routine bacteriological analysis of the fecal samples showed that most diarrheic rva positive samples were also co-infected with one or more bacterial species, such as escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, salmonella sp. and/or brachyspira sp. further genetic characterization of the vp7 and vp4 genes of 26 rva strains resulted in the detection of six different g-genotypes (g2, g3, g4, g5, g9 and g11), and five different p-genotypes (p[6], p[7], p[13], p[23], p[27]), in a total of 12 different g/p combinations. a large intra-genotypic diversity was also apparent.  in conclusion, results of the present study help us better understand the role of rva in the pathogenesis of piglet diarrhea, and provide better insights into the  vast genetic diversity present among circulating porcine group a rotaviruses.

TI  == tolerance of anaerobic bacteria to chlorinated solvents.
AB  == the aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of four chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (cahs), perchloroethene (pce), carbon tetrachloride (ct),  chloroform (cf) and 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-dca), on the growth of eight anaerobic bacteria: four fermentative species (escherichia coli, klebsiella sp.,  clostridium sp. and paenibacillus sp.) and four respiring species (pseudomonas aeruginosa, geobacter sulfurreducens, shewanella oneidensis and desulfovibrio vulgaris). effective concentrations of solvents which inhibited growth rates by 50% (ec50) were determined. the octanol-water partition coefficient or log po/w of a cah proved a generally satisfactory measure of its toxicity. most species tolerated approximately 3-fold and 10-fold higher concentrations of the two relatively more polar cahs cf and 1,2-dca, respectively, than the two relatively  less polar compounds pce and ct. ec50 values correlated well with growth rates observed in solvent-free cultures, with fast-growing organisms displaying higher  tolerance levels. overall, fermentative bacteria were more tolerant to cahs than  respiring species, with iron- and sulfate-reducing bacteria in particular appearing highly sensitive to cahs. these data extend the current understanding of the impact of cahs on a range of anaerobic bacteria, which will benefit the field of bioremediation.

AB  == two bacillus sp. were isolated from the local fermented milk and identified on the basis 16s rrna sequence profile as bacillus subtilis akl1 and by biochemical  process as lactobacillus acidophilus akl2. these isolates were used as fresh inoculums for curd preparation individually and in combinations. different physico-chemical and therapeutic properties of the newly prepared curd were examined and compared with marketed local (sweet and sour) and branded (mother dairy and thackar) curds. the total hydrolyzed peptides, free amino acids, lactic acid were significantly higher, whereas, total solid, ash content, syneresis and  free reducing sugar were lower in the curd prepared by a mixture of akl1 and akl2 (0.5:0.5, v/v). the antioxidant activity against abts+, dpph8, oh* and fe3+ were  also higher in the newly formulated curd. polyphenols (85.5 microg/g), flavonoids (12.5 microg/g) and free aromatic amino acids contents were also higher in akl1+akl2. all these components prevent excess protein oxidation that was revealed by sds-page. the curd also exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against some entero-pathogens like clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, shigella dysentery, vibrio cholerae and staphylococcus aureus. it can be concluded that the combination of these lactobacillus sp. will be a fruitful inoculum for the preparation of curd having better health promoting effects.

TI  == structure of acidothermus cellulolyticus family 74 glycoside hydrolase at 1.82 a  resolution.
AB  == here, a 1.82 a resolution x-ray structure of a glycoside hydrolase family 74 (gh74) enzyme from acidothermus cellulolyticus is reported. the resulting structure was refined to an r factor of 0.150 and an rfree of 0.196. structural analysis shows that five related structures have been reported with a secondary-structure similarity of between 75 and 89%. the five similar structures were all either clostridium thermocellum or geotrichum sp. m128 gh74 xyloglucanases. structural analysis indicates that the a. cellulolyticus gh74 enzyme is an endoxyloglucanase, as it lacks a characteristic loop that blocks one end of the active site in exoxyloglucanases. superimposition with the c. thermocellum gh74 shows that asp451 and asp38 are the catalytic residues.

TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == microbial production of short-chain alkanes.
AB  == increasing concerns about limited fossil fuels and global environmental problems  have focused attention on the need to develop sustainable biofuels from renewable resources. although microbial production of diesel has been reported, production  of another much in demand transport fuel, petrol (gasoline), has not yet been demonstrated. here we report the development of platform escherichia coli strains that are capable of producing short-chain alkanes (scas; petrol), free fatty acids (ffas), fatty esters and fatty alcohols through the fatty acyl (acyl carrier protein (acp)) to fatty acid to fatty acyl-coa pathway. first, the beta-oxidation pathway was blocked by deleting the fade gene to prevent the degradation of fatty acyl-coas generated in vivo. to increase the formation of short-chain fatty acids suitable for subsequent conversion to scas in vivo, the activity of 3-oxoacyl-acp synthase (fabh), which is inhibited by unsaturated fatty acyl-acps, was enhanced to promote the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis by deleting the fadr gene; deletion of the fadr gene prevents upregulation of the faba and fabb genes responsible for unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis. a modified thioesterase was used to convert short-chain fatty acyl-acps to the corresponding ffas, which were then converted to scas by the sequential reactions of e. coli fatty acyl-coa synthetase, clostridium acetobutylicum fatty acyl-coa reductase and arabidopsis thaliana fatty aldehyde decarbonylase. the final engineered strain produced up to 580.8 mg l(-1) of scas  consisting of nonane (327.8 mg l(-1)), dodecane (136.5 mg l(-1)), tridecane (64.8 mg l(-1)), 2-methyl-dodecane (42.8 mg l(-1)) and tetradecane (8.9 mg l(-1)), together with small amounts of other hydrocarbons. furthermore, this platform strain could produce short-chain ffas using a fadd-deleted strain, and short-chain fatty esters by introducing the acinetobacter sp. adp1 wax ester synthase (atfa) and the e. coli mutant alcohol dehydrogenase (adhe(mut)).

TI  == metabolic engineering of ralstonia eutropha for the biosynthesis of 2-hydroxyacid-containing polyhydroxyalkanoates.
AB  == polyhydroxyalkanoates (phas) are bio-based and biodegradable polyesters synthesized by numerous microorganisms. phas containing 2-hydroxyacids as monomer units have attracted much attention, but their production has not been efficient. here, we metabolically engineered ralstonia eutropha strains for the in vivo synthesis of phas containing 2-hydroxyacids as monomers. this was accomplished by replacing the r. eutropha phac gene in the chromosome with either the r. eutropha phac s506g a510k gene, which contains two point mutations, or the pseudomonas sp. mbel 6-19 phac1437 gene. in addition, the r. eutropha phaab genes in the chromosome were replaced with the clostridium propionicum pct540 gene. all of the engineered r. eutropha strains produced phas containing 2-hydroxyacid monomers, including lactate and 2-hydroxybutyrate (2hb), along with 3-hydroxybutyrate (3hb) and/or 3-hydroxyvalerate (3hv), when they were cultured in nitrogen-free medium containing 5 g/l lactate or 4 g/l 2hb and 20 g/l glucose as carbon sources. expression of the escherichia coli ldha gene in engineered r. eutropha strains allowed production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate) [p(3hb-co-la)] from glucose as the sole carbon source. this is the first report on the production of  2-hydroxyacid-containing phas by metabolically engineered r. eutropha.

TI  == are cellulosome scaffolding protein cipc and cbm3-containing protein hycp, involved in adherence of clostridium cellulolyticum to cellulose?
AB  == clostridium cellulolyticum, a mesophilic anaerobic bacterium, produces highly active enzymatic complexes called cellulosomes. this strain was already shown to  bind to cellulose, however the molecular mechanism(s) involved is not known. in this context we focused on the gene named hycp, encoding a 250-kda protein of unknown function, containing a family-3 carbohydrate binding module (cbm3) along  with 23 hyaline repeat modules (hyr modules). in the microbial kingdom the gene hycp is only found in c. cellulolyticum and the very close strain recently sequenced clostridium sp bnl1100. its presence in c. cellulolyticum guided us to  analyze its function and its putative role in adhesion of the cells to cellulose. the cbm3 of hycp was shown to bind to crystalline cellulose and was assigned to the cbm3b subfamily. no hydrolytic activity on cellulose was found with a mini-protein displaying representative domains of hycp. a c. cellulolyticum inactivated hycp mutant strain was constructed, and we found that hycp is neither involved in binding of the cells to cellulose nor that the protein has an obvious role in cell growth on cellulose. we also characterized the role of the cellulosome scaffolding protein cipc in adhesion of c. cellulolyticum to cellulose, since cellulosome scaffolding protein has been proposed to mediate binding of other cellulolytic bacteria to cellulose. a second mutant was constructed, where cipc was inactivated. we unexpectedly found that cipc is only  partly involved in binding of c. cellulolyticum to cellulose. other mechanisms for cellulose adhesion may therefore exist in c. cellulolyticum. in addition, no  cellulosomal protuberances were observed at the cellular surface of c. cellulolyticum, what is in contrast to reports from several other cellulosomes producing strains. these findings may suggest that c. cellulolyticum has no dedicated molecular mechanism to aggregate the cellulosomes at the cellular surface.

TI  == propionyl-coa dependent biosynthesis of 2-hydroxybutyrate containing polyhydroxyalkanoates in metabolically engineered escherichia coli.
AB  == we have previously reported in vivo biosynthesis of 2-hydroxyacid containing polyesters including polylactic acid (pla), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate) [p(3hb-co-la)], and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-2-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate) [p(3hb-co-2hb-co-la)] employing metabolically engineered escherichia coli strains by the introduction of evolved clostridium propionicum propionyl-coa transferase  (pct(cp)) and pseudomonas sp. mbel 6-19 polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) synthase 1 (phac1(ps6-19)). in this study, we further engineered in vivo pla biosynthesis system in e. coli to synthesize 2hb-containing pha, in which propionyl-coa was used as precursor for 2-ketobutyrate that was converted into 2hb-coa by the sequential actions of lactococcus lactis (d)-2-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (pane) and pct(cp) and then 2hb-coa was polymerized by phac1(ps6-19). the recombinant e. coli xl1-blue expressing the phac1437 gene, the pct540 gene, and the ralstonia eutropha prpe gene together with the pane gene could be grown to 0.66 g/l and successfully produced p(70 mol%3hb-co-18 mol%2hb-co-12 mol%la) up to the pha content of 66 wt% from 20 g/l of glucose, 2 g/l of 3hb and 1 g/l of sodium propionate. removal of the prpc gene in the chromosome of e. coli xl1-blue could increase the mole fraction of 2hb in copolymer, but the pha content was decreased. the metabolic engineering strategy reported here suggests that propionyl-coa can be successfully used as the precursor to provide pha synthase with 2hb-coa for the production of phas containing 2hb monomer.

TI  == deriving metabolic engineering strategies from genome-scale modeling with flux ratio constraints.
AB  == optimized production of bio-based fuels and chemicals from microbial cell factories is a central goal of systems metabolic engineering. to achieve this goal, a new computational method of using flux balance analysis with flux ratios  (fbratio) was further developed in this research and applied to five case studies to evaluate and design metabolic engineering strategies. the approach was implemented using publicly available genome-scale metabolic flux models. synthetic pathways were added to these models along with flux ratio constraints by fbratio to achieve increased (i) cellulose production from arabidopsis thaliana; (ii) isobutanol production from saccharomyces cerevisiae; (iii) acetone production from synechocystis sp. pcc6803; (iv) h2 production from escherichia coli mg1655; and (v) isopropanol, butanol, and ethanol (ibe) production from engineered clostridium acetobutylicum. the fbratio approach was applied to each case to simulate a metabolic engineering strategy already implemented experimentally, and flux ratios were continually adjusted to find (i) the end-limit of increased production using the existing strategy, (ii) new potential strategies to increase production, and (iii) the impact of these metabolic engineering strategies on product yield and culture growth. the fbratio approach  has the potential to design "fine-tuned" metabolic engineering strategies in silico that can be implemented directly with available genomic tools.

AB  == in this study fecal microflora of human infants born through vaginal delivery (vb) and through cesarean section (cb) were investigated using culture-independent 16s rdna cloning and sequencing approach. the results obtained clearly revealed that fecal microbiota of vb infants distinctly differ from those in their counterpart cb infants. the intestinal microbiota of infants  delivered by cesarean section appears to be more diverse, in terms of bacteria species, than the microbiota of vaginally delivered infants. the most abundant bacterial species present in vb infants were acinetobacter sp., bifidobacterium sp. and staphylococcus sp. however, cb infant's fecal microbiota was dominated with citrobacter sp., escherichia coli and clostridium difficile. the intestinal  microbiota of cesarean section delivered infants in this study was also characterized by an absence of bifidobacteria species. an interesting finding of  our study was recovery of large number of acinetobacter sp. consisting of acinetobacter pittii (former acinetobacter genomic species 3), acinetobacter junii and acinetobacter baumannii in the vb infants clone library. among these, acinetobacter baumannii is a known nosocomial pathogen and acinetobacter pittii (genomic species 3) is recently recognized as clinically important taxa within the acinetobacter calcoaceticus-acinetobacter baumannii (acb) complex. although none of the infants had shown any sign of clinical symptoms of disease, this observation warrants a closer look.

TI  == the human small intestinal microbiota is driven by rapid uptake and conversion of simple carbohydrates.
AB  == the human gastrointestinal tract (gi tract) harbors a complex community of microbes. the microbiota composition varies between different locations in the gi tract, but most studies focus on the fecal microbiota, and that inhabiting the colonic mucosa. consequently, little is known about the microbiota at other parts of the gi tract, which is especially true for the small intestine because of its  limited accessibility. here we deduce an ecological model of the microbiota composition and function in the small intestine, using complementing culture-independent approaches. phylogenetic microarray analyses demonstrated that microbiota compositions that are typically found in effluent samples from ileostomists (subjects without a colon) can also be encountered in the small intestine of healthy individuals. phylogenetic mapping of small intestinal metagenome of three different ileostomy effluent samples from a single individual indicated that streptococcus sp., escherichia coli, clostridium sp. and high g+c  organisms are most abundant in the small intestine. the compositions of these populations fluctuated in time and correlated to the short-chain fatty acids profiles that were determined in parallel. comparative functional analysis with fecal metagenomes identified functions that are overrepresented in the small intestine, including simple carbohydrate transport phosphotransferase systems (pts), central metabolism and biotin production. moreover, metatranscriptome analysis supported high level in-situ expression of pts and carbohydrate metabolic genes, especially those belonging to streptococcus sp. overall, our findings suggest that rapid uptake and fermentation of available carbohydrates contribute to maintaining the microbiota in the human small intestine.

AB  == the effects of age on microbiota composition, gut fermentation end-product formation and peripheral lymphocyte numbers were compared between old and young adult beagle dogs fed four kibble diets differing in yeast cell wall contents. the experiment had a double 4 x 4 latin square design, one with four mature dogs  (4 years old) and the other with four old dogs (10 years old), with four replicates (diets) per dog. in each period a 15 d adaptation period preceded a 5  d total collection of faeces for the digestibility trial. on day 21, fresh faecal samples were collected for the determination of bacterial enumeration, ph, biogenic amine and short-chain fatty acid. flow cytometry was used for immunophenotypic evaluation. dogs were fed four kibble diets with similar composition with 0, 0.15, 0.30 and 0.45 % of yeast cell wall (as-fed), respectively. data were evaluated using general linear models of statistical analysis systems statistical software (p < 0.05). no evidence of a difference in  faecal bacteria counts between ages was found (total aerobes, total anaerobes, bifidobacterium, lactobacillus, clostridium and escherichia coli: p>0.15). faecal concentrations of butyrate, histamine, agmatine and spermine were lower (p </= 0.05) and faecal ph was higher (p = 0.03) in older dogs than in mature adult dogs, suggesting an alteration in bacterial metabolic activity, or in the rate of intestinal absorption of these compounds. concentrations of t-lymphocytes, t-cytotoxic lymphocytes and b-lymphocytes were also lower (p </= 0.01) in older dogs than in mature adult dogs. the study confirmed alterations in peripheral lymphocytes and revealed a reduced concentration of some fermentation end products in the colon of old dogs.

TI  == using temperature and time criteria to control the effectiveness of continuous thermal sanitation of piggery effluent in terms of set microbial indicators.
AB  == aim: to determine the minimal conditions (temperature-time), necessary to achieve set sanitation targets for selected microbial indicators during the continuous thermal treatment of pig slurry. methods and results: the effectiveness of thermal treatment between 55 and 96 degrees c was studied using escherichia coli, enterococci, sulfite-reducing clostridia (src), mesophilic culturable bacteria (mcb), f+-specific and somatic phages. identification of src and mcb was performed using 16s rrna gene analysis. ten minutes at 70 degrees c or 1 h at 60  degrees c was sufficient to reduce the vegetative bacteria by 4-5 log(10), but it had little effect on somatic phages nor on spore formers, dominated by clostridium sp. at 96 degrees c, somatic phages were still detected, but there was a reduction of 3.1 log(10) for src and of 1.4 log(10) for mcb. at 96 degrees  c, clostridium botulinum was identified among the thermotolerant mcb. conclusion: only those hygienic risks relating to mesophilic vegetative bacteria can be totally eliminated from pig slurry treated at 60 degrees c (60 min) or 70 degrees c (<10 min). significance and impact of the study: hygiene standards based on the removal of the indicators e. coli and enterococci can easily be met by treatment  as low as 60 degrees c (enabling, a low-cost treatment using heat recovery). however, even at 96 degrees c, certain pathogens may persist.

TI  == microbial community analysis and identification of alternative host-specific fecal indicators in fecal and river water samples using pyrosequencing.
AB  == it is important to know the comprehensive microbial communities of fecal pollution sources and receiving water bodies for microbial source tracking. pyrosequencing targeting the v1-v3 hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna gene was used to investigate the characteristics of bacterial and bacteroidales communities in major fecal sources and river waters. diversity analysis indicated that cow feces had the highest diversities in the bacterial and bacteroidales group followed by the pig sample, with human feces having the lowest value. the bacteroidales, one of the potential fecal indicators, totally dominated in the fecal samples accounting for 31%-52% of bacterial sequences, but much less (0.6%) in the river water. clustering and venn diagram analyses showed that the human sample had a greater similarity to the pig sample in the bacterial and bacteroidales communities than to samples from other hosts. traditional fecal indicators, i.e., escherichia coli, were detected in the human and river water samples at very low rates and clostridium perfringens and enterococci were not detected in any samples. besides the bacteroidales group, some microorganisms detected in the specific hosts, i.e., parasutterella excrementihominis, veillonella sp., dialister invisus, megamonas funiformis, and ruminococcus lactaris for the human and lactobacillus amylovorus and atopostipes sp. for the pig, could be used as potential host-specific fecal indicators. these microorganisms could be used as multiple fecal indicators that are not dependent  on the absence or presence of a single indicator. monitoring for multiple indicators that are highly abundant and host-specific would greatly enhance the effectiveness of fecal pollution source tracking.

TI  == biosynthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates containing 2-hydroxybutyrate from unrelated carbon source by metabolically engineered escherichia coli.
AB  == we have previously reported in vivo biosynthesis of polylactic acid (pla) and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate) [p(3hb-co-la)] employing metabolically engineered escherichia coli strains by the introduction of evolved clostridium propionicum propionyl-coa transferase (pct(cp)) and pseudomonas sp. mbel 6-19 polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) synthase 1 (phac1(ps6-19)). using this in vivo pla biosynthesis system, we presently report the biosynthesis of phas containing 2-hydroxybutyrate (2hb) monomer by direct fermentation of a metabolically engineered e. coli strain. the recombinant e. coli ldha mutant xldh strain expressing phac1( ps6-19) and pct(cp) was developed and cultured in a chemically  defined medium containing 20 g/l of glucose and varying concentrations of 2hb and 3hb. phas consisting of 2hb, 3hb, and a small fraction of lactate were synthesized. their monomer compositions were dependent on the concentrations of 2hb and 3hb added to the culture medium. even though the ldha gene was completely deleted in the chromosome of e. coli, up to 6 mol% of lactate was found to be incorporated into the polymer depending on the culture condition. in order to synthesize phas containing 2hb monomer without feeding 2hb into the culture medium, a heterologous metabolic pathway for the generation of 2hb from glucose was constructed via the citramalate pathway, in which 2-ketobutyrate is synthesized directly from pyruvate and acetyl-coa. introduction of the lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis il1403 2hb dehydrogenase gene (pane) into e. coli allowed in vivo conversion of 2-ketobutyrate to 2hb. the metabolically engineered e. coli xldh strain expressing the phac1437, pct540, cima3.7, and leubcd genes together with the l. lactis il1403 pane gene successfully produced phas consisting of 2hb, 3hb, and a small fraction of lactate by varying the 3hb concentration in the culture medium. as the 3hb concentration in the medium increased the 3hb monomer fraction in the polymer, the polymer content increased. when ralstonia eutropha phaab genes were additionally expressed in this recombinant e. coli xldh strain, p(2hb-co-3hb-co-la) having small amounts of 2hb  and la monomers could also be produced from glucose as a sole carbon source. the  metabolic engineering strategy reported here should be useful for the production  of phas containing 2hb monomer.

TI  == physical, chemical and microbiological quality of ice used to cool drinks and foods in greece and its public health implications.
AB  == ice used for direct human consumption or to preserve foods and cool down drinks can be contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms and may potentially become a vehicle for consumer's infection. to evaluate physical, chemical and microbiological quality of commercial ice and ice used for fish and seafood, 100  ice samples collected at 10 different retail points in the region of epirus were  studied. the following microbiological parameters were determined: total coliforms, fecal coliforms, salmonella spp., shigella spp., yersinia spp., escherichia coli, campylobacter sp., vibrio cholerae, aeromonas spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium perfringens. e. coli was detected in 22% and coliforms were detected in 31% of samples. samples in which coliforms were detected fail to meet the microbiological criteria specified by the drinking water legislation. aeromonas spp., shigella spp., campylobacter sp. and v. cholerae were not detected. spore forms of c. perfringens were prevalent at 35% and the psychotropic bacterium's p. aeruginosa and yersinia spp. were found only at three samples each. the presence of large numbers of coliforms as well as of other pathogenic strains suggested that commercial ice and ice used to make cool drinks or in preservation of fish and seafood may represent a potential hazard to the consumer. in view of the results reported herein, it is highly recommended that national regulatory guidelines should be established for the production of ice as long as regular inspections.

TI  == bivalent transition metal complexes of o-hydroxyacetophenone [n-(3-hydroxy-2-naphthoyl)] hydrazone: spectroscopic, antibacterial, antifungal activity and thermogravimetric studies.
AB  == schiff base complexes of cu(ii), ni(ii) and zn(ii) with the o-hydroxyacetophenone [n-(3-hydroxy-2-naphthoyl)] hydrazone (h(2)o-hahnh) containing n and o donor sites have been synthesized. both ligand and its metal complexes were characterized by different physicochemical methods, elemental analysis, molar conductivity ((1)h nmr, (13)c nmr, ir, uv-visible, esr, ms spectra) and also thermal analysis (tg and dtg) techniques. the discussion of the outcome data of the prepared complexes indicates that the ligand behave as a bidentate and/or tridentate ligand. the electronic spectra of the complexes as well as their magnetic moments suggest octahedral geometries for all isolated complexes. the room temperature solid state esr spectrum of the cu(ii) complex shows d(x2-y2) as a ground state, suggesting tetragonally distorted octahedral geometry around cu(ii) centre. the molar conductance measurements proved that the complexes are non-electrolytes. the kinetic thermodynamic parameters such as: e(#), deltah(#),  deltag(#), deltas(#) are calculated from the dtg curves, for the [ni(h(o)-hahnh)(2)] and [zn(h(2o)-hahnh)(oac)(2)].h(2)o complexes using the coats-redfern equation. also, the antimicrobial properties of all compounds were  studied using a wide spectrum of bacterial and fungal strains. the [cu(ho-hahnh)(oac)(h(2)o)(2)] complex was the most active against all strains, including aspergillus sp., stemphylium sp. and trichoderma sp. fungi; e. coli and clostridium sp. bacteria.

AB  == the aim of this study was to describe parasitological, microbiological, and pathological findings associated with the isolation of aspergillus species in 94  clinically diseased captive falcons from dubai. concomitant agents and/or diseases were identified in 64 cases, causing either single (n = 36) or multiple  coinfections (n = 28). diagnoses found more often in association with aspergillosis were chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome (cfids) (n = 29), caryospora sp. (n = 16), serratospiculum seurati infestation (n = 14), cestodiasis (n = 6), bumblefoot (n = 5), trematodosis due to strigea falconispalumbi (n = 5), trichomoniasis (n = 4), babesia shortti (n = 4), mannheimia (pastorella) haemolytica (n = 4), interstitial hepatitis (n = 4), escherichia coli (n = 3), and clostridium perfringens enterotoxemia (n = 2). compared with a control group of 2000 diseased falcons without evidence of aspergillosis, the prevalence of babesia shortti, cfids, mannheimia (pastorella)  haemolytica, escherichia coli, and falcon herpes virus infection was conspicuously higher in association with aspergillosis. these entities may be considered suitable candidates as predisposing factors for the mycosis.

TI  == hygienic quality and antibiotic resistance profile of sliced butchery.
AB  == in order to investigate the microbiological quality of different meat products on the greek market, 200 samples were collected from the following preparations: boiled turkey (n=50), boiled pork ham (n=50), smoked turkey (n=50) and smoked pork ham (n=50). in all cold meat preparations clostridium perfringens vegetative and spore forms, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and other clostridium sp lec(-), as well as lactobacillus, bacillus sp. and salmonella sp. were recovered. for instance bacillus cereus was present in 6% of the samples. l. monocytogenes,  campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli were rarely present (1-4%) while yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter lari were absent. differences in the occurrence of s. aureus, salmonella sp., e. coli and spore forms of c. perfringens in boiled and smoked samples, reflects either the differences in the  processing of the foods or could be associated to the extensive handling by the personnel during the purchasing (storage, slicing, wrapping). antibiotic resistance on specific antibiotics for each pathogen was also studied. a multiresistance antibiotic profile was effective for most bacterial strains, and  pronounced resistance profiles were observed for the commonly used antibiotics as ampicillin, penicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin followed by ceftriaxone and gentamycin. albeit this high observed resistance profile, the tested strains generally conserved their susceptibility to amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol  and tylosin conserved an almost absent resistance. antibiotics commonly used for  therapeutic purposes, as well as antibiotics added to feed stuff of animals for increasing animal flesh production should contribute to the extensive spreading of antibiotic resistance in food and the environment. systematically monitoring of the microbiological quality of cold butchery preparations must be done, in order to preserve food quality, optimizing the processing and elaboration methods of the product and safeguard the public health.

TI  == isolation of microbial pathogens of subclinical mastitis from raw sheep's milk of epirus (greece) and their role in its hygiene.
AB  == the natural raw milk microflora is a factor that expresses its sensorial characteristics. the microbial charge into the mammary gland of healthy animal is low and the application of right and healthy conditions during milking and cheese making procedure, prevents from contaminating as well as maintains the natural microflora in order to lend the particular characteristics of milk. the purpose of the present project was the study of the total viable count (t.v.c.) and the count of total psychrotropic bacteria of raw sheep milk from boutsiko and karamaniko breeds, collected from healthy animals, as well as the isolation, identification and enumeration of pathogenic bacteria related with the hygiene and the quality of raw sheep milk (with a particular interest in bacteria that may cause human infection). during the experiment we examined two hundred forty (240) samples of raw sheep milk. in these samples a) staphylococcus aureus, salmonella sp., escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens (vegetative cells and spores) and bacillus sp. were isolated and identified b) the total viable count and the total number of psychrotropic bacteria were also specified. the sampling, the preparation of samples and decimal dilutions were based on international methods. the total viable count was determined using the standard methods of the  american public health association, 2002. the total number of psychrotropic bacteria was determined using apha 1976, 1978 rules. the identification of the bacteria was carried out according to the bergey's manual. microscopic examination of gram stained cells, catalase, oxidase and biochemical tests were performed when necessary to further identify. from the 240 milk samples tested, only 5% were e. coli positive, with mean counts ranged from 2 x 10(3) to 2.4 x 10(4) cfu/ml. s. aureus was isolated from 24% of the samples and the mean count per ml was ranged from <10 to 3.4 x 10(2). meanwhile, bacillus spp. was also detected in 29% samples. vegetative forms and spores of c. perfringens were detected in 13% and 63% of the samples respectively. however, microbiological analyses revealed the presence of a small number of selected pathogens in milk samples such as salmonella, which was only detected in 5% of the samples. listeria sp., pseudomonas sp. and vibrio cholerae were never found. from the experimental results, the total viable count from raw sheep milk samples, fulfils the microbiological criteria of eu legislation in a percentage of approximately 97%.

AB  == a 2,373-bp full-length gene (bgla49) encoding a 790-residue polypeptide (bgla49)  with a calculated mass of 87.8 kda was cloned from serratia sp. tn49, a symbiotic bacterium isolated from the gut of longhorned beetle (batocera horsfieldi) larvae. the deduced amino acid sequence of bgla49 showed the highest identities of 80.1% with a conceptually translated protein from pantoea sp. at-9b (eew02556), 38.3% with the identified glycoside hydrolase (gh) family 3 beta-glucosidase from clostridium stercorarium ncbi 11754 (cab08072), and <15.0%  with the low-temperature-active gh 3 beta-glucosidases from shewanella sp. g5 (abl09836) and paenibacillus sp. c7 (aax35883). the recombinant enzyme (r-bgla49) was expressed in escherichia coli and displayed the typical characteristics of low-temperature-active enzymes, such as low temperature optimum (showing apparent optimal activity at 35 degrees c), activity at low temperatures (retaining approximately 60% of its maximum activity at 20 degrees c and approximately 25% at 10 degrees c). compared with the thermophilic gh 3 beta-glucosidase, r-bgla49  had fewer hydrogen bonds and salt bridges and less proline residues. these features might relate to the increased structure flexibility and higher catalytic activity at low temperatures of r-bgla49. the molecular docking study of four gh  3 beta-glucosidases revealed five conserved positions contributing to substrate accommodation, among which four positions of r-bgla49 (r192, y228, d260, and e449) were identified to be essential based on site-directed mutagenesis analysis.

TI  == quality of water sources used as drinking water in a brazilian peri-urban area.
AB  == the objective of this paper was to assess bacteriological quality of drinking water in a peri-urban area located in the metropolitan region of sao paulo, brazil. a total of 89 water samples were collected from community plastic tanks and 177 water samples from wells were collected bimonthly, from september 2007 to november 2008, for evaluating bacteriological parameters including: escherichia coli, enterococcus and heterotrophic plate count (hpc). clostridium perfringens was investigated in a subsample (40 samples from community plastic tank and 40 from wells). e. coli was present in 5 (5.6%) samples from community plastic tanks (2.0 - 5.1x10(4) mpn/100ml) and in 70 (39.5%) well samples (2.0 - 8.6x10(4) mpn/100ml). thus, these samples were not in accordance with the brazilian regulation. enterococcus was detected in 20 (22.5%) samples of the community plastic tanks (1 to 79 nc/100ml) and in 142 (80.2%) well samples (1 to >200 nc/100ml). c. perfringens was detected in 5 (12.5%) community plastic tanks samples and in 35 (87.5%) wells samples (2.2 to >16 mpn/100ml). hpc were above 500 cfu/ml in 5 (5.6%) waters from community plastic tanks. in wells samples, the hpc ranged from <1 to 1.6x10(4) cfu/ml. the residual chlorine did not attend the  standard established in the drinking water legislation (0.2 mg/l), except in 20 (22.5%) samples. these results confirm the vulnerability of the water supply systems in this peri-urban area what is clearly a public health concern.

AB  == aims: a novel ferulic acid esterase gene from rumen fungus anaeromyces mucronatus was cloned, heteroexpressed in escherichia coli and characterized. methods and results: a total of 30 clones exhibiting activity on alpha-naphthyl acetate (alpha-na) were isolated from an a. mucronatus ye505 cdna library. sequence analysis revealed that these clones represented two esterase-coding sequences. the gene, fae1a, showed highest amino acid sequence identity to ce family 1 esterases from anaerobic micro-organisms such as orpinomyces sp., ruminococcus albus and clostridium thermocellum. the gene comprised 828 nucleotides encoding a polypeptide of 275 amino acids. the coding sequence was cloned into the pet30a expression vector and overexpressed in e. coli bl21 (de3). gene product fae1a was found to exhibit activity against a number of substrates including naphthyl fatty acid esters, p-nitrophenyl fatty acid esters and hydroxylcinnamic acid esters. conclusions: fae1a exhibited a lower k(m) and higher catalytic efficiency (k(cat) /k(m) ) on ferulic acid esters than on alpha-na or p-nitrophenyl acetate, suggesting that it has a higher affinity for ethyl and methyl ferulate than for the acetyl esters. it releases ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid from barley straw. activity of fae1a was inhibited by the serine-specific protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, indicating that a serine residue plays a role in its activity. significance and impact of the study: to our knowledge, this is the first report of characterization of carbohydrate esterase gene from the genus of  anaeromyces.

TI  == the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. pcc 6803 is able to express an active [fefe]-hydrogenase without additional maturation proteins.
AB  == [fefe]-hydrogenases have been claimed as the most promising catalysts of hydrogen bioproduction and several efforts have been accomplished to express and purify them. however, previous attemps to obtain a functional recombinant [fefe]-hydrogenase in heterologous systems such as escherichia coli failed due to the lack of the specific maturation proteins driving the assembly of its complex  active site. the unique exception is that of [fefe]-hydrogenase from clostridium  pasteurianum that has been expressed in active form in the cyanobacterium synechococcus pcc 7942, which holds a bidirectional [nife]-hydrogenase with a well characterized maturation system, suggesting that the latter is flexible enough to drive the synthesis of a [fefe]-enzyme. however, the capability of cyanobacteria to correctly fold a [fefe]-hydrogenase in the absence of its auxiliary maturation proteins is a debated question. in this work, we expressed the [fefe]-hydrogenase from chlamydomonas reinhardtii as an active enzyme in the  cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. pcc 6803. our results, using a different experimental system, confirm that cyanobacteria are able to express a functional  [fefe]-hydrogenase even in the absence of additional chaperones.

AB  == several engineered selenocysteine (sec)-containing glutaredoxins (grxs) and their enzymatic properties have been reported, but natural selenoprotein grxs have not  been previously characterized. we expressed a bacterial selenoprotein grx from clostridium sp. (also known as alkaliphilus oremlandii) ohilas in escherichia coli and characterized this selenoenzyme and its natural cys homologues in clostridium and e. coli. the selenoprotein grx had a 200-fold higher activity than its sec-to-cys mutant form, suggesting that sec is essential for catalysis by this thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase. kinetic analysis also showed that the selenoprotein grx had a 10-fold lower k(m) than cys homologues. interestingly, this selenoenzyme efficiently reduced a clostridium selenoprotein methionine sulfoxide reductase a (msra), suggesting that it is the natural reductant for the protein that is not reducible by thioredoxin, a common reductant for cys-containing msras. we also found that the selenoprotein grx could not efficiently reduce a cys version of clostridium msra, whereas natural clostridium and e. coli cys-containing grxs, which efficiently reduce cys-containing msras, poorly acted on the selenoprotein msra. this specificity for msra reduction could explain why sec is utilized in clostridium grx and more generally provides a novel example of the use of sec in biological systems.

TI  == dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  == background: a custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  rna probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and crohn's disease (cd) patients. methods: oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "goarray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16s rrna sequences. fecal 16s rdna  from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six cd patients were used as  template to generate fluorescently labeled crna that was hybridized to the microarray. differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with species-specific primer sets. results: the microarray analyses showed that eubacterium rectale, bacteroides fragilis group, b. vulgatus, ruminococcus albus, r. callidus, r. bromii, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the cd patients, while enterococcus sp., clostridium difficile, escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, and listeria sp. were more abundant in the cd group. conclusions: the microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. in addition, the microarray showed that enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the cd patients. this microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == complete stereospecific repair of a synthetic dinucleotide spore photoproduct by  spore photoproduct lyase.
AB  == spore photoproduct lyase (sp lyase), a member of the radical s-adenosylmethionine superfamily of enzymes, catalyzes the repair of 5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine [spore photoproduct (sp)], a type of uv-induced dna damage unique to bacterial spores. the anaerobic purification and characterization of clostridium acetobutylicum sp lyase heterologously expressed in escherichia coli, and its catalytic activity in repairing stereochemically defined synthetic dinucleotide sps was investigated. the purified enzyme contains between 2.3 and 3.1 iron atoms per protein. electron paramagnetic resonance (epr) spectroscopy reveals an isotropic signal centered at g = 1.99, characteristic of a [3fe-4s](+) cluster accounting for 3-4% of the iron in the sample. upon reduction, a nearly axial signal (g = 2.03, 1.93 and 1.92) characteristic of a [4fe-4s](+) cluster is observed that accounts for 34-45% of total iron. addition of s-adenosylmethionine to the reduced enzyme produces a rhombic signal (g = 2.02, 1.93, 1.82) unique to  the s-adenosyl-l: -methionine complex while decreasing the overall epr intensity. this reduced enzyme is shown to rapidly and completely repair the 5r diastereomer of a synthetic dinucleotide sp with a specific activity of 7.1 +/- 0.6 nmol min(-1) mg(-1), whereas no repair was observed for the 5s diastereomer.

TI  == isolation of bacteria from mouse caecal samples and description of bacteroides sartorii sp. nov.
AB  == caecal samples from wild-type and tnf(deltaare) mice were cultured on selective media containing bile salts, amino acids or casein macro-peptides. twenty-two strains were isolated and identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing. twenty-one strains showed >98% similarity to known bacteria (blautia spp., clostridium innocuum, enterococcus spp., escherichia coli, lactobacillus murinus, parabacteroides goldsteinii and shigella dysenteriae). one additional isolate, strain a-c2-0, was a new bacterium. the closest relatives were bacteroides massiliensis, bacteroides dorei and bacteroides vulgatus (< or = 94% similarity). strain a-c2-0 is a gram-negative rod that does not form spores and has a g + c content of dna of 41.5%. its major cellular fatty acid is c(15:0 anteiso), and its major respiratory quinone is mk-9. cells are aerotolerant but grow only under strict anoxic conditions. they are resistant to cefotaxime and tobramycin. when compared with related bacteroides spp., the new bacterium was positive for alpha-arabinosidase, negative for glutamyl glutamic acid arylamidase and did not  metabolise galactose, glucose, fructose, mannose, raffinose and sucrose. strain a-c2-0 therefore merits recognition as a member of a novel species within the genus bacteroides, for which the name bacteroides sartorii is proposed. the type  strain is a-c2-0(t) (= dsm 21941(t) = ccug 57211(t)).

TI  == effect of high pressure on the microbiological quality of cooked chicken during storage at normal and abuse refrigeration temperatures.
AB  == vacuum-packaged cooked poultry meat was treated at a range of pressures (400-600  mpa) and hold times (1, 2 and 10 min), followed by storage at 4 degrees , 8 degrees or 12 degrees c for up to 35 days. weissella viridescens was found to be  the dominant microorganism in the pressure-treated meat, constituting 100% of the microflora identified at 500 and 600 mpa. none of the pressure-treated samples had obvious signs of spoilage during the 35 day storage period, even when the weissella count was >7 log(10) cfu/g. studies on a typical w. viridescens isolate showed it to be relatively pressure-resistant in poultry meat, with <1 log reduction in numbers after a treatment of 2 min at 600 mpa. agar diffusion assays showed that the isolate also caused the inhibition of a number of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, including strains of clostridium botulinum, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus and escherichia coli. the selection of a pressure-resistant organism, such as this weissella sp. could be advantageous in  extending the shelf-life, and also microbiological safety, of the cooked meat, as it could give protection in addition to the pressure treatment itself.

TI  == expanding the family of collagen proteins: recombinant bacterial collagens of varying composition form triple-helices of similar stability.
AB  == the presence of the (gly-xaa-yaa)(n) open reading frames in different bacteria predicts the existence of an expanded family of collagen-like proteins. to further explore the triple-helix motif and stabilization mechanisms in the absence of hydroxyproline (hyp), predicted novel collagen-like proteins from gram-positive and -negative bacteria were expressed in escherichia coli and characterized. soluble proteins capable of successful folding and in vitro refolding were observed for collagen proteins from methylobacterium sp 4-46, rhodopseudomonas palustris and solibacter usitatus . in contrast, all protein constructs from clostridium perfringens were found predominantly in inclusion bodies. however, attachment of a heterologous n-terminal or c-terminal noncollagenous folding domain induced the clostridium perfringens collagen domain to fold and become soluble. the soluble constructs from different bacteria had typical collagen triple-helical features and showed surprisingly similar thermal  stabilities despite diverse amino acid compositions. these collagen-like proteins provide a resource for the development of biomaterials with new properties.

TI  == biosynthesis of polylactic acid and its copolymers using evolved propionate coa transferase and pha synthase.
AB  == for the synthesis of polylactic acid (pla) and its copolymers by one-step fermentation process, heterologous pathways involving clostridium propionicum propionate coa transferase (pct(cp)) and pseudomonas sp. mbel 6-19 polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) synthase 1 (phac1(ps6-19)) were introduced into escherichia coli for the generation of lactyl-coa endogenously and incorporation  of lactyl-coa into the polymer, respectively. since the wild-type phac1(ps6-19) did not efficiently accept lactyl-coa as a substrate, site directed mutagenesis as well as saturation mutagenesis were performed to improve the enzyme. the wild-type pct(cp) was not able to efficiently convert lactate to lactyl-coa and was found to exert inhibitory effect on cell growth, random mutagenesis by error-prone pcr was carried out. by employing engineered phac1(ps6-19) and pct(cp), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate), p(3hb-co-la), containing 20-49 mol%  lactate could be produced up to 62 wt% from glucose and 3hb. by controlling the 3hb concentration in the medium, pla homopolymer and p(3hb-co-la) containing lactate as a major monomer unit could be synthesized. also, p(3hb-co-la) copolymers containing various lactate fractions could be produced from glucose alone by introducing the cupriavidus necator beta-ketothiolase and acetoacetyl-coa reductase genes. fed-batch cultures were performed to produce p(3hb-co-la) copolymers having 9-64 mol% of lactate, and their molecular weights, thermal properties, and melt flow properties were determined.

TI  == bacterial diversity of darfiyeh, a lebanese artisanal raw goat's milk cheese.
AB  == in order to contribute to the preservation of the lebanese dairy heritage, the aim of this study was to characterize the darfiyeh cheese, a traditional variety  made from raw goat's milk and ripened in goat's skin. three independent batches of darfiyeh production were analyzed after 20, 40 and 60 days of ripening. mesophilic lactobacilli, thermophilic coccal-shaped lactic acid bacteria (lab) and thermophilic lactobacilli were enumerated. in order to explore the darfiyeh natural ecosystem, a combination of phenotypical and molecular approaches was applied. the latter included polymerase chain reaction-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (pcr-ttge), classical pcr and quantitative pcr. these methods revealed the presence of streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus malodoratus, group d streptococcus sp., lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and l. lactis subsp. cremoris, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus curvatus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, clostridium sp./eubacterium tenue. real-time pcr  enabled quantification of e. faecium, with a detection of 10(7)-10(9) cfu g(-1) of product. the present molecular approaches combined with phenotypic method allowed describing the complex natural ecosystem of darfiyeh, giving useful information for the preservation of lebanese artisanal dairy products.

TI  == demonstration of passive protection in neonatal calves against colibacillosis following immunization of pregnant heifers at 3 months of gestation.
AB  == enterotoxigenic escherichia coli is one of the primary etiologic agents for diarrhea in neonatal calves. immunization of dams can provide passive protection  in neonatal calves; antibodies transferred through colostrum block colonization of bacteria, thereby preventing disease. in this study, healthy pregnant heifers  were vaccinated at approximately 3 months of gestation with either a polyvalent oil-adjuvanted vaccine containing inactivated coronavirus, rotavirus, e. coli k99 subunit antigen, and clostridium perfringens b and e toxoid or normal saline as a placebo. calves were allowed to nurse immediately after birth, were orally challenged with virulent heterologous enterotoxigenic e. coli at 1 day of age, and were observed for clinical signs of scours for 10 days. signs of severe scours were noted in 75% of control calves and 28.6% of vaccinates, and the severity of scours was significantly higher (p = .0382) in the control group. the mortality rate was significantly higher (p = .0007) in the control group (80%) than in the vaccinate group (14%). these findings indicate that the vaccination of pregnant heifers at as early as 3 months of gestation (6 months before calving) provides passive protection in neonatal calves against colibacillosis.

TI  == regional differences in bacterial flora in harbour porpoises from the north atlantic: environmental effects?
AB  == aims: microbiological findings in harbour porpoises from different regions of the north atlantic were compared. results in animals from the north and baltic seas were evaluated over a period of 18 years for changes in the microbiological flora. methods and results: microbiological investigations were performed on 1429 organ samples from the lung, liver, kidney, spleen, intestine, and mesenteric lymph nodes from harbour porpoises of the german north and baltic seas, greenlandic, icelandic and norwegian waters. a large variety of bacteria, including potentially pathogenic bacteria like brucella sp., clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, beta-haemolytic streptococci and staphylococcus aureus were isolated. those bacteria were associated with bronchopneumonia, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, pyelonephritis, myocarditis and septicemia. conclusions: organs from animals originating from greenlandic and icelandic waters showed clearly less bacterial growth and fewer associated pathological lesions compared to animals from the german north and baltic seas and norwegian waters. significance and impact of the study: differences in bacterial findings and associated lesions between harbour porpoises from the german north and baltic seas and animals from greenlandic, norwegian and icelandic waters may result from higher stress due to anthropogenic activities such as chemical pollutants in the north and baltic seas.

TI  == the selenoproteome of clostridium sp. ohilas: characterization of anaerobic bacterial selenoprotein methionine sulfoxide reductase a.
AB  == selenocysteine (sec) is incorporated into proteins in response to uga codons. this residue is frequently found at the catalytic sites of oxidoreductases. in this study, we characterized the selenoproteome of an anaerobic bacterium, clostridium sp. (also known as alkaliphilus oremlandii) ohila, and identified 13  selenoprotein genes, five of which have not been previously described. one of the detected selenoproteins was methionine sulfoxide reductase a (msra), an antioxidant enzyme that repairs oxidatively damaged methionines in a stereospecific manner. to date, little is known about msra from anaerobes. we characterized this selenoprotein msra which had a single sec residue at the catalytic site but no cysteine (cys) residues in the protein sequence. its secis  (sec insertion sequence) element did not resemble those in escherichia coli. although with low translational efficiency, the expression of the clostridium selenoprotein msra gene in e. coli could be demonstrated by (75)se metabolic labeling, immunoblot analyses, and enzyme assays, indicating that its secis element was recognized by the e. coli sec insertion machinery. we found that the  sec-containing msra exhibited at least a 20-fold higher activity than its cys mutant form, indicating a critical role of sec in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. furthermore, our data revealed that the clostridium msra was inefficiently reducible by thioredoxin, which is a typical reducing agent for msra, suggesting the use of alternative electron donors in this anaerobic bacterium that directly act on the selenenic acid intermediate and do not require resolving cys residues.

TI  == uv disinfection of rbc-treated light greywater effluent: kinetics, survival and regrowth of selected microorganisms.
AB  == the microbial quality of raw greywater was found to be much better than that of municipal wastewater, with 1.6 x 10(7)cfu ml(-1) heterotrophic plate count (hpc), and 3.8 x 10(4), 9.9 x 10(3), 3.3 x 10(3) and 4.6 x 10(0)cfu 100 ml(-1) faecal coliforms (fc), staphylococcus aureus sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa sp. and clostridium perfringes sp., respectively. further, three viral indicators monitored (somatic phage, host: escherichia coli cn(13) and f-rna phages, hosts:  e. coli f+(amp), e. coli k12) were not present in raw greywater. the greywater was treated by an rbc followed by sedimentation. the treatment removed two orders of magnitude of all bacteria. uv disinfection kinetics, survival and regrowth of  hpc, fc, p. aeruginosa sp. and s. aureus sp. were examined. at doses up to 69 mw  s cm(-2) fc were found to be the most resistant bacteria, followed by hpc, p. aeruginosa sp. and s. aureus sp. (inactivation rate coefficients: 0.0687, 0.113,  0.129 and 0.201 cm2 mw(-1)s(-1), respectively). at higher doses (69-439 mw s cm(-2)) all but hpc (which exhibited a tailing curve) were completely eliminated. microscopic examination showed that fc self-aggregate in the greywater effluent.  this provides fc an advantage at low doses, since the concentration of suspended  matter (that can provide shelter from uv radiation) in the effluent was very low. fc, p. aeruginosa sp. and s. aureus sp. did not exhibit regrowth up to 6h after exposure to increasing uv doses (19-439 mw s cm(-2)). hpc regrowth was proven to  be statistically significant in un-disinfected effluent and after irradiation with high uv doses (147 and 439 mw s cm(-2)). at these doses regrowth resulted from growth of uv-resistant bacteria due to decreased competition with other bacteria eliminated by the irradiation.

TI  == assessment of faecal contamination and the relationship between pathogens and faecal bacterial indicators in an estuarine environment (seine, france).
AB  == the seine estuary, one of the largest estuaries of the european northwest continental shelf, is subjected to numerous anthropogenic influences. here we present an assessment of the microbial faecal contamination of the estuary water. the most vulnerable areas were defined on the basis of the fluxes of indicator organisms and the occurrence of salmonella and cryptosporidium sp. and giardia sp. (oo)cysts. the microbial quality of the water changes from upstream to downstream: in the upstream area, contamination by faecal-indicator bacteria and  salmonella occurs during periods of high flow; in the urbanized area, mid-way between the uppermost areas of the estuary and its mouth, discharge from a wastewater treatment plant and a tributary degrade water quality; at the estuary  mouth, the accumulation of microorganisms attached to particles in the maximum turbidity zone, particularly clostridium perfringens spores and oocysts of cryptosporidium, is accompanied by inputs of thc and escherichia coli from tributaries. in some areas, significant strong relations are observed between salmonella, (oo)cysts of protozoan, and levels of faecal indicators.

TI  == effect of tea phenolics and their aromatic fecal bacterial metabolites on intestinal microbiota.
AB  == tea is rich in polyphenols and other phenolics that have been widely reported to  have beneficial health effects. however, dietary polyphenols are not completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are metabolized by the gut microflora so that they and their metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. in this study, we investigated the influence of the phenolic components of a tea extract and their aromatic metabolites upon bacterial growth. fecal homogenates containing bacteria significantly catalyzed tea phenolics, including epicatechin, catechin, 3-o-methyl gallic acid, gallic acid and caffeic acid to generate aromatic metabolites dependent on bacterial species. different strains of intestinal bacteria had varying degrees of growth sensitivity to tea phenolics and metabolites. growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile and bacteroides spp. was significantly repressed by tea phenolics and their derivatives, while commensal anaerobes like clostridium spp., bifidobacterium spp. and probiotics such as lactobacillus sp. were less severely affected. this indicates that tea phenolics exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population, probably by acting as metabolic prebiotics. our observations provide further evidence for the importance of colonic bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of phenolics in human health and disease. the bioactivity of different phenolics may play an important role in the maintenance of gastrointestinal health.

TI  == comparison of the concentrations of phenolic compounds in olive oils and other plant oils: correlation with antimicrobial activity.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. in vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal  action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal  microbiota (clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum. otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica, yersinia sp., and shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol,  were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. these findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by hplc, against l. monocytogenes. in particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. these results indicate that not all oils classified as "olive oil" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.

AB  == a clostridium sp. isolated from intestine of decaying fish exhibited 99% sequence identity with c. tetani at 16s rrna level. it produced a neurotoxin that was neutralized by botulinum antitoxin (a+b+e) as well as tetanus antitoxin. the gene fragments for light chain, c-terminal and n-terminal regions of the heavy chain of the toxin were amplified using three reported primer sets for tetanus neurotoxin (tent). the neurotoxin gene fragments were cloned in escherichia coli  and sequenced. the sequences obtained exhibited approximately 98, 99 and 98% sequence identity with reported gene sequences of tent/lc, tent/hc and tent/hn, respectively. the phylogenetic interrelationship between the neurotoxin gene of clostridium sp. with previously reported gene sequences of clostridium botulinum  a to g and c. tetani was examined by analysis of differences in the nucleotide sequences. six amino acids were substituted at four different positions in the light chain of neurotoxin from the isolate when compared with the reported closest sequence of tent. of these, four were located in the beta15 motif at a solvent inaccessible, buried region of the protein molecule. one of these substitutions were on the solvent accessible surface residue of alpha1 motif, previously shown to have strong sequence conservation. a substitution of two amino acids observed in n-terminal region of heavy chain were buried residues, located in the beta21 and beta37 motifs showing variability in other related sequences. the c-terminal region responsible for binding to receptor was conserved, showing no changes in the amino acid sequence.

TI  == [emphysematous cystitis due to clostridium perfringens--a localised infection in  a man with generalized melanoma].
AB  == emphysematous cystitis was found at autopsy of a 47-year-old man suffering from generalised malignant melanoma. bacteriological cultures from the urinary bladder showed escherichia coli, klebsiella sp. and clostridium perfringens type a, toxic strain. the histological examination revealed cystic dilatation of lymphatic vessels both in bladder mucosa and muscularis propria. there were multinucleated  macrophages in the lining of some of these cystic spaces and a few gram-positive  rods inside their lumina. in the mucosal and submucosal connective tissue there were signs of chronic inflammation and, focally, small haemorrhages. we suppose that the gas production was due to the presence of clostridium perfringens and believe that the infection of the urinary bladder occurred in relation to the repeated insertion of the catheter into the bladder of a patient with secondary immunosuppression. emphysematous cystitis was, in our case, a localised clostridial infection without clinical and morphological signs of generalised septicaemia.

TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

TI  == decrease of enteric micro-organisms from rural sewage sludge during their composting in straw mixture.
AB  == aims: to study the decrease of enteric micro-organisms including viable nematode  eggs, enteroviruses, faecal indicators (escherichia coli and enterococci) and pathogenic bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, salmonella sp. and clostridium perfringens) of a rural sewage sludge when it is composted for 7 months in mixture with straw. methods and results: numbers of the test organisms and the physico-chemical parameters were measured on a monthly basis on the mixture, on the compost after being turned, and on the pile in three positions representing the part by which air is incoming, the bottom of the pile and the part through which air is outgoing. the lowest temperature in the pile was observed at the bottom, where it did not exceed 50 degrees c against 66 degrees c in the two other areas. there were no significant differences between the three areas in terms of micro-organism survival. infectious enteroviruses were inactivated rapidly and were not found after the first turning whereas some genomes were detected until after the third turning. escherichia coli and enterococci presented a similar survival rate and their number decreased by 4 log(10) whereas salmonella decayed at a greater rate than l. monocytogenes. the numbers of c. perfringens decreased gradually to reach a final concentration in the mature compost of about 10(2) cfu g(-1) dry matter (d.m.), which was similar to that of  the faecal indicators. conclusions: the hygienic effect of sludge composting in mixture with straw results in a significant reduction of enteric micro-organisms, the concentration of the faecal indicators in the final product being < 64 most probable number g(-1) d.m. the concentrations of salmonella, enteroviruses and viable nematode eggs in the final product were not detectable which is in accordance with the french legislation. significance and impact of the study: the results which pointed out the different behaviour of the test micro-organisms reflect the difficulty to propose a relevant indicator of hygienization. otherwise, they show that composting is an efficient means for hygienization of sludge of rural wastewater treatment, where the straw is available close to their place of production.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == cloning, expression, and cell surface localization of paenibacillus sp. strain w-61 xylanase 5, a multidomain xylanase.
AB  == we have shown that a xylan-degrading bacterium, w-61, excretes multiple xylanases, including xylanase 5 with a molecular mass of 140 kda. here, we emend  the previously used classification of the bacterium (i.e., aeromonas caviae w-61) to paenibacillus sp. strain w-61 on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of the 16s rrna gene, and we clone and express the xyn5 gene encoding xylanase 5 (xyn5)  in escherichia coli and study the subcellular localization of xyn5. xyn5 encodes  1,326 amino acid residues, including a 27-amino-acid signal sequence. sequence analysis indicated that xyn5 comprises two family 22 carbohydrate-binding modules (cbm), a family 10 catalytic domain of glycosyl hydrolases, a family 9 cbm, a domain similar to the lysine-rich region of clostridium thermocellum sdba, and three s-layer-homologous (slh) domains. recombinant xyn5 bound to a crystalline cellulose, avicel ph-101, while an n-terminal 90-kda fragment of xyn5, which lacks the c-terminal half of the family 9 cbm, did not bind to avicel ph-101. xyn5 was cell bound, and the cell-bound protein was digested by exogenous trypsin to produce immunoreactive and xylanolytic fragments with molecular masses of 80 and 60 kda. xyn5 was exclusively distributed in the cell envelope fraction consisting of a peptidoglycan-containing layer and an associated s layer. thus, paenibacillus sp. strain w-61 xyn5 is a cell surface-anchored modular xylanase possessing a functional cellulose-binding module and slh domains. possible cooperative action of multiple xylanases produced by strain w-61 is discussed on  the basis of the modular structure of xyn5.

TI  == evaluation of broiler litter with reference to the microbial composition as assessed by using 16s rrna and functional gene markers.
AB  == very little is known about the microbial composition of animal bedding wastes, including poultry litter, and what is known has been deduced from standard culture methods, by which some fastidious organisms that exist in the environment may not be detected. we evaluated the bacterial composition of poultry litter by  using a combination of culture and molecular detection. total aerobic bacteria in poultry litter were detected by culture at 10(9) cfu/g of material. enteric bacteria such as enterococcus spp. and coliforms composed 0.1 and 0.01%, respectively, of the total aerobic cultivatable bacteria in poultry litter; no salmonella strains were detected by culture. in order to characterize the most abundant bacterial groups, we sequenced 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) genes amplified  by pcr with microbial community dna isolated from poultry litter as the template. from the 16s rdna library, 31 genera were identified. twelve families or groups were identified with lactobacilli and salinococcus spp. forming the most abundant groups. in fact, 82% of the total sequences were identified as gram-positive bacteria with 62% of total belonging to low g+c gram-positive groups. in addition to detection of 16s rdna sequences associated with the expected fecal bacteria present in manure, we detected many bacterial sequences for organisms, such as globicatella sulfidofaciens, corynebacterium ammoniagenes, corynebacterium urealyticum, clostridium aminovalericum, arthrobacter sp., and denitrobacter permanens, that may be involved in the degradation of wood and cycling of nitrogen and sulfur. several sequences were identified in the library for bacteria associated with disease in humans and poultry such as clostridia, staphylococci, and bordetella spp. however, specific pcr targeting other human and veterinary pathogens did not detect the presence of salmonella, pathogenic escherichia coli, campylobacter spp., yersinia spp., listeria spp., or toxigenic  staphylococci. pcr and dna hybridization revealed the presence of class 1 integrons with gene cassettes that specify resistance to aminoglycosides and chloramphenicol. only from understanding the microbial community of animal wastes such as poultry litter can we manage animal disease and limit the impact of animal waste on the environment and human and animal health.

AB  == cellulase cel5a from alkalophilic bacillus sp. 1139 contains a family 17 carbohydrate-binding module (bspcbm17) and a family 28 cbm (bspcbm28) in tandem.  the two modules have significantly similar amino acid sequences, but amino acid residues essential for binding are not conserved. bspcbm28 was obtained as a discrete polypeptide by engineering the cel5a gene. bspcbm17 could not be obtained as a discrete polypeptide, so a family 17 cbm from endoglucanase cel5a of clostridium cellulovorans, cccbm17, was used to compare the binding characteristics of the two families of cbm. both cccbm17 and bspcbm28 recognized  two classes of binding sites on amorphous cellulose: a high affinity site (k(a) approximately 1 x 10(6) m(-1)) and a low affinity site (k(a) approximately 2 x 10(4) m(-1)). they did not compete for binding to the high affinity sites, suggesting that they bound at different sites on the cellulose. a polypeptide, bspcbm17/cbm28, comprising the tandem cbms from cel5a, bound to amorphous cellulose with a significantly higher affinity than the sum of the affinities of  cccbm17 and bspcbm28, indicating cooperativity between the linked cbms. cel5a mutants were constructed that were defective in one or both of the cbms. the mutants differed from the wild-type enzyme in the amounts and sizes of the soluble products produced from amorphous cellulose. this suggests that either the cbms can modify the action of the catalytic module of cel5a or that they target the enzyme to areas of the cellulose that differ in susceptibility to hydrolysis.

TI  == regrowth and survival of indicator microorganisms on the surfaces of household containers used for the storage of drinking water in rural communities of south africa.
AB  == the present study covered two rural communities of south africa: ncera and ntselamanzi villages. raw water from ncera river is used by the community of ncera village for drinking, while the community of ntselamanzi receives their drinking water from alice purification system. treated water is supplied to the community by a public standpipe system. in rural communities of south africa, many households use polyethylene (pe) and galvanized steel (gs) containers for the storage of their drinking water. to investigate the regrowth and survival of  indicator microorganisms on the surface of household containers during the storage of drinking water, pe and gs slides were suspended in the appropriate household containers for a period of 48 h. this period of 48 h was chosen as the  study period because results from the questionnaire indicated that the largest percentage (62%) of households store their water for that length of time. the experiment was performed to test drinking water as it is collected and stored by  rural communities. no disinfection of household containers or slides was done during the study period. attached coliphages (f-rna (fp) and somatic phage (sp),  coliform bacteria (total coliform (tc), presumptive escherichia coli (ec), salmonella (sal) and clostridium perfringens (cp) were measured during the study  period. with the exception of cp, attached indicator microorganisms consisted of  tc, presumptive e. coli and salmonella, somatic and f-rna coliphages, although the yield (average count) for the last four groups (ec: < 1-3 cfu cm(-2), sal: <  1-15 cfu cm(-2), fp: < 1-7 pfu cm(-2), sp: < 1-7pfu cm(-2)) was lower than that of tc (3-183 cfu cm(-2)). however, the lowest yield of indicator microorganisms was noted for presumptive e. coli. whereas the occurrence and survival of tc was  noted on the surface of household containers during the entire period of the experimental study, other indicator microorganisms occurred from time to time. the regrowth of indicator microorganisms occurred 48 h after the exposure of slides to both types of test waters. this length of time mostly resulted in the regrowth of tc (with an increase in bacterial counts) while the persistence of other indicator organism groups on the surface of the slides was apparent. a comparison between pe and gs containers showed that more tc (average count) regrew on pe than on gs containers (for river water, pe: from 36 to 55 cfu cm(-2), gs: from 25 to 26 cfu cm(-2); for standpipe water, pe: from 147 to 183 cfu cm(-2), gs from 3 to 4 cfu cm(-2)). this study revealed that both types of household containers supported the growth and survival of indicator microorganisms due to the bad quality of the intake water before storage. the storage of drinking water for 48 h mainly resulted in the regrowth of tc. nevertheless, the persistence of other indicator microorganisms was observed on the surface of household containers.

TI  == involvement of coenzyme a esters and two new enzymes, an enoyl-coa hydratase and  a coa-transferase, in the hydration of crotonobetaine to l-carnitine by escherichia coli.
AB  == two proteins (caib and caid) were found to catalyze the reversible biotransformation of crotonobetaine to l-carnitine in escherichia coli in the presence of a cosubstrate (e.g., gamma-butyrobetainyl-coa or crotonobetainyl-coa). caib (45 kda) and caid (27 kda) were purified in two steps  to electrophoretic homogeneity from overexpression strains. caib was identified as crotonobetainyl-coa:carnitine coa-transferase by maldi-tof mass spectrometry and enzymatic assays. the enzyme exhibits high cosubstrate specificity to coa derivatives of trimethylammonium compounds. in particular, the n-terminus of caib shows significant identity with other coa-transferases (e.g., flda from clostridium sporogenes, frc from oxalobacter formigenes, and bbse from thauera aromatica) and coa-hydrolases (e.g., baif from eubacterium sp.). caid was shown to be a crotonobetainyl-coa hydratase using maldi-tof mass spectrometry and enzymatic assays. besides crotonobetainyl-coa caid is also able to hydrate crotonyl-coa with a significantly lower vmax (factor of 10(3)) but not crotonobetaine. the substrate specificity of caid and its homology to the crotonase confirm this enzyme as a new member of the crotonase superfamily. concluding these results, it was verified that hydration of crotonobetaine to l-carnitine proceeds at the coa level in two steps: the caid catalyzed hydration  of crotonobetainyl-coa to l-carnitinyl-coa, followed by a coa transfer from l-carnitinyl-coa to crotonobetaine, catalyzed by caib. when gamma-butyrobetainyl-coa was used as a cosubstrate (coa donor), the first reaction is the coa transfer. the optimal ratios of caib and caid during this hydration reaction, determined to be 4:1 when crotonobetainyl-coa was used as cosubstrate and 5:1 when gamma-butyrobetainyl-coa was used as cosubstrate, are different from that found for in vivo conditions (1:3).

TI  == comparative genomics and evolution of genes encoding bacterial (p)ppgpp synthetases/hydrolases (the rel, rela and spot proteins).
AB  == in the gram-negative model organism escherichia coli, the effector molecule of the stringent response, (p)ppgpp, is synthesized by two different enzymes, rela and spot, whereas in the gram-positive model organism bacillus subtilis only one  enzyme named rel is responsible for this activity. rel and spot also possess (p)ppgpp hydrolase activity. blast searches were used to identify orthologous genes in databases. the construction and bootstrapping of phylogenetic trees allowed classification of these orthologs. four groups could be distinguished: with the exception of neisseria and bordetella (beta subdivision), the rela and spot groups are exclusively found in the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria. two rel groups representing the actinobacterial and the bacillus/clostridium group were also identified. the spot proteins are related to the gram positive rel proteins. rela proteins carry substitutions in the hd domain (aravind and koonin, 1998, tibs 23: 469-472) responsible for ppgpp degradation. a theory for the evolution of the specialized, paralogous rela and spot genes is presented: after  gene duplication of an ancestral rellike gene, the spot and rela genes evolved from the duplicated genes. the distribution pattern of the paralogous rela and spot proteins supports a new model of linear bacterial evolution (gupta, 2000, fems microbiol. rev. 24: 367-402). this model postulates that the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria represents the most recently evolved bacterial lineage. however, two paralogous, closely related genes of porphyromonas gingivalis (cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides phylum) encoding proteins with functions probably identical to the rela and spot proteins do not fit in this model. completely sequenced genomes of several obligately parasitic organisms (treponema pallidum, chlamydia species, rickettsia prowazekii) and the obligate aphid symbiont buchnera sp. aps as well as archaea do not contain rel-like genes  but they are present in the arabidopsis genome. in crosslinking experiments using different analogs of ppgpp as crosslinking reagents and rna polymerase preparations of escherichia coli, binding of ppgpp to distinct regions at the c-terminus of the beta subunit (the rpob gene product) and/or at the n-terminus of the beta subunit (the rpoc gene product) was observed previously. rpob and rpoc sequences of the species which do not possess a rel like gene do not exhibit specific insertions or deletions in the ppgpp binding regions.

AB  == background: bacterial beta-glucuronidase causes deconjugation of bilirubin diglucuronide resulting in the precipitation of calcium bilirubinate, which contributes to biliary sludge and stone formation. this process is attributed to  enzyme activity produced by the aerobic enterobacteriaceae such as escherichia coli and klebsiella sp. the presence of clostridium sp. was detected in 48 of 56  intrahepatic stones by using polymerase chain reaction techniques and cultured clostridium perfringens from 14 of 18 unblocked biliary stents. such bacteria are reported to produce beta-glucuronidase activity. the aim of this study was to determine the proportion of biliary bacteria isolated from pigment stones and stents that produce beta-glucuronidase and to compare the enzyme activity expressed by the different bacteria in human bile. methods: a total of 202 bacteria were isolated from blocked and unblocked biliary stents and pigment ductal stones recovered from patients. of these, 61 bacteria expressed beta-glucuronidase activity in brain heart infusion broth. these 61 bacteria were subsequently grown in human bile under aerobic or anaerobic conditions to the early stationary phase and assayed for beta-glucuronidase activity by using rho-nitrophenyl beta-d glucuronide as substrate. results were normalized and reported as units of enzyme activity per milligram protein of the bacteria. results: c. perfringens produced beta-glucuronidase enzyme activity that was 34-fold higher than that for e coli, staphylococcus, corynebacterium sp., bacillus sp., enterococcus sp., acinetobacter sp., streptococcus sp., and klebsiella sp. conclusion: c. perfringens with its higher enzyme activity is more important in the deconjugation of bilirubin diglucuronide than e coli and klebsiella sp.

TI  == analysis of kdpc of the k(+)-transporting kdpfabc complex of escherichia coli.
AB  == the kdp complex, a high affinity atp-driven k(+) transport system of escherichia  coli, is composed of the four membrane-bound subunits kdpf, kdpa, kdpb and kdpc.  whereas the role of kdpb (catalytical subunit), kdpa (k(+)-translocating subunit) and kdpf (stabilizing peptide) is well understood, the function of kdpc is still  unknown. therefore, a kdpc deletion strain was constructed and complementation experiments were performed using different kdpc constructs. truncations of the kdpc gene revealed that only one derivative, which lacks base pairs coding for the four c-terminal amino acids, was able to complement the chromosomal deletion  of kdpc. furthermore, complementation was also observed with kdpc of mycobacterium tuberculosis, but not with kdpc from clostridium acetobutylicum or  synechocystis sp. pcc6803. sequence alignment of 17 different kdpc proteins led to the construction of hybrids between kdpc of e. coli and that of c. acetobutylicum. complementation revealed that the n-terminal transmembrane segment as well as the c-terminal-third of the protein can be exchanged between both species, but only one after the other. a simultaneous substitution of both regions was not possible.

TI  == spread of antibiotic resistance with food-borne pathogens.
AB  == this short review summarizes data on antibiotic resistance profiles of common food-borne pathogens like salmonella sp., escherichia coli, campylobacter sp., listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. as a flashlight on the literature of the last few years, it provides ample evidence that antibiotic resistance traits have entered the microflora of farm animals and the food produced from them. molecular analysis of the resistance genes, where available, shows that the food microflora is not separated from its human counterpart and conjugative transfer of resistance genes has been demonstrated in vitro and in a few cases in vivo. for example, for salmonella typhimurium, resistance towards tetracyclines has increased from zero in 1948 to a 98% level in certain epidemic populations of s.  typhimurium dt104 in 1998. the high incidence of food-borne pathogens in raw meat and milk together with a high level of therapeutic, prophylactic and nutritional  application of antibiotics in agriculture reveals an antibiotic resistance problem of global dimensions. the resistance problem in human medicine will not be solved if there is a constant influx of resistance genes into the human microflora via the food chain.

TI  == novel targets for the pharmacotherapy of diarrhoea: a view for the millennium.
AB  == acute diarrhoea continues to carry a high morbidity and mortality worldwide. intestinal infection is the major cause of acute diarrhoea although the prevalence of individual pathogens varies according to geographic location. in many countries in the industrialized world, reports of intestinal infections continue to increase; these are largely related to waterborne and foodborne outbreaks. acute diarrhoea may be due to increased intestinal secretion, commonly as a result of infection with enterotoxin-producing organisms (enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, vibrio cholerae) or to decreased intestinal absorption from infection with organisms that damage the intestinal epithelium (enteropathogenic  e. coli, shigella sp., salmonella sp.). although oral rehydration therapy has reduced the mortality associated with acute diarrhoea, the diarrhoea attack rate  remains unchanged and stool volume often increases during the rehydration process. the search for agents that will directly inhibit intestinal secretory mechanisms and thereby reduce stool volume has been going on for more than 20 years. research during the past decade has highlighted the importance of neurohumoral mechanisms in the pathogenesis of diarrhoea, notably the role of 5-hydroxytryptamine, substance p, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and neural reflexes within the enteric nervous system. cholera toxin, e. coli enterotoxins and clostridium difficile toxin a are known to invoke these mechanisms in diarrhoea pathogenesis. this new dimension of intestinal pathophysiology has already exposed possible novel targets for anti-secretory therapy, namely, 5-ht receptor antagonists, substance p antagonists and the possibility for potentiating the proabsorptive effects of endogenous enkephalins by use of enkephalinase inhibitors. there now seems to be a real possibility that anti-secretory therapy will become more widely available in the future.

TI  == fermentation by gut microbiota cultured in a simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem is improved by supplementing a soygerm powder.
AB  == an in vitro model, designated the simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (shime), was used to study the effect of a soygerm powder rich in beta-glycosidic phytoestrogenic isoflavones on the fermentation pattern of the colon microbiota and to determine to what extent the latter metabolize the conjugated phytoestrogens. initially, an inoculum prepared from human feces was introduced into the reactor vessels and stabilized over 3 wk using a culture medium. this stabilization period was followed by a 2-wk control period during which the microbiota were monitored. the microbiota were then subjected to a 2-wk treatment period by adding 2.5 g/d soygerm powder to the culture medium. the addition resulted into an overall increase of bacterial marker populations (enterobacteriaceae:, coliforms, lactobacillus: sp., staphylococcus: sp. and clostridium: sp.), with a significant increase of the lactobacillus: sp. population. the short-chain fatty acid (scfa) concentration increased approximately 30% during the supplementation period; this was due mainly to a significant increase of acetic and propionic acids. gas analysis revealed that the methane concentration increased significantly. ammonium and sulfide concentrations were not influenced by soygerm supplementation. use of an electronic nose apparatus indicated that odor concentrations decreased significantly during the treatment period. the beta-glycosidic bonds of the phytoestrogenic isoflavones were cleaved under the conditions prevailing in the large intestine. the increased bacterial fermentation after addition of the soygerm powder was paralleled by substantial metabolism of the free isoflavones (genistein, daidzein and glycitein), resulting in recovery of only 12-17% of the  supplemented isoflavones.

TI  == high-level expression of tetanus toxin fragment c-thioredoxin fusion protein in escherichia coli.
AB  == an insert of clostridium tetani dna corresponding to fragment c of tetanus toxin  was amplified by pcr. this 1.4 kb fragment was cloned into the high-expression vector pet32a, under control of the t7 promoter. expression of this plasmid in escherichia coli bl21(de3) resulted in the production of a fusion protein ( approximately 62 kda) consisting of 112 amino acids of thioredoxin and approximately 450 amino acids of fragment c. this fusion protein was recognized by anti-tetanus toxoid antiserum in an elisa and on immunoblots. the recombinant  fragment-c-thioredoxin protein was purified significantly in one step by ni(2+)-chelate sepharose, the final yield being approximately 35 mg/l. immunization of animals with the recombinant protein produced antibodies that were able to recognize the tetanus toxin. by using this gene-fusion expression system we produced soluble fragment c of tetanus toxin in a high yield, preventing many problems inherent in the use of other expression systems that produce either insoluble fragment c in inclusion bodies, or a soluble form, but in low yield, using e. coli as the expression host.

TI  == the role of probiotic cultures in the control of gastrointestinal health.
AB  == the use of probiotics to enhance intestinal health has been proposed for many years. probiotics are traditionally defined as viable microorganisms that have a  beneficial effect in the prevention and treatment of specific pathologic conditions when they are ingested. there is a relatively large volume of literature that supports the use of probiotics to prevent or treat intestinal disorders. however, the scientific basis of probiotic use has been firmly established only recently, and sound clinical studies have begun to be published. currently, the best-studied probiotics are the lactic acid bacteria, particularly lactobacillus sp. and bifidobacterium sp. however, other organisms used as probiotics in humans include escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., enterococcus sp., bacteroides sp., bacillus sp., propionibacterium sp. and various fungi. some probiotic preparations contain mixtures of more than one bacterial strain. probiotics have been examined for their effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of a diverse spectrum of gastrointestinal disorders such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea (including clostridium difficile-associated intestinal disease), infectious bacterial and viral diarrhea (including diarrhea  caused by rotavirus, shigella, salmonella, enterotoxigenic e. coli, vibrio cholerae and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency disorder, enteral feeding diarrhea, helicobacter pylori gastroenteritis, sucrase maltase deficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, small bowel bacterial overgrowth and lactose intolerance. probiotics have been found to inhibit intestinal bacterial enzymes involved in the synthesis of colonic carcinogens. there are many mechanisms by which probiotics enhance intestinal health, including stimulation of immunity, competition for limited nutrients, inhibition of epithelial and mucosal adherence, inhibition of epithelial invasion and production of antimicrobial substances. probiotics represent an exciting prophylactic and therapeutic advance, although additional investigations must be  undertaken before their role in intestinal health can be delineated clearly.

TI  == cloning and sequence analysis of the gene for glucodextranase from arthrobacter globiformis t-3044 and expression in escherichia coli cells.
AB  == the gld gene for glucodextranase from arthrobacter globiformis t-3044 was cloned  by using a combination of gene walking and probe methods and expressed on the recombinant plasmid pgd8, which was constructed with puc118, in escherichia coli  cells. the enzyme gene consisted of a unique open reading frame of 3,153 bp. the  comparison of the dna sequence data with the n-terminal and 6 internal amino acid sequences of the purified enzyme secreted from a. globiformis t-3044 suggested the enzyme was translated from mrna as a secretory precursor with a signal peptide of 28 amino acids residues. the deduced amino acids sequence of the mature enzyme contained 1,023 residues, resulting in a polypeptide with a molecular mass of 107,475 daltons. the deduced sequence showed about 38% identity to that of the glucoamylase from clostridium sp. g0005. the glucodextranase activity of transformant harboring pgd8 was about 40 mu/ml at 30 degrees c for a  16-h culture. although the gdase that was produced from the transformant was shorter than authentic gdase by 2 amino acid residues at the n-terminal end side, its enzymatic properties were almost same as the authentic one. two kinds of genes, dex1 and dex2, for endo-dextranases from a. globiformis t-3044 were also cloned into escherichia coli cells. the n-terminal of the purified endo-dextranase from a. globiformis t-3044 agreed with the deduced amino acid sequence, after the 33rd alanine residue, of only the dex1 gene for edo-dextranase. this result suggests that the endo-dextranase is translated from  mrna as a secretory precursor with a signal peptide of 32 amino acids residues. the deduced sequence of endo-dextranase 1 and endo-dextranase 2 showed about 93%  and 65% identity with that of known endo-dextranase from arthrobacter sp. cb-8, respectively.

TI  == nadp+-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase in the antarctic psychrotolerant bacterium psychrobacter sp. tad1. characterization, protein and dna sequence, and relationship to other glutamate dehydrogenases.
AB  == the antarctic psychrotolerant bacterium psychrobacter sp. tad1 contains two distinct glutamate dehydrogenases (gdh), each specific for either nadp+ or nad+.  this feature is quite unusual in bacteria, which generally have a single gdh. nadp+-dependent gdh has been purified to homogeneity and the gene encoding gdh has been cloned and expressed. the enzyme has a hexameric structure. the amino acid sequence determined by peptide and gene analyses comprises 447 residues, yielding a protein with a molecular mass of 49 285 da. the sequence shows homology with hexameric gdhs, with identity levels of 52% and 49% with escherichia coli and clostridium symbiosum gdh, respectively. the coenzyme-binding fingerprint motif gxgxxg/a (common to all gdhs) has ser at the last position in this enzyme. the overall hydrophilic character is increased and  a five-residue insertion in a loop between two alpha-helices may contribute to the increase in protein flexibility. psychrobacter sp. tad1 gdh apparent temperature optimum is shifted towards low temperatures, whereas irreversible heat inactivation occurs at temperatures similar to those of e. coli gdh. the catalytic efficiency in the temperature range 10-30 degrees c is similar or lower than that of e. coli gdh. unlike e. coli gdh the enzyme exhibits marked positive  cooperativity towards 2-oxoglutarate and nadph. this feature is generally absent  in prokaryotic gdhs. these observations suggest a regulatory role for this gdh, the most crucial feature being the structural/functional properties required for  fine regulation of activity, rather than the high catalytic efficiency and thermolability encountered in several cold-active enzymes.

TI  == characterization of an acetyl xylan esterase from the anaerobic fungus orpinomyces sp. strain pc-2.
AB  == a 1,067-bp cdna, designated axea, coding for an acetyl xylan esterase (axea) was  cloned from the anaerobic rumen fungus orpinomyces sp. strain pc-2. the gene had  an open reading frame of 939 bp encoding a polypeptide of 313 amino acid residues with a calculated mass of 34,845 da. an active esterase using the original start  codon of the cdna was synthesized in escherichia coli. two active forms of the esterase were purified from recombinant e. coli cultures. the size difference of  8 amino acids was a result of cleavages at two different sites within the signal  peptide. the enzyme released acetate from several acetylated substrates, including acetylated xylan. the activity toward acetylated xylan was tripled in the presence of recombinant xylanase a from the same fungus. using p-nitrophenyl  acetate as a substrate, the enzyme had a k(m) of 0.9 mm and a v(max) of 785 micromol min(-1) mg(-1). it had temperature and ph optima of 30 degrees c and 9.0, respectively. axea had 56% amino acid identity with bnaa, an acetyl xylan esterase of neocallimastix patriciarum, but the orpinomyces axea was devoid of a  noncatalytic repeated peptide domain (ncrpd) found at the carboxy terminus of the neocallimastix bnaa. the ncrpd found in many glycosyl hydrolases and esterases of anaerobic fungi has been postulated to function as a docking domain for cellulase-hemicellulase complexes, similar to the dockerin of the cellulosome of  clostridium thermocellum. the difference in domain structures indicated that the  two highly similar esterases of orpinomyces and neocallimastix may be differently located, the former being a free enzyme and the latter being a component of a cellulase-hemicellulase complex. sequence data indicate that axea and bnaa might  represent a new family of hydrolases.

TI  == chronic diarrhoea among hiv-infected adult patients in nairobi, kenya.
AB  == objectives: chronic diarrhoea and wasting are well recognized features of aids in africa. however, because of resource constraints few comprehensive aetiological studies have been conducted in sub-saharan africa which have included a broad range of microbiological investigations. we undertook a prospective cross-sectional study of adult patients admitted to a government hospital in nairobi, kenya, to determine possible bacterial, mycobacterial, parasitic and viral causes of diarrhoea; to consider which may be treatable; and to relate microbiological findings to clinical outcome. methods: stool specimens from 75 consecutive hiv-seropositive patients with chronic diarrhoea admitted to a nairobi hospital were subjected to microbiological investigation and results were compared with clinical findings and outcome. stool samples were cultured for bacteria and mycobacteria and underwent light and electron microscopy; lawns of escherichia coli were probed for pathogenic types and aliquots were tested for the presence of clostridium difficile cytotoxin. blood cultures for mycobacteria  and other bacterial pathogens were performed as clinically indicated. results: thirty-nine (52%) patients yielded putative pathogens, the most common being cryptosporidium sp. (17%), salmonella typhimurium (13%), and mycobacterium tuberculosis (13%). of 41 patients investigated for pathogenic escherichia coli,  enteroaggregative e. coli and diffusely adherent e. coli were each found in four  patients. thirty-one (41%) patients died. detection of cryptosporidium cysts was  the single most significant predictor of death (x2 = 5.2, p<0.05). many patients  did not improve (21; 28%) or self-discharged whilst still sick (5; 7%) but five (7%) were diagnosed ante mortem with tuberculosis and treated and a further 13 (17%) showed improvement by time of discharge. conclusions: hiv-infected patients with chronic diarrhoea in nairobi have a poor outcome overall, and even with extensive investigation a putative pathogen was identified in only just over half the patients. the most important step is to exclude tuberculosis; and the most useful investigation appears to be ziehl-neelsen staining. other potentially treatable gram-negative bacterial pathogens, s. typhimurium, shigella sp. and adherent e. coli were, however, common but require culture facilities which are not widely accessible for definitive identification. further studies focussing on simple ways to identify sub-groups of patients with treatable infections are warranted.

TI  == evidence for the bacterial origin of genes encoding fermentation enzymes of the amitochondriate protozoan parasite entamoeba histolytica.
AB  == entamoeba histolytica is an amitochondriate protozoan parasite with numerous bacterium-like fermentation enzymes including the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (por), ferredoxin (fd), and alcohol dehydrogenase e (adhe). the goal of this study was to determine whether the genes encoding these cytosolic e. histolytica fermentation enzymes might derive from a bacterium by horizontal transfer, as has previously been suggested for e. histolytica genes encoding heat shock protein 60, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase. in this study, the e. histolytica por gene and the adhe gene of a second amitochondriate protozoan parasite, giardia lamblia, were sequenced, and their phylogenetic positions were estimated in relation to por, adhe, and fd cloned from eukaryotic and eubacterial organisms. the e. histolytica por gene encodes a 1,620-amino-acid peptide that contained conserved iron-sulfur- and thiamine pyrophosphate-binding sites. the predicted e. histolytica por showed fewer positional identities to the por of g. lamblia (34%) than to the por of the enterobacterium klebsiella pneumoniae (49%), the cyanobacterium anabaena sp. (44%), and the protozoan trichomonas vaginalis (46%), which targets its por to anaerobic organelles called hydrogenosomes. maximum-likelihood, neighbor-joining, and parsimony analyses also suggested as less likely e. histolytica por sharing more recent common ancestry with g. lamblia por than with por of bacteria and the t. vaginalis hydrogenosome. the g. lamblia adhe encodes an 888-amino-acid fusion  peptide with an aldehyde dehydrogenase at its amino half and an iron-dependent (class 3) adh at its carboxy half. the predicted g. lamblia adhe showed extensive positional identities to adhe of escherichia coli (49%), clostridium acetobutylicum (44%), and e. histolytica (43%) and lesser identities to the class 3 adh of eubacteria and yeast (19 to 36%). phylogenetic analyses inferred a closer relationship of the e. histolytica adhe to bacterial adhe than to the g. lamblia adhe. the 6-kda fd of e. histolytica and g. lamblia were most similar to  those of the archaebacterium methanosarcina barkeri and the delta-purple bacterium desulfovibrio desulfuricans, respectively, while the 12-kda fd of the t. vaginalis hydrogenosome was most similar to the 12-kda fd of gamma-purple bacterium pseudomonas putida. e. histolytica genes (and probably g. lamblia genes) encoding fermentation enzymes therefore likely derive from bacteria by horizontal transfer, although it is not clear from which bacteria these amebic genes derive. these are the first nonorganellar fermentation enzymes of eukaryotes implicated to have derived from bacteria.

TI  == the helicobacter pylori urec gene codes for a phosphoglucosamine mutase.
AB  == the function of urec, the product of a 1,335-bp-long open reading frame upstream  from the urease structural genes (ureab) of helicobacter pylori, was investigated. we present data showing that the urec gene product is a phosphoglucosamine mutase. d. mengin-lecreulx and j. van heijenoort (j. biol. chem. 271:32-39, 1996) observed that urec is similar (43% identity) to the glmm protein of escherichia coli. those authors showed that glmm is a phosphoglucosamine mutase catalyzing interconversion of glucosamine-6-phosphate into glucosamine-1-phosphate, which is subsequently transformed into udp-n-acetylglucosamine. the latter product is one of the main cytoplasmic precursors of cell wall peptidoglycan and outer membrane lipopolysaccharides. the present paper reports that, like its e. coli homolog glmm, the h. pylori urec gene is essential for cell growth. it was known that growth of a lethal conditional glmm mutant of e. coli at a nonpermissive temperature can be restored in the presence of the urec gene. we showed that complete complementation of the  glmm mutant can be obtained with a plasmid overproducing urec. the peptidoglycan  content and the specific phosphoglucosamine mutase activity of such a complemented strain were measured; these results demonstrated that the urec gene  product functions as a phosphoglucosamine mutase. homologs of the urec and glmm proteins were identified in haemophilus influenzae, mycobacterium leprae, clostridium perfringens, synechocystis sp. strain pcc6803, and methanococcus jannaschii. significant conservation of the amino acid sequence of these proteins in such diverse organisms suggests a very ancient common ancestor for the genes and defines a consensus motif for the phosphoglucosamine mutase active site. we propose renaming the h. pylori urec gene the glmm gene.

TI  == risk factors for outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease linked to domestic catering.
AB  == the epidemiology of general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering for large numbers is described and compared with foodborne outbreaks in other settings. from 1 january 1992 to 31 december 1994, the phls communicable disease surveillance centre identified 101 foodborne general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering in england and wales (16% of all foodborne outbreaks). salmonella species were associated with 77 of the 101 outbreaks and s. enteriditis phage type 4 accounted for 57. small round structured viruses were implicated in five outbreaks, clostridium perfringens in four, bacillus cereus in two, and campylobacter sp and escherichia coli in one each. no pathogen was identified in 11 outbreaks. outbreaks occurred most commonly in summer. the commonest vehicles implicated were poultry/eggs in 44 outbreaks, desserts in 13, and meat/meat products in nine. salad/vegetables, sauces, and fish/shellfish were each implicated in eight  outbreaks. raw shell eggs were implicated in a fifth of outbreaks. inappropriate  storage was the commonest fault, reported in association with 50 outbreaks (ambient temperature for long periods before serving in 29), inadequate heat treatment was reported in 35, cross contamination in 28, an infected food handler in 11, and other faults in 14. outbreaks associated with catering on domestic premises were independently more likely than outbreaks in other settings to be associated with salmonellas, inappropriate storage of food, and consumption of poultry, eggs, or sauces. public health services need to direct messages about the use, preparation, and storage of food to those who cater on domestic premises.

TI  == sequencing and expression of a gene encoding a bile acid transporter from eubacterium sp. strain vpi 12708.
AB  == eubacterium sp. strain vpi 12708 expresses inducible bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylation activity via a multistep pathway. the genes encoding several of the inducible proteins involved in the pathway have been previously mapped to a bile acid-inducible (bai) operon in eubacterium sp. strain vpi 12708. we now report the cloning, sequencing, and characterization of the baig gene, which is part of the bai operon. the predicted amino acid sequence of the baig polypeptide shows significant homology to several membrane transport proteins, including sugar and antibiotic resistance transporters, which are members of the  major facilitator superfamily. hydrophilicity plots of baig show a high degree of similarity to class k and l teta proteins from gram-positive bacteria, and, like  these classes of teta proteins, baig has 14 proposed transmembrane domains. the baig gene was cloned into escherichia coli and shown to confer an energy-dependent bile acid uptake activity. primary bile acids were preferentially transported into e. coli cells expressing this gene, with at least sevenfold and fourfold increases in the uptake of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, respectively, over control reactions. less transport activity was observed with cholylglycine, 7-oxocholic acid, and deoxycholic acid. the transport activity was inhibited by the proton ionophores carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and nigericin but not by the potassium ionophore valinomycin, suggesting that the transport is driven by the proton motive force across the cell membrane. in summary, we have cloned, sequenced, and expressed a bile acid-inducible bile acid transporter from eubacterium sp. strain vpi 12708. to our knowledge, this is the first report of the cloning and expression of a gene encoding a procaryotic bile acid transporter.

TI  == expression and characterization of a c24 bile acid 7 alpha-dehydratase from eubacterium sp. strain vpi 12708 in escherichia coli.
AB  == the intestinal bacterium eubacterium sp. strain vpi 12708 has been shown to have  a bile acid 7 alpha/7 beta-dehydroxylation pathway. a large bile acid inducible (bai) operon encoding at least 9 open reading frames has been cloned and sequenced from this bacterium. the baie gene from this operon has been subcloned  and expressed in e. coli and found to encode a bile acid 7 alpha-dehydratase (ba7 alpha d). the purified ba7 alpha d was shown to have a calculated subunit mass of 19 kd and a relative native molecular weight of 36,000. the km and vmax for 7 alpha, 12 alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholenoic acid was 0.16 mm and 0.48 nmol/min per mg protein, respectively. of the substrates tested, the ba7 alpha d used only 7 alpha, 12 alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholenoic acid and 7 alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholenoic acid as substrates. a molecular modeling program  (sybyl) was used to calculate the energy differences between the various intermediates in the 7 alpha-dehydroxylation pathway. a marked energy difference  (-9.4 kcal/mol) was observed between 7 alpha, 12 alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholenoic acid and 12 alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4,6-choldienoic acid, possibly accounting for the apparent irreversibility of the bile acid 7 alpha-dehydratase reaction under our experimental conditions. no significant amino acid sequence homologies were found between ba7 alpha d and other proteins  in the data base; however, ba7 alpha d does contain a lipocalin signature sequence, possibly indicating a bile acid binding domain. the bile acid 7 alpha-dehydratase appears to be a unique enzyme in the bacterial bile acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylation pathway.

TI  == hepatic abscesses in dogs: 14 cases (1982-1994).
AB  == objectives: to determine typical clinical signs and clinicopathologic findings in dogs with hepatic abscesses, to assess outcome of treatment, and to evaluate the  role that abdominal ultrasonography has in the diagnosis of hepatic abscesses in  dogs and in monitoring response to treatment. design: retrospective case series.  animals: 14 dogs with hepatic abscesses. results: anorexia and lethargy were the  most common historical complaints, followed by vomiting and diarrhea. physical abnormalities included fever, dehydration, signs of abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, and mucosal bleeding. hematologic abnormalities included leukocytosis with neutrophilia, mild to moderate thrombocytopenia, and mild anemia. serum biochemical abnormalities included high alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase activities and high bilirubin concentration; hypoalbuminemia and prolonged coagulation values were also reported. abdominal radiography revealed hepatomegaly, poor abdominal detail, a hepatic mass, or splenomegaly in 9 dogs. thoracic radiography revealed alveolar consolidation or mixed bronchial/interstitial pulmonary patterns in 6 dogs. hypoechoic, heteroechoic, or hyperechoic masses were identified in all dogs in which ultrasonography was performed. escherichia coli, clostridium sp, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus  sp, staphylococcus epidermidis, and s intermedius were the most common bacteria isolated from hepatic abscesses. concurrent infections were identified in the biliary tract, spleen, blood, endocardium, lung, prostate gland, peritoneum, lymph nodes, salivary gland, or brain of several dogs. seven dogs died or were euthanatized before definitive treatment could be initiated. one dog was successfully treated with antibiotics and was alive 12 months after medical treatment. six dogs were treated surgically (ie, full or partial liver lobectomy, drainage, abdominal lavage) and medically (ie, antibiotic administration). five of these dogs survived and were alive 12 months after surgery. ultrasonography was used to monitor response to treatment in several dogs. clinical implications: hepatic abscesses are rare in dogs, but the clinical signs and clinicopathologic  findings are similar to other inflammatory hepatic disease. ultrasonography revealed abnormalities in all animals in which imaging studies were performed, and was successfully used to monitor response to treatment in several dogs. medical and surgical treatments were used successfully to treat hepatic abscesses in dogs.

TI  == transcriptional induction and expression of the endoglucanase cela gene from a ruminal clostridium sp. ("c. longisporum").
AB  == northern (rna) blot analysis of rna from clostridium sp. revealed induction of transcription of the cela gene when barley beta-glucan was used as carbon source, while no cela mrna was detected after growth on cellobiose. western blots (immunoblots), prepared by using a rabbit antiserum raised against cela protein purified from escherichia coli, revealed the extracellular location of cela in clostridium sp. despite the absence of detectable cela mrna, significant quantities of cela were detected in the culture supernatant during growth on cellobiose. this finding indicated a low constitutive expression of cela. a 6.7-fold increase in the total beta-glucanase specific activity in the extracellular fraction was observed during growth on beta-glucan. the transcriptional start site of cela was mapped by extension and was found to be the same in clostridium sp. and in e. coli expressing the cloned cela gene. a consensus e. coli -10 promoter region (aataat), but not a -35 promoter region, could be identified. two direct repeats (tattgaatttat) separated by 15 nucleotides flank the region where the consensus -35 promoter regions would have  been. the size of the cela mrna transcript corresponded with the size of the open reading frame. a potential stem-loop structure was found 18 nucleotides downstream of the 3' stop codon, which could be responsible for termination of transcription.

TI  == bacteroides infections in children.
AB  == from 1974 to 1990, 336 bacteroides isolates were obtained from 312 specimens from 274 patients. they comprised 180 (54%) b. fragilis isolates, 55 (16%) b. theta-iotaomicron, 36 (11%) b. vulgatus, 34 (10%) b. distasonis, 21 (6%) b. ovatus and 10 (3%) b. uniformis. infections in 253 (92%) patients were polymicrobial, but in 21 (8%) children, a bacteroides sp. was isolated in pure culture. most bacteroides isolates were from peritoneal fluid (114), abscesses (110), wound infections (20), blood cultures (10) and from patients with pneumonia (14) or chronic otitis media (8). predisposing conditions were present  in 145 (53%) children; these were previous surgery (46), trauma (28), malignancy  (21), prematurity (19), immunodeficiency (18), steroid therapy (12) foreign body  (10), diabetes (9) and sickle cell disease (7). the micro-organisms isolated most commonly mixed with bacteroides spp. were anaerobic cocci (221), escherichia coli (122), fusobacterium spp. (38) and clostridium spp. (30). all patients received antimicrobial therapy in conjunction with surgical drainage or correction of pathology in 197 (72%) cases. all but 12 (5%) patients recovered. these data illustrate the importance of bacteroides spp. in infections in children.

TI  == clinical features and aerobic and anaerobic microbiological characteristics of cellulitis.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the aerobic and anaerobic microbiological characteristics of cellulitis and correlate them with the infection site. design: of 342 specimens, 64 obtained using needle aspiration and 278 using swabs were studied over 10 years. results: bacterial growth was noted in 15 (23%) of the 64  needle aspirates and 259 (93%) of the 278 swab aspirates. the microbial results of the 15 specimens obtained through needle aspiration are separately presented.  aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 138 (53%) of swab samples, anaerobic bacteria only in 69 (27%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 52 (20%). in total, there were 582 isolates, 247 aerobic or facultative and 335 anaerobic bacteria, with an average of 2.2 isolates per specimen. the predominance of certain isolates in different anatomical sites correlated with their distribution in the normal flora adjacent to the infected site. the highest recovery rates of anaerobes was from the neck, trunk, groin, external genitalia,  and leg areas. aerobes outnumbered anaerobes in the arm and hand. the predominant aerobes were staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococci, and escherichia coli. the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp, bacteroides fragilis group, prevotella and porphyromonas sp, and clostridium sp. certain clinical findings correlated with the following organisms: swelling and tenderness with clostridium sp, prevotella sp, s aureus, and group a streptococci; regional adenopathy with b fragilis group; bulbous lesions with enterobacteriaceae; gangrene and necrosis with peptostreptococcus sp, b fragilis group, clostridium sp, and enterobacteriaceae; foul odor with bacteroides sp; and gas in tissues with peptostreptococcus sp, b fragilis group and clostridium sp. certain predisposing  conditions correlated with the following organisms: trauma with clostridium sp; diabetes with bacteroides sp, enterobacteriaceae, and s aureus; and burn with pseudomonas aeruginosa. conclusion: these data highlight the polymicrobial nature of cellulitis.

TI  == necrotizing enterocolitis in the extremely low birth weight infant.
AB  == improved neonatal management has resulted in an enlarging population of extremely low birth weight (elbw) infants. these infants have a high incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) and a high mortality rate. the authors compared two groups of nec patients: elbw infants (< 1,000 g and/or < or = 28 weeks' gestation) and "standard" premature infants (29 to 36 weeks' gestation). nec was  classified according to the extent of bowel involvement: (1) focal, (2) diffuse,  or (3) pan involvement (pan necrosis). clinical laboratory, radiological, pathological, and bacteriologic findings, management, and mortality were analyzed. there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to gender, race, delivery mode, or incidence of prenatal or perinatal problems. the most common presenting signs in both groups were abdominal distension, vomiting, and feeding intolerance. the onset of signs and the time of first feedings were significantly later in the elbw group. pneumatosis was the most frequent initial radiological finding (60% of the elbw group, 75% of the premature group). portal vein air (pva) was present in 29% of the elbw and premature infants. seventy-one percent of elbw infants with pva had pan involvement, versus 40% of premature infants (p < .05). there were significant differences in the peritoneal cultures between the groups. the premature group had significantly more escherichia coli (54% v 23%). the elbw group had a wider variety of microorganisms (eg, clostridium sp, pseudomonas sp, and yeast). survival was significantly higher for the premature group (84% v 55%). the mortality rate was 93% when pan involvement was present in the elbw group.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == effect of different combinations of antibiotics on experimental septic peritonitis in rabbits.
AB  == this study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of different combinations of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of experimental septic peritonitis. two hundred rabbits, divided into ten groups of 20 rabbits each, were used. septic peritonitis was provoked in two stages: treatment of animals by mechanical lavage or antibiotics was performed during the first stage; blood cultures, isolation and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the peritoneal cavity were performed during the second stage. the parameters assessed were survival and, in the second phase, the formation of peritoneal abscesses. the most significant finding was noted in the first phase, where diffuse peritonitis took  place, with a very high mortality rate due to bacteremia and sepsis. in both blood and pus from the peritoneal cavity cultures in all groups, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis (among the aerobes) and bacteroides fragilis, clostridium sp. and peptostreptococcus sp. (among anaerobes) were the predominant pathogens identified. high mortality rates appeared to be due to the aerobic microbes, particularly escherichia coli, whereas abscess formation was related to the anaerobes, particularly bacteroides  fragilis. all antibiotics tested were effective, whether alone or in combination. metronidazole, however, was the most effective in the reduction of intraabdominal abscesses. the lowest mortality rate was observed in animals injected with piperacillin and a combination of cefoxitin and an aminoglycoside with metronidazole. finally, good peritoneal lavage seemed to be as effective as any combination of antibiotic treatment.

AB  == a genomic library of clostridium sp. ('c. longisporum') atcc 49440 in the host escherichia coli was screened for endo-beta-glucanases, and plasmids pcm64 and pcm4 were isolated. the nucleotide sequence of a 3620 bp fragment was found to contain a 1548 bp open reading frame (orf), termed cela, which encodes an endo-(1-->4)-beta-glucanase, cela, assigned to family a4. n-terminal amino acid sequence determination revealed that pcm64 encoded the full-length cela gene, including a signal sequence, while pcm4 carried a 5'-truncated cela gene expressed as an n-terminal fusion protein, cela delta n', without a signal sequence. cela was secreted into the periplasm in e. coli. in this organism, proteolytic cleavage of cela at or near a putative linker region resulted in the  appearance of two active polypeptides of molecular masses 57 and 47 kda. the former was the full-length enzyme while the latter consisted of the catalytic domain from which the cellulose-binding domain (cbd) had been removed (cela delta cbd). the intracellularly-located cela delta n' was not subject to proteolytic degradation. the ph and temperature optima of cela were ph 4.8 and 43 degrees c,  respectively. cela hydrolysed barley beta-glucan, lichenan, carboxymethylcellulose and xylan. it showed preferential activity against the larger cellooligosaccharides (cellohexaose and cellopentaose); cellotetraose was  the smallest substrate degraded completely.

AB  == tissue cultures from perforations of the lower intestinal tract commonly yield both aerobes (coliform organisms) and anaerobes (bacteroides sp. and clostridium  sp.). to determine the consistency of this pattern and the value of intraoperative cultures, the authors reviewed the hospital records of 115 patients with perforation of the appendix (100 patients) or colon (15 patients),  treated between 1987 and 1990, in whom organisms were cultured from tissue samples taken intraoperatively. attention was paid to the organisms cultured, their distribution and antibiotic sensitivity in initial samples and in subsequent samples obtained when there were septic complications. on average, 4.7 bacterial isolates per patient were obtained. the common organisms were as expected: bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli and clostridium sp. although the culture results did not affect the management of these patients, the sensitivity  of bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin was found to be lower than expected, indicating a shift in sensitivity.

TI  == sequence and expression of the gene encoding the corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein from clostridium thermoaceticum and reconstitution of the recombinant protein to  full activity.
AB  == the corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein (c/fe-sp) from clostridium thermoaceticum acts  as a methyl group carrier in the anaerobic acetyl-coa pathway of co and co2 fixation. consisting of a small (approximately 33 kda) and a large (approximately 55 kda) subunit, the c/fe-sp contains 1 mol of cobalt in a corrinoid cofactor and 1 mol of [4fe-4s]2+/1+ cluster/mol of alpha beta dimer. cobalt is the site of methylation, and the [4fe-4s] center appears to serve an electron transfer function. the genes encoding both subunits have been cloned previously and are located within a gene cluster that includes other genes required for co2 fixation by anaerobic bacteria. when the genes encoding the c/fe-sp were expressed in escherichia coli, the protein was found to be inactive. we report the amino acid  sequences of the large and small subunits of the c/fe-sp based on the dna sequences of the cloned genes. the [4fe-4s] cluster was found to be located in the large subunit. although the primary structural lattice for cobamide binding resides in the small subunit, both subunits are required for formation of a stable cobamide-binding protein. based on sequence comparisons with other [4fe-4s]-containing proteins, 3 of the 4 cysteine residues that serve as ligands  to the iron sites in the cluster have been located. the two subunits were independently overexpressed in e. coli to a level of 30-50% of cell protein; however, the resulting protein was inactive, lacked stoichiometric amounts of fe-s cluster, and lacked cobamide. by combining the recombinant subunits, unfolding them with urea, and refolding in the presence of cobamide, iron, and inorganic sulfide, the resulting c/fe-sp was found to contain stoichiometric amounts of cobamide and [4fe-4s] cluster and had spectroscopic and enzymatic properties similar to those of the native protein. we expect that the methods developed here may be used for heterologous overexpression and reconstitution of  other complex metalloenzymes. the c/fe-sp was found to utilize with equal efficiency either vitamin b12 or the natural cofactor 5-methoxybenzimidazolylcobamide as a methyl carrier.

AB  == the catalytic domain of mature clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase e (ege') and derivatives of the enzyme fused to prokaryote and eukaryote signal peptides (sp), were produced in chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells and escherichia coli. all three forms of the endoglucanase were secreted into the periplasm of escherichia coli, but only derivatives of the enzyme containing an n-terminal sp  were exported from cho cells. extracellular ege', purified from e. coli and cho cultures, displayed similar properties suggesting that glycosylation of the enzyme in the eukaryote did not significantly alter the protein's properties. data presented in this report indicate that mature ege' contains secretion signals which are recognised only by the e. coli protein export apparatus, suggesting that there are differences in the recognition of certain secretion signals in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. as mature ege' does not contain secretion  signals recognised by the mammalian cell, membrane translocation of the bacterial cellulase in a higher eukaryote is directed by an n-terminal prokaryotic sp.

TI  == [studies on the locality and the function of spirosome in bacterial cells: relationship between the production of spirosome and anaerobic glycolysis].
AB  == the locality and the function of spirosome were studied by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) and electron microscopy in  peptostreptococcus productus, clostridium sp. hd-17, lactobacillus fermentum, eubacterium aerofaciens and escherichia cali b. when the bacterial cells in phosphate buffered saline were disrupted by sonication and fractionated by differential centrifugation, the spirosome protein was found in the cytoplasmic fraction and not in the fraction of cell wall and cell membrane (the envelope fraction). the spirosome protein was found, however, in the envelope fraction when the bacterial cells were treated with a proper concentration of sds. the spirosome protein in the envelope fraction disappeared after treatment with 2% triton x-100 for 2 h. these results suggest that the spirosome protein anchored to the cell membrane upon sds treatment. so it is presumed that the locality of spirosome is close to the cell membrane. spirosome production increased in parallel to the concentration of glucose in the medium in obligate and aerotolerant anaerobes as well as in facultative anaerobes. this result indicates that the spirosome production was induced during the process of anaerobic glycolysis. fructose as the sole carbon source in the minimal medium induced the  spirosome production by e. coli as did glucose, but sodium pyruvate did not induce it either under aerobic or anaerobic condition.

(pmy1 to pmy3). to probe their usefulness, we used one of the plasmids (pmy1) to clone in e. coli a modified form of the cellulase gene (cela) from clostridium thermocellum in which the native signal peptide was replaced in vitro by that from the s-layer gene of t. thermophilus hb8. the hybrid product was expressed and exported by e. coli. when  the gene was transferred by transformation into t. thermophilus, the cellulase protein was also expressed and secreted at 70 degrees c.

AB  == clostridium sp. g0005 produces a cell-bound glucoamylase (cga). the gene encoding cga has been sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequence begins with a putative 21-residue signal sequence for secretion of bacterial lipoproteins, which suggests that a putative cga precursor is modified and secreted like other bacterial lipoproteins in clostridium sp. g0005, and that the modified residue is important in the cell-bound form of mature cga. comparison of the amino acid sequence of the cga precursor with known eukaryotic enzymes showed several regions of high similarity in spite of low similarity throughout the overall primary structure. cga is the first bacterial glucoamylase to be cloned. the cga  gene was expressed in escherichia coli cells with an inducible expression plasmid, in which the 5' non-coding region and the n-terminal coding region of the gene were replaced with the lac promoter. kinetic studies of the cloned enzyme purified from e. coli were performed with a set of linear malto-oligosaccharides as substrates, and the subsite affinity was calculated from the kinetic parameters. cga had typical kinetic properties for a glucoamylase, but this bacterial enzyme had higher isomaltose-hydrolyzing activity than other eukaryotic glucoamylases.

TI  == [bacterial translocation in a model of intestinal obstruction. ii. bacteriological study and role of cellular immunity].
AB  == bacterial translocation (bt) from the gastrointestinal (gi) tract to systemic organs creates the possibility of infection and sepsis in a great number of pathologic entities. in a mouse model of intestinal obstruction (io), we evaluated the type of micro-organisms and the organs that bacteria frequent translocated. at 24 hours post-10, positive cultures where obtained at the mln, portal, systemic circulation and peritoneal cavity, establishing that the translocation is bi-directional. the more frequent bacteria isolated were the streptococcus group d, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp., an clostridium. bt occurs at 24 hour post-oi and was due to increased intestinal permeability, at 48 hrs bt increased and related to the physical disruption of the mucosal barrier in the intestinal mucosa. cell mediated immunity (cmi) response in this model was not altered, although a progressive decrease was observed at 48 hrs it was not significant, suggesting that the cmi play no role in the pathogenesis of bt. in the control-laparotomy group, cmi response was increased significantly at 48 hours, suggesting that a simple laparotomy boost the immune defense response.

TI  == molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding an endo-1,4-beta-glucanase from bacillus sp. ksm-330.
AB  == the gene encoding an acid endo-1,4-beta-glucanase from bacillus sp. ksm-330 was cloned into the hindiii site of pbr322 and expressed in escherichia coli hb101. the recombinant plasmid contained a 3.1 kb hindiii insert, 1.8 kb of which was sufficient for the expression of endoglucanase activity in e. coli hb101. nucleotide sequencing of this region (1816 bp) revealed an open reading frame of  1389 bp. the protein deduced from this sequence was composed of 463 amino acids with an mr of 51882. the deduced amino acid sequence from amino acids 56 through  75 coincided with the amino-terminal sequence of the endoglucanase, endo-k, purified from culture of bacillus sp. ksm-330. the deduced amino acid sequence of endo-k had 30% homology with that of the cela enzyme from clostridium thermocellum ncib 10682 and 25% homology with that of the enzyme from cellulomonas uda cb4. however, the endo-k protein exhibited no homology with respect to either the nucleotide or the amino acid sequences of other endoglucanases from bacillus that had been previously characterized. these results indicate that the gene for endo-k in bacillus sp. ksm-330 has evolved from an ancestral gene distinct from that of other bacillus endoglucanases.

TI  == electron microscopic analysis and biochemical characterization of a novel methanol dehydrogenase from the thermotolerant bacillus sp. c1.
AB  == methanol dehydrogenase from the thermotolerant bacillus sp. c1 was studied by electron microscopy and image processing. two main projections can be distinguished: one exhibits 5-fold symmetry and has a diameter of 15 nm, the other is rectangular with sides of 15 and 9 nm. subsequent image processing showed that the 5-fold view possesses mirror symmetry. the rectangular views can  be divided into two separate classes, one of which has 2-fold rotational symmetry. it is concluded that methanol dehydrogenase is a decameric molecule, and a tentative model is presented. the estimated molecular weight is 430,000, based on a subunit molecular weight of 43,000. the enzyme contains one zinc and one to two magnesium ions per subunit. n-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed substantial similarity with alcohol dehydrogenases from saccharomyces cerevisiae, zymomonas mobilis, clostridium acetobutylicum, and escherichia coli,  which contain iron or zinc but no magnesium. in view of the aberrant structural and kinetic properties, it is proposed to distinguish the enzyme from common alcohol dehydrogenases (ec 1.1.1.1) by using the name nad-dependent methanol dehydrogenase.

TI  == oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  == two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (peptostreptococcus (1); eubacterium (9); clostridium (6); veillonella (6); megasphera (1); bacteroides (28); fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (p. anaerobius (1); e. fossor (9); c. villosum (1); b. fragilis (1); b. tectum (2); b. heparinolyticus (2)). three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (lrt) or paraoral (po) bacterial infections. of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. among the obligately anaerobic species, gram-positive cocci including p. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, e. fossor 11% and other gram-positive rods (excluding  clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. the gram-negative rods comprised b. fragilis 5%, b. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented bacteroides 3% and other bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of fusobacterium (7%), and gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by pasteurella spp. 19%, escherichia coli 17%, actinomyces spp. 9%, streptococcus spp. 9%. incidental facultative isolates were enterococcus spp. 2%, enterobacter cloaceae 2%, actinobacillus spp. 2% and gram-negative corroding rods 5%. on the basis of the similarities (as determined by dna hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. e. fossor and b. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and lrt and po diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of celc307 encoding endoglucanase c307 of clostridium sp. strain f1.
AB  == the celc gene, encoding endoglucanase c, of clostridium thermocellum was recently sequenced while a promoter region was not identified. in this study, the nucleotide sequence of celc307 of clostridium sp. strain f1 was identified and compared with that of the c. thermocellum gene. the open reading frame was composed of 1029 nucleotides and the deduced amino acid sequence corresponded to  a protein of a molecular weight of 40,905. we identified promoter sequences (tggaca and tataat) at a position about 150 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon. six substitutions were found in the coding region, 3 leading to amino acid replacements. five substitutions and 1 deletion of a nucleotide were found in the region upstream of the initiation codon, 1 present at the promoter sequence. overproduction of endoglucanase c307 (egc307) in escherichia coli strongly inhibited the cell growth of the host strain. around 50% of egc307 produced in e. coli was detected in the periplasmic fraction. the n-terminal amino acid sequence suggested that this protein was exported into the periplasm without processing of a signal peptide.

TI  == a randomized prospective study of ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with or without teicoplanin as an empiric antibiotic regimen for febrile neutropenic patients.
AB  == febrile neutropenic patients were randomized to receive ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with the addition of teicoplanin in cases with clinical suspicion of a hickman line-associated infection. at 48 h both clinical and bacteriological analyses were made. patients were categorized as: success, in cases of improvement or stability in the clinical condition; failure, if there was a deterioration of the clinical condition; and non-evaluable, in cases of protocol  violation or death due to other causes. a total of 86 patients have completed the study so far; 43 patients were randomized to the ceftazidime and 43 to the ciprofloxacin group. teicoplanin was added to the monotherapy in 12 patients in the ceftazidime group and 15 in the ciprofloxacin group. the diagnoses were: acute myelogenous leukaemia (25), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (34), hodgkin's disease  (17); acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (9) and chronic granulocytic leukaemia (1). forty-eight hour clinical assessment showed a response rate in the ceftazidime group of: success 18/31 (58%), failure 13/31 (42%); in the ceftazidime and teicoplanin group: success 8/12 (67%), failure 4/12 (33%); in the ciprofloxacin group: success 23/28 (82%), failure 5/28 (18%); and in the ciprofloxacin and teicoplanin group: success 11/15 (73%), failure 4/15 (27%). blood cultures were positive in 48/86 (56%) cases, with more than one organism isolated in seven of these 48 cases. organisms isolated were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (20), escherichia coli (13), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), staphylococcus aureus (3), diphtheroids (3), klebsiella sp. (3), enterobacter cloacae (2), streptococcus faecalis (2), ent. adenocarboxylata (1), clostridium septicum (1). strept. b (1), alpha streptococcus (1) and p. fluorescens (1), in-vitro testing showed that all  gram-positive organisms were sensitive to teicoplanin, and gram-negative organisms to ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime. there were seven cases of superimposed infections with eight organisms isolated, all cases occurring in patients receiving ciprofloxacin alone: coagulase-negative staphylococci (4), strep. sangius (1), strep. viridans (1), diphtheroids (1) and p. maltophilia (1). both ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime are comparable in efficacy as empirical monotherapy for febrile neutropenic patients. there is, however, a significant increase in the incidence of superimposed infection in patients receiving only ciprofloxacin. in view of the very high incidence of gram-positive septicaemia, we suggest that  teicoplanin should be added as part of the initial empiric antibiotic regimen in  all febrile neutropenic patients.

TI  == cloning, sequencing, and expression of the genes encoding the adenosylcobalamin-dependent ethanolamine ammonia-lyase of salmonella typhimurium.
AB  == ethanolamine ammonia-lyase is a bacterial enzyme that catalyzes the adenosylcobalamin-dependent conversion of certain vicinal amino alcohols to oxo compounds and ammonia. studies of ethanolamine ammonia-lyase from clostridium sp. and escherichia coli have suggested that the enzyme is a heterodimer composed of  subunits of mr approximately 55,000 and 35,000. using a partial sau3a salmonella  typhimurium library ligated into pbr328 and selecting by complementation of a mutant lacking ethanolamine ammonia-lyase activity, we have cloned the genes for  the 2 subunits of the s. typhimurium enzyme. the genes were localized to a 6.5-kilobase fragment of s. typhimurium dna, from which they could be expressed in e. coli under noninducing conditions. sequencing of a 2526-base pair portion of this 6.5-kilobase dna fragment revealed two open reading frames separated by 21 base pairs. the open reading frames encoded proteins of 452 and 286 residues whose derived n-terminal sequences were identical to the n-terminal sequences of  the 2 subunits of the e. coli ethanolamine ammonia-lyase, except that residue 16  of the large subunit was asparagine in the e. coli sequence and aspartic acid in  the s. typhimurium sequence.

TI  == relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  == bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with  bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. we obtained semen samples from 37  men attending a special infertility clinic and assessed the relationship between  seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. one hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. the microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), peptostreptococcus sp (62%), bacteroides sp (27%), gardnerella vaginalis (19%), lactobacillus sp (16%), actinomyces sp (16%), enterococcus (11%), and veillonella (11%). other microorganisms including group b streptococcus, hemophilus, escherichia coli, mobiluncus, and clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. when the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (p greater  than .05 for each comparison). the proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == six patients with chronic relapsing diarrhoea caused by clostridium difficile were treated with rectal instillation of homologous faeces (one patient) or a mixture of ten different facultatively aerobic and anaerobic bacteria diluted in  sterile saline (five patients). the mixture led to a prompt loss of cl difficile  and its toxin from the stools and to bowel colonisation by bacteroides sp, which  had not been present in pre-treatment stool samples. strains of escherichia coli, cl bifermentans, and peptostreptococcus productus in the mixture inhibited the in-vitro growth of cl difficile, which in turn inhibited the growth of bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides vulgatus, and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. the finding that bacteroides sp had been absent during the patients' illness but was  present after recovery suggests that the absence of bacteroides sp may result in  chronic relapsing cl difficile diarrhoea, and that its presence may prevent colonisation by cl difficile.

TI  == production of a unique cytotoxin by campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is an important diarrheal pathogen worldwide; the mechanisms by which it causes disease remain unclear. because of its association with inflammatory diarrhea, we postulated that c. jejuni might produce a cytotoxin similar to that produced by shigella sp., enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157, or clostridium difficile. filtrates of 12 polymyxin-treated isolates of c.  jejuni were placed on hela cells (sensitive to shiga toxin cytotoxicity) and chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells. of 12 isolates of c. jejuni tested, 5 killed 50% of the cells at greater than or equal to 1:4 dilutions of filtered suspensions of 10(9) bacteria per ml; killing was similar in hela and cho cells (the cho cells being insensitive to shiga cytotoxin). one isolate produced a titer of 1:32 to 1:128. the relative potency in hela cells was comparable to that of e. coli strains that produce intermediate amounts of shiga-like toxin. the other seven strains showed no cytotoxic effect, nor did the control diluents, polymyxin b, or supernatants of c. jejuni not treated with polymyxin b. sonication also released active cytotoxin, but slightly less well than did polymyxin. the cytotoxic effect was dose dependent. concentration of the c. jejuni in suspension by 10-fold before treatment with polymyxin b resulted in a 10-fold increase in the 50% cytotoxic dose. the cytotoxin effect was not neutralized by shiga toxin immune serum against either shiga-like toxin i or ii or by anti-clostridium difficile antiserum. the c jejuni cytotoxin was partially  labile to trypsin (0.25%) and to heating to greater than or equal to 60 degrees c. cytotoxicity was retained in scientific products dialysis tubing d1615-1 (mr cutoff, 12,000 to 14,000). some isolates of c. jejuni release a substance lethal  to hela or cho cells in vitro that is distinct from shiga-like or clostridium difficile toxin. this cytotoxin may contribute to the colonic mucosal invasive process that characterizes c. jejuni enteritis.

AB  == norfloxacin (nflx), a synthetic oral antibacterial agent of quinolone carboxylic  acid, was given orally for 5 full days at a dose of 200 mg, three times daily after each meal to healthy normal men with ages between 22 and 25 years weighing  53.0 to 84.0 kg (average 67.0 kg). the actual regimen followed was that the drug  was administered twice after lunch and supper on the first day of dosing, and once after breakfast on the last day of dosing. on the 5th day before the start of dosing, on the first, 3rd and 5th days (last dosing day) of dosing, and on the 3rd, 5th, 10th and 20th days after the end of dosing, effects of the drug on the  fecal flora were examined and its fecal levels were determined. susceptibilities  against nflx and nalidixic acid (na) of various fecal isolates from 7 men were determined. adverse effects and influences on clinical laboratory tests were also examined. the results obtained are summarized below. 1. following the drug administration, a transient decrease or disappearance of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., citrobacter sp. and enterobacter sp. of enterobacteriaceae was noted. the 3 strains other than e. coli were isolated from increasing number of cases after the end of dosing. no constant trend was observed in the isolation of proteus sp. organisms belong to enterobacteriaceae were isolated only in 4 and 2  cases after 3 and 5 days of the start of dosing, respectively, but then gradually increased to the predose level. among other gram-negative bacteria, no constant trend was noted in the isolation frequency of plesiomonas sp. pseudomonas sp. was isolated from 6 and 5 cases on the 3rd day after dosing and on the 3rd day after  the end of dosing, respectively; the frequency of isolation increased after dosing. gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus sp. were isolated with a reduced frequency on the 3rd day of dosing. however, the number of isolates increased in all cases both on the 5th day of dosing and on the 3rd day after the end of dosing, and then decreased. no change was noticed in the number of isolates of enterococcus sp., and no constant trend was observed for micrococcus  sp. and ylo. the average count of the whole aerobic bacteria did not change. some strains decreased significantly after the start of dosing. 2. among anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis and other bacteroides were isolated on every test day.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == antimicrobial substance from a human lactobacillus strain.
AB  == lactobacillus sp. strain gg, which was isolated from the feces of a normal person, produced a substance with potent inhibitory activity against a wide range of bacterial species. it inhibited anaerobic bacteria (clostridium spp., bacteroides spp., bifidobacterium spp.), members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas spp. staphylococcus spp., and streptococcus spp., as demonstrated by a microbiological assay; however, it did not inhibit other lactobacilli. the inhibitory activity occurred between ph 3 and 5 and was heat stable. bactericidal activity against escherichia coli was demonstrated at a dilution of 1:128. the inhibitory substance was distinct from lactic and acetic acids. it had a low molecular weight (less than 1,000) and was soluble in acetone-water (10:1). because of these characteristics, the inhibitory material could not be considered a bacteriocin; it most closely resembled a microcin, which has been associated previously with members of the family enterobacteriaceae.

AB  == the activities of four enzymes (beta-glucuronidase, nitrate reductase and nitroreductase) in selected intestinal bacteria (escherichia coli, clostridium sp., streptococcus sp., bacteroides sp. and lactobacillus salivarius) were measured after growth in vitro and in vivo. the five strains differed in their activities with clostridium sp. being the most active for beta-glucosidase, beta-glucuronidase and nitroreductase, and e. coli the most active producer of nitrate reductase. enzyme activity in vivo tended to be higher than in vitro but  there were instances where the comparative activities were reversed.

TI  == the primary structure of thioredoxin from the filamentous cyanobacterium anabaena sp. 7119.
AB  == thioredoxin from the cyanobacterium anabaena 7119 serves as electron donor to ribonucleotide reductase and as a protein disulfide reductase. this small, heat-stable protein was found to have structural and functional similarities to thioredoxins from both bacterial and mammalian sources. we here report the complete primary structure of anabaena thioredoxin. the structure was determined  by analysis of peptides obtained after cleavage with cyanogen bromide, staphylococcus aureus protease, and trypsin. the protein consists of 106 residues with the following amino acid sequence: ser-ala-ala-ala-gln-val-thr-asp- ser-thr-phe-lys-gln-glu-val-leu-asp-ser-asp-val-pro-val-leu-val-asp-phe- trp-ala-pro-trp-cys-gly-pro-cys-arg-met-val-ala-pro-val-val-asp-glu- ile-ala-gln-gln-tyr-glu-gly-lys-ile-lys-val-val-lys-val-asn-thr-asp- glu-asn-pro-gln-val-ala-ser-gln-tyr-gly-ile-arg-ser-ile-pro-thr-leu- met-ile-phe-lys-gly-gly-gln-lys-val-asp-met-val-val-gly-ala-val-pro- lys-thr-thr-leu-ser-gln-thr-leu-glu-lys-his-leu. the sequence of anabaena thioredoxin shows a definite homology to the protein from escherichia coli, with  49% residue identities occurring in the proteins when aligned at the active site  disulfide.

TI  == in vitro effects of sulphasalazine, azodisal sodium, and their metabolites on clostridium difficile and some other faecal bacteria.
AB  == the effects of sulphasalazine (sasp), azodisal sodium (ads), and their metabolites were tested in vitro on aerobic and anaerobic faecal bacterial strains. sulphapyridine (sp) had a mild to moderate effect on escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis. sasp also had a growth-inhibitory effect on strep. faecalis. the other substances had no effect on the aerobic strains. sasp, sp, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and, to a certain extent, n-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid exerted a growth-inhibitory effect on the anaerobic strains. of special interest  was the inhibitory effect on clostridium difficile strains. in recent years the possibility that overgrowth of cl. difficile could cause flare-ups of inflammatory bowel disease has been discussed. some studies suggested that sasp treatment could predispose to cl. difficile superinfection, whereas others found  sasp more probable to exert a prophylactic effect. our findings support the theory that sasp treatment reduces rather than promotes the risk of cl. difficile superinfection.

AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.

TI  == etiology of acute infectious diarrhea in a highly industrialized area of switzerland.
AB  == during an 18-mo period between 1981 and 1982, a prospective study was conducted in 119 adult patients with acute diarrhea. a diarrhea-inducing microorganism or toxin could be identified in 38.7% of the patients. salmonella sp and campylobacter jejuni were the leading agents that caused diarrheal illness in 25% of the investigated population. clostridium difficile was found in 6%, mainly after previous antibiotic therapy. rotavirus was rarely isolated and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli were not found. clinical features in patients in whom an invasive agent was isolated did not differ from those in patients in whom no enteropathogens were found, although the occurrence of fecal leukocytes and positive hemoccult tests in the former group was significantly more frequent. more than 30% of the patients with negative stool cultures, however, showed fecal leukocytes and positive occult blood, which is suggestive of the existence of one or more invasive agent(s) so far unknown or not recognized.

TI  == development of the normal gastrointestinal microflora of specific pathogen-free chickens.
AB  == the development of the normal intestinal microflora of the small intestine, caecum and large intestine of specific pathogen-free (spf) chickens, was studied  in the period from hatching to 84 days of age. no bacteria were detected in any of the sites at hatchery (day 1), but by day 3 significant levels of faecal streptococci and coliforms were isolated from all sites. the flora of the small intestine was limited to faecal streptococci and coliforms for the first 40 days  and then lactobacilli became established and dominated the flora. a large variety of facultative and strictly anaerobic organisms colonized the caecum. many of these species were transient and were only present for a limited period; after 40 days the flora stabilized to consist predominantly of faecal streptococci, escherichia coli, bacteroides spp. and lactobacillus sp. the flora of the large intestine was composed of organisms also present in the small intestine or the caecum. these findings differ from previously published studies on conventionally reared chickens in that the number of species isolated and the population levels  of organisms are much lower. this probably reflects the absence of continuous environmental challenge to the chickens because of the housing and feeding facilities in which the chickens were maintained.

TI  == motility as a factor in bowel colonization by roseburia cecicola, an obligately anaerobic bacterium from the mouse caecum.
AB  == roseburia cecicola strain gm is a motile obligate anaerobe that was isolated from mouse caecal mucosa. twenty-five strains of motility mutants were obtained from populations of strain gm (wild-type) that had been exposed to uv light. unlike gm cells, mutant bacteria were either non-motile and non-flagellated (fla-) or migrated slowly or atypically in semi-solid medium. strain gm and two mutant strains, sls (fla-) and wes (atypically motile), were used in mouse colonization  experiments. in separate experiments, each strain colonized (4.8 x 10(9) to 1.5 x 10(10) c.f.u. per g caecum) the caecum of germfree mice inoculated intragastrically with pure cultures of the bacteria. in mice mono-associated with either mutant strain, bacteria which were non-motile or atypically motile predominated in their caeca (greater than 99% of total bacteria recovered). in mice mono-associated with motile cells of strain gm, mutant strains which had lost wild-type motility became predominant in the caecal populations (97% of total bacteria recovered at 48 to 70 days after inoculation). mice mono-associated with either strain sls or strain gm were colonized by one strain  each of escherichia coli, candida pintolopesii, a bacteroides sp., and a clostridium sp. most (99%) of the r. cecicola cells recovered from the caeca of these animals had typical wild-type motility. motility, although not essential for r. cecicola to colonize germfree mice, is apparently advantageous to this bacterium when other micro-organisms are present with it in the mouse caecum. motility may thus be essential for r. cecicola to colonize conventional laboratory mice.

TI  == bacterial translocation from the gastrointestinal tracts of rats receiving thermal injury.
AB  == rats receiving nonlethal thermal burns over 20 or 40% of their total body surface area were tested at various intervals for the translocation of indigenous bacteria from their gastrointestinal tracts to their mesenteric lymph nodes, peritoneal cavities, and bloodstreams. no indigenous bacteria were cultured from  these organs of control rats or from rats receiving 20% burns. however, 44% of the rats receiving 40% burns exhibited viable escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus sp. and clostridium sp. in their mesenteric lymph nodes 2 days after thermal injury. bacterial translocation after burn stress also was tested in antibiotic-decontaminated rats monoassociated with e. coli. e. coli attained population levels in these animals of 10(8) to 10(9) per g cecum. e. coli translocated to 100% of the mesenteric lymph nodes of both the control and 40% burned rats. however, e. coli translocated at a greater incidence to the spleens, livers, and peritoneal cavities of the burned rats compared with translocation to these organs in control rats. the numbers of e. coli translocating to the mesenteric lymph nodes, spleens, and livers also were greater in the 40% burned rats than in control rats. by 14 days after thermal injury, the rats were able to clear e. coli from their spleens and livers, and the infection remained localized in the mesenteric lymph nodes. these results support the concept that the indigenous gastrointestinal flora or exogenous organisms colonizing the gastrointestinal tract are potential sources of septicemia after thermal injury.

TI  == controlled cell disruption: a comparison of the forces required to disrupt different micro-organisms.
AB  == a cell disrupter has been developed which can measure the forces required to disrupt both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. it operates a continuous process and will disrupt both large and small volumes. shear forces are set up when a suspension under laminar flow conditions is released under high pressure through  a short orifice. if the applied pressure is altered, the shear forces are simultaneously changed so that the amount of cell disruption can be compared under different known and repeatable conditions. the disrupter is now manufactured and supplied by stansted fluid power limited, stansted, england. phase-contrast microscopy has shown that the disrupter will break a variety of organisms including chlorella, aspergillus fumigatis, fusarium sp., saccharomyces cerevisiae, escherichia coli, lactobacillus casei, bacillus subtilis, clostridium perfringens, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus zooepidermicus and staphylococcus aureus. the cells are not all broken at one pressure but a certain pressure must be applied before disruption starts which will then increase rapidly as the applied pressure is increased. the applied pressure required to disrupt half the population in a culture is different from one species to another, rods being disrupted more easily than spheres. the case of disruption seems to be related to the shape and chemical composition of the cell wall. furthermore, the disrupting process, in an unsynchronized culture is not random and may be related to the statistical size distribution of the cells.

AB  == 1. the 120-fold purification of ethanolamine ammonia-lyase from escherichia coli  extracts, to apparent homogeneity, is described. ethanolamine, dithiothreitol, glycerol and kcl protected the apoenzyme from inactivation. 2. at the optimum ph7.5, k(m) values for ethanolamine and coenzyme b(12) were 44mum and 0.42mum respectively. the k(m) for ethanolamine was markedly affected by ph, transitions  occurring at ph7.0 and 8.35. 3. the enzyme was specific for ethanolamine as substrate, none of the 18 analogues tested being active. l-2-aminopropan-l-ol (k(i) 0.86mum), dl-1-aminopropan-2-ol (k(i) 2.2mum) and dl-1,3-diaminopropan-2-ol (k(i) 88.0mum) inhibited competitively. 4. enzyme activity was inhibited, irreversibly and non-competitively, by the coenzyme analogues methylcobalamin (k(i) 1.4nm), hydroxocobalamin (k(i) 2.1nm) and cyanocobalamin (k(i) 4.8nm). 5. iodoacetamide inhibited in the absence of ethanolamine, but only slightly in its  presence. p-hydroxymercuribenzoate inhibited markedly even in the presence of ethanolamine. dithiothreitol and 2-mercaptoethanol (less effectively) restored activity to the enzyme dialysed against buffer containing ethanolamine. 6. although k(+) ions stabilized the enzyme during dialysis or storage, they were not necessary for activity. 7. gel filtration showed the enzyme to be of high molecular weight, ultracentrifugal studies giving s(20,w) of 16.4 and an estimated mol.wt. 560400. the isoelectric point for the apoenzyme was approx. ph5.0. inhibited enzyme activity at concentrations above 1m (95% inhibition at 3m) and sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis indicated protein subunits of mol.wt. 61400. 8. immunological studies showed that the e.coli enzyme was closely related to those of other enterobacteria, but only distantly to that of clostridium sp. a double precipitin band suggested that the  apoenzyme may be made up of two protein components.

TI  == increase in the population of duodenal immunoglobulin a plasmocytes in axenic mice associated with different living or dead bacterial strains of intestinal origin.
AB  == various bacterial strains were tested for their ability to stimulate immunoglobulin a (iga) plasmocytes to populate the duodenal lamina propria in axenic mice. the mice were associated with the strains for at least 4 weeks. the  strains inhabiting the conventional mouse intestine and belonging to the genera lactobacillus, streptococcus, eubacterium, actinobacillus, micrococcus, corynebacterium, and clostridium (including the extremely oxygen-sensitive ones)  are only slightly or nonimmunogenic, whereas the strains belonging to the genera  bacteroides and escherichia have an immunogenic effect. the same result was obtained with bacteroides and escherichia strains isolated from the digestive tract of other animal species. the kinetics of appearance of intestinal iga plasmocytes are similar in axenic mice monoassociated with a stimulatory strain and in conventional mice. the association of two or more strains with axenic mice leads either to the same or a greater number of duodenal iga plasmocytes as that  obtained with the most stimulatory strain monoassociated with axenic mice. the maximum stimulation recorded in all of these trials represents about two-thirds of that observed in conventional mice and was obtained in the duodenum of gnotoxenic mice harboring four bacterial strains isolated from the conventional mouse microflora. the orally administered killed cells of two immunogenic strains, e. coli and bacteroides sp., are as immunogenic as the living cells, provided that their concentration in the digestive tract is sufficient.

AB  == two extremely oxygen-sensitive strains of clostridium sp., designated clostridium e and p, were obtained from digestive microflora of conventional mice and found to constitute a barrier against shigella flexneri sf-2 when associated in vivo with escherichia coli k-12. these and other simplified fractions of the conventional microflora were demonstrated to have an effect comparable to that of the total flora. when k-12 and clostridium e were established in gnotobiotic mice before the introduction of sf-2, the latter was reduced to a level below detection in the digestive tract. whe sf-2 was established first, the antagonistic effect exerted by clostridium e and k-12 was variable and, apparently, related to the rate of establishment of clostridium e. mutants of sf-2 resistant to the barrier effect of clostridium e and k-12 appeared at the end of 3 months when sf-2 was established in gnotobiotic mice alone or with k-12, and after only a week when sf-2 was associated only with clostridium e. these results suggest that the bacterial antagonsim in this model is related to the production in vivo of an antibiotic substance active against sf-2. it appears that the substance may be produced by clostridium e, stimulated by k-12.

AB  == an examination of the fecal microflora of adult swine was made with regard to the efficiency of several roll tube media in enumeration and recovery of anaerobes, the effects of medium constituents on recovery, and the isolation and identification of the predominant kinds of bacteria. total number of organisms by microscopic bacterial counts varied among fecal samples from 4.48 x 10(10) to 7.40 x 10(10) bacteria/g (wet weight). comparison of different nonselective roll  tube media indicated that about 30% of the fecal bacteria could be recovered with a rumen fluid (40%, vol/vol) medium (m98-5). recoveries of 21 and 15%, respectively, were obtained with m10 and rumen fluid-glucose-cellobiose agar (rgca) media. rumen fluid, trypticase, sugars, and co2 gas phase were important components required for maximum recovery with this medium. similar high recoveries of anaerobes were also obtained with m98-5 containing swine cecal extract of place in rumen fluid or m10 plus swine cecal extract. significantly lower recoveries were observed with rcga, media supplemented with swine fecal extracts, reinforced clostridial medium, brain heart infusion agar, and prereduced blood agar. ninety percent of the bacteria isolated from roll tube media were gram positive and consisted of facultatively anaerobic streptococci, eubacterium sp., clostridium sp., and propionibacterium acnes. the remainder of the flora (8%) included several other species of anaerobes and escherichia coli.  rumen fluid (or volatile fatty acids), trypticase, and yeast extract additions to basal media stimulated the growth of anaerobic strains. variation in the relative proportions of the predominant fecal microflora was observed. this work indicates that satisfactory enumeration, isolation and cultivation of the predominant microflora in swine feces can be obtained when strict anaerobic culture methods and a rumen fluid medium are used.

TI  == the reduction of n-hydroxy-4-acetylaminobiphenyl by the intestinal microflora of  the rat.
AB  == the role of the intestinal flora in the conversion of n-hydroxy-4-acetyl-aminobiphenyl (n-oh-aabp) to 4-acetylaminobiphenyl has been examined. this reaction, which reverses the metabolic activation of the parent carcinogen, can be demonstrated in cultures of some bacteria indigenous to the intestinal microflora. these include cultures of clostridium sp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus productus i, and bacteroides fragilis ss. thetaiotaomicron and ss. vulgatus. in contrast, cultures of lactobacillus plantarum and escherichia coli show little or no capacity for this reaction. the  reduction of n-oh-aabp is also carried out by homogenates of liver, kidney, and brain. on a weight basis, the cecal flora is considerably more active in reducing n-oh-aabp than are homogenates of tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. the cecal flora also has a greater activity for reducing n-oh-aabp than the stomach flora, an observation which may relate to the induction of tumors in the forestomach but not in the cecum of rats fed this compound. the products of the metabolism of n-oh-aabp have been compared in germ-free and conventional animals. glucuronide conjugates of n-oh-aabp are found in the cecal contents and feces only of the germ-free rats, while 4-acetylaminobiphenyl is found in the feces only of conventional rats. these results suggest that the flora, by hydrolyzing glucuronides and reducing n-oh-aabp, may influence the level of metabolities of 4-acetylaminobiphenyl which are critical for carcinogenesis.

AB  == the capacity of rats to reduce a 25-mg dose of p-nitrobenzoic acid (pnba) was measured by quantifying the amount of this compound recovered in the urine as p-aminobenzoic acid (paba) and its conjugates. it was found that germfree rats converted approximately 1% of pnba to paba; in conventional rats the conversion was approximately 25%. various bacteria isolated from the rat cecum were selectively associated with germfree rats and it was demonstrated that these bacteria colonized their gastrointestinal tracts. in assoication with lactobacillus plantarum, the conversion of pnba to paba increased to 3.9%. when these rats were further associated with clostridium sp. and streptoccocus faecalis, the conversion increased to approximately 12%. a general correlation was found between the capacity of constituents of the microflora to reduce pnba in vitro and when associated with the germfree rat. cecectomy, which removes a substantial portion of the microflora of the rat, decreases the capacity of the conventional rat to reduce pnba. similar experiments with p-nitrobenzenesulfonamide indicate that this compound is also largely reduced by  the flora. evidence that the reduction of the nitro group in these compounds is carried out by the intestinal microflora explains previous observations in which  the reduction of these compounds in rats did not correlate with the activity of liver enzymes putative for these reactions.

TI  == a review of 105 necropsies in captive baboons (papio cynocephalus).
AB  == in contrast to the findings in newly caught babboons in africa, the leading cause of death in captivity in america was a pneumonia and enteritis complex. bacterial species such as proteus morgani, proteus mirabilis, clostridium sp., pseudomonas  paracolon, pathogenic escherichia coli and cocci have been isolated in association with a pneumoenteric syndrome of 35 newborn baboons, including neonates. the majority of these animals died with pulmonary factors such as anoxia and pneumonia.

TI  == studies on the cecal microflora of commercial broiler chickens.
AB  == a study was made of the cecal microflora isolated from broilers (5-week-old) reared under typical commercial husbandry conditions. three hundred and twenty-five bacterial strains (randomly isolated from colonies representing 49 to 81% of the microscopic count) were isolated from cecal digesta of six animals on  a rumen fluid roll tube medium (m98-5). seventy-seven percent of these strains consisted of strict anaerobes: gram-negative, pleomorphic cocci (5.2%), peptostreptococcus (1.5%), gram-positive rods (36.1% as propionibacterium acnes and eubacterium sp.), gram-negative rods (18.6% as bacteroides clostridiiformis,  b. hypermegas and b. fragilis) and sporeforming rods (15.7% as clostridium sp.).  two types of facultatively anaerobic bacteria (gram-positive cocci and escherichia coli) were also isolated and constituted 17.5% of the remaining flora. the distribution of the bacterial groups isolated from six cecal samples varied considerably. data on the growth requirements of anaerobic strains indicated that many could be cultured in a simple medium consisting of an energy  source, minerals, reducing agent, trypticase, and yeast extract (or a vitamin mixture in place of yeast extract). the growth of some of these bacteria was also enhanced by co(2) and rumen fluid. these preliminary data suggest that some of the more numerous anaerobes isolated from the chicken cecum may not require complex nutrients for growth and, in fact, may be nutritionally similar to rumen  anaerobes.
