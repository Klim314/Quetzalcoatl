TI  == determination of the mode of action of enterolysin a, produced by enterococcus faecalis b9510.
AB  == aim: the current study aimed to visualize the damage caused by enterolysin a to the cells of sensitive strains and to find out cleavage site within the peptidoglycan moiety of bacterial cell walls. methods and results: enterolysin a  produced by a local isolate, enterococcus faecalis b9510 was found to rapidly kill cells of the sensitive strain lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris 2144 during 120 min of treatment as compared to the untreated control where no such effect was observed. transmission electron microscopy of the enterolysin a-treated cells revealed leaking of the cytoplasmic contents ultimately resulting in complete lysis of cell walls. to find the cleavage site, purified cell walls of l. lactis  ssp. cremoris 2144, pediococcus pentosaceus 43201 and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus atcc 11842 were treated with enterolysin a, and liberated amino acids were derivatized for n and c terminals and analysed using thin layer chromatography on silica gel with isopropanol as solvent. the results showed that enterolysin a cleaves the peptide bonds at two locations within peptidoglycan subunits. the first location is between l-alanine and d-glutamic acid of the stem peptide and the other location is between l-lysine of the stem peptide and d-aspartic acid of the interpeptide bridge. conclusions: enterolysin a cleaves the peptide bonds within the stem peptide as well as in the interpeptide bridge of gram-positive bacterial cell walls. this gives a possible reason for the broad spectrum of enterolysin a activity. significance and impact of the study: this is the first report identifying the cleavage site of enterolysin a within the cell walls of sensitive bacteria. this will help in identifying potential applications for enterolysin a.

TI  == the dominant microbial community associated with fermentation of obushera (sorghum and millet beverages) determined by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == obushera includes four fermented cereal beverages from uganda namely: obutoko, enturire, ekitiribita and obuteire, whose microbial diversity has not hitherto been fully investigated. knowledge of the microbial diversity and dynamics in these products is crucial for understanding their safety and development of appropriate starter cultures for controlled industrial processing. culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques including denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and mixed dna sequencing of polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) amplified ribosomal rna genes were used to study the bacteria and  yeast diversity of obushera. the ph dropped from 6.0-4.6 to 3.5-4.0 within 1-2 days for obutoko, enturire and obuteire whereas that of ekitiribita decreased to  4.4 after 4 days. counts of lactic acid bacteria (lab) increased from 5.0 to 11.0 log cfug(-1) and yeasts increased from 3.4 to 7.1 log cfug(-1) while coliform counts decreased from 2.0 to <1 log cfug(-1) during four days of fermentation. lab and yeast isolates were identified by rrna gene sequence analysis. lab isolates included: enterococcus spp., lactobacillus (lb.) plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus (s.) infantarius subsp. infantarius, pediococcus pentosaceus and weisella (w.) confusa. dgge indicated predominance of s. gallolyticus, s. infantarius subsp. infantarius, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, w. confusa, lb. reuteri, fructobacillus spp., l. lactis and l. lactis. yeast isolates included clavispora  lusitaniae, cyberlindnera fabianii, issatchenkia orientalis and saccharomyces cerevisiae. dgge indicated predominance of s. cerevisiae in obutoko, enturire and obuteire and also detected pichia spp. and i. orientalis in obutoko. obushera produced in the laboratory was initially dominated by enterobacteriaceae and later by lactococcus spp. enterobacteriaceae and bacillus spp. were also detected in ekitiribita. development of starters for obushera may require combinations of  lab and s. cerevisiae for obutoko, enturire and obuteire and lab for ekitiribita.

TI  == genotypic characterization and safety assessment of lactic acid bacteria from indigenous african fermented food products.
AB  == background: indigenous fermented food products play an essential role in the diet of millions of africans. lactic acid bacteria (lab) are among the predominant microbial species in african indigenous fermented food products and are used for  different applications in the food and biotechnology industries. numerous studies have described antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of lab from different parts  of the world. however, there is limited information on antimicrobial resistance profiles of lab from africa. the aim of this study was to characterize 33 lab previously isolated from three different african indigenous fermented food products using (gtg)5-based rep-pcr, sequencing of the 16s rrna gene and species-specific pcr techniques for differentiation of closely related species and further evaluate their antibiotic resistance profiles by the broth microdilution method and their haemolytic activity on sheep blood agar plates as  indicators of safety traits among these bacteria. results: using molecular biology based methods and selected phenotypic tests such as catalase reaction, co2 production from glucose, colonies and cells morphology, the isolates were identified as lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus ghanensis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, pediococcus acidilactici, pediococcus pentosaceus and weissella confusa. the bacteria were susceptible to ampicillin, chloramphenicol,  clindamycin and erythromycin but resistant to vancomycin, kanamycin and streptomycin. variable sensitivity profiles to tetracycline and gentamicin was observed among the isolates with lb. plantarum, lb. salivarius, w. confusa (except strain sk9-5) and lb. fermentum strains being susceptible to tetracycline whereas pediococcus strains and lb. ghanensis strains were resistant. for gentamicin, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lb. ghanensis and ped. acidilactici strains were resistant to 64 mg/l whereas some w. confusa and lb. plantarum strains had a mic value of 16 mg/l and 32 mg/l respectively. no beta-haemolytic activity was observed, however, alpha-haemolytic activity was observed in 27% (9) of the strains comprising lb. salivarius (6), w. confusa (2) and lb. delbrueckii  (1) isolates. conclusions: the resistance to kanamycin and vancomycin is probably an intrinsic feature since similar observations were reported in the literature for lab. low prevalence of pathogenicity indicator traits were observed among the isolates especially with the presence of poor haemolytic activities and they could therefore be considered as interesting candidates for selection of starter  cultures or probiotics for different applications.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of microflora from ovine cheese.
AB  == strains identified in ovine cheese and bryndza by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis belonged to ten species of non-enterococcal lactic acid bacteria and included lactobacillus casei/lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus and pediococcus acidilactici. the susceptibility toward antibiotics was determined in lactobacilli, lactococci and pediococci and also in escherichia coli for comparison. analysis of l. fermentum and pediococci revealed the presence of non-wild-type epidemiological cut-offs in streptomycin, clindamycin or gentamicin. e. coli were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin and  florfenicol. no extended spectrum beta-lactamases were detected.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from tarhana, a traditional turkish fermented food.
AB  == tarhana is a traditional fermented product produced from a mixture of spontaneously fermented yogurt and wheat flour in turkey. the aims of the present study were to enumerate and identify for the first time by molecular biology-based methods predominant lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated during processing of tarhana. samples were collected from eight different regions of turkey. in order to explore the relationship between raw material and the microbiology of tarhana, yogurt and wheat flour were also analyzed. a total of 226 gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates were obtained from mrs, m17 and  sbm (slanetz and bartley medium). the isolates were grouped and identified using  a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods including rep-pcr fingerprinting [(gtg)(5) primer], multiplex pcr, 16s rrna gene sequencing and carbohydrate assimilation profiling. pediococcus acidilactici were found to constitute 27% of  the isolates, 19% were identified as streptococcus thermophilus, 19% as lactobacillus fermentum, 12% as enterococcus faecium, 7% as pediococcus pentosaceus, 5% as leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, 4% as weissella cibaria, 2% as lactobacillus plantarum, 2% as lactobacillus delbrueckii spp. bulgaricus, 2% as leuconostoc citreum, 1% as lactobacillus paraplantarum and 0.5% as lactobacillus casei. the different production sites investigated all had individual lab profiles, but with p. acidilactici and s. thermophilus being isolated from the majority of samples. the main source of p. acidilactici and s.  thermophilus was found to be the yogurt.

TI  == redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: to verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. methods and results: eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from traditional italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis,  lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus and pediococcus pentosaceus. it was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential  before the lactobacilli. the reduction rate of enterococcus spp. and l. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and lactobacillus spp. all the p. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. conclusions: the evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. significance and impact of the study: the reduction aptitude of strains might be  used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.

TI  == a survey of the microbial and chemical composition of seven semi-ripened provola  dei nebrodi sicilian cheeses.
AB  == aims: the microbial and chemical composition of seven different semi-ripened (45  days) provola dei nebrodi sicilian cheese samples were assessed in order to investigate the diversity of the microbial population in cheese made from different geographical areas throughout sicily. methods and results: the samples, which were obtained from seven different provola dei nebrodi manufacturers, were  assessed using selective media. interestingly, concentrations of presumptive lactobacilli represented over 90% of the total microbial population. in total, 105 presumptive lactobacillus isolates were characterized to determine the relatedness of the isolates between the seven different cheeses. randomly amplified polymorphic dna polymerase chain reaction (rapd pcr) analysis of the 105 presumptive lactobacilli indicated the presence of 22 distinct isolates. further investigation of the isolates using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge) following restriction with the enzyme apai revealed the presence of 19 distinct macrorestriction patterns and the presence of between one and four distinct isolates per cheese sample (out of a total of 15 isolates per cheese randomly taken from lactobacillus selective media plates). analysis of the 16s rdna sequence of each genetically distinct isolate demonstrated the dominance of  the lactobacillus casei species in all cheese samples assessed. lactobacillus delbrueckii and pediococcus pentosaceus species were also detected. the concentration of free amino acids, used to estimate the extent of proteolysis in  each cheese, ranged from 59 to 433 mg 100 g(-1) cheese. conclusions: microbiological assessment of the cheeses demonstrated the dominance of lactobacillus species after 45 days of ripening with levels ranging from 8.3 to 9.4 log cfu g(-1). significance and impact of the study: this study provides new  information on the diversity of lactobacilli within an artisanal sicilian cheese, enabling the identification of 17 strains of lact. casei, one strain of lact. delbrueckii and ped. pentosaceus through the combined use of rapd pcr, pfge and 16s rdna sequencing.

TI  == autolytic activity and pediocin-induced lysis in pediococcus acidilactici and pediococcus pentosaceus strains.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the autolytic phenotype of pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus, the peptidoglycan hydrolases content and the effect of pediocin ach/pa-1 and autolysins on cell lysis. methods and results: the autolytic phenotype of pediococcus strains was evaluated under starvation conditions in potassium phosphate buffer. the strains tested showed an extent of autolysis ranging between 40 and 90% after 48 h of starvation at 37 degrees c. peptidoglycan hydrolase content was evaluated by renaturing sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) using cells of micrococcus lysodeikticus as a target for the enzymatic activity and a major activity band migrating at about 116 kda was detected. additional secondary lytic bands migrating in a range of molecular weight between 45 and 110 kda were also detected. the lytic activity, evaluated in the presence of different chemicals, was retained in 15 mm cacl2 and in a range of ph between 5 and 9.5 but was strongly reduced in presence of 8% nacl and in the presence of protease inhibitors. the substrate specificity of peptidoglycan hydrolases of pediococcus  strains was evaluated in renaturing sds-page incorporating cells of different bacterial species. lytic activity was detected against cells of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus  and listeria monocytogenes. the interaction between pediocin ach/pa-1 and autolysis was evaluated and a relevant effect of bacteriocin in cell-induced lysis was observed. conclusions: the autolytic phenotype is widely distributed among p. acidilactici and p. pentosaceus and the rate of autolysis is high in the majority of the analysed strains. several autolytic bands, detected by renaturing sds-page, retained their activity against several lactic acid bacteria and l. monocytogenes. significance and impact of the study: the characterization of the  autolytic phenotype of pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus strains should expand the knowledge of their role in fermentation processes where these species  occur as primary or secondary bacterial population.
