TI  == the characterization of nonbacterial prostatitis: search for an etiology.
AB  == nonbacterial prostatitis is often difficult to differentiate from other prostatic complaints and remains a vaguely characterized syndrome. prostatic fluid inflammatory cells and elevated immunoglobulins raise the suspicion that this syndrome is caused by some undetected infection. prostatic fluid antibodies against chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma urealyticum, staphylococcus, staphylococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens were measured in men with nonbacterial and bacterial prostatitis, and men without urinary symptoms by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. prostate specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase were measured in the prostatic fluid as indirect measures of secretory activity. of 44 men with nonbacterial prostatitis  9 (20%) had detectable prostatic fluid antichlamydial antibody titers, compared with 3 of 25 control men (12%) and 2 of 13 (15%) with bacterial prostatitis--no evidence for a higher prevalence of prostatic fluid antichlamydial antibody in men with nonbacterial prostatitis. prostatic antibodies to the other organisms were rarely detected. when compared with unaffected men the low levels of prostate specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase, and more alkaline prostatic fluid in men with bacterial and nonbacterial prostatitis suggest that secretory dysfunction accompanies the inflammation. these data show that none of  the organisms studied caused the majority of the cases of nonbacterial prostatitis and that either an agent as yet unidentified or multiple agents may be involved in the etiology of nonbacterial prostatitis.

TI  == newly documented antimicrobial activity of quinolones.
AB  == the improved antimicrobial activity of newer fluoroquinolones and novel applications recently found for the drugs already marketed are reviewed. several  new compounds are more active against gram-positive bacteria than the presently marketed fluoroquinolones. win 57273, the most potent compound in vitro on a weight basis, is 16 to 128 times more active than ciprofloxacin against various staphylococci, streptococci, enterococcus spp., corynebacterium spp., listeria monocytogenes and bacillus spp. bmy 40062, pd 117558, pd 127391, sparfloxacin, temafloxacin and tosufloxacin also show enhanced in vitro efficacy against these  species. these drugs also possess increased activity against various anaerobes, notably clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile and the bacteroides fragilis group. mycobacterium tuberculosis, rapidly growing mycobacteria other than mycobacterium chelonae, and mycobacterium leprae are often susceptible to quinolones displaying bactericidal activity which is potentially useful for curing difficult-to-treat mycobacteriosis. in addition, a number of new products, notably those containing a cyclopropyl group, are more active than reference fluoroquinolones against mycobacterium leprae. sparfloxacin, bmy 40062 and win 57273 compare favorably with older fluoroquinolones in the killing of intracellular legionella spp., and several of the newer compounds have greater antichlamydial potency. improved antibacterial activity has also been found against mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas maltophilia. by contrast, the newer quinolones have similar or less activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae. recently, pefloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were found to be active against protozoa, including plasmodium spp., trypanosoma cruzi and leishmania donovani, but not against toxoplasma gondii. in the near future, more specific research testing unusual pathogens may lead to the identification of quinolones with more selective activity.
