TI  == low surface tension calcium hydroxide solution is an effective antiseptic.
AB  == the antimicrobial effects of a saturated calcium hydroxide solution, and in combination with 10% and 20% detergent, were evaluated on streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, neisseria  sp., diphtheroid, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus sp., staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis and candida albicans. the saturated calcium hydroxide solution was effective against only four of the 11 microorganisms studied over a 60-min exposure time. the calcium hydroxide solutions containing detergent killed all 11 test organisms over a 30-min exposure time. this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.01). no statistically significant difference in antimicrobial action was found between the 10% and 20% detergent calcium hydroxide solutions (p > 0.01). however, the low surface tension (46.5 x  10(-3) nm-1) and high ph (10.8) of the calcium hydroxide solution with 20% detergent establish it as the more effective solution.

TI  == the association between dietary sucrose consumption and microbial population shifts at six oral sites in man.
AB  == sucrose-related microbial population shifts were evaluated at 6 oral sites in 22  volunteers, who consumed high-sucrose diets for 21 days followed by low-sucrose diets for 21 days. culturing was performed at 0, 12, 21, 33 and 42 days of the 6-week experiment. over 50,000 microbial isolates were characterized and analysed. analysis of initial cultures showed the following site-specific microbial characteristics of the 6 sites evaluated: (1) molar fissures harboured  higher levels of neisseria species and showed the highest facultative-to-anaerobic ratio; (2) molar fissures and cervical buccal sites showed high streptococcus sanguis levels and total gram-positive cocci and fewer  gram-negative bacilli; (3) the tongue and saliva gave high concentrations of streptococcus salivarius and veillonella sp. sucrose intake was positively related to concentrations of yeasts and streptococcus mutans in the molar fissures; actinomyces viscosus in the mandibular approximal site; strep. mutans,  veillonella sp. and lactobacillus sp. in the maxillary approximal site and strep. salivarius on the tongue and in saliva. sucrose intake was negatively related to  concentrations of neisseria sp. on the tongue and total gram-positive bacilli in  saliva. a definite ecological effect of sucrose on the oral microflora was confirmed. the high inter-subject and site variations of target bacteria and the  generally low magnitude of shifts, however, discourage implementation of microbiological criteria in dietary assessments.
