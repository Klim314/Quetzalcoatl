TI  == prevalence of mycoplasma genitalium and mycoplasma hominis in urogenital tract of brazilian women.
AB  == background: the role of mycoplasma hominis and m. genitalium in urogenital tract  infections remains unknown. furthermore these mollicutes present a complex relationship with the host immune response. the role of inflammatory cytokines in infections also makes them good candidates to investigate bacterial vaginosis and mycoplasma genital infections. therefore, the aim of this study was to detect the above-mentioned mollicutes by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) methodologies in vaginal swabs and dosage of cytokines. methods: vaginal swabs and peripheral blood were collected from 302 women, including healthy individuals. the molecular findings were correlated with some individual behavioral variables, clinical and demographic characteristics, presence of other important microorganisms in vaginal swabs, and levels of interleukin (il)-1beta and il-6. results: m. hominis and m. genitalium were detected in 31.8% and 28.1%  of samples, respectively. the qpcr results were associated with clinical signs and symptoms of the infections studied. the frequency of trichomonas vaginalis, gardnerella vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae and chlamydia trachomatis was 3.0%,  21.5%, 42.4%, and 1.7% respectively. increased levels of il-1beta were associated with the presence of m. hominis and signs and/or symptoms of the genital infection of women studied. conclusion: il-1beta production was associated with the detection of m. hominis by qpcr. the sexual behavior of women studied was associated with the detection of mycoplasma and other agents of genital infections.

TI  == human papillomavirus and other genital infections in indigenous women from paraguay: a cross-sectional analytical study.
AB  == background: the incidence of cervical cancer in paraguay is among the highest in  the world, with the human papillomavirus (hpv) being a necessary factor for cervical cancer. knowledge about hpv infection among indigenous women is limited. this cross-sectional study analyzed the frequency of hpv and other genital infections in indigenous paraguayan women of the department of presidente hayes.  methods: this study included 181 sexually active women without cervical lesions.  they belonged to the following ethnicities: maka (n = 40); nivacle (n = 23); sanapana (n = 33); enxet sur (n = 51) and toba-qom (n = 34). the detection of hpv and other gynecological infectious microorganisms was performed by either molecular methods (for mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, chlamydia trachomatis), gram staining and/or culture (for gardnerella vaginalis, candida sp, trichomonas vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae), serological methods (for treponema pallidum, human immunodeficiency virus [hiv]) or cytology (cervical inflammation). results: a high prevalence (41.4%) of women positive for at least  one sexually transmitted infection (sti) was found (23.2% any-type hpv, 11.6% t pallidum, 10.5% t vaginalis, 9.9% c trachomatis and 0.6% hiv) with 12.2% having more than one sti. hpv infection was the most frequent, with 16.1% of women positive for high-risk hpv types. there was a statistically significant association observed between any-type hpv and c trachomatis (p = 0.004), which indicates that the detection of one of these agents should suggest the presence of the other. there was no association between any-type hpv and other genital infections or cervical inflammation, suggesting that other mechanism could exist  to favor infection with the virus. conclusion: this multidisciplinary work suggests that stis are frequent, making it necessary to implement control measures and improve diagnosis in order to increase the number of cases detected, especially in populations with poor access to health centers.

TI  == trospectomycin, a novel spectinomycin analogue: antibacterial activity and preliminary human pharmacokinetics.
AB  == trospectomycin (tsp; u-63366f) is a novel spectinomycin (sp) analogue with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. the in vitro activity of the analogue was  compared to that of sp against approximately 400 bacterial isolates. the in vivo  activity of the compound was assessed using experimental infection models for both gram-positive and gram-negative facultative bacteria. the preliminary human  pharmacokinetics of tsp were evaluated following single-dose i.v. or i.m. administration. tsp was more active in vitro than sp (2 to 32-fold) against strains of numerous bacterial species, including staphylococci, streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, proteus spp., bacteroides spp., gardnerella vaginalis and chlamydia trachomatis. the activity of tsp for most species of the family enterobacteriaceae was comparable  to that of sp. tsp was more active than sp (2 to 32-fold) in curing experimental  infections due to streptococci, salmonella typhi, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. tsp was well-absorbed following both i.v.  and i.m. administration. pharmacokinetic analysis of microbiological assay data for the 1000 mg dose yielded the following mean values for the i.v. and i.m. routes, respectively: cmax = 81.2, 28.7 micrograms/ml; serum half-life = 2.2, 2.2 h; tmax = 25, 75 min; and auc = 156.6, 116.2 h micrograms/ml. pharmacokinetic analysis of assay data derived using the more sensitive hplc assay revealed the biphasic nature of trospectomycin elimination, highlighted by a short apparent serum half-life (2.2 h) and a prolonged tissue half-life (approximately 36 h). tsp inhibits a variety of clinically important organisms, including agents of sexually transmitted diseases and pelvic inflammatory disease, and demonstrates favourable pharmacokinetic properties.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == ampicillin/sulbactam versus metronidazole-gentamicin in the treatment of soft tissue pelvic infections.
AB  == the clinical efficacy and safety of ampicillin/sulbactam versus metronidazole-gentamicin were evaluated in a comparative, randomized, prospective study. forty-four patients were enrolled: 22 received the ampicillin/sulbactam regimen, and 22 received the metronidazole-gentamicin combination. there were 33  cases of severe acute pelvic inflammatory disease, two tuboovarian abscesses, five cases of endomyometritis, and two cases of posthysterectomy pelvic cellulitis. aerobic and anaerobic cultures from the infection sites yielded 447 microorganisms from 44 patients (an average of 10 bacteria per infection; 6.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). the most frequent isolates were bacteroides sp., 54;  bacteroides bivius, 17; black-pigmented bacteroides, 12; bacteroides disiens, 11; fusobacterium, 13; peptostreptococcus anaerobius, 24; peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, 21; anaerobic gram-positive cocci, 34; gardnerella vaginalis, 29; neisseria gonorrhoeae, 17; alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 15; and escherichia  coli, five. clinical cure was noted in 19 of 20 patients treated with ampicillin/sulbactam and 18 of 21 patients treated with metronidazole-gentamicin. one treatment failure occurred in the ampicillin/sulbactam group in a patient who required antichlamydial therapy and had a complex left adnexal mass consistent with an abscess. the cases of metronidazole-gentamicin failure included two patients initially diagnosed as having tuboovarian abscesses who required a change in antibiotic therapy to control the infections. the third patient had postabortion endomyometritis that did not respond to metronidazole-gentamicin therapy within 48 hours, and required a change of medication. no adverse hematologic, renal, or hepatic effects were noted in either group of patients.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of ci-934 compared with that of other new 4-quinolones and  nalidixic acid.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of ci-934, a new 4-quinolone compound, was compared with that of the other new 4-quinolones, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin, and also with that of nalidixic acid. ci-934 was more active than any of the other 4-quinolones tested against gram-positive aerobic organisms including staphylococcus aureus (mics 0.06-0.25 mg/l), beta-haemolytic streptococci (mics 0.12-0.5 mg/l), streptococcus pneumoniae (mics 0.25-0.5 ml/l), viridans streptococci (mics 0.06-0.5 mg/l) and most enterococci (mics 0.12-0.5 mg/l), although some ampicillin-resistant isolates of str. faecium were slightly less susceptible (mics 2 mg/l). all three of the newer 4-quinolones tested were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas sp., haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mics mostly less than 1 mg/l). the other gram-negative aerobes tested were in general somewhat less susceptible, although for acinetobacter and  pseudomonas aeruginosa mics seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. ci-934 was more active than enoxacin against gardnerella vaginalis (mics 1-8 mg/l) although it was a little less active than ciprofloxacin. bacteroides species (including about half of the  fragilis group) were susceptible to ci-934 (mics mostly 1-8 mg/l): ciprofloxacin  had similar activity but enoxacin was less active. other anaerobes tested were mostly highly susceptible to ci-934 (mics 1 mg/l or less) but were somewhat less  susceptible to enoxacin and ciprofloxacin.

TI  == moxalactam versus clindamycin plus tobramycin in the treatment of obstetric and gynecologic infections.
AB  == the clinical efficacy of moxalactam versus clindamycin/tobramycin was evaluated in a comparative, randomized, prospective study. sixty patients were treated: 30  with moxalactam and 30 with clindamycin/tobramycin. there were 15 cases of tuboovarian abscess, 36 cases of severe pelvic inflammatory disease with peritonitis, eight cases of endomyometritis, and one wound abscess. aerobic and anaerobic cultures from the sites of infection yielded 441 microorganisms from 53 patients; an average of 8.3 bacteria per infection (4.5 anaerobes and 3.8 aerobes). the infections tended to be mixed aerobic-anaerobic with anaerobes isolated in 90% of cases. the most frequently isolated possible pathogens were bacteroides sp. (37), bacteroides bivius (23), bacteroides asaccharolyticus (12), peptococcus asaccharolyticus (29), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (19), unidentified anaerobic gram-positive cocci (18), escherichia coli (17), nonhemolytic streptococci (16), neisseria gonorrhoeae (13), and gardnerella vaginalis (38). clinical cure was noted in 29 of 30 moxalactam-treated and 29 of  30 clindamycin/tobramycin-treated patients. moxalactam was effective in five of six cases of tuboovarian abscess, all 22 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease with peritonitis, the one case of endomyometritis and the one wound abscess. clindamycin/tobramycin was effective in eight of nine cases of tuboovarian abscess, all 14 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease with peritonitis, and all seven cases of endomyometritis. no adverse hematologic, renal, or hepatic effects were noted with either regimen.

TI  == the effect of a contraceptive vaginal ring and oral contraceptives on the vaginal flora.
AB  == premenopausal women seeking a steroid contraceptive method were allowed to choose between a contraceptive vaginal ring (cvr) containing levonorgestrel and estradiol used in a 3-week in, 1-week out regimen (n=20) and an oral contraceptive (oc) containing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol in a 28-day regimen (n = 10). cultures from the posterior vaginal fornix were obtained before therapy in both groups and monthly for 6 months for the cvr group and after 1, 3, and 6 months for the oc group. these cultures were streaked on specific media to  provide quantitative aerobic and anaerobic, lactobacillus, candida sp., gardnerella vaginalis and neisseria gonorrhoeae counts in micro-organisms per milliliter. a comparison of the number and types of organisms isolated from vaginal cultures obtained initially and at 6 months demonstrated no statistically significant differences in colony counts between cvr and oc users. the results of this study suggest that the use of the cvr is not associated with a greater growth of pathogens than is oral administration of a progestin and estrogen combination.
