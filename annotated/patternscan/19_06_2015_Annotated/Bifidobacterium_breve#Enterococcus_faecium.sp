TI  == the influence of some probiotic supernatants on the growth and virulence features expression of several selected enteroaggregative e. coli clinical strains.
AB  == the purpose of this study was the assessment of the influence of three probiotic  supernatants (bifidobacterium breve atcc 15700, enterococcus faecium atcc 19434,  lactobacillus casei subsp. casei atcc 393) on the growth (quantified by viable cell counts) and virulence features expression (adherence ability to hep-2 cells  and inert substratum- slime test) of several selected eaggec diarrhoeagenic strains as well as the cytotoxicity of the respective supernatants on hep-2 cells. results: our in vitro studies are demonstrating that the selected supernatants, when added simultaneously with the bacterial culture are generally  opposing to the adherence to the cellular substratum by the eaggec strains. when  added after the pre-adherence period, the supernatants did not change the adherence indexes of the eaggec strains, but induced slight changes in the adherence pattern, reducing the frequency and size of bacterial aggregates. only  in few cases, the bacterial growth rate was slightly increased or sustained by the probiotic supernatants, a possible explanation being that we used supernatants obtained from 24 hrs fresh cultures, which are probably still containing some nutrients and probably also other growth factors. conclusion: our results are demonstrating that soluble probiotic metabolites accumulated in culture supernatants may interfere with the first step of adherence and colonization of the cellular and inert substrata by eaggec strains, probablyby the cross-talk between probiotic soluble molecules and quorum-sensing mediators of opportunistic strains; so, direct contact between the probiotic and pathogenic bacteria are not always necessary for the occurrence of a protective effect, that could be partly mediated by the soluble molecules secreted by specific probiotic  strains.

TI  == detection of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (bb12) in the intestine after feeding of sows and their piglets.
AB  == a real-time pcr method has been developed to distinguish bifidobacterium animalis subspecies in the gastrointestinal tracts of pigs. identification of a highly conserved single-copy tuf gene encoding the elongation factor tu involved in bacterial protein biosynthesis was used as a marker to differentiate homologous bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (strain bb12) from bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis, as well as bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, several species of lactobacillus, and enterococcus faecium. real-time pcr detection of serially diluted dna extracted from a pure culture of bb12 was linear for bacterial numbers ranging from 10 to 10,000 tuf gene copies per pcr (r(2) = 0.99). relative differences in bb12 bacterial numbers in pigs fed daily with bb12 were determined after detection of bb12 tuf gene copies in dna extracted from the intestinal contents. piglets treated with bb12 immediately after birth maintained a high level of bb12 in their large intestines with continuous daily administration of bb12. piglets born to bb12-treated sows during the last third of their gestation and also treated with bb12 at birth (t/t group) had a higher number of bb12 organisms per gram of intestinal contents compared to placebo-treated piglets born to placebo-treated sows (c/c group), bb12-treated sows (t/c group), or piglets born to placebo sows but treated with bb12 immediately after birth (c/t group). in addition, there was a significant increase in gene expression for toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9) in piglets from the t/t group, with no change in tlr2 and tlr4. these findings suggest that the tuf gene represents a specific and functional marker for detecting bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis strain bb12 within the microbiota of the intestine.

TI  == specific species of intestinal bacteria influence the induction of aberrant crypt foci by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine in rats.
AB  == to shed light on the association of intestinal microflora with the development of colon cancer, we studied the modifying effects of intestinal microflora on the occurrence of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh)-induced colonic aberrant crypt foci (acf) in germfree (gf), gnotobiotic (gb) and conventionalized (cvd) rats. in the  first part of this study, 10 week old germfree fischer-344 rats were randomly assigned to three groups and two groups of rats were orally inoculated with mixtures of pure culture of escherichia coli, enterococcus faecium, and several strains of bacteroides and clostridium species (gb), or feces from conventional rats (cvd). inoculated rats were given two weekly i.p. injections of dmh (20 mg/kg body wt) at 13 and 14 weeks of age. rats were sacrificed 11 or 34 weeks after the last dmh injection for acf scoring. the total number of acf, acf with four or more crypts/focus, and mean number of aberrant crypts per focus (crypt multiplicity) in gb rats sacrificed at week 34 were 168% (p < 0.001), 442% (p < 0.001) and 138% (p < 0.001) of those in gf rats, respectively. on the other hand, the same values in cvd rats were 42% (p < 0.001), 147% (p = 0.246) and 159% (p <  0.001) of those in gf rats, respectively. similar results were observed in rats that were sacrificed at week 11. in the second part of this study, the effect of  colonization of bifidobacterium breve on the acf profiles was examined in gb rats. the number of acf with four or more crypts/focus and crypt multiplicity in  gb plus b. breve rats at week 11 were significantly lower than those of gb rats (p < 0.01, and p < 0.05, respectively), although the former was not statistically significant at week 34. these findings suggest that some intestinal bacteria might behave as promoters and some as anti-promoters in colon carcinogenesis.
