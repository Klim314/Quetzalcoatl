TI  == interleukin-6 and microrna profiles induced by oral bacteria in human atheroma derived and healthy smooth muscle cells.
AB  == background: atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease with possible contributions from bacterial antigens. we aimed to investigate the role of oral bacteria as inducers of inflammatory cascades in smooth muscle cells from carotid endarterectomy patients (athsmcs) and healthy controls (hsmcs). findings: inactivated streptococcus mitis, s. sanguinis, s. gorgonii, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were used to stimulate inflammation in hsmcs and athsmcs. tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnfalpha) was used as a positive control in all stimulations. interleukin-6 (il-6) levels were  determined from cell culture supernatants and microrna expression profiles from cells after 24 h of bacterial stimulation. genome wide expression (gwe) analyses  were performed after 5 h stimulation. all studied bacteria induced pro inflammatory il-6 production in both smcs. the most powerful inducer of il-6 was  a. actinomycetemcomitans (p < 0.001). of the 84 studied mirnas, expression of 9 mirnas differed significantly (p </= 0.001) between hsmcs and athsmcs stimulated  with inactivated bacteria or tnfalpha. the data was divided into two groups: high il-6 producers (a. actinomytectemcomititans and tnfalpha) and low il-6 producers  (streptococcal strains and p. gingivalis). the expression of 4 mirnas (mir-181-5p, -186-5p, -28-5p and -155-5p) differed statistically significantly (p < 0.001) between healthy hsmcs and athsmcs in the low il-6 producer group. according to multidimensional scaling, two gene expression clusters were seen: one in hsmcs and one athsmcs. conclusions: our results suggest that inactivated oral bacteria induce inflammation that is differently regulated in healthy and atherosclerotic smcs.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of chemokine cxcl10 for dermal and oral microorganisms.
AB  == cxcl10 (ip-10) is a small 10 kda chemokine with antimicrobial activity. it is induced by ifn-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of t cells. recently, we detected cxcl10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. in the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that cxcl10 inhibits the growth of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium jeikeium, corynebacterium striatum, and candida albicans hmv4c, but not corynebacterium bovis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, poryphromonas gingivalis, or c. albicans atcc 64124. the reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. however, antimicrobial activity of cxcl10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues,  7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pi of 9.93. modeling studies revealed that cxcl10 contains an alpha-helix at the n-terminal,  three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the c-terminal. thus, cxcl10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of apitoxin, melittin and phospholipase a(2) of honey bee  (apis mellifera) venom against oral pathogens.
AB  == in this work, we used the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) technique to evaluate the antibacterial potential of the apitoxin produced by apis mellifera bees against the causative agents of tooth decay. apitoxin was assayed in natura  and in the commercially available form. the antibacterial actions of the main components of this apitoxin, phospholipase a2, and melittin were also assessed, alone and in combination. the following bacteria were tested: streptococcus salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, lactobacillus casei,  and enterococcus faecalis. the mic results obtained for the commercially available apitoxin and for the apitoxin in natura were close and lay between 20 and 40 microg / ml, which indicated good antibacterial activity. melittin was the most active component in apitoxin; it displayed very promising mic values, from 4 to 40 microg / ml. phospholipase a2 presented mic values higher than 400 microg / ml. association of mellitin with phospholipase a2 yielded mic values ranging between 6 and 80 microg / ml. considering that tooth decay affects people's health, apitoxin and its component melittin have potential application against oral pathogens.

TI  == species-specific difference in antimicrobial susceptibility among viridans group  streptococci.
AB  == background: viridans group streptococci (vgs) are both commensal microbes and potential pathogens. increasing resistance to penicillin in vgs is an ongoing issue in the clinical environment. we investigated the difference in susceptibility and resistance to penicillin among various vgs species. methods: in total 1,448 vgs isolated from various clinical specimens were analyzed over a  two-yr period. identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed by the automated vitek 2 system (biomerieux, france) or the microscan microstrep  system (siemens, germany). results: among the 1,448 isolates, 412 were isolated from blood (28.4%). streptococcus mitis group was the most frequently isolated (589 isolates, 40.7%), followed by the s. anginosus group (290 isolates, 20.0%),  s. sanguinis group (179 isolates, 12.4%) and s. salivarius group (57 isolates, 3.9%). in total, 314 isolates could not be identified up to the species level. the overall non-susceptibility to penicillin was observed to be 40.0% (resistant, 11.2% and intermediately resistant, 28.8%) with uneven distribution among groups; 40.2% in s. sanguinis group (resistant, 5.0% and intermediately resistant, 35.2%), 60.3% in s. mitis group (resistant, 20.9% and intermediately resistant, 39.4%), 78.9% in s. salivarius group (resistant, 8.8% and intermediately resistant, 70.1%), and 6.2% in s. anginosus group (resistant, 1.7% and intermediately resistant, 4.5%). conclusions: antimicrobial resistance patterns towards penicillin show differences among various vgs; this should be considered  while devising an effective antimicrobial treatment against vgs.

TI  == antibacterial activity of berry juices, an in vitro study.
AB  == abstract objective. the aim of the present study was to evaluate in vitro antibacterial activities of blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices on bacteria associated with gingival inflammation. materials and methods. the growth of selected bacteria (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was studied in vitro on agar plates. the  content of phenols in the different extracts was measured with hplc-esi-ms. results. the spectrometric analysis identified that the highest level of the single phenols studied was found for ferulic acid (113 mug/ml) in blackcurrant juice. sea buckthorn contained low levels of selected phenols. total bacterial inhibition for all bacterial species studied was found at 20% berry juice concentration with ph varying between 4.1-5.4. conclusions. the present study identified that in vitro bacterial growth on agar plates was inhibited by blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices and that low juice ph explains bacterial in vitro growth. this may have clinical implications in biofilm development, reducing the risks for both tooth decay and gingivitis.

TI  == environment and colonisation sequence are key parameters driving cooperation and  competition between pseudomonas aeruginosa cystic fibrosis strains and oral commensal streptococci.
AB  == cystic fibrosis (cf) patient airways harbour diverse microbial consortia that, in addition to the recognized principal pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa, include other bacteria commonly regarded as commensals. the latter include the oral (viridans) streptococci, which recent evidence indicates play an active role during infection of this environmentally diverse niche. as the interactions between inhabitants of the cf airway can potentially alter disease progression, it is important to identify key cooperators/competitors and environmental influences if therapeutic intervention is to be improved and pulmonary decline arrested. importantly, we recently showed that virulence of the p. aeruginosa liverpool epidemic strain (les) could be potentiated by the anginosus-group of streptococci (ags). in the present study we explored the relationships between other viridans streptococci (streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguinis) and the les and observed that co-culture outcome was dependent upon inoculation sequence and environment. all four streptococcal species were shown to potentiate les virulence factor production in co-culture biofilms. however, in the case of s. oralis interactions were environmentally determined; in air cooperation within a high cell density co-culture biofilm occurred together with stimulation of les virulence factor production, while in an atmosphere containing added co2 this species became a competitor antagonising les growth through hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) production, significantly altering biofilm population dynamics and appearance. streptococcus  mitis, s. gordonii and s. sanguinis were also capable of h2o2 mediated inhibition of p. aeruginosa growth, but this was only visible when inoculated as a primary coloniser prior to introduction of the les. therefore, these observations, which  are made in conditions relevant to the biology of cf disease pathogenesis, show that the pathogenic and colonisation potential of p. aeruginosa isolates can be modulated positively and negatively by the presence of oral commensal streptococci.

TI  == comparison of species identification of endocarditis associated viridans streptococci using rnpb genotyping and 2 maldi-tof systems.
AB  == streptococcus spp. are important causes of infective endocarditis but challenging in species identification. this study compared identification based on sequence determination of the rnpb gene with 2 systems of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, maldi biotyper (bruker) and vitek ms ivd (biomerieux). blood culture isolates of viridans streptococci from 63 patients with infective endocarditis were tested. the 3 methods showed full agreement for all 36 isolates identified in the anginosus, bovis, and mutans groups or identified as streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, or streptococcus sanguinis. none of the methods could reliably identify the 23 isolates to the species level when designated as streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, or streptococcus tigurinus. in 7 isolates classified to the mitis group, the rnpb sequences deviated strikingly from all reference sequences, and additional analysis of soda and groel genes indicated the occurrence of yet unidentified streptococcus spp.

TI  == action of essential oils from brazilian native and exotic medicinal species on oral biofilms.
AB  == background: essential oils (eo) obtained from twenty medicinal and aromatic plants were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against the oral pathogens candida albicans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis. methods: the antimicrobial activity of the eo was evaluates by microdilution method determining minimal inhibitory concentration. chemical analysis of the oils compounds was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (cg-ms). the most active eo were also investigated as to their actions on the biolfilm formation. results: the most of  the essential oils (eo) presented moderate to strong antimicrobial activity against the oral pathogens (mic--minimal inhibitory concentrations values between 0.007 and 1.00 mg/ml). the essential oil from coriandrum sativum inhibited all oral species with mic values from 0.007 to 0.250 mg/ml, and mbc/mfc (minimal bactericidal/fungicidal concentrations) from 0.015 to 0.500 mg/ml. on the other hand the essential oil of c. articulatus inhibited 63.96% of s. sanguis biofilm formation. through scanning eletronic microscopy (sem) images no changes were observed in cell morphology, despite a decrease in biofilm formation and changes  on biofilm structure. chemical analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) of the c. sativum essential oil revealed major compounds derivatives from alcohols and aldehydes, while cyperus articulatus and aloysia gratissima (eos) presented mono and sesquiterpenes. conclusions: in conclusion, the crude oil from c. articulatus exhibited the best results of antimicrobial activity e ability to  control biofilm formation. the chemical analysis showed the presence of terpenes  and monoterpenes such as a-pinene, a-bulnesene and copaene. the reduction of biofilms formation was confirmed from sem images. the results of this research shows a great potential from the plants studied as new antimicrobial sources.

TI  == phylogenomic and maldi-tof ms analysis of streptococcus sinensis hku4t reveals a  distinct phylogenetic clade in the genus streptococcus.
AB  == streptococcus sinensis is a recently discovered human pathogen isolated from blood cultures of patients with infective endocarditis. its phylogenetic position, as well as those of its closely related species, remains inconclusive when single genes were used for phylogenetic analysis. for example, s. sinensis branched out from members of the anginosus, mitis, and sanguinis groups in the 16s ribosomal rna gene phylogenetic tree, but it was clustered with members of the anginosus and sanguinis groups when groel gene sequences used for analysis. in this study, we sequenced the draft genome of s. sinensis and used a polyphasic approach, including concatenated genes, whole genomes, and matrix-assisted laser  desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry to analyze the phylogeny of s. sinensis. the size of the s. sinensis draft genome is 2.06 mb, with gc content of 42.2%. phylogenetic analysis using 50 concatenated genes or whole genomes revealed that s. sinensis formed a distinct cluster with streptococcus oligofermentans and streptococcus cristatus, and these three streptococci were clustered with the "sanguinis group." as for phylogenetic analysis using hierarchical cluster analysis of the mass spectra of streptococci, s. sinensis also formed a distinct cluster with s. oligofermentans and s. cristatus, but these three streptococci were clustered with the "mitis group." on the basis of the findings, we propose a novel group, named "sinensis group," to include s. sinensis, s. oligofermentans, and s. cristatus, in the streptococcus genus. our study also illustrates the power of phylogenomic analyses for resolving ambiguities in bacterial taxonomy.

TI  == salivary antibody response to streptococci in preterm and fullterm children: a prospective study.
AB  == objectives: secretory immunoglobulins present in mucosa surfaces represent the first line of defense of the adaptive immune system against infectious challenges. preterm (pt) neonates' humoral immunity is diminished compared to full-term (ft) newborns. the identification of important antigens (ags) of virulence of oral species may help in the investigation of the mechanisms of antigenic stimulation and the development of the mucosal immune response. in the  present study, we measured saliva levels of immunoglobulins a (iga) and m (igm) and characterized the specificity of iga against ags of several streptococcal species found early in life. methods: this was a prospective observational study. salivary iga (siga) antibody responses to bacterial species that are prototypes of pioneer (streptococcus mitis, s. sanguinis, s. gordonii) and pathogenic (streptococcus mutans) microorganisms of the oral cavity were studied in ft and pt children in two visits: at birth (t0) and at 3 months of age (t3). salivas from 123 infants (72 ft and 51 pt) were collected during the first 10h after birth (t0) and again at 3 months of age (t3). salivary levels of iga and igm antibodies were analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). a subgroup of 26 ft and 24 pt children were compared with respect to patterns of antibody specificities against different streptococci ags using western blot assays. results: no significant differences (p>0.05) in salivary levels of iga and igm between ft and pt babies were found at birth. at t3, mean siga values were similar between groups and sigm levels were significantly higher in pt than ft (p<0.05). western blot assays identified positive iga response to streptococci in the majority of children, especially in the ft group. there were some differences between groups in relation to the frequency of children with positive response to ags and intensity of iga response. in general, oral streptococci ags were more frequently detected and bands were more intense in ft than in pt, especially in t3. prospective analysis of patterns of siga against ags of different streptococcal species revealed an increase in complexity of the siga antibody response from the first day of birth (t0) to t3 in pt and ft. conclusion: the patterns of siga response to streptococci ags appear to be influenced by the gestational age, which might reflect the level of immunological maturity of the mucosal immune system.

TI  == bacteremia after piezocision.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of transient  bacteremia after a piezocision procedure. methods: the sample consisted of 30 subjects (24 women, 6 men; mean age, 19.6 +/- 0.7 years; range, 18.1-22.4 years)  with the american society of anesthesiologists' physical status i. all patients had class i skeletal and dental relationships and had fixed orthodontic treatment with the damon system. the piezocision surgery was performed 1 week after the placement of the orthodontic appliances in all patients. two 20-ml venous blood samples were collected before and 30 to 60 seconds after the first microincision  using an aseptic technique. the samples were inoculated into bactec plus aerobic  and anaerobic blood culture bottles and were assessed in the bactec blood culture analyzer (becton dickinson diagnostic instrument systems, sparks, md). the results were analyzed statistically using the mcnemar test, with p <0.05 indicating statistical significance. results: no significant difference between the preoperative and postoperative samples was determined with respect to transient bacteremia (p = 0.250). no bacteremia was detected in the pretreatment  samples, although gemella sanguinis, streptococcus pluranimalium, and streptococcus mitis/oralis were detected in 3 postoperative blood samples. conclusions: the piezocision procedure might be related to transitory bacteremia. hence, orthodontists should consider the possibility of bacterial endocarditis in at-risk patients when piezocision is part of the treatment plan.

TI  == levels and complexity of iga antibody against oral bacteria in samples of human colostrum.
AB  == streptococcus mutans (sm) have three main virulence antigens: glucan binding protein b (gbpb), glucosyltransferase (gtf) and antigens i/ii (ag i/ii) envolved  in the capacity of those bacteria to adhere and accumulate in the dental biofilm. also, the glycosyltransferases 153 kda of streptococcus gordonii (sgo) and 170kda of streptococcus sanguinis (ssa) were important antigens associated with the accumulation of those bacterias. streptococcus mitis (smi) present iga1 protease  of 202 kda. we investigated the specificity and levels iga against those antigens of virulence in samples of human colostrum. this study involved 77 samples of colostrum that were analyzed for levels of immunoglobulian a, m and g by elisa. the specificity of iga against extracts of sm and initials colonizators (ssa, smi, sgo) were analyzed by the western blot. the mean concentration of iga was 2850.2 (+/-2567.2) mg/100 ml followed by igm and igg (respectively 321.8+/-90.3 and 88.3+/-51.5), statistically different (p<0.05). results showed that the majority of samples had detectable levels of iga antibodies to extracts of bacteria antigens and theirs virulence antigens. to sm, the gbpb was significantly lower detected than others antigens of sm (p<0.05). high complexities of response to ags were identified in the samples. there were no significant differences in the mean number of iga-reactive ags between the antigens (p>0.4). so, the breast milk from first hours after birth presented significant levels of iga specific against important virulence of antigens those  oral streptococci, which can disrupt the installation and accumulation process of these microorganisms in the oral cavity.

TI  == cell wall-anchored nuclease of streptococcus sanguinis contributes to escape from neutrophil extracellular trap-mediated bacteriocidal activity.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis, a member of the commensal mitis group of streptococci, is a primary colonizer of the tooth surface, and has been implicated in infectious complications including bacteremia and infective endocarditis. during  disease progression, s. sanguinis may utilize various cell surface molecules to evade the host immune system to survive in blood. in the present study, we discovered a novel cell surface nuclease with a cell-wall anchor domain, termed swan (streptococcal wall-anchored nuclease), and investigated its contribution to bacterial resistance against the bacteriocidal activity of neutrophil extracellular traps (nets). recombinant swan protein (rswan) digested multiple forms of dna including net dna and human rna, which required both mg(2+) and ca(2+) for optimum activity. furthermore, dnase activity of s. sanguinis was detected around growing colonies on agar plates containing dna. in-frame deletion of the swan gene mostly reduced that activity. these findings indicated that swan is a major nuclease displayed on the surface, which was further confirmed by immuno-detection of swan in the cell wall fraction. the sensitivity of s. sanguinis to net killing was reduced by swan gene deletion. moreover, heterologous expression of the swan gene rendered a lactococcus lactis strain more resistant to net killing. our results suggest that the swan nuclease on the  bacterial surface contributes to survival in the potential situation of s. sanguinis encountering nets during the course of disease progression.

TI  == neuraminidase-producing oral mitis group streptococci potentially contribute to influenza viral infection and reduction in antiviral efficacy of zanamivir.
AB  == influenza is a serious respiratory disease among immunocompromised individuals, such as the elderly, and its prevention is an urgent social issue. influenza viruses rely on neuraminidase (na) activity to release progeny viruses from infected cells and spreading the infection. na is, therefore, an important target of anti-influenza drugs. a causal relationship between bacteria and influenza virus infection has not yet been established, however, a positive correlation between them has been reported. thus, in this study, we examined the biological effects of oral mitis group streptococci, which are predominant constituents of human oral florae, on the release of influenza viruses. among them, streptococcus oralis atcc 10557 and streptococcus mitis atcc 6249 were found to exhibit na activity and their culture supernatants promoted the release of influenza virus and cell-to-cell spread of the infection. in addition, culture supernatants of these na-producing oral bacteria increased viral m1 protein expression levels and cellular erk activation. these effects were not observed with culture supernatants of streptococcus sanguinis atcc 10556 which lacks the ability to produce na. although the na inhibitor zanamivir suppressed the release of progeny viruses from the infected cells, the viral release was restored upon the addition of culture supernatants of na-producing s. oralis atcc 10557 or s. mitis atcc 6249. these findings suggest that an increase in the number of na-producing oral  bacteria could elevate the risk of and exacerbate the influenza infection, hampering the efficacy of viral na inhibitor drugs.

TI  == adherence of human oral keratinocytes and gingival fibroblasts to nano-structured titanium surfaces.
AB  == background: a key element for long-term success of dental implants is integration of the implant surface with the surrounding host tissues. modification of titanium implant surfaces can enhance osteoblast activity but their effects on soft-tissue cells are unclear. adherence of human keratinocytes and gingival fibroblasts to control commercially pure titanium (cpti) and two surfaces prepared by anodic oxidation was therefore investigated. since implant abutments  are exposed to a bacteria-rich environment in vivo, the effect of oral bacteria on keratinocyte adhesion was also evaluated. methods: the surfaces were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (sem). the number of adhered cells and binding strength, as well as vitality of fibroblasts and keratinocytes  were evaluated using confocal scanning laser microscopy after staining with live/dead baclight. to evaluate the effect of bacteria on adherence and vitality, keratinocytes were co-cultured with a four-species streptococcal consortium. results: sem analysis showed the two anodically oxidized surfaces to be nano-structured with differing degrees of pore-density. over 24 hours, both fibroblasts and keratinocytes adhered well to the nano-structured surfaces, although to a somewhat lesser degree than to cpti (range 42-89% of the levels on  cpti). the strength of keratinocyte adhesion was greater than that of the fibroblasts but no differences in adhesion strength could be observed between the two nano-structured surfaces and the cpti. the consortium of commensal streptococci markedly reduced keratinocyte adherence on all the surfaces as well  as compromising membrane integrity of the adhered cells. conclusion: both the vitality and level of adherence of soft-tissue cells to the nano-structured surfaces was similar to that on cpti. co-culture with streptococci reduced the number of keratinocytes on all the surfaces to approximately the same level and caused cell damage, suggesting that commensal bacteria could affect adherence of  soft-tissue cells to abutment surfaces in vivo.

TI  == crystalline anatase-rich titanium can reduce adherence of oral streptococci.
AB  == dental implant abutments that emerge through the mucosa are rapidly covered with  a salivary protein pellicle to which bacteria bind, initiating biofilm formation. in this study, adherence of early colonizing streptococci, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguinis to two saliva-coated anodically oxidized surfaces was compared with that on commercially pure titanium (cpti). near edge x-ray absorption (nexafs) showed crystalline anatase was more pronounced on the anodically oxidized surfaces than  on the cpti. as revealed by fluorescence microscopy, a four-species mixture, as well as individual bacterial species, exhibited lower adherence after 2 h to the  saliva-coated, anatase-rich surfaces than to cpti. since wettability did not differ between the saliva-coated surfaces, differences in the concentration and/or configuration of salivary proteins on the anatase-rich surfaces may explain the reduced bacterial binding effect. anatase-rich surfaces could thus contribute to reduced overall biofilm formation on dental implant abutments through diminished adherence of early colonizers.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in the community.
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated the upper respiratory tract of adult and paediatric patients within the community. vgs are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of  the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (ar). laboratory examination of the colonising vgs species  may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the ar reservoir in this population. freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis, s. constellatus, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius,  s. sanguinis and s. vestibularis. the most frequent vgs organisms isolated was s. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by s. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), s. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), s. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), s. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), s. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), s. australis (3/363; 0.8%), s. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), s. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and s. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). all patients examined carried at least one vgs organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of vgs species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different vgs species, respectively. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by  standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime,  with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. s. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all vgs species examined (s. vestibularis v s. salivarius p=0.011), followed by s. anginosis. s. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible vgs species examined. overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. however, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae. in conclusion, these data indicate that vgs colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible s. salivarius.

AB  == members of the mitis group of streptococci are normal inhabitants of the commensal flora of the oral cavity and upper respiratory tract of humans. some mitis group species, such as streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguinis, are primary colonizers of the human oral cavity. recently, we found that hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) produced by s. oralis is cytotoxic to human macrophages, suggesting that streptococcus-derived h2o2 may act as a cytotoxin. since epithelial cells provide a physical barrier against pathogenic microbes, we investigated their susceptibility to infection by h2o2-producing streptococci in  this study. infection by s. oralis and s. sanguinis was found to stimulate cell death of detroit 562, calu-3 and hela epithelial cell lines at a multiplicity of  infection greater than 100. catalase, an enzyme that catalyzes the decomposition  of h2o2, inhibited s. oralis cytotoxicity, and h2o2 alone was capable of eliciting epithelial cell death. moreover, s. oralis mutants lacking the spxb gene encoding pyruvate oxidase, which are deficient in h2o2 production, exhibited reduced cytotoxicity toward detroit 562 epithelial cells. in addition, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays revealed that both s. oralis and h2o2 induced  interleukin-6 production in detroit 562 epithelial cells. these results suggest that streptococcal h2o2 is cytotoxic to epithelial cells, and promotes bacterial  evasion of the host defense systems in the oral cavity and upper respiratory tracts.

TI  == [evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  == introduction: antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (snp's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for  therapeutic purposes. it is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal snp's  possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of snp's against cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis  responsible for initiation of dental carries. tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. nanotechnology creates a  new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. methods: colloidal silver solution (css) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were  evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis and s, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs  of 7 patients treated for dental carries at department of conservative dentistry, medical university of warsaw. mic and mbc values for css's were evaluated. results: css used in this research is of good stability. no agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. mic values were: 12-25 ppm for s. salivarius, 25 ppm for s. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for s. mitis and 50 ppm for s. mutans, while mbc values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. after 24 hours of contact  mbc values were: 25-50 ppm for s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for s. mitis and 200 ppmfor s. mutans. conclusions: antimicrobial properties of css depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. the susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in  our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.

TI  == adhesion forces and composition of planktonic and adhering oral microbiomes.
AB  == the oral microbiome consists of a planktonic microbiome residing in saliva and an adhering microbiome (the biofilm adhering to oral hard and soft tissues). here we hypothesized that possible differences in microbial composition of the planktonic and adhering oral microbiome on teeth can be related to the forces by which different bacterial species are attracted to the tooth surface. the relative presence of 7 oral bacterial species in saliva and biofilm collected from 10 healthy human volunteers was determined twice in each volunteer by denaturing-gradient-gel electrophoresis. analysis of both microbiomes showed complete separation of the planktonic from the adhering oral microbiome. next, adhesion forces of corresponding bacterial strains with saliva-coated enamel surfaces were measured by atomic force microscopy. species that were found predominantly in the adhering microbiome had significantly higher adhesion forces to saliva-coated enamel (-0.60 to -1.05 nn) than did species mostly present in the planktonic microbiome (-0.40 to -0.55 nn). it is concluded that differences in composition of the planktonic and the adhering oral microbiome are due to small differences in the forces by which strains adhere to saliva-coated enamel,  providing an important step in understanding site- and material-specific differences in the composition of biofilms in the oral cavity.

TI  == a tissue-dependent hypothesis of dental caries.
AB  == current understanding of dental caries considers this disease a demineralization  of the tooth tissues due to the acid produced by sugar-fermenting microorganisms. thus, caries is considered a diet- and ph-dependent process. we present here the  first metagenomic analysis of the bacterial communities present at different stages of caries development, with the aim of determining whether the bacterial composition and biochemical profile are specific to the tissue affected. the data show that microbial composition at the initial, enamel-affecting stage of caries  is significantly different from that found at subsequent stages, as well as from  dental plaque of sound tooth surfaces. although the relative proportion of streptococcus mutans increased from 0.12% in dental plaque to 0.72% in enamel caries, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguinis were the dominant streptococci in these lesions. the functional profile of caries-associated bacterial communities indicates that genes involved in acid stress tolerance and  dietary sugar fermentation are overrepresented only at the initial stage (enamel  caries), whereas other genes coding for osmotic stress tolerance as well as collagenases and other proteases enabling dentin degradation are significantly overrepresented in dentin cavities. the results support a scenario in which ph and diet are determinants of the disease during the degradation of enamel, but in dentin caries lesions not only acidogenic but also proteolytic bacteria are involved. we propose that caries disease is a process of varying etiology, in which acid-producing bacteria are the vehicle to penetrate enamel and allow dentin degrading microorganisms to expand the cavity.

TI  == antimicrobial effects of herbal extracts on streptococcus mutans and normal oral  streptococci.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is associated with dental caries. a cariogenic biofilm, in particular, has been studied extensively for its role in the formation of dental  caries. herbal extracts such as cudrania tricuspidata, sophora flavescens, ginkgo biloba, and betula schmidtii have been used as a folk remedy for treating diseases. the purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial activity of herbal extracts against normal oral streptococci, planktonic and biofilm of s. mutans. streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguinis, and s. mutans were cultivated with brain heart infusion broth and susceptibility assay for the herbal extracts was performed according to the protocol of clinical and laboratory standard institute. also, s. mutans biofilm was formed on a polystyrene 12-well plate and  8-well chamber glass slip using bhi broth containing 2% sucrose and 1% mannose after conditioning the plate and the glass slip with unstimulated saliva. the biofilm was treated with the herbal extracts in various concentrations and inoculated on mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar plate for enumeration of viable s. mutans by counting colony forming units. planktonic s. mutans showed susceptibility to all of the extracts and s. mutans biofilm exhibited the highest level of sensitivity for the extracts of s. flavescens. the normal oral streptococci exhibited a weak susceptibility in comparison to s. mutans. s. oralis, however, was resistant to all of the extracts. in conclusion, the extract of s. flavescens may be a potential candidate for prevention and management of dental caries.

TI  == multiple alcohol dehydrogenases but no functional acetaldehyde dehydrogenase causing excessive acetaldehyde production from ethanol by oral streptococci.
AB  == ethanol consumption and poor oral hygiene are risk factors for oral and oesophageal cancers. although oral streptococci have been found to produce excessive acetaldehyde from ethanol, little is known about the mechanism by which this carcinogen is produced. by screening 52 strains of diverse oral streptococcal species, we identified streptococcus gordonii v2016 that produced the most acetaldehyde from ethanol. we then constructed gene deletion mutants in  this strain and analysed them for alcohol and acetaldehyde dehydrogenases by zymograms. the results showed that s. gordonii v2016 expressed three primary alcohol dehydrogenases, adha, adhb and adhe, which all oxidize ethanol to acetaldehyde, but their preferred substrates were 1-propanol, 1-butanol and ethanol, respectively. two additional dehydrogenases, s-adha and tdha, were identified with specificities to the secondary alcohol 2-propanol and threonine,  respectively, but not to ethanol. s. gordonii v2016 did not show a detectable acetaldehyde dehydrogenase even though its adhe gene encodes a putative bifunctional acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase. mutants with adhe deletion showed greater tolerance to ethanol in comparison with the wild-type and mutant with adha or adhb deletion, indicating that adhe is the major alcohol dehydrogenase in s. gordonii. analysis of 19 additional strains of s. gordonii, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis showed expressions of up to three alcohol dehydrogenases, but none showed detectable acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, except one strain that showed a novel aldh. therefore, expression  of multiple alcohol dehydrogenases but no functional acetaldehyde dehydrogenase may contribute to excessive production of acetaldehyde from ethanol by certain oral streptococci.

TI  == early in vitro and in vivo development of high-level daptomycin resistance is common in mitis group streptococci after exposure to daptomycin.
AB  == the development of high-level daptomycin resistance (hldr; mic of >/= 256 mg/liter) after exposure to daptomycin has recently been reported in viridans group streptococcus (vgs) isolates. our study objectives were as follows: to know whether in vitro development of hldr after exposure to daptomycin was common among clinical isolates of vgs and streptococcus bovis; to determine whether hldr also developed during the administration of daptomycin to treat experimental endocarditis caused by the daptomycin-susceptible, penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis strain s. mitis 351; and to establish whether combination with gentamicin prevented the development of hldr in vitro and in vivo. in vitro  studies were performed with 114 vgs strains (mitis group, 92; anginosus group, 10; mutans group, 8; and salivarius group, 4) and 54 streptococcus bovis strains  isolated from 168 consecutive patients with infective endocarditis diagnosed between 1995 and 2010. hldr was only observed after 24 h of exposure to daptomycin in 27% of the mitis group, including 27% of s. mitis isolates, 47% of  s. oralis isolates, and 13% of s. sanguis isolates. in our experimental model, hldr was detected in 7/11 (63%) and 8/12 (67%) isolates recovered from vegetations after 48 h of daptomycin administered at 6 mg/kg of body weight/24 h  and 10 mg/kg/24 h, respectively. in vitro, time-kill experiments showed that daptomycin plus gentamicin was bactericidal against s. mitis 351 at tested concentrations of 0.5 and 1 times the mic and prevented the development of hldr.  in vivo, the addition of gentamicin at 1 mg/kg/8 h to both daptomycin arms prevented hldr in 21 out of 23 (91%) rabbits. daptomycin plus gentamicin was at least as effective as vancomycin plus gentamicin. in conclusion, hldr develops rapidly and frequently in vitro and in vivo among mitis group streptococci. combining daptomycin with gentamicin enhanced its activity and prevented the development of hldr in most cases.

TI  == the efficacy of neem extract on four microorganisms responsible for causing dental caries viz streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis: an in vitro study.
AB  == history and objectives: from the ancient time, neem used to be the traditional medicine for many diseases and was mainly used for cleaning the oral cavity. the  incidence of dental caries was less a few decades ago but now the incidence of caries is very aggressive. this might be due to change in dietary habits, life style and more tendency toward processed food. the objective of this study is to  find out the truth that if the neem is really efficacious against caries-inducing microorganisms, mainly streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis. materials and methods: the dried neem sticks ground into a coarse powder and weighed into 5, 10 and 50 gm were added to 100 ml of deionized double distilled water. after soaking for 2 days, the water was filtered at 4 degrees c and the fine filtrate was inoculated onto blood agar plates contains individual species of microorganisms and incubated at  37 degrees c for 2 days. results: at maximum concentrations, neem extract has shown the maximum zone of inhibition on streptococcus mutans. at less concentration, the efficacy of neem has shown some inhibition of growth for all the four species of microorganisms. conclusion: neem chewing provides the maximum benefits. hence, the use of chewing sticks of neem can be recommended.

TI  == enantiomeric hplc resolution and absolute stereochemistry assignment of a new poligamain derivative.
AB  == a new aryltetralin lignan derivative, 1, was obtained by reacting dimethyl succinate and piperonal, furnishing the lactone 4-(3',4'-methylenedioxybenzyl)-4,5-dihydro-2(3h)-furanone, which was reacted once again with piperonal and lda to give the dibenzylbutirolactone 7-hydroxyhinokinin. the cyclization of 7-hydroxyhinokinin into polygamain occurred in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid. the reduction of the furanic ring of polygamain was done by its reaction with dibal in thf, furnishing the diol functionalized lignin derivative 1 as single diastereomer. the enantiomeric  fractions of 1 were obtained by preparative enantioselective hplc. the absolute stereochemistry was assigned by electronic circular dichroism (ecd) and nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy. an all-trans relative configuration was determined by nmr on the bases of (1)h coupling constants and nuclear overhauser  effect (n.o.e.) experiments. the absolute configuration at c1 was assigned on the basis of the ecd sign at 296 nm by comparison to the ecd spectra of structural analogues with defined stereochemistry. the assignment of the absolute configuration was confirmed by applying the exciton chirality method to the well-defined ecd couplets at 285 and 200 nm allied to the two electronic transitions l(b) and b(b) of the aromatic moieties, respectively. rac-1 and its enantiomeric isomers were evaluated against important bacteria responsible for dental caries. the best results obtained for the (1r,2s,3s) isomer were against streptococcus mutans (250 mum), streptococcus salivarius (250 mum), streptococcus sobrinus (280 mum) and streptococcus mitis (280 mum). the (1s,2r,3r) isomer was active only against streptococcus sanguinis (280 mum). the enantiomeric mixture was less active than the (1r,2s,3s) isomer.

TI  == effect of osteopontin on the initial adhesion of dental bacteria.
AB  == bacterial biofilms are involved in numerous infections of the human body, including dental caries. while conventional therapy of biofilm diseases aims at eradication and mechanical removal of the biofilms, recent therapeutic approaches target the mechanisms of biofilm formation and bacterial adhesion in particular.  the effect of bovine milk osteopontin, a highly phosphorylated whey protein, on adhesion of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and actinomyces naeslundii, three prominent colonizers in dental biofilms, to saliva-coated surfaces was investigated. while adhesion of a. naeslundii was not affected by osteopontin, a strong, dose-dependent reduction in the number of adhering s. mitis was shown. no difference in bacterial adhesion was observed for caseinoglycomacropeptide, another phosphorylated milk protein. osteopontin did not affect bacterial viability, but changed bacterial surface hydrophobicity, and may be suggested to prevent the adhesins of s. mitis from interacting with their  salivary receptors. the antiadhesive effect of osteopontin may be useful for caries prevention.

TI  == beyond streptococcus mutans: dental caries onset linked to multiple species by 16s rrna community analysis.
AB  == dental caries in very young children may be severe, result in serious infection,  and require general anesthesia for treatment. dental caries results from a shift  within the biofilm community specific to the tooth surface, and acidogenic species are responsible for caries. streptococcus mutans, the most common acid producer in caries, is not always present and occurs as part of a complex microbial community. understanding the degree to which multiple acidogenic species provide functional redundancy and resilience to caries-associated communities will be important for developing biologic interventions. in addition, microbial community interactions in health and caries pathogenesis are not well understood. the purpose of this study was to investigate bacterial community profiles associated with the onset of caries in the primary dentition. in a combination cross-sectional and longitudinal design, bacterial community profiles at progressive stages of caries and over time were examined and compared to those of health. 16s rrna gene sequencing was used for bacterial community analysis. streptococcus mutans was the dominant species in many, but not all, subjects with caries. elevated levels of s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, and s. parasanguinis were  also associated with caries, especially in subjects with no or low levels of s. mutans, suggesting these species are alternative pathogens, and that multiple species may need to be targeted for interventions. veillonella, which metabolizes lactate, was associated with caries and was highly correlated with total acid producing species. among children without previous history of caries, veillonella, but not s. mutans or other acid-producing species, predicted future  caries. bacterial community diversity was reduced in caries as compared to health, as many species appeared to occur at lower levels or be lost as caries advanced, including the streptococcus mitis group, neisseria, and streptococcus sanguinis. this may have implications for bacterial community resilience and the  restoration of oral health.

AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

TI  == regulation of neuraminidase expression in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == background: sialic acid (n-acetylneuraminic acid; neunac) is one of the most important carbohydrates for streptococcus pneumoniae due of its role as a carbon  and energy source, receptor for adhesion and invasion and molecular signal for promotion of biofilm formation, nasopharyngeal carriage and invasion of the lung. results: in this work, neunac and its metabolic derivative n-acetyl mannosamine (mannac) were used to analyze regulatory mechanisms of the neuraminidase locus expression. genomic and metabolic comparison to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguinis elucidates the metabolic association of the two amino sugars to different parts of the locus coding for the two main pneumococcal neuraminidases and confirms the substrate specificity of the respective abc transporters. quantitative gene expression analysis shows repression of the locus by glucose and induction of all predicted transcriptional units by mannac and neunac, each inducing with higher efficiency the operon encoding for the transporter with higher specificity for the respective amino sugar. cytofluorimetric analysis demonstrated enhanced surface exposure of nana on pneumococci grown in neunac and mannac and an activity assay allowed to quantify approximately twelve times as much neuraminidase activity on induced cells as opposed to glucose grown cells. conclusions: the present data increase the understanding of metabolic regulation  of the nanab locus and indicate that experiments aimed at the elucidation of the  relevance of neuraminidases in pneumococcal virulence should possibly not be carried out on bacteria grown in glucose containing media.

AB  == aim: previous work has indicated that environmental stresses on bacteria might lead to an upregulation of stress response. led curing lights (315-400 nm) and other uv lights used in tooth whitening cosmetic procedures might act as stresses. we examined the effect of uv-c light, as a high-energy surrogate to the lower-energy uv-a light used in such instruments, to examine its effect on the antibiotic susceptibility of viridans group streptococci. methods: twelve species of viridans group streptococci were examined in this study: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus australis, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis. these organisms were exposed to varying degrees of sublethal uv-c radiation, and their minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility was determined by broth dilution assay against three classes of commonly-used antibiotics: beta-lactams (penicillin), macrolides (erythromycin), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). results: there was no significant difference between antibiotic susceptibility before uv-c exposure and following maximum sublethal stress, prior to cell death due to fatal uv-c exposure. conclusions: exposure to uv-c light will not result in altered antibiotic susceptibility patterns on viridans group streptococci. given that uv-c is more toxic and mutagenic than uv-a light, it is unlikely than uv-a light  would yield any difference in response to such exposure.

TI  == osteopontin reduces biofilm formation in a multi-species model of dental biofilm.
AB  == background: combating dental biofilm formation is the most effective means for the prevention of caries, one of the most widespread human diseases. among the chemical supplements to mechanical tooth cleaning procedures, non-bactericidal adjuncts that target the mechanisms of bacterial biofilm formation have gained increasing interest in recent years. milk proteins, such as lactoferrin, have been shown to interfere with bacterial colonization of saliva-coated surfaces. we here study the effect of bovine milk osteopontin (opn), a highly phosphorylated whey glycoprotein, on a multispecies in vitro model of dental biofilm. while considerable research effort focuses on the interaction of opn with mammalian cells, there are no data investigating the influence of opn on bacterial biofilms. methodology/principal findings: biofilms consisting of streptococcus oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus downei and streptococcus sanguinis were grown in a flow cell system that permitted in situ microscopic analysis. crystal violet staining showed significantly less biofilm formation in the presence of opn, as compared to biofilms grown without opn or biofilms grown in the presence of caseinoglycomacropeptide, another phosphorylated milk protein. confocal microscopy revealed that opn bound to the surface of bacterial cells and reduced mechanical stability of the biofilms without affecting cell viability. the bacterial composition of the biofilms, determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, changed considerably in the presence of opn. in particular, colonization of s. mitis, the best biofilm former in the model, was reduced dramatically. conclusions/significance: opn strongly reduces the amount of biofilm formed in a well-defined laboratory model of acidogenic dental biofilm. if a similar effect can be observed in vivo, opn might serve as a valuable adjunct to mechanical tooth cleaning procedures.

TI  == shifts in the microbial population in relation to in situ caries progression.
AB  == the shift in microbial diversity from young to mature plaque, related to caries activity on sound and restored surfaces, was studied using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. during a 20-week in situ study on caries progression 8 subjects wearing restored and unrestored dentin and enamel sections, biofilm was  sampled after 1 and 20 weeks (young or mature plaque). a higher microbial diversity (mature plaque) was seen in caries-active compared to caries-free subjects. rothia dentocariosa and scardovia inopinata were absent from all caries-free sites, but appeared in 50% of the caries-active sites.

TI  == bacterial viability on surface-modified resin-based dental restorative materials.
AB  == the purpose of the present investigation was to investigate the viability of early colonizers on the surfaces of resin-based dental restorative materials modified with low-surface tension active agents in comparison with the unmodified material. a novel polymeric sorption material, loaded with two low-surface tension gamma(l) active agents (hydroxyfunctional polydimethylsiloxane and polydimethylsiloxane) or a polymerizable active agent (silicone polyether acrylate), was used to modify commonly formulated experimental dental resin composites. the non-modified resin was used as the standard (st). the viability of actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus sanguinis on water-stored, polished, and  human saliva pellicle-coated specimens was determined using a fluorescence microscope after 8 and 24h. total, vital, and non-vital cells were calculated from the microscopic images by counting pixels per colour. means, standard deviations, univariate anova and multiple comparisons with post hoc scheffe's tests were calculated. t-test was done to compare 8-h and 24-h bacteria counts. for all tests p<0.05 was chosen. null hypothesis: the test materials and the standard did not differ either in the total bacterial counts or in the respective bacterium's viability after 8 or 24h. the test materials modified with the silicone polyether acrylate showed lower total bacteria count after 8 or 24h than st. but all test materials had significantly fewer vital cells after 8 or 24h compared to st. the contact angle did not influence bacterial adhesion, but low total sfe and a low polar term of sfe resulted in fewer bacteria. the material's  chemistry also affected the total and vital cell counts. different bacteria viabilities needed to be explored to obtain relevant information regarding bacterial adhesion on dental composite resins. the novel sorption material loaded with low gamma(l) active agents or with a low gamma(l) polymerizable silicone polyether acrylate used to modify the chemistry of the test materials was appropriate to reduce bacterial adhesion or cell viability, respectively.

TI  == influence of orthodontic treatment on oral streptococci.
AB  == objective of this study is to evaluate the changes of the oral microbial flora, concentrating on the oral streptococci, after the first 3 and 6 months of orthodontic treatment. materials and methods: 40 patients, aged 7-17, that presented for orthodontic treatment between april and september 2010 in the department of orthodontics and dento-facial orthopedics of "carol davila" university of medicine and pharmacy, bucharest have been selected. according to the protocol, coronary and subgingival plaque was collected from the dental surface before starting any orthodontic treatment (t0), 3 months after wearing orthodontic appliances (t1) and 6 months after wearing orthodontic appliances (t2). the samples were studied in cantacuzino national institute of research-development for microbiology and immunology [isolation on columbia agar  with 5% sheep blood, identification on morphotinctorial, growth and biochemical characteristics using api 20 strep (biomerieux)]. bacterial concentration (colony-forming units/sample = cfu/sample) for the aerobic and anaerobic flora was calculated by the serial dilution method of counting bacteria. results: 106 strains of oral streptococci were isolated from dental plaque, belonging to 6 species (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus acidominimus),  37 strains of oral streptococci in patients from group i (t0), 40 strains from group ii (t1) and 29 strains of oral streptococci from group iii (t2). after 3 months (t1) the aerobic bacteria percentage, detected at a concentration between  10(5) and 10(6), increased from 30 to 38.2%. the percentage of patients with a bacterial concentration higher than 10(6) cfu/sample increased from 5% to 8.8%. the samples colected at t2 (patients examined after 6 months of orthodonic treatment) presented a lower bacterial concentration, as compared to group ii (t1). the most common isolated species of streptococci were s. salivarius, s. oralis and s. mutans (37.5%, 22.5% and 10%), whose frequency increased after 3 months of treatment to 41.14%, 32.3% and respectively 14.4%, returning after 6 months of treatment at values similar to those recorded before beginning the orthodontic treatment. conclusions: presence of orthodontic appliances may produce a transitory increase of bacterial concentration (cfu/sample) and isolation rate of oral streptococci, returning to the level prior to the application of these devices after a time interval of several months.

TI  == comparison of microbial changes in early redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.
AB  == background: surfaces and fluids can affect oral bacterial colonization. the aim of this study is to compare redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.  methods: supragingival plaque samples were taken from 55 dentate individuals and  the denture teeth of 62 edentulous individuals before and after professional cleaning. also, samples from seven "teeth" (samples included dentures) in randomly selected quadrants were collected after 1, 2, 4, and 7 days of no oral hygiene. samples were analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. counts and proportions of 41 bacterial taxa were determined at each time point, and significant differences were determined using the mann-whitney u test. ecological succession was determined using a modified moving window analysis. results: mean  total dna probe counts were similar precleaning but were higher in dentate individuals at all post-cleaning visits (p <0.01). precleaning edentate biofilms  had higher counts and proportions of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus mutans, whereas dentate individuals had higher proportions of tannerella forsythia, selenomonas noxia, and neisseria mucosa. by day 2, mean counts of all taxa were higher in natural teeth, and most remained higher at day  7 (p <0.01). succession was more rapid and complex in dentate individuals. both groups demonstrated increased proportions of s. mitis and s. oralis by day 1. n.  mucosa, veillonella parvula, and eikenella corrodens increased in both groups, but later in samples from edentate individuals. conclusions: "mature" natural and denture teeth biofilms have similar total numbers of bacteria but different species proportions. post-cleaning biofilm redevelopment is more rapid and more complex on natural teeth than on denture teeth.

TI  == the cariogenic characters of xylitol-resistant and xylitol-sensitive streptococcus mutans in biofilm formation with salivary bacteria.
AB  == streptococcus mutans metabolize carbohydrates, such as glucose and sucrose, to produce acid and enhance biofilm formation with the early colonizing bacteria to  induce dental caries. xylitol has been used as a reliable substitute for carbohydrate to inhibit the acid production of s. mutans. however, long-term xylitol consumption leads to the emergence of xylitol-resistance in s. mutans. the aim of this study was to investigate the cariogenic trait of xylitol-resistant (x(r)) s. mutans using biofilm formation and coaggregation of xylitol-sensitive (x(s)) and x(r) s. mutans with salivary bacteria and their glucosyltransferases expression. when x(s) or x(r) s. mutans were incubated in brain heart infusion broth with bacteria from human saliva, x(r)s. mutans exhibited reduction in biofilm formation in comparison to x(s) s. mutans. the coaggregation between x(r) s. mutans and s, gordonii, s. mitis, s. oralis or s. sanguinis was less pronounced than that of x(s) s. mutans in the presence of sucrose. however, there was no difference in the coaggregation between x(r) and x(s) s. mutans in the sucrose-free condition. the level of gtfb and gtfc mrna expression of x(r) s. mutans was lower than that of x(s) s. mutans, whilst the level of gtfd mrna expression did not differ between the two strains. the reduction of biofilm formation in x(s) s. mutans due to decrease in glucosyltransferases expression suggests that x(r) s. mutans may be less cariogenic than x(s) s. mutans.

TI  == a five-species transcriptome array for oral mixed-biofilm studies.
AB  == background: oral polymicrobial interactions and biofilm formation are associated  with initiation and progression of caries, gingivitis, and periodontitis. transcriptome studies of such interactions, allowing a first mechanistic insight, are hampered by current single-species array designs. methodology/principal findings: in this study we used 385 k nimblegene technology for design and evaluation of an array covering the full genomes of 5 important physiological-, cariogenic-, and periodontitis-associated microorganisms (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis). array hybridization was done with cdna from cultures grown for 24 h anaerobically. single species experiments identified cross-species hybridizing array probes. these probes could be neglected in a mixed-species experimental setting without the need to exclude  the whole genes from the analysis. between 69% and almost 99% of the genomes were actively transcribed under the mono-species planktonic, monolayer, and biofilm conditions. the influence of streptococcus mitis (not represented on the array) on s. mutans gene transcription was determined as a test for a dual-species mixed biofilm setup. phenotypically, under the influence of s. mitis an increase in s.  mutans biofilm mass and a decrease in media ph-value were noticed, thereby confirming previously published data. employing a stringent cut-off (2-fold, p<0.05), 19 s. mutans transcripts were identified with increased abundance, and 11 with decreased abundance compared to a s. mutans mono-species biofilm. several of these genes have previously been found differentially regulated under general  and acid stress, thereby confirming the value of this array. conclusions/significance: this new array allows transcriptome studies on multi-species oral biofilm interactions. it may become an important asset in future oral biofilm and inhibitor/therapy studies.

TI  == antibacterial activity of sphingoid bases and fatty acids against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == there is growing evidence that the role of lipids in innate immunity is more important than previously realized. how lipids interact with bacteria to achieve  a level of protection, however, is still poorly understood. to begin to address the mechanisms of antibacterial activity, we determined mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of lipids common to the skin and oral cavity--the sphingoid bases d-sphingosine, phytosphingosine, and dihydrosphingosine and the fatty acids sapienic acid and lauric acid--against four gram-negative bacteria and seven gram-positive bacteria. exact kruskal-wallis tests of these values showed differences among lipid treatments (p < 0.0001) for each bacterial species except serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. d-sphingosine (mbc range, 0.3 to 19.6 mug/ml), dihydrosphingosine (mbc range, 0.6 to 39.1 mug/ml), and phytosphingosine (mbc range, 3.3 to 62.5 mug/ml) were active against all bacteria except s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). sapienic acid (mbc range, 31.3 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and fusobacterium nucleatum but not active against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, corynebacterium bovis, corynebacterium striatum, and corynebacterium  jeikeium (mbc > 500 mug/ml). lauric acid (mbc range, 6.8 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against all bacteria except e. coli, s. marcescens, and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). complete killing was achieved as early as 0.5 h for some lipids but took as long as 24 h for others. hence, sphingoid bases and fatty acids have  different antibacterial activities and may have potential for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention in infection.

TI  == effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation between oral streptococci and actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == background: the co-aggregation of oral bacteria leads to their clearance from the oral cavity. poor oral hygiene and high saliva viscosity are common amongst the elderly; thus, they frequently suffer from pneumonia caused by the aspiration of  oral microorganisms. objectives: to examine the direct effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces. materials and methods: fifteen oral streptococcal and a single actinomyces strain were used. co-aggregation was assessed by a visual assay in phosphate buffer and a spectrophotometric assay in the same buffer containing 0-60% glycerol or whole saliva. results: nine oral streptococci co-aggregated with actinomyces naeslundii atcc12104 in the visual assay and were subsequently used for the spectrophotometric analysis. all tested strains displayed a decrease in co-aggregation with increasing amounts of glycerol in the buffer. the co-aggregation of streptococcus oralis with a. naeslundii recovered to baseline level following the removal of glycerol. the per cent co-aggregation of s. oralis with a. naeslundii was significantly correlated with the viscosity in unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva samples (correlation coefficients: -0.52 and -0.48, respectively). conclusion: this study suggests that saliva viscosity affects the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces and that bacterial co-aggregation decreases with increasing saliva viscosity.

TI  == antibiotic modulation of the plasminogen binding ability of viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the ability of viridans group streptococci to bind human plasminogen and its subsequent activation into plasmin may contribute to the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis (ie) by leading to a decreased stability of the streptococcal vegetation and facilitating dehiscence of emboli. at levels greater than or equal to their mics, penicillin, vancomycin, and linezolid are efficacious in the treatment of streptococcal endocarditis. however, at sub-mics, antibiotics can modulate the expression of bacterial genes, including virulence-associated genes, which can have counterproductive effects on the treatment of endocarditis. the effects of 1/8x and 1/4x mics of penicillin, vancomycin, and linezolid on the plasminogen binding ability of ie isolates streptococcus mitis 881/956, streptococcus oralis 12601, and streptococcus sanguinis 12403 were assessed phenotypically and the expression of plasminogen receptors alpha-enolase and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase of s. oralis 12601 when exposed to 1/4x mic of penicillin, was analyzed through quantitative reverse transcription (qrt)-pcr. the plasminogen binding ability of s. mitis 881/956 and s. sanguinis 12403 remained unaffected by exposure to sub-mics of all of the antibiotics tested, while that of s. oralis 12601 was significantly enhanced by all of the antibiotics tested at sub-mics. qrt-pcr analysis of s. oralis 12601 demonstrated an upregulation of the eno and gapdh genes, indicating  an overexpression of plasminogen receptors. these findings suggest that for some  endocarditis isolates, the effect of antibiotic sub-mics, in addition to a reduced antibacterial effect, may influence the clinical response to nonsurgical  therapy. it remains difficult to accurately predict isolate responses to sub-mic  antimicrobials since there appears to be interspecies variation.

TI  == ph landscapes in a novel five-species model of early dental biofilm.
AB  == background: despite continued preventive efforts, dental caries remains the most  common disease of man. organic acids produced by microorganisms in dental plaque  play a crucial role for the development of carious lesions. during early stages of the pathogenetic process, repeated ph drops induce changes in microbial composition and favour the establishment of an increasingly acidogenic and aciduric microflora. the complex structure of dental biofilms, allowing for a multitude of different ecological environments in close proximity, remains largely unexplored. in this study, we designed a laboratory biofilm model that mimics the bacterial community present during early acidogenic stages of the caries process. we then performed a time-resolved microscopic analysis of the extracellular ph landscape at the interface between bacterial biofilm and underlying substrate. methodology/principal findings: strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus downei and actinomyces naeslundii were employed in the model. biofilms were grown in flow channels that allowed for direct microscopic analysis of the biofilms in situ. the architecture and composition of the biofilms were analysed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal laser scanning microscopy. both biofilm structure and composition were highly reproducible and showed similarity to in-vivo-grown dental plaque. we employed the ph-sensitive ratiometric probe c-snarf-4 to perform real-time microscopic analyses of the biofilm ph in response to salivary solutions containing glucose. anaerobic glycolysis in the model biofilms created a mildly acidic environment. decrease in ph in different areas of the biofilms varied, and distinct extracellular ph-microenvironments were conserved over several hours. conclusions/significance: the designed biofilm model represents a promising tool to determine the effect of potential therapeutic agents on biofilm growth, composition and extracellular ph. ratiometric ph analysis using c-snarf-4 gives detailed insight into the ph landscape of living biofilms and contributes to our general understanding of metabolic processes in in-vivo-grown bacterial biofilms.

TI  == mitis group streptococci express variable pilus islet 2 pili.
AB  == background: streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus sanguinis are members of the mitis group of streptococci and agents of oral biofilm, dental plaque and infective endocarditis, disease processes that involve bacteria-bacteria and bacteria-host interactions. their close relative, the human pathogen s. pneumoniae uses pilus-islet 2 (pi-2)-encoded pili to facilitate adhesion to eukaryotic cells. methodology/principal findings: pi-2 pilus-encoding genetic islets were identified in s. oralis, s. mitis, and s. sanguinis, but were absent from other isolates of these species. the pi-2 islets resembled the genetic organization of the pi-2 islet of s. pneumoniae, but differed in the genes encoding the structural pilus proteins pita and pitb. two and three variants of pita (a pseudogene in s. pneumoniae) and pitb, respectively, were identified that showed approximately 20% difference in nucleotide as well as corresponding protein sequence. species-independent combinations of pita and pitb variants indicated prior intra- and interspecies horizontal gene transfer events. polyclonal antisera developed against pita and pitb of s. oralis type strain atcc35037 revealed that pi-2 pili in oral streptococci were composed of pita and  pitb. electronmicrographs showed pilus structures radiating >700 nm from the bacterial surface in the wild type strain, but not in an isogenic pi-2 deletion mutant. anti-pitb-antiserum only reacted with pili containing the same pitb variant, whereas anti-pita antiserum was cross-reactive with the other pita variant. electronic multilocus sequence analysis revealed that all pi-2-encoding  oral streptococci were closely-related and cluster with non-pi-2-encoding s. oralis strains. conclusions/significance: this is the first identification of pi-2 pili in mitis group oral streptococci. the findings provide a striking example of intra- and interspecies horizontal gene transfer. the pi-2 pilus diversity provides a possible key to link strain-specific bacterial interactions  and/or tissue tropisms with pathogenic traits in the mitis group streptococci.

TI  == thermal treatments modulate bacterial adhesion to dental enamel.
AB  == numerous studies have demonstrated the effects of laser-induced heat on demineralization of enamel; however, no studies have investigated the link between heat/laser-induced changes in physicochemical properties and bacterial adhesion. in this study, we investigated the effects of thermal treatment on surface properties of enamel such as hydrophobicity and zeta potential. bacterial adhesion to treated surfaces was characterized by confocal laser scanning microscopy, and adhesion force was quantified by atomic force microscopy. the hydrophobicity of enamel increased after heating (p < 0.05), and the zeta potential of heated enamel became more negative than that of the control (p < 0.01). streptococcus oralis and s. mitis were more hydrophilic than s. sanguis, with more negative zeta potential (all p < 0.01). s. mitis and s. oralis occupied significantly less area on enamel after being heated (p < 0.05). heating reduced  the adhesion force of both s. mitis and s. oralis to enamel with or without saliva coating. reduction of adhesion force was statistically significant for s.  mitis (p < 0.01), whereas that of s. oralis was not statistically significant (p  > 0.05). heating did not affect the adhesion of s. sanguis with or without saliva coating. in conclusion, thermal treatment and photothermal/laser treatments may modulate the physicochemical properties of enamel, preventing the adhesion of some bacterial species.

AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate the species distribution, antimicrobial susceptibility and erythromycin-penicillin resistance mechanisms of viridans streptococci (vgs) isolates from blood cultures of adult patients with underlying diseases. fifty vgs blood culture isolates were screened for their antibiotic susceptibilities against penicillin g, erythromycin and tetracycline by e-test. clindamycin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, levofloxacin, linezolid and vancomycin  susceptibility were performed by broth microdilution method. erythromycin and penicillin resistance genotypes, ermb and mefa/e, pbp1a, pbp2b and pbp2x are amplified using pcr method. the clinical isolates included streptococcus mitis (n. 19), s.oralis (n. 13), s.sanguinis, s.parasanguinis (n. 6, each), s.salivarius, s.vestibularis (n. 2, each), s.constellatus, s.sobrinus (n. 1, each). the percentage resistance against erythromycin and penicillin was 36% and  30%, respectively. the genotypic carriage rate of erythromycin resistance genes were: 56% ermb, 28% mefe, 8% ermb+mefe. penicillin-resistant isolates carried pbp2b (33.3%) and pbp2x (20%) genes. twenty-four vgs isolates were recovered from patients with cancer. s.mitis and s.oralis predominated among patients with cancer who had erythromycin and penicillin resistance isolates. the importance of classical antimicrobial agents like penicillin and erythromycin warrants the continuous surveillance of invasive vgs isolates and can guide better treatment options especially in patients with underlying diseases.

TI  == microflora in maxillofacial infections--a changing scenario?
AB  == purpose: advances in isolation and culturing techniques have brought the role of  anaerobic bacteria-causing maxillofacial infections to the fore. recent literature also favors the role of anaerobes in maxillofacial infections. a prospective clinical and microbiological study was designed to check the validity of such claims. patients and methods: this study included 88 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. pus was obtained by aspirating the involved spaces and culture and sensitivity tests were performed to determine the microbes involved and their sensitivity to various antibiotics. results: upon isolating the various organisms causing infection, it was found that 68.2% were aerobes, 13.6% were mixed infections, and 9.1% were anaerobes. streptococcus and peptostreptococcus species were the most common among aerobes and anaerobes, respectively. on determining sensitivity to penicillin, 81.3% were sensitive and  18.8% were resistant. coagulase-negative staphylococcus and staphylococcus aureus were predominantly resistant to penicillin. conclusion: analysis of the results indicated no change in microflora-causing infections in the maxillofacial region  and penicillin remains the drug of choice in treating these infections.

TI  == streptococcus
AB  == the genus streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. among  the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. the nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. for several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: s pyogenes (group a streptococci) and s pneumoniae (pneumococci). in 1984, two members were assigned  a new genus - the group d enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and e faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). in recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. a variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. some of the other medically important streptococci are s agalactiae (group b), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease;  e faecalis (group d), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include s mutans and s sanguis (involved in dental caries), s mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "s milleri" (associated with suppurative  infections in children and adults). there remains persistent taxonomic confusion  regarding "s milleri." these and other streptococci of medical importance are listed intable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.

TI  == antibacterial activity of 15-deoxygoyazensolide isolated from the stems of minasia alpestris (asteraceae) against oral pathogens.
AB  == this work reports the isolation of the sesquiterpene lactone 15-deoxygoyazensolide from the stems of minasia alpestris and the evaluation of its antimicrobial activity against the following oral pathogens: enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and lactobacillus casei. despite the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of other sesquiterpene lactones of the furanoheliangolide-type, our results revealed that this compound exhibits low antibacterial activity against the evaluated oral pathogens; however, an interesting selectivity against e. faecalis (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]=40 microg ml(-1)) and s. sobrinus (mic=60 microg ml(-1)) was observed.

TI  == influence of salvadora persica (miswak) extract on physical and antimicrobial properties of glass ionomer cement.
AB  == aim: to investigate physical and antimicrobial properties of glass ionomer cement (gic) combined with salvadora persica extract (spe). methods: spe was added to gic (fuji ix) in concentrations of 1%, 2% and 4% w/w. the compressive strength and diametral tensile strength were measured at 1 h, 24 h and 7 days. the antimicrobial effect was tested in agar dilution assay in blood agar plates with  candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius and actinomyces naeslundii as test organisms. gic containing 5% chlorhexidine served as positive control. results: significant differences were found for the compressive strength and diametral tensile strength as a result of adding spe to gic (p<0.05). gic with 2 or 4 % spe was significantly weaker than the gic control, while gic with 1% spe was not different from the control. the mean values for the 4% spe-containing specimens and the gic control group ranged from 108.7mpa to 141.1mpa for cs and from 8.2mpa to 12.5mpa for dts. the 1% spe-containing specimens were not different in physical properties compared to the control gic specimens; the 2% spe-containing  specimens were statistically slightly less strong (p<0.05), but within an acceptable range. as compared with pure gic the antimicrobial properties of the spe-containing specimens were increased significantly (p<0.01). it has been found up to a 2-fold increased inhibition compared to the gic with increasing concentrations of spe. for most microorganisms tested the spe group inhibited less than chlorhexidine, but significantly better than pure gic (p<0.01). conclusion: spe could be a promising natural material as an additive to gics. further studies should include in vivo tests and other antimicrobial and physical properties of this combination.

TI  == phenotypic and molecular methods used for identification of oral streptococci and related microorganisms.
AB  == the oral cavity contains the greatest biodiversity, over 70 species being isolated from mouth mucosa, saliva, denture surfaces and/or dental-plaque. the oral streptococci, representing over 80% of the mouth micro flora, are able to synthesize glucosyl-transferases, enzymes involved in glucans production. glucans are involved in production of an extracellular slime layer promoting adhesion and formation of a dental plaque biofilm. the 43 isolates studied obtained from partially and/or totally edentulous, were identified by vitek system using gram-positive identification cards. species-specific regions within the genes coding for glucosyl-transferases (gtf genes) were targeted for pcr identification of isolates. sequencing of 16s rrna was used as gold standard for strain confirmation. vitek system identified a number of 11 strains as s. mitis/oralis,  12 strains as s. anginosus/gordonii, 12 strains as s. sanguinis/parasanguinis, 3  strains as s. salivarius, 3 strains as s. plurianimalium, 1 strain as s. cristatus and 1 strain as s. alactolyticus, respectively. the pcr system targeting gtf genes was able to identify s. oralis, s. salivarius and s. gordonii strains. sequence of 16s rrna discriminated among streptococci species and revealed 16 strains of leuconostoc mesenteroides. many studies are needed in order to select the most reliable phenotypic and genotypic methods in order to improve the identification algorithm for oral streptococci used by clinical laboratories. their accurate identification is mandatory for better understanding their role in human infections.

TI  == molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci in  viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == objectives: ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. however, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (cf) airways has not yet been examined. the aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (vgs), in terms of mics and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs). methods: the mics of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the qrdrs for 190 isolates of vgs, originating from the sputa of adult cf patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. vgs organisms included streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus australis and streptococcus mutans. ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and qrdrs within the gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. results: twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mics >/=8 mg/l) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (mics 4 mg/l). as a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive vgs organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-cf patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. five novel qrdr pcr assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the cf vgs population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential qrdr resistance mutations. double mutations  in gyra and parc/pare led to mics of 16 to >64 mg/l, while single mutations in parc or pare resulted in mics of 8-32 mg/l and 8 mg/l, respectively. the mean homologies of each species to streptococcus pneumoniae r6 were: gyra, 70.3%-95%;  gyrb, 69.6%-96.2%; parc, 76.1%-94.8%; and pare, 70.7%-94.7%. the close relatives  of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). conclusions: treatment of p. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with cf may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal vgs flora, where these organisms may potentially  act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the streptococcus milleri group.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) including streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf).
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) in the sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf). freshly expectorated sputa (n=58) from 45 adult cf patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 190 isolates  of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these  isolates to belong to 12 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis,  s. cristatus, s. gordonii, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. pneumoniae, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis. the most frequently vgs organism isolated was s. salivarius (47/190; 24.7%), followed by s. mitis (36/190; 19%), s. sanguinis (25/190; 13.2%), s. oralis (20/190; 11.0%), s. pneumoniae (19/190; 10.0%), s. parasanguinis (16/190; 8.4%), s. infantis (11/190; 5.8%), s. gordonii (7/190; 3.7%), s. anginosus (4/190; 2.1%), s. cristatus (2/190; 1.1%), s. australis (1/190; 0.5%), s. mutans (1/190; 0.5%) and s. agalactiae (1/190; 0.5%). all, but four, patients harboured at least one vgs species, which ranged from one to five streptococcal species, with a mean of 2.85 species per patient. there was no clonality at the subspecies level employing eric rapd pcr. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) testing against penicillin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. overall, resistance to penicillin with all vgs was 73/190 (38.4%) and 167/190 (87.9%) for erythromycin. with regard to ciprofloxacin, 27/190 (14.2%) were fully resistant, whilst a further 21/190 (11.1%) showed intermediate resistance, which  equated to approximately three quarters (74.7%) of isolates being fully sensitive to this agent. in addition, as a comparator control population, we examined antibiotic susceptibility, as above, in a non-cf population comprising 12 individuals (50 vgs isolates), who were not receiving chronic antibiotics. in comparison, 8% and 38% of vgs isolates from non-cf individuals were resistant by  disk susceptibility testing to penicillin and erythromycin, respectively. none of the non-cf vgs organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin, but 42% showed intermediate resistance.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the essential oil from rosmarinus officinalis and its major components against oral pathogens.
AB  == the essential oil of rosmarinus officinalis l. (rosemary) was obtained by hydro-distillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. sixty-two constituents were identified, representing 98.06% of the total oil content. oxygenated monoterpenes were the predominant components. the rosemary oil was characterized as having prominent (> 5%) contents of camphor (18.9%), verbenone (11.3%), a-pinene (9.6%), beta-myrcene (8.6%), 1,8-cineole (8.0%), and  beta-caryophyllene (5.1%). the antimicrobial activity of the oil as well as of its major constituents was tested against the following microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, and enterococcus faecalis, which are potentially responsible for the formation of dental caries in humans. the microdilution method was used for determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) during evaluation of the antibacterial activity. the essential oil displayed low activity against the selected microorganisms. in the  present study, the pure major compounds were more active than the essential oil.  among all the microorganisms tested, the pathogen s. mitis was the most susceptible and e. faecalis was the most resistant to the evaluated samples. this is the first report on antimicrobial activity of the major components of rosemary oil against oral pathogens.

TI  == anticariogenic properties of ent-pimarane diterpenes obtained by microbial transformation.
AB  == in the present work, the anticariogenic activities of three pimarane-type diterpenes obtained by fungal biotransformation were investigated. among these metabolites, ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol was the most active compound, displaying very promising mic values (ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 mug ml(-1)) against the main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: streptococcus salivarius,  s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and lactobacillus casei. time kill assays performed with ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol against the primary causative agent s. mutans revealed that this compound only avoids growth of the inoculum in the first 12 h (bacteriostatic effect). however, its bactericidal effect is clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). the curve profile obtained by combining ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol and chlorhexidine revealed a  significant reduction in the time necessary for killing s. mutans compared with each of these two chemicals alone. however, no synergistic effect was observed using the same combination in the checkerboard assays against this microorganism. in conclusion, our results point out that ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol is an important metabolite in the search for new effective anticariogenic agents.

TI  == identification of genes for small non-coding rnas that belong to the regulon of the two-component regulatory system ciarh in streptococcus.
AB  == background: post-transcriptional regulation by small rnas (srnas) in bacteria is  now recognized as a wide-spread regulatory mechanism modulating a variety of physiological responses including virulence. in streptococcus pneumoniae, an important human pathogen, the first srnas to be described were found in the regulon of the ciarh two-component regulatory system. five of these srnas were detected and designated csrnas for cia-dependent small rnas. ciarh pleiotropically affects beta-lactam resistance, autolysis, virulence, and competence development by yet to be defined molecular mechanisms. since ciarh is  highly conserved among streptococci, it is of interest to determine if csrnas are also included in the ciarh regulon in this group of organisms consisting of commensal as well as pathogenic species. knowledge on the participation of csrnas in ciarh-dependent regulatory events will be the key to define the physiological  role of this important control system. results: genes for csrnas were predicted in streptococcal genomes and data base entries other than s. pneumoniae by searching for ciar-activated promoters located in intergenic regions that are followed by a transcriptional terminator. 61 different candidate genes were obtained specifying csrnas ranging in size from 51 to 202 nt. comparing these genes among each other revealed 40 different csrna types. all streptococcal genomes harbored csrna genes, their numbers varying between two and six. to validate these predictions, s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. sanguinis were subjected  to csrna-specific northern blot analysis. in addition, a csrna gene from s. thermophilus plasmid pst0 introduced into s. pneumoniae was also tested. each of  the csrnas was detected on these blots and showed the anticipated sizes. thus, the method applied here is able to predict csrnas with high precision. conclusions: the results of this study strongly suggest that genes for small non-coding rnas, csrnas, are part of the regulon of the two-component regulatory  system ciarh in all streptococci.

TI  == [classical and new approaches in laboratory diagnosis of viridans streptococci].
AB  == viridans group streptococci (vgs) are gram-positive microorganisms that can form  alpha-hemolytic colonies on sheep blood agar. they reside as normal flora in oral cavity, respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital tract and on skin. they can cause bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis and septicemia following dental procedures. the diagnosis of vgs are difficult since the taxonomic classification and species na-mes may change due in time. viridans group streptococci are classified into 5 groups (sanguinis, mitis, mutans, salivarius, anginosus) according to biochemical reactions and 16s rrna sequencing. since streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the mitis group, the other important species in this group deserves investigation. genetic exchange between streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis and s.pneumoniae by transformation and lysis mechanisms occur continously as they share the same anatomical region. these mechanisms play role in exchanging capsular and antibiotic resistance genes between these species. the cultivation of vgs usually starts with the inoculation of various patient specimens into sheep blood agar and the detection of alpha-hemolytic colonies. observation of gram-positive cocci microscopically, the detection of optochin-resistant and bile insoluble colonies with few exceptions are the further important steps in laboratory diagnosis. vgs are then identified at species level by using biochemical reactions, automated diagnostic systems and molecular methods. the last step in the laboratory diagnosis of vgs is antibiotic susceptibility testing which is of outmost importance as penicillin and erythromycin resistance are on rise. in this review article, classification of vgs, similarities between s.pneumoniae and mitis group streptococci and the laboratory diagnosis of vgs have been discussed.

TI  == setup of an in vitro test system for basic studies on biofilm behavior of mixed-species cultures with dental and periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: caries and periodontitis are important human diseases associated with formation of multi-species biofilms. the involved bacteria are intensively studied to understand the molecular basis of the interactions in such biofilms. this study established a basic in vitro single and mixed-species culture model for oral bacteria combining three complimentary methods. the setup allows a rapid screening for effects in the mutual species interaction. furthermore, it is easy  to handle, inexpensive, and reproducible. methods: streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, typical inhabitants of the healthy oral cavity, s. mutans as main carriogenic species, and porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, s. intermedius and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as periodontitis-associated bacteria, were investigated for their biofilm forming ability. different liquid growth media were evaluated. safranin-staining allowed monitoring of biofilm formation under the chosen conditions. viable counts and microscopy permitted investigation of biofilm behavior in mixed-species and transwell setups. findings: s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and p. micra failed to form biofilm structures. s. mutans, s. sanguinis, s. intermedius and s. salivarius established abundant biofilm masses in cdm/sucrose. a. actinomycetemcomitans formed patchy monolayers. for in depth analysis s. mitis, s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans were chosen, because i) they are representatives of the physiological-, cariogenic and periodontitis-associated bacterial flora, respectively and ii) their difference in their biofilm forming ability. microscopic analysis confirmed the results of safranin staining. investigation of two species combinations of s. mitis with either s. mutans or a. actinomycetemcomitans revealed bacterial interactions influencing biofilm mass, biofilm structure and cell viability. conclusions: this setup shows safranin staining, microscopic analysis and viable counts together are crucial for basic examination and evaluation of biofilms. our experiment generated meaningful results, exemplified by the noted s. mitis influence, and allows a fast decision about the most important bacterial interactions which should be investigated in depth.

TI  == investigation of supragingival plaque microbiota in different caries status of chinese preschool children by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == this study aimed to detect differences in the richness of total supragingival plaque microbiota as well as the species composition of oral streptococci involved in the different stages of dental caries. forty-five plaque samples were collected from caries-moderate (cm, 4 </= dmfs </= 6), caries-susceptible (cs, dmfs >/= 10), and age-matched caries-free children separately. total dna was isolated directly from each sample, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) analyses using universal and primers specific for oral streptococci were carried out. using 16s rdna pcr-dgge, 34 different species of bacteria were identified in a culture-independent manner and classified into 11 genera according to phylogenetic analysis. among them, mitis group streptococci and campylobacter, which were present in health status, no longer appeared in caries-susceptible samples. in addition, capnocytophaga, burkholderia, and prevotella were found significantly less frequently in the cs group samples (p < 0.05), while there were no significant differences among the prevalence of neisseria, leptotrichia, haemophilus, mutans group streptococci, corynebacterium, and actinomyces in the three groups. further dgge analysis of rnpb gene amplicons obtained with oral streptococci species-specific primers showed that a total of 23 species of oral streptococci were identified. streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis showed a significantly higher prevalence in healthy children (p < 0.05), while that of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus did not vary among the three groups. overall, these results suggest that supragingival plaque microbiota as a  whole undergoes a more complicated shift in the caries process.

TI  == in vitro oral biofilm formation on triclosan-coated sutures in the absence and presence of additional antiplaque treatment.
AB  == purpose: this study evaluated the in vitro plaque inhibitory effect of triclosan-coated polyglactin 910 sutures in the absence and presence of an additional antiplaque agent commonly used after oral surgery. materials and methods: triclosan-coated sutures were incubated for 4 hours in freshly collected human saliva and, when appropriate, subsequently treated with an antiplaque rinse containing chlorhexidine-cetyl pyridinium as active components. sutures without a triclosan-coating served as a control. results: triclosan-coated sutures harbored similar amounts of plaque as did uncoated sutures. exposure to the antiplaque rinse caused significant decreases in viable organisms for uncoated and triclosan-coated sutures. however, after application of the antiplaque rinse, more micro-organisms were found on triclosan-coated than on uncoated sutures. conclusion: sutures coated with triclosan do not provide a sufficient antimicrobial effect to prevent in vitro colonization by oral bacteria, whereas use in combination with a chlorhexidine-cetyl pyridinium-containing antiplaque rinse appears to be counterproductive.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of rosmarinus officinalis against oral pathogens: relevance of carnosic acid and carnosol.
AB  == the in vitro inhibitory activity of crude etoh/h2o extracts from the leaves and stems of rosmarinus officinalis l. was evaluated against the following microorganisms responsible for initiating dental caries: streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and enterococcus faecalis. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined with the broth microdilution method. the bioassay-guided fractionation of the leaf extract, which displayed the higher antibacterial activity than the stem extract, led to the identification of carnosic acid (2) and carnosol (3) as the major compounds in the fraction displaying the highest activity, as identified by hplc analysis.  rosmarinic acid (1), detected in another fraction, did not display any activity against the selected microorganisms. hplc analysis revealed the presence of low amounts of ursolic acid (4) and oleanolic acid (5) in the obtained fractions. the results suggest that the antimicrobial activity of the extract from the leaves of r. officinalis may be ascribed mainly to the action of 2 and 3.

TI  == streptococcus mutans inhibits candida albicans hyphal formation by the fatty acid signaling molecule trans-2-decenoic acid (sdsf).
AB  == in the human mouth, fungi and several hundred species of bacteria coexist. here we report a case of interkingdom signaling in the oral cavity: a compound excreted by the caries bacterium streptococcus mutans inhibits the morphological  transition from yeast to hyphae, an important virulence trait, in the opportunistic fungus candida albicans. the compound excreted by s. mutans was originally studied because it inhibited signaling by the universal bacterial signal autoinducer-2 (ai-2), determined by the luminescence of a vibrio harveyi sensor strain. the inhibitor was purified from cell-free culture supernatants of  s. mutans guided by its activity. its chemical structure was elucidated by using  nmr spectroscopy and gc-ms and proved to be trans-2-decenoic acid. we show that trans-2-decenoic acid does not inhibit ai-2-specific signaling, but rather the luciferase reaction used for its detection. a potential biological role of trans-2-decenoic acid was then discovered. it is able to suppress the transition  from yeast to hyphal morphology in the opportunistic human pathogen candida albicans at concentrations that do not affect growth. the expression of hwp1, a hyphal-specific signature gene of c. albicans, is abolished by trans-2-decenoic acid. trans-2-decenoic acid is structurally similar to the diffusible signal factor (dsf) family of interkingdom-signaling molecules and is the first member of this family from a gram-positive organism (streptococcus dsf, sdsf). sdsf activity was also found in s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. sanguinis, but not in other oral bacteria. sdsf could be relevant in shaping multispecies candida bacteria biofilms in the human body.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI  == [dissertations 25 years after date 21. enhancing resistance to bacteria with chlorhexidine varnish and probiotics].
AB  == the aim of the research described in 'chemotherapy against streptococcus mutans'  was to increase colonization resistance against mutans streptococci by inoculating actinomyces naeslundii on the dentition. actinomyces naeslundii established better after chlorhexidine application than after dental cleansing only but did not exceed the 1% level of the total actinomyces population. this was insufficient to increase the colonization resistance against mutans streptococci. a 33% chlorhexidine varnish was developed. after a single short-term application of the varnish all plaque bacteria were erased. after several hours streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis  and streptococcus gordonii re-established on the surface. actinomyces naeslundii  recovered later, but often with higher numbers. mutans streptococci remained suppressed for months. this led to less acid production in dental plaque and caries reduction. the combination of mechanical cleansing and varnish application resulted in additional pocket reduction. recently, attention is also established  for research on the application ofprobiotics in periodotology.

TI  == partial recn gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus streptococcus.
AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

TI  == microbial interactions influence inflammatory host cell responses.
AB  == the inflammatory response plays an important role in the tissue destruction associated with periodontitis. bacterial species can regulate the inflammatory responses of host cells, triggered by pathogens. it was hypothesized that, in the field of oral microbiology/immunology, such effects of bacterial interactions on  inflammatory host cell responses might also be present. in this study, the effects of beneficial, commensal, and pathogenic species on aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-induced interleukin-8 (il-8) production by human cells were investigated. the beneficial species, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis, were able to lower the il-8 production triggered by a. actinomycetemcomitans. the inhibitory effect was also achieved by the application of streptococcal supernatants. in contrast, the commensal streptococcus gordonii caused no reduction, and the pathogen fusobacterium nucleatum increased il-8 production by the host cells. these results show that bacterial species can influence the inflammatory responses of host cells triggered by infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans.

TI  == poisson analysis of streptococcal bond-strengthening on saliva-coated enamel.
AB  == the forces responsible for bond-strengthening in initial oral bacterial adhesion  are unknown. since lifshitz-van der waals and electrostatic forces work instantaneously upon approach, it is hypothesized that bond-strengthening is governed by hydrogen bonding. poisson analysis of adhesion forces observed during the retraction of bacterial probes from surfaces in atomic force microscopy can be used to analyze the nature of the adhesion forces. streptococcal adhesion forces increased from about -0.7 to -10.3 nn when the contact time between cell surfaces and salivary films on enamel was increased from 0 to 120 sec. initial and final adhesion forces were stronger for initial colonizers of tooth surfaces  (s. mitis, s. sanguinis) than for later, more cariogenic, strains (s. sobrinus, s. mutans). retraction curves after increased contact times showed minor peaks, representative of hydrogen bonds, and poisson analyses indicated repulsive non-specific forces of around +0.3 nn and slightly more attractive hydrogen-bonding forces (-1.0 nn) for initial than for late colonizers (-0.8 nn).

TI  == oral streptococcus species in pre-term and full-term children - a longitudinal study.
AB  == background: despite high clinical significance, the microbiology of the dental biofilm in young children remains poorly understood. aim: the aim of this longitudinal study was to investigate five streptoccocus species commonly found in the oral biofilm of children, namely streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and streptococcus salivarius to determine their relative numbers in caries-free pre-term children,  and age-matched full-term controls. design: plaque and saliva samples were obtained from 15 pre-term children and 15 age-matched controls at ages 3, 6, 12,  18, and 24 months. a quantitative real-time pcr technique was used to determine the numbers of five species of streptococcus using probes and primers specific for each bacterial species. results: all species of streptococcus generally increased from ages 3 to 24 months. the relative ratios of the bacteria remained  fairly constant at all ages studied (p > 0.1). there were no significant differences in numbers of all streptococcus species between pre-term children and full-term controls at all the ages investigated between. conclusion: the results  show that the relative numbers of s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and s. salivarius remain relatively constant from 3 to 24 months of age in caries-free pre- and full-term children.

TI  == interference with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans: colonization of epithelial cells under hydrodynamic conditions.
AB  == introduction: microbial interactions are considered to be important for bacterial colonization. interactions that inhibit colonization of pathogens could possibly  be used as a new treatment approach for periodontitis. the aim of this study was  to test this hypothesis on soft surfaces in vitro, taking into account the hydrodynamic forces continuously present in vivo. methods: cultured epithelial cells were precolonized with streptococcus sanguinis kth-4, streptococcus cristatus cc5a, streptococcus salivarius tove and streptococcus mitis bms before  aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans colonization. experiments were performed in a modified robbins-device-type flow cell. bacterial colonization and the number of epithelial cells were evaluated by microbial culturing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. results: the streptococci were able to inhibit a. actinomycetemcomitans colonization on soft tissue surfaces under flow conditions. statistically significant differences were found between streptococcal pretreatments and the controls, with the most pronounced effect caused by s. sanguinis. conclusion: these data confirm the possibility of applying beneficial  bacteria in periodontal treatment.

TI  == molecular characterization of macrolide resistance determinants [erm(b) and mef(a)] in streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf).
AB  == objectives: although long-term use of azithromycin has shown a significant clinical improvement for patients with cystic fibrosis (cf), its long-term effect on the susceptibility of commensal flora within cf airways has not yet been examined. we therefore suggest that long-term use of azithromycin increases macrolide resistance in commensal streptococci. methods: erythromycin susceptibility in naturally colonizing viridans group streptococci (vgs) was characterized, as well as macrolide resistance gene determinants through sequence analysis, in pneumococci (n = 15) and vgs [n = 84; i.e. streptococcus salivarius  (n = 30), streptococcus mitis (n = 17), streptococcus sanguinis (n = 11), streptococcus oralis (n = 10), streptococcus parasanguinis (n = 6), streptococcus gordonii (n = 3), streptococcus infantis (n = 3), streptococcus cristatus (n = 2), streptococcus anginosus (n = 1) and streptococcus australis (n = 1)] isolated from sputum from 24 adult cf patients, who were on oral azithromycin therapy for  at least the previous 7 months. results: almost three-quarters of isolates (74; 74.7%) were resistant to erythromycin, whilst a further 15 (15.2%) had reduced susceptibility, leaving only 10 (10.1%) isolates susceptible to erythromycin. the majority (89.8%) were not susceptible to erythromycin, as demonstrated by possession of the erm(b) gene in 25/99 (25.3%), the mef(a) gene in 1/99 (1.0%), the mef(e) gene in 75/99 (75.8%) and both erm(b) and mef(e) genes simultaneously  in 11/99 (11.1%). these results indicate that genotypic resistance for macrolides is common in vgs in adult cf patients, with efflux being over three times more frequent. conclusions: long-term treatment with azithromycin in cf patients may reduce antibiotic susceptibility in commensal vgs, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of macrolide resistance determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens.

TI  == bacteriostatic effect of piper betle and psidium guajava extracts on dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == in this study, the bacteriostatic effect of piper betle and psidium guajava extracts on selected early dental plaque bacteria was investigated based on changes in the doubling time (g) and specific growth rates (micro). streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis and actinomyces sp. were cultured in brain heart infusion (bhi) in the presence and absence of the extracts. the growth of bacteria was monitored periodically every 15 min over a period of 9 h to allow for a complete growth cycle. growth profiles of the bacteria in the presence of the extracts were compared to those in the absence and deviation in the g and micro were determined and analyzed. it was found that the g and mu were affected  by both extracts. at 4 mg ml(-1) of p. betle the g-values for s. sanguinis and s. mitis were increased by 12.0- and 10.4-fold, respectively (p < 0.05). at similar  concentration p. guajava increased the g-value by 1.8- and 2.6 -fold, respectively (p < 0.05). the effect on actinomyces sp. was observed at a much lower magnitude. it appears that p. betle and p. guajava extracts have bacteriostatic effect on the plaque bacteria by creating a stressed environment that had suppressed the growth and propagation of the cells. within the context of the dental plaque, this would ensure the attainment of thin and healthy plaque. thus, decoctions of these plants would be suitable if used in the control of dental plaque.

TI  == levofloxacin versus azithromycin on the oropharyngeal carriage and selection of antibacterial- resistant streptococci in the microflora of healthy adults.
AB  == objective: to determine the proportion of subjects with oropharyngeal streptococci resistant to either levofloxacin or azithromycin prior to and during antibacterial exposure, and to follow temporal changes in the proportion of resistant and susceptible isolates through 6 weeks post-exposure. this randomized, open-label, single-center study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: nct00821782). research design and methods: a total of 143 healthy volunteers (levofloxacin, n = 71; azithromycin, n = 72) without antibacterial exposure in the previous 90 days received either levofloxacin 750 mg once daily for 5 days or azithromycin 500 mg once daily on day 1 and 250 mg once daily on days 2 through 5. oropharyngeal cultures were obtained pre-exposure, at day 5, and at 2, 4, and 6 weeks post-dosing. bacterial strains were identified and the minimum inhibitory concentrations for levofloxacin and azithromycin were determined. results: at study entry 117 streptococci were isolated from 72 subjects randomized to azithromycin and 53 (45.3%) were azithromycin-resistant. none of the 121 streptococci isolated from 71 subjects randomized to.levofloxacin were colonized by a levofloxacin-resistant microorganism prior to dosing. at the  end of dosing, the number of subjects with resistant streptococci (s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, or alpha streptococcus species [spp.]) increased in azithromycin-exposed subjects and resistant isolates remained through 6 weeks post-dosing. in contrast, a small number of levofloxacin-resistant streptococci were observed at the end of dosing but decreased by week 2 post-dosing and continued to decrease through the 6-week evaluation period (p < 0.001 azithromycin vs. levofloxacin for s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis and alpha streptococcus spp. at week 6). limitations of this study included the fact that,  since previous antibiotic use was self-reported, genetic typing was not done. the results of this study may not be completely generalizable, because subjects in this study received study drug under directly-observed conditions, thus ensuring  compliance. conclusions: both antibacterial agents were well tolerated. levofloxacin 750 mg administered for 5 days was associated with less microbial resistance than that observed with azithromycin in healthy subjects.

TI  == distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in five different intra-oral habitats in young children.
AB  == background: knowledge of the colonization patterns and composition of the oral microbiota can lead to a better understanding of disease initiation. aim: the aim of this study was to examine the distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in  samples from five different oral habitats in young greek children. design: ninety-three children 3-12 years old (mean + sd 7.9 +/- 2.5) (60.2% male, 39.8% female) participated and split into three different age groups: primary (3-6 years), early mixed (6-9 years), and mixed dentition (9-12 years). samples for bacterial enumeration were taken from saliva, supragingival and subgingival plaque, tongue dorsum, and soft tissues from each child, and were further analysed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: mean counts and proportions of all the test bacteria differed significantly among sample locations. cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all healthy children. mean  proportions of streptococcus mutans isolated from soft tissue and streptococcus sanguinis from soft tissue, subgingival and saliva samples increased significantly with age, whereas the opposite was seen for lactobacillus acidophilus. conclusions: cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all young children. soft tissues, saliva, and tongue were more often colonized by cariogenic streptococcal species than teeth. these surfaces may serve as reservoirs for oral pathogens, requiring attention during preventive interventions.

TI  == effects of alpha-amylase and its inhibitors on acid production from cooked starch by oral streptococci.
AB  == this study evaluated acid production from cooked starch by streptococcus mutans,  streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus mitis, and the  effects of alpha-amylase inhibitors (maltotriitol and acarbose) and xylitol on acid production. streptococcal cell suspensions were anaerobically incubated with various carbohydrates that included cooked potato starch in the presence or absence of alpha-amylase. subsequently, the fall in ph and the acid production rate at ph 7.0 were measured. in addition, the effects of adding alpha-amylase inhibitors and xylitol to the reaction mixture were evaluated. in the absence of  alpha-amylase, both the fall in ph and the acid production rate from cooked starch were small. on the other hand, in the presence of alpha-amylase, the ph fell to 3.9-4.4 and the acid production rate was 0.61-0.92 micromol per optical density unit per min. these values were comparable to those for maltose. when using cooked starch, the fall in ph by s. sanguinis and s. mitis was similar to that by s. mutans and s. sobrinus. for all streptococci, alpha-amylase inhibitors caused a decrease in acid production from cooked starch, although xylitol only decreased acid production by s. mutans and s. sobrinus. these results suggest that cooked starch is potentially acidogenic in the presence of alpha-amylase, which occurs in the oral cavity. in terms of the acidogenic potential of cooked starch, s. sanguinis and s. mitis were comparable to s. mutans and s. sobrinus. alpha-amylase inhibitors and xylitol might moderate this activity.

TI  == pimarane-type diterpenes: antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens.
AB  == seven pimarane type-diterpenes re-isolated from viguiera arenaria baker and two semi-synthetic pimarane derivatives were evaluated in vitro against the following main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: streptococcus salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis and lactobacillus casei. the compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid (pa); ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol; ent-15-pimarene-8beta,19-diol; ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-acetoxy and the sodium salt derivative of pa were the most active compounds, displaying mic values ranging from 2 to 8 microg ml(-1). thus, this class of compounds seems promising as a class of new effective anticariogenic agents. furthermore, our results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new natural compounds that could be employed in the development of oral care products.

TI  == phylogenetic analyses and detection of viridans streptococci based on sequences and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of the rod shape-determining protein  gene.
AB  == background: population analysis of viridans streptococci is important because these species are associated with dental caries, bacteremia, and subacute endocarditis, in addition to being important members of the human oral commensal  microbiota. design: in this study, we phylogenetically analyzed the rod shape-determining protein gene (roda), which is associated with cellular morphology, cell division, and sensitivity for antibiotics, and demonstrated that the diversity of the roda gene is sufficient to identify viridans streptococci at the species level. moreover, we developed a more convenient denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) method based on the diversity of the roda gene (roda-dgge) for detecting nine dominant streptococcal species in human saliva, namely, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus vestibularis,  streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus. results: this roda-dgge method proved useful in detecting viridans streptococci without cultivation, isolation, and phenotypic characterization. conclusion: analysis of the oral microbiota by roda-dgge offers a higher resolution than the  conventional dgge using 16s rdna and may be an alternative in the microbial diagnosis of streptococcal infection.

TI  == streptococcus cristatus attenuates fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  == background and objective: oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, streptococcus cristatus. material and methods: kb, tert-2, tr146  and scc15 cells were cocultured with f. nucleatum and s. cristatus, either alone  or in combination, at 37 degrees c in 5% co2 under various conditions. the mrna expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay. results: f. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas s. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. when present together, s. cristatus attenuated the f. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. the inhibitory effect of s. cristatus was independent of its  viability and its co-aggregation with f. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. conclusion: our data suggest that s. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to f. nucleatum challenge.

TI  == a quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

TI  == [effects of oral streptococci on biofilm formation by cariogenic bacteria in dual species cultures].
AB  == the effects of oral commensal streptococci (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus salivarius) on biofilm formation by cariogenic mutans streptococci (streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus) were investigated. cell suspensions were cultured on 96-well microtiter plates coated with or without salivary components (sc), and in flow cell systems coated with sc in tryptic soy broth including 0.25% sucrose without dextrose (tsb). the resultant biofilm formations were stained using safranin or a live/dead baclight viability kit, and examined with absorbance at 492 nm or using confocal laser scanning microscopy. mutans streptococci and s. sanguinis biofilms were formed significantly on the polystyrene surfaces in tsb.  further, in combination cultures, s. sanguinis formed a sufficient biofilm when cultured with s. mutans. however, when s. sanguinis was cultured with s. sobrinus, biofilm formation was slightly inhibited. s. gordonii also inhibited biofilm formation in the culture with s. sobrinus, but not when cultured with s.  mutans. s. mitis and s. salivarius collapsed the biofilm morphology and inhibited volume development in some conditions when cultured with s. mutans or s. sobrinus. biofilm formation by mutans streptococci was challenged and collapsed on the whole by culturing with each of the other oral streptococci. these results indicate that co-culturing of multiple species of mutans streptococci and other oral streptococci has physical effects related to previous attachment and colonization on the surface, as well as biological effects to regulate biofilm formation.

TI  == interactions between salivary bifidobacterium adolescentis and other oral bacteria: in vitro coaggregation and coadhesion assays.
AB  == coaggregation assays were performed to investigate interactions between oral bifidobacterium adolescentis and other oral bacterial species. bifidobacterium adolescentis olb6410 isolated from the saliva of healthy humans did not coaggregate with actinomyces naeslundii jcm8350, streptococcus mitis ols3293, streptococcus sanguinis jcm5708, veillonella parvula atcc17745 or porphyromonas gingivalis ob7124, but it did coaggregate with fusobacterium nucleatum jcm8532. subsequent examination of biofilm formation on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite discs using fish revealed that b. adolescentis olb6410 could not directly adhere to the coated discs. it did, however, adhere to biofilms of a. naeslundii, v. parvula, and f. nucleatum, although it did not coaggregate with a. naeslundii nor with v.  parvula. these results suggest that the adhesion of b. adolescentis to tooth surfaces is mediated by other oral bacteria. heat- or proteinase k-treated f. nucleatum could not coaggregate with b. adolescentis. similarly, the coaggregation and coadhesion of proteinase k-treated b. adolescentis were strongly inhibited. it is therefore probable that proteinaceous factors on the cellular surface of b. adolescentis and f. nucleatum are involved in their interaction. the data presented in this study add to our understanding of bifidobacterial colonization in the human oral cavity.

TI  == identification of species of viridans group streptococci in clinical blood culture isolates by sequence analysis of the rnase p rna gene, rnpb.
AB  == objectives: viridans group streptococci (vgs) cause severe diseases such as infective endocarditis and septicaemia. genetically, vgs species are very close to each other and it is difficult to identify them to species level with conventional methods. the aims of the present study were to use sequence analysis of the rnase p rna gene (rnpb) to identify vgs species in clinical blood culture  isolates, and to compare the results with the api 20 strep system that is based on phenotypical characteristics. methods: strains from patients with septicaemia  or endocarditis were analysed with pcr amplification and sequence analysis of the rnpb gene. clinical data were registered as well. results: one hundred and thirty two vgs clinical blood culture isolates from patients with septicaemia (n=95) or  infective endocarditis (n=36) were analysed; all but one were identified by rnpb. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus gordonii strains  were most common in the patients with infective endocarditis. in the isolates from patients with haematological diseases, streptococcus mitis and s. oralis dominated. in addition in 76 of the isolates it was possible to compare the results from rnpb analysis and the api 20 strep system. in 39/76 (51%) of the isolates the results were concordant to species level; in 55 isolates there were  no results from api 20 strep. conclusion: sequence analysis of the rnase p rna gene (rnpb) showed that almost all isolates could be identified. this could be of importance for evaluation of the portal of entry in patients with septicaemia or  infective endocarditis.

AB  == oral microbes that colonize in the mouths of humans contribute to disease susceptibility, but it is unclear if host genetic factors mediate colonization. we therefore tested the hypothesis that the levels at which oral microbes colonize in the mouth are heritable. dental plaque biofilms were sampled from intact tooth surfaces of 118 caries-free twins. an additional 86 caries-active twins were sampled for plaque from carious lesions and intact tooth surfaces. using a reverse capture checkerboard assay the relative abundance of 82 bacterial species was determined. an integrative computational predictive model determined  microbial abundance patterns of microbial species in caries-free twins as compared to caries-active twins. heritability estimates were calculated for the relative microbial abundance levels of the microbial species in both groups. the  levels of 10 species were significantly different in healthy individuals than in  caries-active individuals, including, a. defectiva, s. parasanguinis, s. mitis/oralis, s. sanguinis, s. cristatus, s. salivarius, streptococcus sp. clone  ch016, g. morbillorum and g. haemolysans. moderate to high heritability estimates were found for these species (h(2) = 56%-80%, p < .0001). similarity of the overall oral microbial flora was also evident in caries-free twins from multivariate distance matrix regression analysis. it appears that genetic and/or  familial factors significantly contribute to the colonization of oral beneficial  species in twins.

TI  == reduction of periodontal pathogens adhesion by antagonistic strains.
AB  == introduction: periodontitis results from a shift in the subgingival microflora into a more pathogenic direction with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans considered as periodontopathogens. in many cases, treatment procures only a temporary shift towards a less pathogenic microflora. an alternative treatment could be the deliberate colonization of pockets with antagonistic microorganisms to control the adhesion of periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to identify bacterial strains that reduce adhesion of periodontopathogens to surfaces. methods: streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus crista, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces naeslundii, and haemophilus parainfluenzae were  evaluated as potential antagonists against p. gingivalis atcc 33277, p. intermedia atcc 49046, and a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718 as periodontopathogens. adhesion of periodontopathogens to the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber was studied in the absence (control) and the presence of pre-adhering antagonistic strains up to a surface coverage of 5%. results: the largest reduction caused by antagonistic strains was observed for p. gingivalis.  all antagonistic strains except s. crista atcc 49999 inhibited the adhesion of p. gingivalis by at least 1.6 cells per adhering antagonist, with the largest significant reduction observed for a. naeslundii atcc 51655 (3.8 cells per adhering antagonist). adhering antagonists had a minimal effect on the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718. intermediate but significant reductions were perceived for p. intermedia, most notably caused by s. mitis bms. conclusion: the adhesion of p. gingivalis was inhibited best by antagonistic strains, while s. mitis bms appeared to be the most successful antagonist.

TI  == antibacterial activity of triterpene acids and semi-synthetic derivatives against oral pathogens.
AB  == triterpene acids (ursolic, oleanoic, gypsogenic, and sumaresinolic acids) isolated from miconia species, along with a mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids and a mixture of maslinic and 2-a-hydroxyursolic acids, as well as ursolic  acid derivatives were evaluated against the following microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, and enterococcus faecalis, which are potentially responsible for the formation of dental caries in humans. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) during the evaluation of the antibacterial activity. all the  isolated compounds, mixtures, and semi-synthetic derivatives displayed activity against all the tested bacteria, showing that they are promising antiplaque and anticaries agents. ursolic and oleanolic acids displayed the most intense antibacterial effect, with mic values ranging from 30 microg/ml to 80 microg/ml.  the mic values of ursolic acid derivatives, as well as those obtained for the mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids showed that these compounds do not have higher antibacterial activity when compared with the activity observed with either ursolic acid or oleanolic acid alone. with regard to the structure-activity relationship of triterpene acids and derivatives, it is suggested that both hydroxy and carboxy groups present in the triterpenes are important for their antibacterial activity against oral pathogens.

TI  == guiding periodontal pocket recolonization: a proof of concept.
AB  == the complexity of the periodontal microbiota resembles that of the gastro-intestinal tract, where infectious diseases are treatable via probiotics.  in the oropharyngeal region, probiotic or replacement therapies have shown some benefit in the prevention of dental caries, otitis media, and pharyngitis, but their effectiveness in the treatment of periodontitis is unknown. therefore, this study addressed the hypothesis that the application of selected beneficial bacteria, as an adjunct to scaling and root planing, would inhibit the periodontopathogen recolonization of periodontal pockets. analysis of the data showed, in a beagle dog model, that when beneficial bacteria were applied in periodontal pockets adjunctively after root planing, subgingival recolonization of periodontopathogens was delayed and reduced, as was the degree of inflammation, at a clinically significant level. the study confirmed the hypothesis and provides a proof of concept for a guided pocket recolonization (gpr) approach in the treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == the effect of mango and neem extract on four organisms causing dental caries: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivavius, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus sanguis: an in vitro study.
AB  == background and objectives: chewing twigs of the mango or neem tree is a common way of cleaning the teeth in the rural and semi-urban population. these twigs are also believed to possess medicinal properties. the present study was conducted to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of these chewing sticks on the microorganisms  streptococcus mutans , streptococcus salivarius , streptococcus mitis , and streptococcus sanguis which are involved in the development of dental caries. an  additional objective was to identify an inexpensive, simple, and effective method of preventing and controlling dental caries. materials and methods: the sticks were sun dried, ground into a coarse powder, and weighed into 5 gm, 10 gm, and 50 gm amounts. these were added to 100 ml of deionized distilled water. after soaking for 48 h at 4 degrees c, the water was filtered. the filtrate was inoculated onto blood agar plates containing individual species of microorganisms and incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 h. results: mango extract, at 50% concentration, showed maximum zone of inhibition on streptococcus mitis . neem extract produced the maximum zone of inhibition on streptococcus mutans at 50% concentration. even at 5% concentration neem extract showed some inhibition of growth for all the four species of organisms. interpretation and conclusion: a combination of neem and mango chewing sticks may provide the maximum benefit. we  recommend the use of both the chewing sticks.

TI  == in vitro inhibition of oral streptococci binding to the acquired pellicle by algal lectins.
AB  == aims: the initial colonization of the tooth by streptococci involves their attachment to adsorbed components of the acquired pellicle. avoiding this adhesion may be successful in preventing caries at early stages. salivary mucins  are glycoproteins that when absorbed onto hydroxyapatite may provide binding sites for certain bacteria. algal lectins may be especially interesting for oral  antiadhesion trials because of their great stability and high specificity for mucins. this work aimed to evaluate the potential of two algal lectins to inhibit the adherence of five streptococci species to the acquired pellicle in vitro. methods and results: the lectins used were extracted from bryothamnion triquetrum (btl) and bryothamnion seaforthii (bsl). fluorescence microscopy was applied to visualize the ability of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled lectins to attach to the pellicle and revealed a similar capability for both lectins. streptococcal adherence assays were performed using saliva-coated microtitre plates. bsl inhibited more than 75% of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sobrinus and streptococcus mutans adherence, achieving 92% to the latter. btl only obtained statistically significant results on s. mitis and s. sobrinus, whose adherence was decreased by 32.5% and 54.4%, respectively. conclusion: algal lectins are able to inhibit streptococcal adherence. significance and impact of the study: our results support the proposed application of lectins in antiadhesion therapeutics.

TI  == inhibition of bacterial adherence to saliva-coated through plant lectins.
AB  == in the present study, we evaluated the ability of lectin from talisia esculenta (tel) and a protein from labramia bojeri seeds (labramin) to inhibit adherence of microorganisms and exert antimicrobial effects. the minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of these proteins were determined using 5 species of  bacteria: streptococcus mutans ua159, streptococcus sobrinus 6715, streptococcus  sanguinis atcc10556, streptococcus mitis atcc903 and streptococcus oralis pb182.  in addition, an adherence assay was performed using these 5 bacterial species and sterile polystyrene microtiter plates coated with human saliva. filtered protein  solutions (6.25 to 100 mug/ml) were added to saliva-coated plates, and the plates were then incubated for 1 h at 37 degrees c. after incubation, the plates were washed, and a bacterial suspension (10(6 )cfu/ml) was then transferred to each plate, followed by incubation at 37 degrees c for 1 h (10% co(2)). adherence of bacteria to the acquired pellicle was visualized by staining with crystal violet, and absorbance was measured using a plate reader at 575 nm. neither labramin nor  tel, at any of the concentrations used, inhibited growth of any of the microorganisms. however, labramin inhibited adherence of s. mutans and s. sobrinus. the present results indicate that labramin is potentially useful as a biofilm-inhibiting drug.

TI  == bacteria interfere with a. actinomycetemcomitans colonization.
AB  == it is known that beneficial bacteria can suppress the emergence of pathogenic bacteria, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. this study examined the potential for a similar suppression of aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus)  actinomycetemcomitans colonization of epithelial cells, due to its potential relevance in periodontal diseases. seven presumed beneficial bacteria were examined for their ability to interfere, exclude, or displace a. actinomycetemcomitans from epithelial cells in vitro. streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus salivarius showed prominent inhibitory effects on either a. actinomycetemcomitans recovery or colonization. these results confirmed the hypothesis that bacterial interactions interfere with a. actinomycetemcomitans colonization of epithelial cells in vitro, and demonstrated the potential beneficial effects of s. mitis, s. salivarius, and s. sanguinis.

TI  == odontogenic bacteria in periodontal disease and resistance patterns to common antibiotics used as treatment and prophylaxis in odontology in spain.
AB  == resistance in streptococci or gram-negative bacteria is associated with antibiotic consumption. scarce information exists on the antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial isolates from patients with periodontitis in countries with high antibiotic consumption, as this is an area in which microbiological testing is not performed in daily practice. the present study was undertaken to explore the susceptibility of bacterial isolates in periodontitis to antibiotics prescribed in odontology in spain as treatment for local infections or prophylaxis for distant focal infections. periodontal samples were  prospectively collected in 48 patients classified by pocket depth of <4 mm and >or=4 mm. species were identified by culture, selecting the five most frequent morphotypes per sample, and polymerase chain reaction (pcr). susceptibility was determined by e-test. a total of 261 isolates were identified: 72.9% patients had streptococcus oralis; 70.8% streptococcus mitis; 60.4% prevotella buccae; 39.6% prevotella denticola; 37.5% fusobacterium nucleatum; 35.4% prevotella intermedia; 25% capnocytophaga spp.; 23% veillonella spp.; 22.9% prevotella melaninogenica and streptococcus sanguis; and <20% other species. streptococcus viridans resistance rates were 0% for amoxicillin, approximately 10% for clindamycin, 9-22% for tetracycline, and for azithromycin ranged from 18.2% for s. sanguis to  47.7% for s. mitis. prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, with amoxicillin resistance ranging from 17.1% in p. buccae to 26.3% in p. denticola. metronidazole resistance was <6% in all prevotella species, while clindamycin resistance ranged from 0 to 21.1%. beta-lactamase production was positive in 54.1% prevotella spp., 38.9% f. nucleatum, 30% capnocytophaga spp., and 10% veillonella spp. in this study, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was the most active antibiotic against all species tested, followed by metronidazole in the case of anaerobes.

TI  == identification of a novel streptococcal gene cassette mediating sos mutagenesis in streptococcus uberis.
AB  == streptococci have been considered to lack the classical sos response, defined by  increased mutation after uv exposure and regulation by lexa. here we report the identification of a potential self-regulated sos mutagenesis gene cassette in the streptococcaceae family. exposure to uv light was found to increase mutations to  antibiotic resistance in streptococcus uberis cultures. the mutational spectra revealed mainly g:c-->a:t transitions, and northern analyses demonstrated increased expression of a y-family dna polymerase resembling umuc under dna-damaging conditions. in the absence of the y-family polymerase, s. uberis cells were sensitive to uv light and to mitomycin c. furthermore, the uv-induced  mutagenesis was almost completely abolished in cells deficient in the y-family polymerase. the gene encoding the y-family polymerase was localized in a four-gene operon including two hypothetical genes and a gene encoding a hdir homolog. electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that s. uberis hdir binds specifically to an inverted repeat sequence in the promoter region of the four-gene operon. database searches revealed conservation of the gene cassette in several streptococcus species, including at least one genome each of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and streptococcus thermophilus strains. in addition, the umuc operon was localized in several mobile dna elements of streptococcus and lactococcus species. we conclude that the hdir-umuc-orf3-orf4 operon represents a novel gene cassette capable of mediating sos mutagenesis among members of the streptococcaceae.

TI  == oral streptococcal strains isolated from odontogenic infections and their susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == the aim of this study was to identify at species level and to investigate the antibiotic susceptibility of oral streptococcal strains isolated from 100 pus samples collected from romanian patients with different odontogenic infections. the isolates were identified at species level using the rapid id 32 strep system  and their susceptibility was testing by the etest, against: penicillin g, ampicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline. for the investigation of  erythromycin resistance phenotype the disk diffusion test was used. the isolates  belonged to several species, with streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis predominating. reduced susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics was found only among the isolates belonging to s. mitis and s. sanguinis groups. resistance to erythromycin was detected among all species, except for: s. constellatus, s. intermedius and s. gordonii, and the m phenotype was established, while resistance to tetracycline was detected within all species but s. gordonii. in contrast, clindamycin was fully active. as most odontogenic infections are mixed  infections, often involving strictly anaerobic bacteria, which are frequently beta-lactamase producers, the association of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor, like amoxiclav, is recommended when the antimicrobial treatment is necessary.

TI  == identification of alpha-hemolytic streptococci by pyrosequencing the 16s rrna gene and by use of vitek 2.
AB  == alpha-hemolytic streptococci are very difficult to identify by phenotypic methods. in this study, a pyrosequencing method for the identification of streptococcal species based on two variable regions of the 16s rrna gene is described. almost all studied streptococcal species (n = 51) represented by their type strains could be differentiated except for some closely related species of the streptococcus bovis or s. salivarius group. the pyrosequencing results of alpha-hemolytic streptococci isolated from blood (n = 99) or from the normal pharyngeal microbiota (n = 25) were compared to the results obtained by the vitek 2 with gp card (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france). as expected, the results of  the two methods did not completely agree, but 93 (75.0%) of the isolates assigned to the same streptococcal group by both methods and 57 (46.0%) reached consistent results at the species level. however, 10 strains remained unidentified by vitek  2, and 4 isolates could not be assigned to any streptococcal group by pyrosequencing. identification of members of the s. mitis and s. sanguinis groups proved difficult for both methods. furthermore, the pyrosequencing analysis revealed great sequence variation, since only 43 (32.3%) of the 133 isolates analyzed by pyrosequencing had sequences identical to a type strain. the variation was greatest in the pharyngeal isolates, slightly lower in the blood culture isolates, and nonexistent in invasive pneumococcal isolates (n = 17) that all had the s. pneumoniae type strain sequence. the resolution of the results obtained by the two methods is impeded by the lack of a proper gold standard.

TI  == relationship between the ability of oral streptococci to interact with platelet glycoprotein ibalpha and with the salivary low-molecular-weight mucin, mg2.
AB  == the oral streptococci streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus oralis are common aetiological agents of infective endocarditis, and their ability to adhere to and induce the aggregation of platelets is thought to be a virulence trait. the platelet glycoprotein gpibalpha has been implicated  as the adhesion receptor for s. sanguinis and s. gordonii, but it is not known if this is the case for s. oralis and other species. the aim of this study was to determine the gpibalpha-interactive capability of a range of oral streptococci and to determine the relationship between this capability and their ability to interact with the salivary constituents that they would encounter in their normal habitat. all platelet-adhesive s. sanguinis strains and most s. gordonii strains  adhered in a gpibalpha-dependent manner, but strains of s. oralis, streptococcus  cristatus, streptococcus parasanguinis and streptococcus mitis had no direct affinity for platelets. those strains that were able to bind gpibalpha also bound to the low-molecular-weight submandibular salivary mucin, mg2, and this interaction was sialic acid-dependent. the data suggest that s. sanguinis and s.  gordonii may be efficient colonizers of platelet vegetations because of their adaptation to recognize sialylated salivary mucins. in contrast, s. oralis does not interact with platelets and so is likely to colonize vegetations through an as yet unidentified mechanism.

TI  == sites in the ch3 domain of human iga1 that influence sensitivity to bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == the influence of regions, other than the hinge, on the susceptibility of human iga1 to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases, was examined using iga1 mutants bearing amino acid deletions, substitutions, and domain swaps. iga1 lacking the tailpiece retained its susceptibility to cleavage by all of the iga1  proteases. the domain swap molecule alpha1alpha2gamma3, in which the ch3 domain of iga1 was exchanged for that of human igg1, was resistant to cleavage with the  type 1 and 2 serine iga1 proteases of neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and haemophilus influenzae, but remained sensitive to cleavage with  the metallo-iga1 proteases of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis. substitution of the iga1 calpha3  domain motif pro440 -phe443 into the corresponding position in the cgamma3 domain of alpha1alpha2gamma3 resulted now in sensitivity to the type 2 iga1 protease of  n. meningitidis, indicating the possible requirement of these amino acids for sensitivity to this protease. for the h. influenzae type 2 protease, resistance of an iga1 mutant in which the ch3 domain residues 399-409 were exchanged with those from igg1, but sensitivity of mutant hubovalpha3 in which the calpha3 domain of bovine iga replaces that of human iga1, suggests that ch3 domain residues glu403, gln406, and thr409 influence sensitivity to this enzyme. hence,  unlike the situation with the metallo-iga1 proteases of streptococcus spp., the sensitivity of human iga1 to cleavage with the serine iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus involves their binding to different sites specifically in the ch3 domain.

AB  == the adhesion of early settlers of dental plaque to the tooth surface has a role in the initiation of the development of dental plaque. the hydrophobic surface properties of the bacteria cell wall are indirectly responsible for the adhesion  of the bacteria cell to the acquired pellicle on the tooth surfaces. in this study, the effect of aqueous extract of two plants (psidium guajava and piper betle) on the cell-surface hydro-phobicity of early settlers of dental plaque was determined in vitro. hexadecane, a hydrocarbon was used to represent the hydrophobic surface of the teeth in the oral cavity. it was found that treatment  of the early plaque settlers with 1 mg/ml extract of psidium guajava reduced the  cell-surface hydrophobicity of strep. sanguinis, strep. mitis and actinomyces sp. by 54.1%, 49.9% and 40.6%, respectively. treatment of these bacteria with the same concentration of piper betle however, showed a comparatively lesser effect (< 10%). it was also observed that the anti-adhesive effect of the two extracts on the binding of the early plaque settlers to hexadecane is concentration dependent.

TI  == vancomycin tolerance, a potential mechanism for refractory gram-positive bacteremia observational study in patients with cancer.
AB  == background: the clinical significance of infections caused by vancomycin-tolerant (vt) gram-positive organisms in patients with cancer remains unclear. methods: twenty-five patients with nonenterococcal gram-positive bloodstream infection, which was refractory to vancomycin therapy, were identified by reviewing the infectious diseases consultation database at the tertiary care cancer center. among these, 8 patients in whom vancomycin-tolerance was documented are described. antibiotic tolerance was defined as a > 32 times increase in minimum bactericidal concentration compared with minimum inhibitory concentration. results: eight patients with persistent fever and bacteremia of > 72 hours' duration after the initiation of vancomycin therapy were treated. the median age  of these patients, which included 3 men and 5 women, was 44 years +/- 11 years. solid tumors were more common (6 patients) and 2 patients had acute leukemia. six patients (75%) were neutropenic (absolute neutrophil count < 500/mm3), including  2 breast cancer patients who had undergone autologous stem cell transplantation.  the causative organisms were staphylococcus aureus (n = 3 patients), group g streptococci (n = 2 patients), and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus sanguis (1 patient each). all isolates demonstrated a minimum bactericidal concentration for vancomycin that was at least 32 times greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration. rapid defervescence (< or = 24 h) and resolution of bacteremia occurred with the addition of gentamicin (4 patients) or gentamicin plus rifampin (4 patients). none of these infections recurred after discontinuation of therapy. conclusions: lack of clinical and/or microbiologic response to vancomycin should raise the suspicion of possible infection due to vt gram-positive bacteria, and alternative bactericidal therapy  should be instituted early, especially in patients with underlying immune suppression.

TI  == effect of penicillin resistance on presentation and outcome of nonenterococcal streptococcal infective endocarditis.
AB  == background and aims: most cases of infective endocarditis are caused by nonenterococcal streptococci. the emergence of strains resistant to penicillin is increasingly recognized worldwide. this study sought to assess the effect of penicillin resistance on presentation and outcome of streptococcal endocarditis.  methods: a retrospective study was conducted in a single tertiary care hospital.  results: between august 1996 and december 2004, patients infected with nonenterococcal streptococcal endocarditis and known minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) to penicillin were included in this study. a total of 62 cases were identified: 48 (77%) cases of the streptococcal endocarditis were caused by viridans streptococci. the most common species groups identified were streptococcus mitis in 12 (19%) cases, streptococcus oralis in 9 (15%) cases, streptococcus sanguis in 7 (11%) cases and streptococcus mutans in 7 (11%) cases. there were 36 male and 26 female patients with a median age of 46 years (range: 1-85). twenty-two patients (35%) had peripheral embolization and 10 patients (16%) died in hospital. twenty-eight (45%) of the 62 patients were infected with  streptococcal strains of mics > or =0.125 microg/ml to penicillin. infection with streptococcal strains of mics > or =0.125 microg/ml to penicillin was associated  with a lower incidence of all-site embolization, but was not associated with higher mortality or increased frequency of surgery. conclusions: high-level penicillin resistance of the streptococci responsible for endocarditis was increasingly common and medical therapy with vancomycin had a good response. penicillin resistance was associated with a decreased risk of embolization, but was not associated with higher mortality.

TI  == effect of a stannous fluoride dentifrice on the sulcular microbiota: a prospective cohort study in subjects with various levels of periodontal inflammation.
AB  == objectives: to assess the effects of an experimental 0.454% stannous fluoride (snf2) dentifrice on the oral sulcular microbiota in patients with various stages of oral diseases using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. material and methods:  in the present one-month, single center, single product, prospective cohort trial, 37 adults (mean age 37.6) were assigned to one of four oral health condition cohorts with seven to 10 subjects each: 1. mild gingivitis, 2. marked generalized gingivitis to moderate periodontitis, 3. caries-prone and 4. treated  moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis in supportive periodontal care. all four groups were asked to use the test dentifrice and a power toothbrush twice a  day for one minute during a four-week test period. before and after the trial period, plaque indices (pii, silness and loe, 1964) and gingival indices (gi, loe and silness, 1963) were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were collected from  all patients at baseline, as well as after two and four weeks. these samples were analyzed for content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: as a result of the only one minute brushing with the stannous fluoride dentifrice, the mean pii at baseline was significantly lower (p < 0.05) from the mean pii at four weeks. no statistically significant differences were found between premolar and molar mean values. moreover, no statistically significant differences were found between the mean gi at baseline and at four weeks. the microbiological analysis showed that at baseline subjects in groups 2  and 4 had significantly higher bacterial loads of bacteria than groups 1, and 3 (i.e. a. actinomyctemcomitans p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola. over the study period, the total bacterial load did not change in groups 2, 3 and 4. in groups 1 and 3, however, an increase in the loads of streptococci spp. were noticed (p < 0.05) including s. mitis, s. intermedius, and s. sanguis (p < 0.01)  suggesting an increase in the presence of early colonizing and health associated  bacteria. conclusion: one minute brushing with a 0.454% stannous fluoride dentifrice did--after four weeks--not affect the subgingival microbial profiles in patients with moderate periodontitis and treated moderate to advanced periodontitis. however, the sulcular microbial profiles of mild gingivitis and caries-prone patients were affected, indicating a shift towards a gingival health associated microbiota in the sulcular region of patients not affected by attachment loss. running head: effect of stannous fluoride on sulcular microbiota.

TI  == interleukin 1alpha increases the susceptibility of rabbits to experimental viridans streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  == major predisposing conditions for infective endocarditis (ie) are the presence of a cardiac platelet-fibrin vegetation and of circulating bacteria with relatively  low susceptibility to microbicidal activity of blood platelets. the influence of  proinflammatory conditions on development of ie is unknown. we studied the effects of the presence of a catheter, inserted to induce platelet-fibrin vegetations, and of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1alpha in rabbit experimental ie. leaving the catheter in place after challenge with viridans streptococci predisposed for experimental ie. ie susceptibility rapidly decreased between 0 to 6 h after catheter removal. the catheter did not predispose for ie by providing a site for bacterial adherence, as almost all explanted catheters were culture negative. to mimic the proinflammatory influence of the catheter, rabbits were injected with interleukin-1alpha at 24 h after catheter removal and  at 0, 1, and 3 h before bacterial challenge. interleukin-1alpha injected 3 h prior to challenge significantly increased ie incidence due to a platelet releasate-susceptible streptococcus oralis strain, with rapidly increasing numbers of bacteria within the vegetations. ie due to the streptococcus sanguis strain less susceptible to platelet releasate was not enhanced. we conclude that  proinflammatory stimuli, either a catheter or interleukin-1alpha, enhanced susceptibility to ie due to the platelet releasate-susceptible s. oralis. as with rabbits, temporary intravascular proinflammatory conditions may predispose for ie in humans at risk for this serious infection.

TI  == viridans streptococci isolated by culture from blood of cancer patients: clinical and microbiologic analysis of 50 cases.
AB  == clinical and microbiologic studies of 50 cases of viridans streptococcal bacteremia in cancer patients were performed. the bacteria were identified to species level by sequencing analysis of the 16s rrna gene. at least nine streptococcus spp. were found, including s. mitis (25 strains, 50.0% of 50); currently unnamed streptococcus spp. (11 strains); s. parasanguis (five strains); s. anginosus (three strains); s. salivarius (two strains); and one strain each of s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. sobrinus, and s. vestibularis. there were no s. oralis strains. among 11 antibiotics of nine classes tested, no resistance to vancomycin, linezolid, or quinupristin-dalfopristin was seen. resistance to penicillin (mic, 4 to 12 mug/ml) was noted only among s. mitis strains (28.0%, 7/25) and not non-s. mitis strains (0/25) (p = 0.004). significantly more s. mitis strains than non-s. mitis strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones and to > or =3 classes of antibiotics. isolation of quinolone-resistant organisms was associated with the prior usage of quinolones (p = 0.002). quantitative blood cultures showed that the strains resistant to levofloxacin or gatifloxacin were associated with higher colony counts than were their corresponding nonresistant strains. the young and elderly patients also had higher levels of bacteremia caused predominantly by s. mitis. septic shock was present in 17 (34.0% of 50) patients, and 13 of those cases were caused by s. mitis (p = 0.007). these results suggest that s. mitis is the most common cause of viridans streptococcal  bacteremia in cancer patients and is more resistant to antibiotics than other species.

TI  == use of phylogenetic and phenotypic analyses to identify nonhemolytic streptococci isolated from bacteremic patients.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate molecular and phenotypic methods for the identification of nonhemolytic streptococci. a collection of 148 strains consisting of 115 clinical isolates from cases of infective endocarditis, septicemia, and meningitis and 33 reference strains, including type strains of all relevant streptococcus species, were examined. identification was performed by phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences of four housekeeping genes, ddl, gdh, rpob, and soda; by pcr analysis of the glucosyltransferase (gtf) gene; and by conventional phenotypic characterization and identification using two commercial kits, rapid id 32 strep and streptogram and the associated databases.  a phylogenetic tree based on concatenated sequences of the four housekeeping genes allowed unequivocal differentiation of recognized species and was used as the reference. analysis of single gene sequences revealed deviation clustering in eight strains (5.4%) due to homologous recombination with other species. this was particularly evident in s. sanguinis and in members of the anginosus group of streptococci. the rate of correct identification of the strains by both commercial identification kits was below 50% but varied significantly between species. the most significant problems were observed with s. mitis and s. oralis  and 11 streptococcus species described since 1991. our data indicate that identification based on multilocus sequence analysis is optimal. as a more practical alternative we recommend identification based on soda sequences with reference to a comprehensive set of sequences that is available for downloading from our server. an analysis of the species distribution of 107 nonhemolytic streptococci from bacteremic patients showed a predominance of s. oralis and s. anginosus with various underlying infections.

TI  == microbial risk indicators of early childhood caries.
AB  == the aim of this study was to use molecular identification methods, such as 16s rna gene sequence and reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization, for identification of the bacteria associated with dental caries and with dental health in a subset of 204 twins aged 1.5 to 7 years old. a total of 448 plaque samples (118 collected from caries-free subjects and 330 from caries-active subjects) were used for analysis. we compared the bacteria found in biofilms of children exhibiting severe dental caries, with different degrees of lesion severity, with those found in biofilms of caries-free children. a panel of 82 bacterial species was selected, and a pcr-based reverse-capture checkerboard method was used for detection. a simple univariate test was used to determine the overabundance and underabundance of bacterial species in the diseased and in the  healthy groups. features identified with this univariate test were used to construct a probabilistic disease prediction model. furthermore, a method for the analysis of global patterns of gene expression was performed to permit simultaneous analysis of the abundance of significant species by allowing cross-bacterial comparisons of abundance profiles between caries-active and caries-free subjects. our results suggested that global patterns of microbial abundance in this population are very distinctive. the top bacterial species found to be overabundant in the caries-active group were actinomyces sp. strain b19sc, streptococcus mutans, and lactobacillus spp., which exhibited an inverse relationship to beneficial bacterial species, such as streptococcus parasanguinis, abiotrophia defectiva, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis,  and streptococcus sanguinis.

TI  == in vitro activity of daptomycin against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == we determined the activity of daptomycin, a recently fda-approved antimicrobial agent, against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria, including viridans group streptococci (16 streptococcus mitis species group, 12 s. mutans species group, 9 s. anginosus species group, 8 s. sanguinis species group, 5 s. salivarius species group) from patients with infective endocarditis, 32 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 32 high-level penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, 38 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (including 1 linezolid-resistant isolate), and the following unusual gram-positive bacteria: 3 listeria monocytogenes, 4 erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, 9 corynebacterium species, 10 abiotrophia/granulicatella species, 2 rothia (stomatococcus) mucilaginosus, and 4 gemella morbillorum. daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)(90) values for the viridans group streptococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, and enterococcus species were 0.5, 0.5, < or =0.125, and 4 microg/ml, respectively. the daptomycin mic range for the unusual gram-positive bacteria was < or =0.125-2 microg/ml. we conclude that daptomycin has in vitro activity against viridans group streptococci associated with endocarditis as well as against several types  of unusual gram-positive bacteria that can cause endocarditis.

TI  == differentiation of mutans streptococci by intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == it is difficult to distinguish mutans streptococci on the species level, and even more so on the subspecies level. intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) (icm) was applied to reference strains of five of the species of the mutans group (streptococcus criceti, streptococcus downei, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus ratti, streptococcus sobrinus), nonmutans streptococci (streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis), and  177 mutans streptococci isolated from saliva of 10 children. from the analysis of the reference strains, readily distinguishable icm mass spectra were obtained for the different species. based on multivariate statistical analysis, a correct and  unambiguous assignment was made of the spectra of 159 isolated mutans streptococci to s. mutans and 16 isolates to s. sobrinus. two isolates were sorted out and were identified by sequencing of their 16s rrna genes as streptococcus anginosus. in addition, icm indicated a misclassification for some  reference strains (aht, v 100 and e 49) and re-classified aht and e 49 as s. ratti and v 100 as s. sobrinus. this was confirmed by 16s rdna sequencing. based  on a statistical similarity analysis of the spectra of reference strains and a quantitative assessment of the reproducibility of icm, the isolates identified as either s. mutans or s. sobrinus were phenotyped on the subspecies level. in the population of the clinical isolates, 14 unambiguously different s. mutans and three different s. sobrinus phenotypes were detected. icm proved to be a powerful tool for a differentiation of mutans streptococci down to the subspecies level.

TI  == the influences of hinge length and composition on the susceptibility of human iga to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == the influences of iga hinge length and composition on its susceptibility to cleavage by bacterial iga1 proteases were examined using a panel of iga hinge mutants. the iga1 proteases of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis strains sk4 and sk49, neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and haemophilus influenzae cleaved iga2-iga1 half hinge, an ab featuring half of the  iga1 hinge incorporated into the equivalent site in iga1 protease-resistant iga2, whereas those of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and s. sanguis strain sk1 did not. hinge length reduction by removal of two of the four c-terminal proline residues rendered iga2-iga1 half hinge resistant to all streptococcal iga1 metalloproteinases but it remained sensitive to cleavage by the serine-type  iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus spp. the four c-terminal proline residues could be substituted by alanine residues or transferred to the n-terminal extremity of the hinge without affect on the susceptibility of the ab  to cleavage by serine-type iga1 proteases. however, their removal rendered the ab resistant to cleavage by all the iga1 proteases. we conclude that the serine-type iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus require the fab and fc regions to be  separated by at least ten (or in the case of n. gonorrhoeae type i protease, nine) amino acids between val(222) and cys(241) (iga1 numbering) for efficient access and cleavage. by contrast, the streptococcal iga1 metalloproteinases require 12 or more appropriate amino acids between the fab and fc to maintain a minimum critical distance between the scissile bond and the start of the fc.

TI  == susceptibilities of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to antibacterial peptides, {beta}-defensins and ll37, produced by human epithelial cells.
AB  == objectives: antimicrobial peptides are one of the factors involved in innate immunity. the susceptibility of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to the major antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelia was investigated. methods: synthetic antimicrobial peptides of human beta-defensin-1 (hbd1), hbd2, hbd3 and  ll37 (cap18) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria. they included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (20 strains), porphyromonas gingivalis (6), prevotella intermedia (7), fusobacterium nucleatum  (7), streptococcus mutans (5), streptococcus sobrinus (5), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus sanguis (4), streptococcus mitis (2) and lactobacillus casei (1). results: although the four peptides had bactericidal activity against all bacteria tested, the degree of antibacterial activity was variable against the different strains and species. the antibacterial activity of hbd1 was lower than that of the other peptides. among the bacteria tested in this study, f. nucleatum was highly susceptible to hbd3 and ll37, and s. mutans was highly susceptible to hbd3. we measured the zeta-potential, representing the net  charge of whole bacteria, to study the relationship between susceptibility to cationic peptide and the net charge of the bacteria. although we found some correlation in a. actinomycetemcomitans strains, we did not find a definite correlation with all the bacterial species. conclusions: these results indicate that beta-defensins and ll37 have versatile antibacterial activity against oral bacteria.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by an oligonucleotide array.
AB  == viridans streptococci (vs) are common etiologic agents of subacute infective endocarditis and are capable of causing a variety of pyogenic infections. many species of vs are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. an oligonucleotide array based on 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic spacer (its) sequences was developed to identify 11 clinically relevant vs. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the method consisted of pcr amplification of the its regions by using  a pair of universal primers, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled pcr products to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides immobilized on a nylon membrane. after 120 strains of the 11 species of vg and 91 strains of other bacteria were tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide array were found to be 100% (120 of 120 strains) and 95.6% (87 of 91 strains), respectively. s. pneumoniae cross-hybridized to the probes used for the identification of s. mitis, and simple biochemical tests such as optochin susceptibility or bile solubility should be used to differentiate s. pneumoniae from s. mitis. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by use of the present oligonucleotide array is accurate and could be used as an alternative reliable method for species identification of strains of vs.

TI  == effect of mutations in the human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) hinge on its susceptibility to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == components of the human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) hinge governing sensitivity to cleavage by bacterial iga1 proteases were investigated. recombinant antibodies with distinct hinge mutations were constructed from a hybrid comprised of human iga2 bearing half of the human iga1 hinge region. this hybrid antibody and all the mutant antibodies derived from it were resistant to cleavage by the iga1 proteases from streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis biovar 1 strains but  were cleaved to various degrees by those of streptococcus pneumoniae, some streptococcus sanguis strains, and the type 1 and 2 iga1 proteases of haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. remarkably, those  proteases that cleave a pro-ser peptide bond in the wild-type iga1 hinge were able to cleave mutant antibodies lacking a pro-ser peptide bond in the hinge, and those that cleave a pro-thr peptide bond in the wild-type iga1 hinge were able to cleave mutant antibodies devoid of a pro-thr peptide bond in the hinge. thus, the enzymes can cleave alternatives to their preferred postproline peptide bond when  such a bond is unavailable. peptide sequence analysis of a representative antibody digestion product confirmed this conclusion. the presence of a cleavable peptide bond near the ch2 end of the hinge appeared to result in greater cleavage than if the scissile bond was at the ch1 end of the hinge. proline-to-serine substitution at residue 230 in a hinge containing potentially cleavable pro-ser and pro-thr peptide bonds increased the resistance of the antibody to cleavage by many iga1 proteases.

TI  == effect of hydrophobicity on in vitro streptococcal adhesion to dental alloys.
AB  == non-specific interactions such as electrostatic interactions, and surface free energy are of importance in bacterial adhesion to dental surfaces as they determine whether or not bacteria are attracted to the surface. the relationship  between adherence of streptococcus mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis and s. sanguinis on precious and non-precious dental alloys, and the bacterial and alloy surface hydrophobicities (a measure of the surface free energy) was studied. the number of adhering bacteria was determined by fluorescence microscopy counts. the hydrophobicity of the bacteria and alloy surfaces were evaluated by adhesion to hexadecane and water contact angles, respectively. our results showed that (i) the surfaces of the tested alloys were hydrophobic, (ii) s. sanguinis, s. mutans  and s. oralis were hydrophobic, and (iii) s. mitis was hydrophilic. s. oralis, the more hydrophobic strain, demonstrated the highest adherence on the tested materials, whereas s. mitis adhered least on the hydrophobic surfaces. for the tested alloys, bacterial adherence was highest for the high gold content alloy, and lowest for the non-precious alloy. our results showed that for the tested bacterial strains, there was a significant correlation between bacterial adhesion and substratum hydrophobicity: hydrophobic metal surfaces favor adhesion of hydrophobic bacteria.

AB  == background & objectives: streptococcal bacteraemia remains a major and challenging clinical problem throughout the world. the epidemiology of these infections appears to be changing. in the present study we analysed the data collected over a period of 20 yr (1978-1999) to throw light on this. methods: laboratory records of all patients yielding clinically significant, non-pneumococcal, nonenterococcal streptococcal bacteraemia were reviewed for the decades 1978-1988 and 1990-1999 in the two districts (combined population 260,000). results: from a total of 3134 patients with detected bacteraemia 338 (10.8%) yielded streptococci. the organisms comprised: in the beta-haemolytic group (n=169), gas (32%), gbs (34%), gcs (5%), ggs (28%), grs (1%); in the non-haemolytic/streptococcus milleri group (n=160): s. milleri (21%), s. bovis (10%), s. sanguis (30%), s.mitis (10%), s. oralis (8%) and other 'viridans' streptococci (20%); nine isolates were of anaerobic streptococci. there was a steady increase in the number of blood cultures submitted for investigation during the period and streptococcal isolations of all species rose in proportion  (approximately x 2.5) in the second decade compared with the first. complementary data on the occurrence of necrotising fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome in these districts suggested a real increase in the occurrence of serious forms of gas infection. interpretation & conclusion: an increase in the level of detected streptococcal bacteraemia was seen in this part of england over 20 yr, involving  a wide variety of different streptococcal species. this represented both improved ascertainment of infection and an increase in the burden of disease in the population.

AB  == the feasibility of sequence analysis of the 16s-23s ribosomal dna (rdna) intergenic spacer (its) for the identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci (vs) was evaluated. the its regions of 29 reference strains (11 species) of vs were amplified by pcr and sequenced. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis,  s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the its lengths (246 to 391 bp) and sequences were highly conserved among strains within a species. the intraspecies similarity scores for the its sequences ranged from 0.98 to 1.0, except for the score for s. gordonii strains.  the interspecies similarity scores for the its sequences varied from 0.31 to 0.93. phylogenetic analysis of the its regions revealed that evolution of the regions of some species of vs is not parallel to that of the 16s rrna genes. one  hundred six clinical isolates of vs were identified by the rapid id 32 strep system (biomerieux vitek, marcy l'etoile, france) and by its sequencing, and the  level of disagreement between the two methods was 18% (19 isolates). most isolates producing discrepant results could be unambiguously assigned to a specific species by their its sequences. the accuracy of using its sequencing for identification of vs was verified by 16s rdna sequencing for all strains except strains of s. oralis and s. mitis, which were difficult to differentiate by their 16s rdna sequences. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by its sequencing is reliable and could be used as an alternative accurate method for identification of vs.

AB  == objective: to investigate the bacterial flora of the gingival plaques of pediatric dental patients in order to establish baseline data for future studies  on the complex microbiota of the oral cavity of this group of child dental patients. subjects and methods: forty subjects, aged 3-12 years, were enrolled and investigated after informed consent was obtained. during the patients' first  visit to the dental clinic supragingival plaque samples were collected from the gingival area of buccal and lingual tooth surfaces of all primary and permanent molar teeth using sterile curettes. serially diluted samples were inoculated onto a set of selective and nonselective media and then incubated at the appropriate atmospheric conditions and temperatures. representative colonies of isolates were identified by standard methods, including hemolytic characteristics on blood agar and profiling on api 20s and api 20a as appropriate. results: a total of 183 isolates (123 aerobes and 60 anaerobes) were recovered from the 40 patients with  a mean count of 3 per sample of aerobes compared to 1.5 per sample for the anaerobes. streptococcus sanguis was the predominant aerobic species (23.6%) isolated from 29 (72.5%) of the 40 patients, followed by streptococcus mitis, 19.5 and 60%, streptococcus salivarius, 17.1 and 52.5% and streptococcus mutans,  17.1 and 52.5%. the frequency of isolation of anaerobic bacteria was prevotella spp. 50% from 30 (75%) of the 40 patients, fusobacterium spp., 18.3 and 27.5%, bacteroides spp., porphyromonas spp. and peptostreptococcus spp., 6.7 and 10%, 6.7 and 10%, and 5 and 7.5%, respectively. prevotella intermedia was the single most common species. conclusion: the results show that there were more aerobic/facultative anaerobic bacteria than the obligate anaerobes in the dental  plaque of the pediatric dental patients in kuwait. the high prevalence of the pioneering streptococci as well as black-pigmented prevotella spp. and fusobacterium spp. indicates that the dental plaques of the children were in the  developing stage, a precursor to the development of periodontal diseases.

TI  == the anti-adherence effect of piper betle and psidium guajava extracts on the adhesion of early settlers in dental plaque to saliva-coated glass surfaces.
AB  == the aqueous extracts of piper betle and psidium guajava were prepared and tested  for their anti-adherence effect on the adhesion of early plaque settlers (strep.  mitis, strep. sanguinis and actinomyces sp.). the saliva-coated glass surfaces were used to simulate the pellicle-coated enamel surface in the oral cavity. our  results showed that the anti-adherence activities of piper betle and psidium guajava extracts towards the bacteria were different between the bacterial species. psidium guajava was shown to have a slightly greater anti-adherence effect on strep. sanguinis by 5.5% and actinomyces sp. by 10% and a significantly higher effect on strep. mitis (70%) compared to piper betle. the three bacterial  species are known to be highly hydrophobic, and that hydrophobic bonding seemed to be an important factor in their adherence activities. it is therefore suggested that the plant extracts, in expressing their anti-adherence activities, could have altered the hydrophobic nature of the bonding between the bacteria and the saliva-coated glass surfaces.

TI  == prevalence and characterization of the mechanisms of macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin resistance in viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the presence of erm genes conferring constitutive and inducible resistance, as well as that of the mefa gene conferring only constitutive resistance, was investigated using pcr in 70 erythromycin resistant (mic>or=1 mg/l) strains of viridans group streptococci (vgs) (18 streptococcus mitis biotype 1, 16 s. mitis  biotype 2, 15 s. oralis, 12 s. salivarius and nine s. sanguis) isolated from the  oropharynx of healthy greek children. all of the 56 isolates belonging to resistance phenotype m harbored the mefa gene. all of the 14 isolates constitutively resistant to macrolides and lincosamides (phenotype cr) harbored the ermb gene. co-presence of both genes was not observed, whereas class a erm gene (previously known as ermtr) was not detected. our results are consistent with a possible role of vgs as a reservoir of resistance genes now prevalent in pathogenic species of streptococci.

TI  == viridans streptococcus bacteremia in children on chemotherapy for cancer: an underestimated problem.
AB  == the authors discuss the morbidity associated with viridans streptococcus bacteremia, and its implications on the choice of antibiotics used as prophylaxis and treatment. they retrospectively studied the case notes of 38 children who were being treated for various malignant conditions in their unit and developed 40 episodes of bacteremia with viridans streptococci between october 1995 and january 1999. viridans streptococci were the third commonest blood culture isolate during this period, after coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus. the majority of the isolates were streptococcus mitis (55%). others were s. sanguis (25%), s. oralis (12.5%), s. salivarius (5%), and s. acidominimus (2.5%). twenty-five percent of the patients had been treated with regimens that included cytosine arabinoside, 60% were receiving prophylactic co-trimoxazole, and 87.5% were neutropenic. thirty percent of patients had abnormal chest x-rays, and 15% were hypotensive; 2 patients required admission to the intensive care unit. initial antibiotic therapy was changed because of failure of clinical response in 60% of cases, despite the infecting organism being sensitive in vitro. this study confirms the importance of viridans streptococci as a cause of bacteremia in pediatric hematology and oncology patients, leading to significant morbidity. further work is required to establish the optimal treatment for viridans streptococcus bacteremia.

TI  == susceptibility of oral bacteria to melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil in vitro.
AB  == the in vitro activity of melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil against 161 isolates of oral bacteria from 15 genera was determined. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) ranged from 0.003 to 2.0% (v/v). mic90 values were 1.0% (v/v) for actinomyces spp., lactobacillus spp., streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis, and 0.1% (v/v) for prevotella spp. isolates of porphyromonas, prevotella and veillonella had the lowest mics and mbcs, and isolates of streptococcus, fusobacterium and lactobacillus had the highest. time kill studies with streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus rhamnosus showed that treatment with > or = 0.5% tea tree oil caused decreases in viability of >3 log colony forming units/ml after only 30 s,  and viable organisms were not detected after 5 min. these studies indicate that a range of oral bacteria are susceptible to tea tree oil, suggesting that tea tree  oil may be of use in oral healthcare products and in the maintenance of oral hygiene.

TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

TI  == identification of streptococcus sanguinis with a pcr-generated species-specific dna probe.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to design a pcr-generated dna probe and determine the specificity of the probe for the identification of clinical isolates of streptococcus sanguinis. to do this, we examined over 200 arbitrarily primed pcr (ap-pcr) amplicon patterns obtained with dna from clinical isolates of s. sanguinis. a 1.6-kb dna amplicon that was common to all ap-pcr profiles was extracted from agarose gels and then cloned and sequenced. a search for a similar sequence in the genbank database with the blastn program revealed that the 1.6-kb dna fragment comprised an intergenic region between two housekeeping genes, uncc  (proton-translocating atpase) and mura (udp-n-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase). three digoxigenin-labeled dna probes were synthesized on the basis  of the sequence of the 1.6-kb fragment: the sequence of probe ssa-1 contained the proton-translocating atpase (uncc) and the entire intergenic region, the sequence of probe ssa-2 contained only the intergenic region, and the sequence of probe ssa-3 contained an internal region of the mura gene. dot blot hybridization showed that the three probes displayed signals for hybridization to both s. sanguinis strain atcc 10556 and the s. sanguinis clinical isolates. probe ssa-1,  however, hybridized to dna from s. oralis and s. mitis. probe ssa-3 hybridized to dna from s. gordonii, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, and s. vestibularis. the probe ssa-2-specific intergenic region appeared to be specific for s. sanguinis. the results from this study suggest that probe ssa-2 may serve as a species-specific dna probe for the identification of clinical isolates of s. sanguinis.

TI  == echocardiographic presentations of endocarditis, and risk factors for rupture of  a sinus of valsalva in childhood.
AB  == background: in recent years, the diagnosis of infective endocarditis has been enhanced by the use of echocardiography. we sought, therefore, to review its effect on the management of endocarditis in children. methods: we reviewed all the patients presenting to our institution for evaluation for infective endocarditis from may 1994 to january 2002. the patients were stratified according to whether or not they had congenitally malformed hearts. results: of the 90 referred patients identified, 46 (51%) had positive ultrasonic findings. of these, we excluded 26 patients because of the presence of indwelling lines. the remaining 20 patients with features of endocarditis had a median age of 6.5 years, and a range from 0.14 to 8.5 years. there were 4 patients with normal hearts, and 16 with congenital cardiac malformations. we identified rupture of a  sinus of valsalva in four patients, with rupture into the left ventricle in two,  and into the right ventricle and right atrium in one each. the mitral valve was involved in six patients, the aortic valve in another six, including all four with rupture of the sinus of valsalva, both mitral and aortic valves in three, the pulmonary trunk in three patients, and the tricuspid valve and a blalock-taussig shunt in one patient each. organisms isolated included streptococcus mitis in 4 patients, streptococcus pneumoniae in 2 patients, streptococcus sanguis in 1, staphylococcus aureus in 3, staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, and enteroccocus in 2. cultures proved negative in 7 patients.  surgical intervention was needed in 12 patients, and one died (5%). only the left-sided chambers were involved in those with normal hearts. both patients infected with streptococcus pneumoniae had rupture of a sinus of valsalva. conclusion: involvement of the left-sided chambers is more likely in structurally normal hearts, and in cases with rupture of a sinus of valsalva, in which case infection with streptococcus pneumonia should be suspected.

TI  == stress as a determinant of saliva-mediated adherence and coadherence of oral and  nonoral microorganisms.
AB  == objective: the mucosal secretory proteins, such as the salivary proteins, play a  key role in the acquisition and regulation of the mucosal microflora. most notably, some microorganisms utilize the host's secretory proteins to adhere to the mucosa; a first step in colonization and infection. the secretory proteins also influence colonization by affecting the binding among microorganisms, a process denoted as coadherence. previously we reported that acute stressors cause specific changes in saliva composition. the present study investigated to what extent these changes influence saliva-mediated microbial adherence and coadherence (ex vivo). methods: thirty-two male undergraduates provided unstimulated saliva before and during a control condition and two stressors: a memory test and a surgery video presentation. we used saliva-coated microplates to test the adherence of bacteria for which the oral cavity is either a natural reservoir (eg, viridans streptococci) or a portal of entry (eg, helicobacter pylori). we also tested the saliva-mediated co-adherence between streptococcus gordonii and the yeast candida albicans. correlation analyses were performed to determine the relationships between changes in microbial adherence and the concentrations of potential salivary ligands, viz. cystatin s, the mucins muc5b and muc7, s-iga, lactoferrin, alpha-amylase, and total salivary protein. results: during the memory test, saliva-mediated adhesion of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, and h. pylori increased, whereas the coadherence of c. albicans with s. gordonii decreased. during the surgical video presentation the saliva-mediated adherence of h. pylori, s. sanguis, and streptococcus mitis increased. these changes were independent of salivary flow rate, but correlated with specific changes in salivary protein composition. conclusion: the results show that even moderate stressors, by altering the activity of the mucosal secretory glands, may affect microbial colonization processes such as adherence and coadherence. this study hereby presents a mechanism by which stress may affect the mucosal microflora and susceptibility to infectious disease.

TI  == real-time interaction of oral streptococci with human salivary components.
AB  == oral streptococci are present in large numbers in dental plaque and several types interact with the enamel salivary pellicle to form a biofilm on tooth surfaces. the respective affinity of individual streptococci for salivary components has an influence on the etiologic properties of oral biofilm in the development of dental caries. we studied real-time biospecific interactions between oral streptococci and salivary components utilizing biosensor technology to analyze surface plasmon resonance. streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans showed  significant responses for binding to salivary components, in comparison with other bacteria. further, the association rates (4.1 x 10-11/bacterium) and dissociation rate (5.7 +/- 0.9 x 10-3 second(s)-1) were higher for s. sanguis than for s. mutans (2.4 x 10-11 and 2.9 +/- 0.8 x 10-3) and streptococcus mitis (1.3 x 10-11 and 3.5 +/- 1.3 x 10-3). however, the association equilibrium constants (8.2 s/bacterium) for s. mutans was 2 times higher in than s. mitis (3.8) and slightly higher than s. sanguis (7.2). these findings may provide useful information regarding the mechanism of early biofilm formation by streptococci on the tooth surface.

TI  == invasion and killing of human endothelial cells by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == colonization of the cardiovascular endothelium by viridans group streptococci can result in infective endocarditis and possibly atherosclerosis; however, the mechanisms of pathogenesis are poorly understood. we investigated the ability of  selected oral streptococci to infect monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec) in 50% human plasma and to produce cytotoxicity. planktonic streptococcus gordonii ch1 killed huvec over a 5-h period by peroxidogenesis (alpha-hemolysin) and by acidogenesis but not by production of protein exotoxins. huvec were protected fully by addition of supplemental buffers and bovine liver catalase to the culture medium. streptococci were also found to  invade huvec by an endocytic mechanism that was dependent on polymerization of actin microfilaments and on a functional cytoskeleton, as indicated by inhibition with cytochalasin d and nocodazole. electron microscopy revealed streptococci attached to huvec surfaces via numerous fibrillar structures and bacteria in membrane-encased cytoplasmic vacuoles. following invasion by s. gordonii ch1, huvec monolayers showed 63% cell lysis over 4 h, releasing 64% of the total intracellular bacteria into the culture medium; however, the bacteria did not multiply during this time. the ability to invade huvec was exhibited by selected  strains of s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. mutans, s. mitis, and s. oralis but only weakly by s. salivarius. comparison of isogenic pairs of s. gordonii revealed a requirement for several surface proteins for maximum host cell invasion: glucosyltransferase, the sialic acid-binding protein hsa, and the hydrophobicity/coaggregation proteins csha and cshb. deletion of genes for the antigen i/ii adhesins, sspa and sspb, did not affect invasion. we hypothesize that peroxidogenesis and invasion of the cardiovascular endothelium by viridans group streptococci are integral events in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis and atherosclerosis.

TI  == prevalence of csh-like fibrillar surface proteins among mitis group oral streptococci.
AB  == the prevalence of csh-like fibrillar surface proteins among oral streptococci was investigated by elisa and by immunoelectron microscopy using antiserum raised to  recombinant fragments of csha of streptococcus gordonii dl1. the majority of s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis strains tested elaborated short (ca. 50-80 nm long) surface fibrils and reacted with antiserum to the amino acid repeat region of csha, demonstrating the widespread nature of csh-like proteins among these species. in contrast, reactivity with antiserum raised to the adhesion-mediating non-repetitive region of csha was more restricted. on the basis of the elisa results, several isolates were selected for immunogold analysis using csha antisera. immunogold-negative staining showed a surface distribution of 10 nm gold particles consistent with antibody binding to  short fibrils. long fibrils (>150 nm long), where present, were not significantly labelled with gold. the results suggest that some of the short peritrichous fibrils on many mitis group streptococci comprise csh-like fibrillar protein. further, the data are consistent with our hypothesis that the antigenically conserved amino acid repeat region of csh-like proteins forms a scaffold for cell-distal presentation of the amino-terminal non-repetitive region that, at least in s. gordonii dl1, functions as an adhesin.

TI  == a rapid solid-phase fluorimetric assay for measuring bacterial adherence, using dna-binding stains.
AB  == in this report, we describe the validation of a rapid, single-step, microtiter plate method for quantifying bacterial adherence, based on fluorescent labeling of microorganisms with cell-permeable fluorescent dna-binding probes. we have tested the binding to saliva-coated microtiter plates of bacteria, including helicobacter pylori and viridans streptococci (s. mitis, s. gordonii, s. sanguis), known to interact with salivary components. furthermore, we tested the  short-term and longer-term temporal stability of a saliva-mediated adherence of these bacteria in a healthy population (n=30). the assay exhibited excellent reliability statistics, yielding within-assay variability coefficients ranging from 4.9% to 11%. a range of approximately 5 x 10(4)-1 x 10(7) cells could be detected. this method may be generally applicable to study surface binding of virtually any microbial species, while obviating the need of radioactive materials or specific antibodies for quantification, thus providing a procedure that is useful to both basic and clinical research.

TI  == amino acid sequence requirements in the hinge of human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) for cleavage by streptococcal iga1 proteases.
AB  == the amino acid sequence requirements in the hinge of human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) for cleavage by iga1 proteases of different species of streptococcus were  investigated. recombinant iga1 antibodies were generated with point mutations at  proline 227 and threonine 228, the residues lying on either side of the peptide bond at which all streptococcal iga1 proteases cleave wild-type human iga1. the amino acid substitutions produced no major effect upon the structure of the mutant iga1 antibodies or their functional ability to bind to fcalpha receptors.  however, the substitutions had a substantial effect upon sensitivity to cleavage  with some streptococcal iga1 proteases, with, in some cases, a single point mutation rendering the antibody resistant to a particular iga1 protease. this effect was least marked with the iga1 protease from streptococcus pneumoniae, which showed no absolute requirement for either proline or threonine at residues  227 to 228. by contrast, the iga1 proteases of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis had an absolute requirement for proline at 227 but not for threonine at 228, which could be replaced by valine. there was evidence in s. mitis that proteases from different strains may have different amino acid requirements for cleavage. remarkably, some streptococcal proteases appeared able to cleave the hinge at a distant alternative site if substitution prevented efficient cleavage of the original site. hence, this study has identified key residues required for the recognition of the iga1 hinge as a substrate by streptococcal iga1 proteases, and it marks a preliminary step towards development of specific enzyme inhibitors.

AB  == background and purpose: cytotoxic t lymphocyte-induced lysis of virus-infected oral epithelial cells has been shown to be a cause of early ulcer formation in recurrent aphthous ulcerations (rau). to test whether bacteria and their associated antigens are involved in the disease process of rau, the proliferative response (pr) to different streptococcal species in peripheral blood mononuclear  cells (pbmc) and t cells isolated from rau patients at the exacerbation stage was determined. methods: pbmc and t cells were isolated from 39 patients with rau, 21 patients with erosive oral lichen plaus (eolp, disease control group), and 22 healthy subjects (normal control group). streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis and their associated antigen, glucosyltransferase d (gtfd), were used to stimulate isolated pbmc and t cells in in vitro proliferation assays. results: pbmc and t cells isolated from rau patients at the exacerbation stage showed a significantly higher pr to s. mutans antigen and gtfd than those isolated from eolp patients or healthy control subjects (p < 0.05). gtfd was a more potent stimulation antigen than s. mutans. however, elevated prs to s. mutans antigen and gtfd were transient and present only in the exacerbation stage of rau. these elevated prs declined to normal levels in the postexacerbation and convalescence stages of rau. furthermore, the gtfd-stimulated pr in pbmc and t cells was correlated with  the severity of rau. conclusion: in addition to viral infections, streptococci and their associated antigen, gtfd, may be involved in the disease process of rau, especially in the exacerbation stage.

AB  == objective: septicemia is a cause of death in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct) recipients. extraction of teeth with advanced periodontitis has been advocated before hsct to prevent septicemia in myeloablated hosts. the primary aim of the present study was to determine impact of chronic periodontitis, as measured by radiographic alveolar bone loss, on septicemia and transplant mortality. study design: a retrospective design was used to study 77 subjects who received pretransplant dental evaluation, panoramic radiography, and full myeloablative allogeneic hsct to treat hematologic malignancies. radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss was measured with a schei ruler on all teeth. microorganisms isolated from positive blood cultures within the first 100 days after transplant were categorized as of likely origin from periodontal, oral, or  any body sites. spearman correlation and logistic regression analysis assessed associations between positive blood cultures, mean subject whole-mouth percent radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss, and 100-day survival. results: radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss per study subject averaged 13% +/- 7%, with 18.2% exhibiting bone loss of 20% or greater. during the initial 100 days after transplant, 63.6% subjects yielded septicemia-associated positive blood cultures, with staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli as the most common isolates recovered. no statistically significant associations were found between mean subject radiographic alveolar bone loss and septicemia of likely periodontal or oral origin. conclusion: in this preliminary study, no relationship was found between radiographic periodontal status and septicemia or  mortality within the initial 100 days after transplant. a larger-sized, prospective study is warranted to further delineate the risk of septicemia from periodontal and other oral diseases in immunocompromised patients.

AB  == as part of a series of longitudinal studies on the development of the indigenous  microflora of the upper respiratory tract, the establishment of streptococci in the oral cavity and nasopharynx and iga1 protease production by the early streptococcal flora was examined in 50 healthy caucasian infants at the ages of 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. in the oral cavity, streptococci were found in all infants on every sampling occasion, streptococcus mitis biovar 1 being the main finding in each age group. s. salivarius and s. mitis biovar 2 reached their highest prevalence during the first year of life, whereas the prevalence of s. oralis and s. sanguis showed no significant increase before 12 months of age. salivary streptococci mainly consisted of the above-mentioned species during the  follow-up period. in contrast to the oral cavity, no stable colonisation pattern  was observed for viridans streptococci in the nasopharynx. s. mitis biovar 1 and  s. pneumoniae, a traditional respiratory pathogen, were the principal streptococcal species among nasopharyngeal isolates. iga1 protease production by  early streptococci was common in infancy. among the oral streptococcal microflora, s. mitis biovar 1 (especially during the first year of life) and s. oralis and s. sanguis constituted the main species responsible for this enzyme activity. in the nasopharynx, iga1 protease was produced by s. mitis biovar 1, s. oralis and s. pneumoniae. in conclusion, streptococcal colonisation differs in these two close habitats in the upper respiratory tract.

AB  == the occurrence of 36 environmentally regulated genes of streptococcus suis strain 10 among all 35 s. suis serotypes was determined by using hybridization with the  amplified genes as probes. in addition, the distribution of these genes among the virulence phenotypes of serotypes 1 and 2 was assessed. hybridization was also performed with various other streptococcal species and nonstreptococcal bacterial species which may be present in pigs. interestingly, probe ivs-25/iri-1, similar  to agra and sapr, hybridized only with s. suis serotype 1 and 2 strains with virulent phenotypes and is therefore suitable as a diagnostic parameter. only one probe was specific for s. suis. this probe's sequence was identical to the epf gene, a putative virulence factor of s. suis. probe ivs-31 was similar to a virulence factor of s. suis, namely, a gene encoding a fibronectin- and fibrinogen-binding protein. this probe hybridized only with oral streptococci. nearly half of the probes (45%) hybridized with the oral streptococci (s. oralis, s. milleri, s. sanguis, s. gordonii, and s. mitis) and with streptococcus pneumoniae. this indicates a close relationship between s. suis, the oral streptococci, and s. pneumoniae with respect to the selected environmentally regulated genes. one probe only hybridized with gram-negative species and therefore seems to be obtained by s. suis from a gram-negative organism by horizontal transfer.

TI  == groesl sequence determination, phylogenetic analysis, and species differentiation for viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the full-length sequences of the groesl genes (also known as cpn10/60) of streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordonii, and  streptococcus sanguis and the near full-length sequence of the groesl genes of streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus salivarius were determined. the lengths of the groes genes from the 10 species listed above ranged from 282 to 288 bp, and the full-length sequences of groel determined for  4 species (s. anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, and s. sanguis) revealed that each was 1,623 bp. the intergenic region (spacer) between the groes and groel genes varies in size (15 to 111 bp) and sequence between species. the variation of the groes sequences among the species tested was greater (62.1 to 95.1% nucleotide sequence identities) than that of the groel sequences (77.2 to 95.2% nucleotide sequence identities). phylogenetic analysis of the groes and groel genes yielded evolutionary trees similar to the tree constructed by use of  the 16s rrna gene. the intraspecies variation of the spacer was minimal for clinical isolates of some species. the groesl sequence data provide an additional parameter for identification of viridans group streptococcal species.

TI  == streptococcus viridans septicaemia: a comparison study in patients admitted to the departments of infectious diseases and haematology in a university hospital.
AB  == infective endocarditis caused by viridans streptococci is a well-described disease. streptococcus viridans is also an important etiologic agent causing septicaemia in neutropenic patients with haematological diseases. in this study we retrospectively reviewed charts from 111 patients with 121 episodes of viridans streptococci septicaemia during the period 1992-97 for clinical data, presence of endocarditis, subtype and outcome. forty-seven episodes of s. viridans septicaemia were documented in 45 non-neutropenic patients treated at the department of infectious diseases (group a). thirty of these episodes were defined as definite and 9 as possible infective endocarditis, using duke's critera. seventy-four episodes of s. viridans septicaemia were identified in 66 patients treated at the department of haematology (group b), only 1 of which fulfilled the criteria for possible infective endocarditis. s. sanguis was the most common subtype (18/47; 38%) in group a and s. mitis was the major subtype (51/74; 69%) in group b.

TI  == salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in sudanese adults.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult sudanese subjects. material and methods: the study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. the periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using whole genomic dna probes. results: a high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or =  105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. between 12% and 16%  of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, c. rectus and e. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, respectively. there were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. presence of > or = 105 l. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). there were significantly higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, c. rectus, p. micros, v. parvula, s. mutans, s. anginosus, a. israelii, c. sputigena, and c. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, e. corrodens, l. acidophilus, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. oralis, and s. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. conclusions: : the findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. this is the first report that the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.

TI  == [therapeutic impact of streptococcal and enterococcal bacteremia in hematology patients].
AB  == from january 1999 to may 2000 (17 months), 21 strains of streptococci and four strains of enterococci have been isolated from 74 blood cultures in 25 infectious episodes in hematologic patients. they concerned 21 patients, of 21 to 77 years old. these patients suffered from acute leukaemia (14 cases), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (two cases), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (two cases) or myeloma (three cases). seventeen patients displayed a single streptococcal or enterococcal episode, two had two episodes in the course of a single stay in the hospital, two others in the course of two different stays. during 16 episodes (64%), the bacteremia occurred within 15 days after the onset of neutropenia consecutive to  antimitotic chemotherapy, and in nine episodes (36%) it has occurred after a period exceeding 15 days. in six cases the patients had already received antibiotics with a large antibacterial activity (beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and/or glycopeptide +/- aminoside) and in four cases a single antibiotic (synergistine or cotrimoxazole). most streptococci (20/21) were oral streptococci (ten streptococcus mitis, five s. oralis, two s. sanguis, three s. pneumoniae). a single strain of beta-hemolytic streptococci has been identified as s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. the enterococci were one strain of enterococcus  faecalis and three e. faecium. ten streptococci were susceptible to 0.25 mg/l of  penicillin g, ten were less susceptible (0.5 < or = mic < 32 mg/l), and a strain  was resistant (mic = 32 mg/l). eighteen strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and cefotaxime. for three strains, the mics of amoxicillin and cefotaxime (8-16 mg/l and 8-32 mg/l, respectively) were higher. levels of resistance of the enterococci to the beta-lactam (penicillin, amoxicillin, and piperacillin) were variable. all species were susceptible to glycopeptides. three patients were transferred in intensive care unit for respiratory distress or shock syndrome. their evolution has remained severe under antibiotherapy comprising beta-lactam or vancomycin associated with an aminoside. this results demonstrate the interest of species identification to adapt the antibiotic treatment and confirms the frequency of oral streptococci in severe bacteremia in neutropenic patients.

TI  == streptococcus sinensis sp. nov., a novel species isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis.
AB  == a bacterium was isolated from the blood culture of a patient with infective endocarditis. the cells were facultative anaerobic, nonsporulating, gram-positive cocci arranged in chains. the bacterium grows on sheep blood agar as alpha-hemolytic, gray colonies of 0.5 to 1 mm in diameter after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees c in ambient air. growth also occurs in 10 or 40% bile and on bile esculin agar but not in 6% nacl. no enhancement of growth is observed in 5% co(2). it is nongroupable with lancefield groups a, b, c, d, f, or g antisera and is resistant to optochin and bacitracin. the organism is aflagellated and is nonmotile at both 25 and 37 degrees c. it is voges-proskauer  test positive. it produces leucine arylamidase and beta-glucosidase but not catalase, urease, lysine decarboxylase, or ornithine decarboxylase. it hydrolyzes esculin and arginine. it utilizes glucose, lactose, salicin, sucrose, pullulan, trehalose, cellobiose, hemicellulase, mannose, maltose, and starch. 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that there were 3.6, 3.7, 4.3, 4.7, and 5.9% differences between the 16s rrna gene sequence of the bacterium and those of streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus anginosus, respectively. the g+c content of it (mean plus minus standard deviation) was 53.0% plus minus 2.9%. based on phylogenetic affiliation, it belongs to the mitis or anginosus group of streptococcus. for these reasons a new species, streptococcus sinensis sp. nov., is proposed, for which hku4 is the type strain. further studies should be performed to ascertain the potential of this bacterium to become an emerging cause of infective endocarditis.

TI  == adhesion in vitro of oral streptococci to porcelain, composite resin cement and human enamel.
AB  == we investigated the initial adhesion in vitro of oral streptococci to porcelain inlays. four strains of streptococci, streptococcus mitis nctc12261, streptococcus oralis atcc9811, streptococcus sanguis atcc10556 and streptococcus  sobrinus omz176, were used in this study. the disc specimens were made of porcelain, composite resin cement and human enamel. these specimens, with or without a saliva-coat, were immersed in a suspension of each streptococci strain  at 37 degrees c for 1 hr, and the numbers of cells adhering to specimens were counted after staining. the saliva-coat significantly decreased the numbers of adhering cells in all strains tested (t-test, p < 0.05). the adhesion to the porcelain and resin cements could be explained by a thermodynamic approach, although the adhesion to enamel could not be explained. these results indicated the possibility that the mechanism is different in initial adhered strains of streptococci between enamel and dental restorative materials.

TI  == [susceptibility to penicillin and 13 antimicrobial agents in erythromycin-resistant viridans group streptococci isolated from blood cultures].
AB  == from march 1998 to june 1999, we studied 63 sequential blood culture isolates of  viridans group streptococci which showed a 49% resistance to erythromycin. a high level of resistance to penicillin (46%) was also found. a statistically significant correlation was detected between the two types of resistance. the erythromycin-resistant strains were phenotypically and genotypically characterized, and no differences were found between the resistance to penicillin and the m or mls(b) phenotypes. the penicillin-erythromycin-resistant strains included: 16 s. mitis, five s. sanguis and one s. salivarius. the rank order of activity (% of susceptibility) for all 14 agents against 31 erythromycin- resistant isolates was the following: vancomycin = rifampicin (100) > chloramphenicol (98) > meropenem (65) > cefotaxime (61) > amoxicillin- clavulanic acid (42) > cefepime = ciprofloxacin (39) > tetracycline = trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (36) > cefuroxime (32) > penicillin = ampicillin =  cefaclor (29). the species s. milleri and s. bovis were the most susceptible. the most resistant strains were two s. mitis and one s. sanguis and showed multiresistance to six different groups of antimicrobial agents. the frequent association between macrolide resistance and resistance to other antimicrobial agents suggests that the susceptibility of all clinically significant isolates needs to be evaluated and alternative agents for the prevention and treatment of  viridans group streptococci infections should be identified.

TI  == efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (ii). effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == cariogenic potential of lactosylfructoside as determined by acidogenicity of oral streptococci in vitro and human dental plaque in situ.
AB  == the cariogenic potential of lactosylfructoside [o-beta-d-galactopyranosyl-(1-->4)-o-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl-(1<-->2)-beta-d-fruct ofuranoside] was estimated by experiments on oral streptococci in vitro and human dental plaque in situ. lactosylfructoside was unable to support growth of the strains of streptococcus mutans and s. sobrinus used in this study. however, it was able to support growth of strains of s. sanguis, s. mitis and s. oralis. acid was produced rapidly by cell suspensions of s. oralis atcc 10557 incubated with lactosylfructoside. application of 5% w/v solution decreased the ph of human dental plaque. the minimum ph value was below 5.3. the results suggest that lactosylfructoside is as acidogenic as lactose and could be cariogenic if it is consumed frequently and retained for a long period in the mouth.

TI  == oral colonization and cariogenicity of streptococcus gordonii in specific pathogen-free tan:spfom(om)br rats consuming starch or sucrose diets.
AB  == the significance of streptococcus gordonii in dental caries is undefined, as is that of other alpha-amylase-binding bacteria (abb) commonly found in the mouth. to clarify the ecological and cariological roles of s. gordonii our specific pathogen-free osborne-mendel rats, tan:spfom(om)br, were fed either diet 2000 (containing 56% confectioner's sugar, most of which is sucrose) or diet 2000cs (containing 56% cornstarch, in lieu of confectioner's sugar) and inoculated with  s. gordonii strains. uninoculated rats were free of both indigenous mutans streptococci (ms) and abb, including s. gordonii, as shown by culture on mitis salivarius and blood agars of swabs and sonicates of dentitions after weanlings had consumed these diets for 26 days. abb were detected by radiochemical assay using [125i]-amylase reactive to alpha-amylase-binding protein characteristic of  the surface of s. gordonii and other abb. no abb were detected (detection limit < 1 colony-forming units in 10(6) colony-forming units). thus the tan:spfom(om)br colony presents a 'clean animal model' for subsequent study. consequently, s. gordonii strains challis or g9b were used to inoculate weanling rat groups consuming either the high-sucrose diet 2000 or the cornstarch diet 2000cs. two additional groups fed each of these diets remained unioculated. recoveries of inoculants were tested 12 and 26 days later by oral swabs and sonication of the molars of one hemimandible of each animal, respectively. uninoculated animals were reconfirmed to be free of abb and mutans streptococci, but inoculated ones eating diet 2000cs had s. gordonii recoveries of 1-10% or, if eating diet 2000, 10-30% of total colony-farming units in sonicates. there were no statistically significant differences among the inoculated and uninoculated animal groups' caries scores when they ate the cornstarch diet. lesion scores for sucrose-eating rats were, however, from 2.4-5.1-fold higher than for cornstarch-eating rats, p < 0.001, and were still higher if animals had been inoculated with either challis (1.41-fold) or g9b (1.64-fold), than if uninoculated, both p < 0.001, so long as  the rats ate the sucrose diet. therefore, tan:spfom(om)br rats do not harbour abb or s. gordonii but can be colonized by s. gordonii. colonization levels of s. gordonii on the teeth are higher in the presence of high sucrose than with high starch-containing diets. caries scores are augmented by sucrose compared with starch, and are further augmented by s gordonii colonization. s. gordonii is thus cariologically significant in the presence of sucrose, at least in this rat.

TI  == binding of oral streptococci to human fibrinogen.
AB  == the interaction of oral streptococci with human fibrinogen was investigated. streptococcus gordonii was chosen as a representative species to study the binding to fibrinogen. s. gordonii dl1 adhered to immobilized fibrinogen and bovine serum albumin. binding to immobilized fibrinogen was saturable, concentration and temperature dependent. the binding of s. gordonii dl1 to fibrinogen was inhibited by anti-fibrinogen antibody. heating of the bacteria for 1 h at 95 degrees c resulted in 90% inhibition of the binding. trypsin treatment  of the bacteria resulted in decreased binding. neither lipoteichoic acid nor culturing of the bacteria in a sucrose-supplemented medium had any effect on the  binding. s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis bound to the immobilized fibrinogen, but mutans streptococci did not. none of the oral streptococci tested bound to the fibrinogen in fluid phase. these results suggest that the binding of s. gordonii dl1 to immobilized fibrinogen is mediated through a specific protein adhesin-receptor interaction, and fibrinogen acts as a cryptitope.

TI  == mannosidase production by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the production of mannosidase activity by all currently recognized species of human viridans group streptococci was determined using an assay in which bacterial growth was dependent on the degradation of the high-mannose-type glycans of rnase b and subsequent utilization of released mannose. rnase b is an  excellent substrate for the demonstration of mannosidase activity since it is a glycoprotein with a single glycosylation site which is occupied by high-mannose-type glycoforms containing five to nine mannose residues. mannosidase activity was produced only by some members of the mitis group (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus parasanguinis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) and streptococcus intermedius of the anginosus group. none of the other species within the salivarius and mutans groups or streptococcus peroris and streptococcus sanguinis produced mannosidase activity. using matrix-assisted  laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the man(5) glycan alone was degraded while man(6) to man(9), which contain terminal alpha(1-->2) mannose residues in addition to the alpha(1-->3), alpha(1-->6), and beta(1-->4) residues present in man(5), remained intact. investigations on mannosidase production using synthetic (4-methylumbelliferone-  or p-nitrophenol-linked) alpha- or beta-mannosides as substrates indicated that there was no correlation between degradation of these substrates and degradation  of the man(5) glycan of rnase b. no species degraded these alpha-linked mannosides, while degradation of the beta-linked synthetic substrates was restricted to strains within the streptococcus anginosus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius species. the data generated using a native glycoprotein as the substrate demonstrate that mannosidase production within the viridans group streptococci is more widely distributed than had previously been considered.

TI  == utilization and acid production of beta-galactosyllactose by oral streptococci and human dental plaque.
AB  == beta-galactosyllactose is a trisaccharide containing the beta-galactosidic linkage at the nonreducing end. the purpose of this study was to determine whether certain oral streptococci could utilize four kinds of beta-galactosyllactoses. three of four beta-galactosyllactoses were unable to support growth of the oral streptococci and to be a substrate for producing acid  from the cell suspensions and dental plaque. 4'-beta-galactosyllactose supported  growth of streptococcus sanguis atcc 35105, atcc 49298, streptococcus mitis atcc  15914, streptococcus oralis atcc 35037, atcc 10557 and streptococcus milleri 10707 and produced acid from dental plaque. although beta-galactosidase activities were observed in all the strains, 4'-beta-galactosyllactose could not  be used as a carbon source for the growth of mutans streptococci. enzymes metabolizing 4'-beta-galactosyllactose were induced when s. oralis atcc 10557 was cultured in medium containing galactose. these results suggested that 4'-beta-galactosyllactose could be as cariogenic as lactose if it is consumed frequently and retained for a long period in the mouth.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  == a diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. the samples were cultured  for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), streptococcus mitis (66-65%), prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), eikenella corrodens (51-52%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella loescheii, campylobacter gracilis, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter concisus, peptostreptococcus micros and selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. the bacterial species streptococcus constellatus, peptostreptococcus micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, e. corrodens and fusobacterium nucleatum  were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas streptococcus intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were associated with bleeding.

AB  == the enzyme utp-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase, udpg:pp) is synthesized by practically all organisms, although prokaryotic udpg:pps are evolutionarily unrelated to the eukaryotic counterparts. the primary structure of prokaryotic udpg:pps is well conserved, although little  information exists on the polymorphism of the genes coding for these enzymes. it  has been reported that the galu gene encoding the streptococcus pneumoniae udpg:pp is absolutely required for the synthesis of the capsular polysaccharide,  a sine qua non prerequisite for virulence. a 594 bp fragment covering 66% of the  galu gene from 37 pneumococcal isolates and the type strains of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sobrinus has been amplified by pcr and sequenced. up to 21 different alleles were found in s. pneumoniae. they possess a mosaic-like structure and belong to, at least, two evolutionarily distinct families that show a sequence divergence of 15-20%. in spite of its marked polymorphism, phylogenetic relationships among pneumococcal strains deduced from the galu gene matched those previously established by using alternative approaches. comparison of the pneumococcal galu alleles with those from other streptococci indicated the existence of a complex network of genetic interchange. the galu gene represents an informative marker to be used alone or in conjunction with other molecular typing methods.

TI  == strain-related acid production by oral streptococci.
AB  == acid production, in particular at low ph, is thought to be an important ecological determinant in dental caries. the aim of the present study was to determine the acid producing capability at different ph levels of 47 streptococcal strains, representing 9 species, isolated from human dental plaque. the bacteria were grown until mid log-phase under anaerobic conditions and acid production was measured in a ph-stat system at ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5 and 5.0. at all ph values, the mean velocity of acid production (v(ap)) by streptococcus mutans and s. sobrinus was significantly higher (p<0.01; anova) than that of the other oral streptococci, including s. mitis, s. oralis, s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. intermedius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus, and s. vestibularis. however, the v(ap) of some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and s. oralis, particularly at ph values of 7.0 and 6.0, exceeded that of some strains of s. mutans. the v(ap) decreased with ph for all strains, but some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and strains of the mutans streptococci maintained a relatively high rate of acid production. the results suggest that some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and s. oralis may play an important role in caries development by modifying the environment in dental plaque to become favourable for the succession of aciduric  species. the study furthermore emphasises the need for detailed species and biovar identification of oral streptococci and for recognition of the significant physiological differences that occur within single species.

TI  == competition for glucose between candida albicans and oral bacteria grown in mixed culture in a chemostat.
AB  == the competition for glucose as a growth-limiting substrate between candida albicans and a mixed community of oral bacteria was investigated. a chemostat was operated under glucose-limiting and glucose excess conditions at a dilution rate  of 0.05/h. a mixed population of oral bacteria was established and after a steady state had been reached the chemostat was inoculated with c. albicans. seven bacterial species streptococcus sanguis, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, lactobacillus casei, veillonella dispar, eubacterium saburreum and fusobacterium nucleatum - were able to establish stable populations under glucose-limiting conditions. the  yeast was unable to grow with the bacteria under glucose limitation. only three bacterial species, s. sobrinus, l. casei and e. saburreum, became established under glucose-excess conditions. c. albicans was also able to become established  in the glucose-excess chemostat and could grow and maintain a steady state in a mixed culture with these organisms. l. casei, s. mitis and s. sobrinus had faster glucose consumption rates than c. albicans. all the bacteria, except for e nucleatum, had maximum specific growth rates higher than c. albicans. the results suggest that glucose may act as a growth-limiting substrate for c. albicans in the establishment and growth of the yeast in a mixed community of oral bacteria.

TI  == taxonomic study of "tufted mitior" strains of streptococci (streptococcus sanguinis biotype 11); recognition of a new genospecies.
AB  == the taxonomic position of tufted strains of streptococci, phenotypically resembling streptococcus mitis and previously referred to as 'tufted mitior' was  investigated. by 16s rrna sequence analysis, it was clear that the "tufted mitior" strains belonged to the mitis group of species within the genus streptococcus. it was confirmed that these strains were taxonomically independent at the species level, sharing less than 43%, dna-dna similarity with all established species of the mitis group. however biochemical test data obtained, using three commercial identification kits (rapid id32 strep, streptogram, and biolog gp-plate) together with in-house biochemical tests employing 4-muf-linked  fluorogenic substrates did not reveal sufficient differential tests with which to identify the "tufted mitior" strains unequivocally. from these data, we conclude  that these "tufted mitior" strains represent a new taxon within the mitis group of the genus streptococcus, and propose that they should be considered as a genospecies until differential phenotypic characteristics are found for their identification.

TI  == ib-367, a protegrin peptide with in vitro and in vivo activities against the microflora associated with oral mucositis.
AB  == although the microflora associated with oral mucositis initiated by cytotoxic therapy is not well characterized, several studies suggest that reduction of the  microbial load in the oral cavity has some clinical benefit. the mics of ib-367,  a synthetic protegrin analog, ranged from 0.13 to 64 microgram/ml for gram-positive bacteria (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, and staphylococcus aureus) and from 0.06 to 8 microgram/ml for gram-negative species (klebsiella, escherichia, and pseudomonas). ib-367 exhibited rapid, microbicidal activity against both log- and stationary-phase cultures of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and pseudomonas aeruginosa. at concentrations near the mics for these two organisms (4 and 2 microgram/ml, respectively), ib-367 reduced viability by more than 3 logs in less than 16 min. similarly, ib-367 effected a 4-log reduction of the endogenous microflora in pooled human saliva within 2 min at 250 microgram/ml, a concentration readily attained by local delivery. after nine serial transfers at  0.5x the mic, the mic of ib-367 for mrsa and p. aeruginosa increased only two to  four times. in a phase i clinical study with healthy volunteers, ib-367 was well  tolerated, with no detectable systemic absorption. one hour after treatment with  9 mg of ib-367, the prevalence of gram-negative bacteria and yeast was reduced, and the density of the predominant gram-positive oral flora was decreased 1,000 times. ib-367's properties (speed of killing, breadth of spectrum, and lack of resistance) make the compound a strong candidate for the prophylaxis of oral mucositis. phase ii clinical trials with ib-367 are under way for this indication in immunocompromised subjects.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  == eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. the aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). the samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. forty-one different microbial species were isolated. gemella morbillorum and peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while p. micros, streptococcus intermedius, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loeschei, p. melaninogenica and selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. the bacterial species s. constellatus, g. morbillorum and p. magnus were  isolated in greater numbers in incisors and p. micros, s. intermedius, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides egertheii, b. forsythus, p. oralis and s. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. cluster i was predominated by s. constellatus, s. mitis, s. sanguis, g. morbillorum, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; cluster ii was predominated by s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea and p. intermedia; cluster iii was predominated by s. mitis, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum,  p. loeschei, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; and finally cluster iv was predominated by s. sanguis, c. gingivalis, veillonella parvula, campylobacter gracilis, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia. the bacterial species s. constellatus,  p. micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, eikenella corrodens and f. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while s. intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.

TI  == systemic doxycycline administration in the treatment of periodontal infections (ii). effect on antibiotic resistance of subgingival species.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to determine the proportion and prevalence  of doxycycline resistant species in subgingival plaque samples taken during and after doxycycline administration. 20 subjects with adult periodontitis were randomly assigned to test (n = 10) or control groups (n = 10). saliva samples as  well as subgingival plaque samples taken from the distal surface of 6 posterior teeth were collected at baseline. all subjects received full mouth srp and the test group systemic doxycycline at the dosage of 100 mg/day for 14 days. saliva samples and plaque samples from the distal surface of 2 randomly selected teeth were taken at 3, 7 and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. control subjects were sampled at the same time points. samples were anaerobically dispersed and serially diluted in pras ringer's solution and plated on enriched trypticase soy blood agar plates with or without 4 microg/ml doxycycline. after 7 days of anaerobic incubation, colonies were counted on both sets of plates. microbial growth was washed from the doxycycline-containing media and the species identified using 40 dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. differences in proportions of resistant species between test and control groups were tested for significance at each time point using the mann whitney test and over time within each group using the quade test. the mean % (+/-sem) of isolates resistant to 4 microg/ml doxycycline in the plaque samples of the test subjects increased from 6+/-2 to 48+/-9% during doxycycline administration, decreasing to  25+/-6% 2 weeks later and 9+/-2% at 90 days. in saliva, the % of resistant isolates rose from 13+/-1% to 81+/-10% during doxycycline administration falling  to 46+/-8% 2 weeks later and 22+/-5% at 90 days. the % of resistant isolates did  not change significantly in plaque or saliva samples of the control subjects at the same time points. for all subject visits combined, the most prevalent resistant species were: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, actinomyces gerencseriae, streptococcus constellatus, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, streptococcus gordonii, eikenella corrodens and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1. doxycycline resistant strains of these  species were detected in both plaque and saliva samples prior to therapy and in the control group. despite the finding of increased resistance, approximately 50% of the organisms present at periodontal sites at the end of 14 days of doxycycline administration tested sensitive to the agent.

TI  == efficacy of levofloxacin in the treatment of experimental endocarditis caused by  viridans group streptococci.
AB  == levofloxacin was investigated against viridans group streptococci in vitro and in rats with experimental aortic endocarditis. the mic(90)s of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin for 20 independent isolates of such bacteria were 1 and 8 mg/l, respectively. rats were infected with two types of organism: either fully susceptible to levofloxacin mic < or = 0.5 mg/l) or borderline susceptible (mic 1-2 mg/l). fully levofloxacin-susceptible bacteria comprised one penicillin-susceptible (mic 0.004 mg/l) streptococcus gordonii, and one penicillin-tolerant as well as one intermediate penicillin-resistant (mic 0.125 mg/l) isogenic strains. borderline levofloxacin-susceptible bacteria comprised one penicillin-susceptible streptococcus sanguis and one highly penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis (mic 2 mg/l). rats were treated for 5 days with drug dosages simulating the following treatments in humans: (i) levofloxacin 500 mg orally once a day (q24 h), (ii) levofloxacin 500 mg orally twice a day (q12 h), (iii) levofloxacin 1 g orally q24 h, (iv) ciprofloxacin 750  mg orally q12 h, and (v) ceftriaxone 2 g iv q24 h. levofloxacin was equivalent or superior to ceftriaxone, and was successful in treating experimental endocarditis irrespective of penicillin resistance. nevertheless, standard levofloxacin treatment equivalent to 500 mg q24 h in human was less effective than twice daily 500 mg or once daily 1 g doses against borderline-susceptible organisms. ciprofloxacin, used as a negative control, was ineffective and selected for resistant isolates. this underlines the importance of mic determinations when treating severe streptococcal infection with quinolones. in the case of borderline-susceptible pathogens, total daily doses of 1 g of levofloxacin should be considered.

TI  == prevalence of the amylase-binding protein a gene (abpa) in oral streptococci.
AB  == salivary amylase binds specifically to a number of oral streptococcal species. this interaction may play an important role in dental plaque formation. recently, a 585-bp gene was cloned and sequenced from streptococcus gordonii challis encoding a 20.5-kda amylase-binding protein (abpa). the goal of this study was to determine if related genes are present in other species of oral streptococci. biotinylated abpa was used in southern blot analysis to screen genomic dna from several strains representing eight species of oral streptococci. this probe hybridized with a 4.0-kb hindiii restriction fragment from all 13 strains of s. gordonii tested. the probe did not appear to bind to any restriction fragments from other species of amylase-binding oral streptococci including streptococcus mitis (with the exception of 1 of 14 strains), streptococcus crista (3 strains),  streptococcus anginosus (1 strain), and streptococcus parasanguinis (1 strain), or to non-amylase-binding oral streptococci including streptococcus sanguinis (3  strains), streptococcus oralis (4 strains), and streptococcus mutans (1 strain).  primers homologous to sequences within the 3' and 5' ends of abpa yielded products of 400 bp following pcr of genomic dna from the southern blot-positive strains. several of these pcr products were cloned and sequenced. the levels of similarity of these cloned products to the abpa of s. gordonii challis ranged from 91 to 96%. these studies reveal that the abpa gene appears to be specific to s. gordonii and differs from genes encoding amylase-binding proteins from other species of amylase-binding streptococci.

TI  == efficacy of levofloxacin for experimental aortic-valve endocarditis in rabbits infected with viridans group streptococcus or staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == levofloxacin is among the more active fluoroquinolones against streptococci and staphylococci. it is effective against moderately severe infections caused by these organisms, but its efficacy in the treatment of bacteremia and serious infections such as endocarditis is not well defined. we compared the efficacy of  levofloxacin to those of standard agents in the rabbit model of aortic-valve endocarditis caused by fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains including a penicillin-susceptible strain of streptococcus sanguis, a penicillin-resistant strain of streptococcus mitis, a methicillin-resistant strain of staphylococcus aureus, and a methicillin-susceptible strain of s. aureus. levofloxacin administered intramuscularly at dosages of 20 to 40 mg/kg of body weight twice daily (b.i.d.) was completely ineffective against the penicillin-susceptible strain, with mean vegetation titers after 3 days of therapy not statistically significantly different from those for controls. levofloxacin was no more effective than penicillin against the penicillin-resistant strain. levofloxacin administered for 4 days at a dosage of 20 mg/kg b.i.d. was at least as effective  as vancomycin administered intravenously at a dosage of 25 mg/kg b.i. d. against  the methicillin-resistant s. aureus strain and was as effective as nafcillin administered intramuscularly at 100 mg three times daily against the methicillin-susceptible strain. emergence of resistance to levofloxacin in vitro  was less likely to occur than resistance to ciprofloxacin, and resistance to levofloxacin was not observed in vivo. levofloxacin-rifampin combinations were antagonistic in vitro and in vivo. levofloxacin was highly effective as a single  agent against experimental staphylococcal endocarditis but was surprisingly ineffective against streptococcal endocarditis, suggesting that it has a potential role as treatment for serious s. aureus but not viridans group streptococcal infections in humans.

TI  == spondylodiscitis caused by viridans streptococci: three cases and a review of the literature.
AB  == three cases of spondylodiscitis caused by viridans streptococci were observed within the course of 1 month. although streptococci have been reported as the third most frequent cause of spondylodiscitis after staphylococci and gram-negative bacteria, alpha-haemolytic streptococci are rarely seen. the three  patients presented with symptoms of low back pain; they felt well and did not have a fever or chills. laboratory examinations revealed inflammation. further examinations such as scintigraphy, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging were done. bacteriological diagnosis was established by blood cultures in two cases and by needle biopsy of the disco-vertebral space in one. in one patient endocarditis was also documented. because the prevalence of endocarditis  was found to be higher in our cases of spondylodiscitis due to streptococcus viridans than for other bacteria, the exclusion of this diagnosis must be pursued aggressively. these observations lead us to question if the spectrum of bacteria  causing spondylodiscitis is undergoing a change. an aetiological agent could be isolated in 1168 patients (85.4%): in 48% a staphylococcus, in 28% a gram-negative bacterium and in only 10% a streptococcus. there were two cases of  viridans streptococci (0.2%). these two cases together with other single case reports [14-22] account for 15 cases of spondylodiscitis due to alpha-haemolytic  streptococci. differentiation of the organisms to the species level was accomplished in six cases: s. mitis (3), s. sanguis (2) and s. anginosus (1). although a multitude of organisms, bacterial as well as fungal, causing spondylodiscitis has been reported in recent years, almost all were single cases  [23-42]. the unusual observation of three cases of spondylodiscitis due to alpha-haemolytic streptococci within 1 month prompted us to review the clinical and laboratory findings and to compare these cases with those caused by staphylococcus aureus.

AB  == among 418 blood culture isolates of viridans group streptococci obtained between  1995 and 1997, the in vitro rates of nonsusceptibility to penicillin, erythromycin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were 28, 29, 24, and 14%, respectively. the most prevalent group (125 strains) was streptococcus mitis, followed by streptococcus sanguis (56 strains). for 236 (56%) strains resistant to one or more antibiotics, the ciprofloxacin mic at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (mic(90)) was 4 microg/ml, whereas the mic(90)s of trovafloxacin, grepafloxacin, and gatifloxacin were 0.25 microg/ml.

TI  == antiphosphorylcholine antibody levels are elevated in humans with periodontal diseases.
AB  == human immunoglobulin g2 (igg2) serum concentrations and the igg2 antibody response to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans can be influenced by genes, by environmental factors such as smoking, and by periodontal disease status. examination of the igg2 response to phosphorylcholine (pc), a response thought to be mainly induced by the c polysaccharide of streptococcus pneumoniae, suggested  that periodontal disease status was also associated with this response. this prompted the hypothesis that pc is an important oral antigen associated with organisms in the periodontal flora and that anti-pc antibody is elevated as a consequence of periodontal disease. subjects in various periodontal disease diagnostic categories in which attachment loss is exhibited were tested for anti-pc in serum. those with adult periodontitis, localized juvenile periodontitis, generalized early-onset periodontitis, and gingival recession all  had similar levels of anti-pc igg2 serum antibody which were significantly greater than in the group of subjects with no attachment loss. analysis of plaque samples from subgingival and supragingival sites in all diseases categories for reactivity with the anti-pc specific monoclonal antibody tepc-15 revealed that a  substantial proportion of the bacteria in dental plaque (30 to 40%) bear pc antigen; this antigen was not restricted to morphotypes resembling only cocci but was also present on rods and branched filamentous organisms. we found that s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. sanguis, as well as oral actinomycetes, including a. viscosus, a. odontolyticus, and a. israelii, incorporated substantial amounts of  [(3)h]choline from culture media. further analysis of antigens derived from these organisms by western blot indicated that s. oralis, s. sanguis, a. viscosus, a. odontolyticus, and a. israelii contained tepc-15-reactive antigens. the data show that many commonly occurring bacterial species found in dental plaque contain pc  antigen and that immunization with plaque-derived pc antigens as a consequence of inflammation and periodontal attachment loss may influence systemic anti-pc antibody concentrations.

TI  == in vitro exchange of fluoroquinolone resistance determinants between streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans streptococci and genomic organization of the pare-parc region in s. mitis.
AB  == transfer of fluoroquinolone (fq) resistance determinants between streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans streptococci was explored by transformation in vitro. one-step fq-resistant parc mutants were selected, and resistance could be transferred from dna from s. oralis, s. mitis, s. sanguis, and s. constellatus to s. pneumoniae, with frequencies of 10(-3) to <10(-7) in correlation with the homologies of their quinolone resistance determining region sequences (95%, 91%,  85%, and 81%, respectively). reciprocal transfers of mutated parc from dna from s. pneumoniae to s. mitis and s. oralis were also observed. simultaneous transfer of mutated parc and gyra genes from s. mitis to s. pneumoniae yielded high-level-resistant pneumococcal transformants in one step at low frequencies. the pare-parc region of the type strain s. mitis 103335t had >90% homology with that of s. pneumoniae. the efficient interspecific transfer of quinolone resistance determinants in vitro leads us to anticipate their dissemination in the clinical setting.

TI  == increased interleukin-6, interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha production by tonsillar mononuclear cells stimulated with alpha-streptococci in patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris.
AB  == in vitro cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells under culture conditions with or without lyophilized streptococcal antigens was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). under culture conditions without any stimulus, a certain amount of interferon (ifn)-gamma, tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and interleukin (il)-6, was detected in the supernatant culture fluids from all 29 donors tested and just detectable levels of il-1alpha and il-2 were identified in 5 of 12 donors tested; but il-4 and il-5 were not detected in  any supernatants from 21 donors tested. in 16 patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp), all three alpha-streptococcal antigens from streptococcus, (s.) sanguis, s. salivarius and s. mitis induced production of il-6. ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha by tonsillar mononuclear cells at a significant level. however, no  significant induction of such cytokines by alpha-streptococcal stimulus was seen  in 13 donors without ppp. no significant difference in cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells was seen between the ppp and non-ppp subjects, when stimulated with s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus cowan i and pokeweed mitogen.  in the experiments using tonsillar cell subsets, the cytokine inductions by alpha-streptococcal stimulus were found in monocyte-depleted cells as well as in  purified t-cells. but not in b-cells. these data suggest that il-6, ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha may play an important role in immunological reactions in the tonsils and that a hyper-immune response to some of alpha-streptococcal antigens through  increased production of such cytokines by tonsillar mononuclear cells, to which t-cells mainly contribute, may play a key role in the pathogenesis of ppp.

TI  == acid-induced acid tolerance and acidogenicity of non-mutans streptococci.
AB  == acid tolerance and acidogenicity of non-mutans streptococci and their capacity of acid adaptation were studied. the cells of non-mutans streptococci (streptococcus sanguis [streptococcus sanguinis], streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis) grown at ph 7.0 showed 0.0088% to 71% viability after acidification at ph 4.0 for 60 min, whereas the cells of mutans streptococci (streptococcus mutans) were not killed by the acidification. washed cells of non-mutans streptococci lowered ph to 4.04-4.33 in the presence of glucose, while mutans streptococci cells lowered ph to 3.70. when the growth ph was shifted to 5.5 for 30-90 min, the viability of non-mutans streptococci after the acidification at ph 4.0 for 60 min increased (0.25% to 91%) and the minimum ph values of the cells in the presence of glucose decreased (3.90 4.19). along with  the increase in acid tolerance and acidogenicity, non-mutans streptococci increased activities of h(+)-atpase and arginine deiminase and amounts of stress  proteins cross-reacting with 60 kda and 70 kda heat shock proteins (hsp60 and hsp70). these results indicate that non-mutans streptococci were capable of increasing their acid tolerance and acidogenicity in response to environmental acidification. furthermore, it is suggested that the acid adaptation observed in  non-mutans streptococci cells could involve the induction of h(+)-atpase, arginine deiminase and stress protein syntheses. the strains of non-mutans streptococci, which are pioneer bacteria for dental plaque formation and predominant in plaque microbial flora, may play a significant role in shifting the dental plaque environment toward acidic and consequently promoting the colonization of more acid-tolerant and acidogenic bacteria such as mutans streptococci and lactobacilli.

AB  == "mitis group" streptococci are commensal but may play some role in dental caries, septicemia or endocarditis. rapid genotypic identification would aid studies of dental plaque ecology, or diagnostic use. ap-pcr with 58 unpaired arbitrary primers was used to characterize 7 streptococcus gordonii, 11 streptococcus sanguis, 2 streptococcus crista, 5 streptococcus parasanguis, 18 streptococcus oralis, and 36 streptococcus mitis (22 biovar 1 and 14 biovar 2). s. parasanguis  16s rrna variable region primer rr2 produced species-specific bands with all s. gordonii and s. sanguis. human v beta 1 t-cell receptor primer 434 yielded concordant genotypic identification of all phenotypically defined s. crista and s. parasanguis, 83% of s. oralis, and 74% of s. mitis biovar 1. amplicon patterns for s. mitis biovar 2 were heterogeneous. findings suggest that primers rr2 and 434 in succession will allow rapid identification of genotypic groups corresponding closely to mitis group species established by phenotype.

TI  == [analysis of serum antibodies to alpha-streptococci in patients with tonsil-related pustulosis palmaris et plantaris].
AB  == to determine the systemic immune response to alpha-streptococci (str. sanguis, str. salivarius and str. mitis) and beta streptococcus (str. pyogenes t12) in patients with tonsil related pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp), we measured  serum antibody levels to whole cell body antigens of streptococcus (str.) sanguis, str. salivarius, str. mitis or str. pyogenes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the serum igg antibody levels to alpha-streptococci, str. sanguis and str. salivarius were significantly higher in patients with ppp (n = 44) than in patients with recurrent tonsillitis (rt: n = 25) and in healthy  adults (n = 17). serum antibody igg level to str. pyogenes was not different among the 3 groups. the iga antibody levels against any streptococcus strain were not different among the 3 groups. the igm antibody levels to str. pyogenes were significantly higher in patients with rt than in patients with ppp. in western blot analysis, the serum igg antibodies against 25-27 kda protein from whole cell body of str. sanguis, str. salivarius and str. mitis were found more frequently in patients with ppp than in healthy adults. however, the western blot profile in str. pyogenes was not different between ppp and healthy adults. no significant difference was seen in the western blot profile of igm or igm antibodies to any streptococcal whole cell bodies. these data suggest that systemic hyper immune response to alpha-streptococci may be present in patients with tonsil-related ppp and the 25-27 kda protein of the organism may be the target for this immunologic  abnormality.

TI  == cumulative correlations of lysozyme, lactoferrin, peroxidase, s-iga, amylase, and total protein concentrations with adherence of oral viridans streptococci to microplates coated with human saliva.
AB  == redundancy refers to the observation that many salivary proteins exhibit similar  properties in vitro. it is possible that bacterial adherence to salivary pellicle occurs as a cumulative effect of multiple proteins. this study determined the joint and individual contributions of salivary amylase, s-iga, lysozyme, salivary peroxidase, lactoferrin, and total protein concentrations to adherence by oral viridans streptococci in microplates coated with whole saliva from 123 persons. strains used were: streptococcus gordonii blackburn, 10558, streptococcus mitis 10712, 903, streptococcus oralis 10557, 9811, and streptococcus sanguis 10556, 13379. rabbit antibody against 13379 was used for the detection of adherence. this antibody cross-reacted with all strains. absorbance was standardized against saliva pooled from five donors. all saliva samples had been previously assayed for amylase, lactoferrin, lysozyme, secretory iga, peroxidase, and total protein. adherence scores for all strains except 13379 were significantly and positively correlated. salivas binding high or low levels of one strain tended to bind others correspondingly. multiple regression indicated significant contributions to 10558 adherence from total protein and lactoferrin (positive), and peroxidase  and lysozyme (negative). similar results were obtained for blackburn and 903. significant individual correlations were seen for 9811 and total protein (positive), 10557 and peroxidase (negative), and 13379 and lactoferrin (negative). salivas with high adherence scores contained significantly more protein and lactoferrin, and significantly less peroxidase, than salivas with low adherence scores. these findings support the hypothesis that multiple proteins contribute to the adherence of streptococcal strains in vivo.

TI  == efficacy of trovafloxacin in treatment of experimental staphylococcal or streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  == the efficacy of trovafloxacin against staphylococcus aureus and viridans group streptococci was investigated in vitro and in an experimental model of endocarditis. the mics at which trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin inhibited 90% of  clinical isolates of such bacteria (mic90s) were (i) 0.03 and 2 mg/liter, respectively, for 30 ciprofloxacin-susceptible s. aureus isolates, (ii) 32 and 128 mg/liter, respectively, for 20 ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus isolates, and (iii) 0.25 and 8 mg/liter, respectively, for 28 viridans group streptococci.  rats with aortic vegetations were infected with either of two ciprofloxacin-susceptible but methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains (strains col and p8), one penicillin-susceptible streptococcus sanguis strain, or one penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis strain. rats were treated for 3 or 5 days with doses that resulted in kinetics that simulated those achieved in humans with trovafloxacin (200 mg orally once a day), ciprofloxacin (750 mg orally twice a day), vancomycin (1 g intravenously twice a day), or ceftriaxone (2 g intravenously once a day). against the staphylococci, the activities of both trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin were equivalent to that of vancomycin, and treatment of endocarditis with these drugs was successful (p < 0.05). however, ciprofloxacin selected for resistant derivatives in vitro and in vivo, whereas trovafloxacin was 10 to 100 times less prone than ciprofloxacin to select for resistance in vitro and did not select for resistance in vivo. against the two streptococcal isolates, trovafloxacin significantly (p < 0.05) decreased bacterial counts in the vegetations but was less effective than the control drug, ceftriaxone. thus, a simulated oral dose of trovafloxacin (200 mg per day) was effective against ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylococci and was less likely than ciprofloxacin to select for resistance. the simulated oral dose of trovafloxacin also had some activity against streptococcal endocarditis, but optimal treatment of infections caused by such organisms might require higher doses of the drug.

TI  == [alpha-hemolytic streptococci and root canal irrigants. an evaluation of the bactericidal efficacy of sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine gluconate plus cetrimide].
AB  == background and aims: the main bacterial species present in pulpal and periapical  microbic flora is alpha-hemolytic streptococci. they are regarded as facultative  anaerobes which prefer to grow in anaerobiosis. canal irrigation plays an important role in the success of endodontic treatment given that, on the one hand, it encourages the gradual elimination of the smear layer, and on the other  it neutralises microbic flora in the root canal. the aim of this study was to test the microbiological efficacy of sodium hypochlorite 1% and s new generation  irrigant based on chlorhexidine 0.2% and cetrimide 0.2%. methods: the test was performed on the following alpha-hemolytic streptococci bacteria (dasit, cornaredo, italy): streptococcus mitis atcc 9811; streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419; streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556. the working concentration (cfu/ml) was defined as 0.5 mc farland which corresponds to a concentration of microorganisms of approximately 1.5 x 10(8) bacteria. the following canal irrigants were used: 1) cetrimide 0.2% + chlorhexidine 0.2% (cetrexidin vebas, s. giuliano milanese, italy); 2) naocl 1% (ogna, milan, italy). each individual substance remained in contact with the bacterial species  used in the test for 10'-20'-30'. results: the results obtained show the bactericidal efficacy of both the irrigants used, even after a short period of contact. conclusions: this does not mean that all irrigants are equal and/or promise the same results. this was a microbiological study, but it is nonetheless important to take other variables into account, such as contact time. moreover, in order to increase the probabilities for the success of endodontic treatment, canal irrigants must also present other characteristics, namely: biocompatibility, scarce toxicity, high proteolytic power.

TI  == acid-regulated proteins induced by streptococcus mutans and other oral bacteria during acid shock.
AB  == our previous research has demonstrated that with the more aciduric oral bacteria, an acid shock to sub-lethal ph values results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that protects the cells at extremely low ph (ph 3.0-4.0) that  kills unadapted control cells maintained at ph 7.5 (oral microbiol immunol 1997:  12: 266-273). in this study, we were interested in comparing the protein profiles of acid-shocked and control cells of nine organisms from three acid-ogenic genera that could be categorized as strong, weak and non-acid responders in an attempt to identify proteins that could be classified as acid-regulated proteins and which may be important in the process of survival at very low ph. for this, log-phase cultures were rapidly acidified from ph 7.5 to 5.5 in the presence of [14c]-amino acids for varying periods up to 2 h, the period previously shown to be required for maximum induction of the acid response. the cells were extracted  for total protein and subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide chromatography with comparable control and acid-shocked protein profiles compared by scanning and computer analysis. of particular interest were the proteins in the acid-shocked cells that showed enhanced labeling (i.e., synthesis) over the control cells, since these were considered acid-regulated proteins of importance in ph homeostasis. streptococcus mutans lt11 generated the most rapid and complex pattern: a total of 36 acid-regulated proteins showing enhanced synthesis, with 25 appearing within the first 30 min of acid shock. the enhanced synthesis was transient with all proteins, with the exception of two with molecular weights of 50/49 and 33/32 kda. within the acid-regulated proteins were proteins having molecular weights comparable to the  heat shock proteins and the various subunits of the membrane h+/atpase. by comparison, the strong responder, lactobacillus casei 151, showed the enhanced formation of only nine proteins within the first 30 min of the acid shock, with a total of 11 acid-regulated proteins formed during the 2-h adaptation period with  enhanced synthesis transient for seven of these proteins. streptococcus salivarius at2 and streptococcus gordonii th12 had the formation of 6 and 8 proteins enhanced, while the weakly responding organisms, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10,556 and streptococcus oralis atcc 10,557, exhibited 8 and 6 such proteins, respectively. even non-responding strains unable to survive at very low ph, such as streptococcus sobrinus ch125/43, streptococcus mitis atcc 12,261 and  actinomyces naeslundii 301-13 showed the initial formation of 3-9 acid-regulated  proteins, but protein synthesis was not sustained over the entire adaptation period. clearly, the survival of oral bacteria at very low ph is related, not to  the total number of the acid-regulated proteins induced per se but to the formation of key proteins that function to augment normal ph homeostasis.

TI  == detection of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia using 16s rrna gene amplification by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == episodes of fever and neutropenia are common complications of treatment for cancer. the use of prophylactic and early empirical antibiotics has reduced mortality but decreases the sensitivity of diagnostic tests based on culture. the aim of this study was to determine the potential of a broad diagnostic approach (eubacterial) based on 16s rrna gene amplification and sequencing to augment cultural methods of diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia in a regional paediatric oncology centre. one hundred eleven patient-episodes of fever and neutropenia were evaluated during the study period, 17 of which were associated with positive blood cultures, as follows: staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 6 episodes), enterococcus faecium (n = 2), streptococcus sanguis (n = 3), streptococcus mitis (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), micrococcus spp. (n = 1), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 1). eubacterial polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detected bacterial dna in nine of 11  blood culture-positive episodes for which a sample was available for pcr; the species identified by sequence analysis were identical to those derived from the  conventional identification of the cultured isolates. bacterial dna was detected  in 20 episodes (21 bacterial sequences) associated with negative blood cultures,  18 of which occurred in patients who were receiving antibiotics at the time of sample collection. the species presumptively identified by partial 16s rrna gene  sequencing were as follows: pseudomonas spp. (n = 6 episodes), acinetobacter spp. (n =5 ); escherichia spp. (n = 3); moraxella spp. (n = 3); staphylococcus spp. (n = 2); neisseria spp. (n = 1); and bacillus spp. (n = 1). the results of this study suggest that molecular techniques can augment cultural methods in the diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients who have been treated with antibiotics.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == a comprehensive genetic study of streptococcal immunoglobulin a1 proteases: evidence for recombination within and between species.
AB  == an analysis of 13 immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease genes (iga) of strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus sanguis was carried out to obtain information on the structure, polymorphism, and phylogeny of this specific protease, which enables bacteria to  evade functions of the predominant ig isotype on mucosal surfaces. the analysis included cloning and sequencing of iga genes from s. oralis and s. mitis biovar 1, sequencing of an additional seven iga genes from s. sanguis biovars 1 through  4, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analyses of iga genes of another 10 strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and 6 strains of s. oralis. all 13 genes  sequenced had the potential of encoding proteins with molecular masses of approximately 200 kda containing the sequence motif hemth and an e residue 20 amino acids downstream, which are characteristic of zn metalloproteinases. in addition, all had a typical gram-positive cell wall anchor motif, lpntg, which, in contrast to such motifs in other known streptococcal and staphylococcal proteins, was located in their n-terminal parts. repeat structures showing variation in number and sequence were present in all strains and may be of relevance to the immunogenicities of the enzymes. protease activities in cultures of the streptococcal strains were associated with species of different molecular  masses ranging from 130 to 200 kda, suggesting posttranslational processing possibly as a result of autoproteolysis at post-proline peptide bonds in the n-terminal parts of the molecules. comparison of deduced amino acid sequences revealed a 94% similarity between s. oralis and s. mitis iga1 proteases and a 75  to 79% similarity between iga1 proteases of these species and those of s. pneumoniae and s. sanguis, respectively. combined with the results of rflp analyses using different iga gene fragments as probes, the results of nucleotide  sequence comparisons provide evidence of horizontal transfer of iga gene sequences among individual strains of s. sanguis as well as among s. mitis and the two species s. pneumoniae and s. oralis. while iga genes of s. sanguis and s. oralis were highly homogeneous, the genes of s. pneumoniae and s. mitis showed extensive polymorphism reflected in different degrees of antigenic diversity.

TI  == comparison of the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy and diseased adults in northern cameroon.
AB  == our study is the 1st report on subgingival microbiota in adult cameronians. the aim was to investigate, using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique, the prevalence of 18 oral species in subgingival plaque samples obtained from sex- and age-matched cameronian adults with and without periodontal destruction.  we also compared cultivation and the affirm dp test with the checkerboard technique in their capability to detect some selected species among the 18. 21 adult periodontitis patients and 21 periodontally healthy subjects were examined  and the results were compared statistically. each periodontitis patient had at least 4 pockets of > or = 6 mm depth, while the healthy subjects had no sites more than 3 mm deep. results of the checkerboard analysis showed that significantly (p < 0.05) more periodontitis patients tested positive for most of  the 18 bacterial species. the gram-positive species actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis, known as microbiota of healthy sites, were detected significantly more frequently in the healthy group. cultivation demonstrated p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum in significantly lower %s of patients as compared  to the checkerboard technique. furthermore, the affirm dp test detected p. gingivalis and b. forsythus in significantly fewer patients than did the checkerboard technique. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 52.3% of the patients by the latter technique while the affirm dp test failed to detect the bacterium in any of the samples. overall, the results of the present study confirm the importance of the screening method and indicate that the prevalences  of the investigated putative periodontal pathogens and beneficial species in the  healthy and diseased adult cameronians were similar to those reported for adults  in the west and in some developing countries.

TI  == structural and antigenic types of cell wall polysaccharides from viridans group streptococci with receptors for oral actinomyces and streptococcal lectins.
AB  == lectin-mediated interactions between oral viridans group streptococci and actinomyces may play an important role in microbial colonization of the tooth surface. the presence of two host-like motifs, either galnac beta1-->3gal (gn) or gal beta1-->3galnac (g), in the cell wall polysaccharides of five streptococcal strains accounts for the lactose-sensitive coaggregations of these bacteria with  actinomyces naeslundii. three streptococcal strains which have gn-containing polysaccharides also participate in galnac-sensitive coaggregations with strains  of streptococcus gordonii and s. sanguis. each gn- or g-containing polysaccharide is composed of a distinct phosphodiester-linked hexa- or heptasaccharide repeating unit. the occurrence of these polysaccharides on 19 additional viridans group streptococcal strains that participate in lactose-sensitive coaggregations  with actinomyces was examined. negatively charged polysaccharides that reacted with bauhinia purpurea agglutinin, a gal and galnac binding plant lectin, were isolated from 17 strains by anion exchange column chromatography of mutanolysin-cell wall digests. results from nuclear magnetic resonance and immunodiffusion identified each of 16 polysaccharides as a known gn- or g-containing structural type and one polysaccharide as a new but closely related  gn-containing type. unlike the reactions of lectins, the cross-reactions of most  rabbit antisera with these polysaccharides were correlated with structural features other than the host-like motifs. gn-containing polysaccharides occurred  primarily on the strains of s. sanguis and s. oralis while g-containing polysaccharides were more common among the strains of s. gordonii and s. mitis examined. the findings strongly support the hypothesis that lectin-mediated recognition of these streptococci by other oral bacteria depends on a family of antigenically diverse gn- and g-containing cell wall polysaccharides, the occurrence of which may differ between streptococcal species.

TI  == effect of radiotherapy on the levels of secretory immunoglobulin a against indigenous and virulent streptococci.
AB  == it is well known that the frequency of upper respiratory infection is clinically  increased after radiotherapy of the head and neck region. this study found higher antibacterial secretory immunoglobulin a (s-iga) activity against three indigenous streptococci (streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius, and s. sanguis i) and s. pneumoniae in patients who had undergone radiation therapy of the head and neck region than in control subjects. this showed no relation to the extent of the radiation field. compared with before radiotherapy, the s-iga titer against s. pneumoniae and its ratio to the activities against the indigenous streptococci were significantly higher in patients with fully irradiated major salivary glands. these results indicated that the radiotherapy promoted the antigen-specific s-iga production of virulent streptococci in most patients with  head and neck cancer, even more than 6 months after radiotherapy. the resulting altered balance in the s-iga system of normal indigenous streptococci may also impair the ability to maintain the stable bacterial interference between normal indigenous and virulent streptococci in the oropharyngeal cavity.

TI  == variations in the predominant cultivable microflora of dental plaque at defined subsites on approximal tooth surfaces in children.
AB  == the distribution and composition of the resident microflora were determined in approximal gingival margin plaque from 21 premolars extracted from schoolchildren (mean age 12.0 +/- 1.8 yr). indigo carmine (5% w v) was used to visualize plaque  to facilitate sampling. about 1 mm2 of plaque was removed from sites away from (a), to the side of (s), and below (b) the contact area. plaque samples were dispersed, serially diluted, and cultured on selective and non-selective agar media. an average of seven to nine species was found at each subsite. streptococcus and actinomyces were subdivided on the basis of a range of biochemical tests. the predominant actinomyces and streptococcal species at most  subsites were a. naeslundii and strep. mitis biovar i. a. naeslundii and a. odontolyticus were isolated more often at subsite b (90.5 and 57.1%, respectively), and a. israelii at subsite s (66.7%) strep. mitis 1 and strep. sanguis were found more frequently at subsite s (76.2 and 66.7% respectively), whereas strep mutans, strep. sobrinus, strep. gordonii and veillonella spp. were  recovered most commonly from subsite b (85.7, 33.3, 38.1 and 76.2%, respectively). the isolation frequencies of strep. mutans and strep. sobrinus were significantly higher at subsite b (a b p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). veillonella spp. were significantly higher at subsites b and s (a < b, p > 0.01;  b > s, p < 0.05), while neisseria spp. were most common at subsite a (a > b. p >  0.03). igal protease-producing species were found at each subsite, but they formed only a small proportion of the total streptococcus population. this study  has shown that local variations were evident at different subsites, both with respect to species prevalence and to proportions of each species within each subsite. the population shifts in gingival margin plaque appear to relate to the  location of plaque in relation to the most caries-prone site below the contact area b.

AB  == background: the evaluation of the reliability of a group of three tests: pyrrolidonil-arilamidase, rapid test in nacl esculin broth and group d antistreptococci agglutination for the rapid identification of the enterococcus genus were performed. methods: one hundred fifty-eight strains of streptococci: 110 strains of enterococcus faecalis, 8 e. faecium, 3 e. avium, 16 streptococcus  intermedius, 7 s. salivarius, 4 s. bovis, 4 s. constellatus, 2 s. sanguis and 1 strain of s. equinus, s. mitis, s. uberis and s. mutans were studied. the tests used were: rapid test in nacl- esculin broth, pyrrolidonyl-arilamidase and antigroup d streptococcus agglutination (patho dx strep d/pyr; diagnostic product corporation). all catalase-negative gram-positive cocci or coccibacilli which were positive in the three tests were considered to belong to the enterococcus genus. the usefulness of gram staining in culture in thioglycolate broth was also studied comparing it with the results obtained with solid medium. results: the results of the proposed identification scheme were evaluated calculating different parameters: sensitivity 98%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value, 100%, and negative predictive value 94%. no significant differences were observed between the results obtained with gram staining with thioglycolate broth and those obtained with solid medium except in the case of the streptococcus mutans strain. conclusions: the application of a combination of tests: pyrroidonyl-arilamidase, antistreptococci group d agglutination and rapid test in nacl-esculin broth to catalase-negative gram-positive cocci and coccobacilli allows reliable identification in a maximum of three hours of strains belonging to the enterococcus genus.

AB  == numerical taxonomic methods were applied to the results of pyrolysis mass spectrometry (py-ms) and conventional test reaction patterns (ctrps) obtained with 46 strains of oral streptococci identified as representative of six species. of these: streptococcus gordonii strains formed a single homogeneous well-differentiated cluster both in the py-ms and ctrp analyses; s. oralis strains were more diverse, forming 2 ctrp and 3 py-ms clusters; s. crista, s. parasanguis and s. sanguis formed clear, but diverse and poorly differentiated clusters on the basis of ctrps, and were poorly differentiated in the py-ms analysis; and s. mitis strains were clearly diverse in both analyses. peritrichously fimbriate ('tufted') s. mitis strains formed a tight cluster, well differentiated from the type strain in both py-ms and ctrp analyses, and may represent a previously unrecognised centre of variation.

TI  == occurrence of lipoteichoic acid in oral streptococci.
AB  == the heterogeneous bacterial group known as oral streptococci was screened for the presence of cellular polyglycerolphosphate-containing lipoteichoic acid. this compound was detected in phenol extracts of lyophilized cells by an immunoassay in which polyglycerolphosphate-specific monoclonal antibody was used. polyglycerolphosphate-containing lipoteichoic acid occurred in all 86 strains of  oral streptococci examined except the streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis strains. this confirms the findings of rosan (b. rosan, science 201:918-920, 1978) and hamada et al. (s. hamada, j. mizuno, s. kotani, and m. torii, fems microbiol. lett. 8:93-96, 1980), is consistent with the results of the taxonomic study of oral streptococci performed by kilian et al.

AB  == given the hypothesis that root caries is the result of acid formation by acidogenic micro-organisms, the present study was performed to relate sucrose-induced ph response of dental plaque on root surfaces to the microbial composition of the overlying plaque. seventeen caries-active elderly chinese with poor oral hygiene and with both sound and carious root surfaces were examined. plaque ph was measured before and up to one hour after a controlled sucrose mouthrinse. plaque samples for microbiologic analyses were collected from 2 sound and 2 or 3 carious ph-measurement sites in each subject. the prevalence of the following micro-organisms was assessed as % of total viable counts on brucella agar: prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium nucleatum,  campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp., actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundi, streptococcus spp., s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus spp., and candida spp. there was no difference in plaque ph response on sound and carious root surfaces. the plaque ph response was more pronounced in the maxilla than in the mandible for both sound and carious sites.  there was no difference in microbial composition of dental plaque on sound and carious root surfaces. the ph response to sucrose was the same regardless of the  presence or absence of mutans streptococci. our results thus do not readily support the traditional concept of caries formation.

TI  == disruption of the gene encoding penicillin-binding protein 2b (pbp2b) causes altered cell morphology and cease in exopolysaccharide production in streptococcus thermophilus sfi6.
AB  == genetic and biochemical analysis of exopolysaccharide (eps) production in lactic  acid bacteria has been a growing field of interest in the food industry. we previously identified and characterized a gene cluster composed of 13 genes (epsa to epsm) responsible for eps production in streptococcus thermophilus sfi6. here  we report one further gene, pbp2b, that is connected to eps production. mutants with a gene disruption in pbp2b were no longer able to produce eps, exhibited a reduced growth-rate, and their cell morphology was altered. the predicted gene product showed significant homology to the class b penicillin-binding proteins 2b of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis involved in peptidoglycan synthesis. upstream of pbp2b, we further identified two genes which showed significant homology to the e. coli fold and urfl, which is an unidentified open reading frame presumed to be involved in dna repair. downstream of pbp2b, we identified a gene that showed homology to the bacillus subtilis and  the escherichia coli recm or recr which, respectively, are involved in the methyl-dependent dna mismatch repair. in s. thermophilus, pbp2b and recm were transcribed from their own promoters as monocistronic mrnas and are therefore organized as independent transcriptional units.

TI  == utilization of sialic acid by viridans streptococci.
AB  == the importance of viridans streptococci as agents of serious extra-oral diseases, including endocarditis, is now recognized. we have tested the hypothesis that the ability to utilize sialic acid as a nutrient source may play a role in the proliferation of these organisms. the type strains of the 15 presently recognized species of viridans streptococci and two clinical isolates-s. oralis (ar3), isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis, and s. intermedius (uns35),  a brain abscess isolate-were studied for their ability to utilize sialic acid. only s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. gordonii, s. mitis ("oralis group") s. intermedius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus ("milleri group"), and s. defectivus ("nutritionally variant group") were able to use sialic acid (n-acetylneuraminic  acid) efficiently as a sole carbon source. formate, acetate, and ethanol were produced as the major metabolic end-products of sialic acid metabolism, while corresponding glucose-grown cultures produced lactate as the major metabolic end-product. utilization of sialic acid was independent of the production of sialidase. cell-free extracts of sialic acid-grown cultures expressed elevated levels of n-acetylneuraminate pyruvate-lyase (npl; the first enzyme in the intracellular catabolism of sialic acid) and n-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (glcnac-6-p) deacetylase and glucosamine-6-phosphate (glcn-6-p) deaminase (enzymes involved in the intracellular catabolism of n-acetylglucosamine). these  activities were repressed by growth in the presence of glucose. the intracellular fate of sialic acid, after cleavage by npl into n-acetylmannosamine (mannac) and  pyruvate, is uncertain, but the elevated levels of glcnac-6-p deacetylase and glcn-6-p deaminase in sialic acid-grown cells suggest that phosphorylation and isomerization are possible steps in the metabolism of mannac to generate an intermediate common to the pathway of n-acetylglucosamine metabolism. the species of viridans streptococci that have the ability to utilize sialic acid are those most commonly associated with extra-oral diseases, and this ability is likely to  play a role in the persistence and survival of these infecting organisms in vivo.

TI  == induced candidosis in mice with artificially established oral flora.
AB  == the aim of this study was to gauge the effect of an artificially established flora, unnatural for mice, on the induction of oral candidosis in mice. four groups of balb/c mice were compared; conventional candida albicans-free mice, "germ-free" mice which had been inoculated with candida-free human saliva, germ-free mice which had been exposed to a cocktail of streptococcus mitis, s. sobrinus and s. sanguis, and uncontaminated germ-free mice. after exposure to c.  albicans via drinking water, the four groups of mice were killed and their oral cavities examined for candidal growth and oral lesions. conventional mice yielded significantly less candidal growth and exhibited significantly fewer oral lesions than the other three groups. candidal lesions in the two groups of contaminated germ-free mice were significantly fewer than in the uncontaminated germ-free mice. the latter exhibited extensive candidal lesions with little inflammatory infiltrate. it is concluded that mice with human oral micro-organisms have some resistance against candidal infection albeit at a reduced level, that mice with natural oral flora are highly resistant, and that germ-free mice are extremely susceptible to c. albicans infection.

AB  == the expression of sialy-lewis(x) (sle(x); neu5ac alpha 2-3 gal beta 1-4) (fuc alpha 1-3) glcnac-r) on oral bacteria producing infective endocarditis was determined by a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and an immunoelectron microscopy using the well-characterized anti-sle(x) monoclonal antibody snh-3 (mab snh-3; igm class). mab snh-3 reacted strongly with whole cells of oral bacteria: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus pyogenes, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens and porphyromonas gingivalis. the negatively stained immuno-electron micrograph of streptococcus pyogenes showed many reactive gold particles on the cell surface. our findings demonstrated the existence of immunologic mimicry between the sle(x) oligosaccharide and cell surface antigens of many species associated with infective endocarditis. we propose the hypothesis that if these bacteria escape their normal habitats, the surface components that mimic the sle(x) oligosaccharide might bind to host antigens of the selectin family which could promote binding to endothelial cells and, consequently, initiation of the events  leading to infective endocarditis.

TI  == bacteria in human mouths involved in the production and utilization of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == earlier studies have demonstrated that pure cultures of oral streptococci produce hydrogen peroxide but none has found any free peroxide in dental plaque or salivary sediment despite streptococci being major components of their mixed bacterial populations. the absence of peroxide in plaque and sediment could be due to the dominance of its destruction over its formation by bacterial constituents. to identify which of the oral bacteria might be involved in such a  possibility, pure cultures of 27 different oral bacteria were surveyed (as well as dental plaque and sediment) for their peroxide-forming and peroxide-removing capabilities. peroxide production was measured for each of the pure cultures by incubation with glucose at low and high substrate concentrations (2.8 and 28.0 mm) for 4 h and with the ph kept at 7.0 by a ph-stat. removal of hydrogen peroxide was assessed in similar experiments where peroxide at 0, 29.4, 147.2 or  294.4 mm [0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1% (w/v)] replaced the glucose. hydrogen peroxide formation was seen with only three of the bacteria tested, streptococcus sanguis  i and ii (sanguis and oralis), and strep. mitior (mitis biotype i); levels of hydrogen peroxide between 2.2 and 9.8 mm were produced when these micro-organisms were grown aerobically and 1.1 and 3.9 mm when grown anaerobically. earlier reports indicate that such levels were usually sufficient to inhibit the growth of many plaque bacteria. the amounts formed were similar at the two glucose levels tested, suggesting that maximum peroxide production is reached at low glucose concentration. none of the three peroxide-producing organisms was able to utilize hydrogen peroxide but five of the other 24 tested, neisseria sicca, haemophilus segnis, h. parainfluenzae, actinomyces viscosus and staphylococcus epidermidis, could readily do so, as could the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment and dental plaque, both of which contain relatively high numbers of these peroxide-utilizing micro-organisms. the ability of the bacteria in plaque and sediment to degrade hydrogen peroxide was considerable and extremely rapid; peroxide removal and usually complete within the first 15 min of the incubation even when its initial level was as high as 294.4 mm. this almost overwhelming ability to remove peroxide was confirmed when peroxide-producing and -using cultures were mixed and when each of eight salivary sediments was incubated with  glucose and with peroxide at concentrations up to 294.4 mm. in the glucose incubations, no hydrogen peroxide was observed, indicating dominance of microbial peroxide removers over hydrogen peroxide producers.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == viridans streptococci isolated from the bloodstream. relevance of species identification.
AB  == over a 4-year-period, 104 isolates belonging to the viridans streptococci were recovered from the blood and identified to the species according to beighton and  co-workers. streptococcus oralis was the species most frequently recovered from patients in the hematology unit [29 of 39 (74%)]. streptococcus mitis ranked second [seven of 39 (18%)]. both species were associated with oromucositis. isolates presently identified as s. oralis are mainly those previously identified as s. mitis or streptococcus sanguis ii. streptococcus milleri was most frequently isolated in the patients from the general hospital population [28 of 65 (43%) isolates]: streptococcus anginosus (n = 20), streptococcus constellatus  (n = 4), and streptococcus intermedius (n = 4). in 14 episodes from the general hospital population, clinical significance was judged questionable. from this part of the laboratory, clinical significance could not be predicted from the number of blood cultures grown, nor from the delay of growth detection. the rapid id 32 strep system agreed well with the identifications according to the scheme of beighton et al., whereas the api 20 strep system did not.

TI  == degradative enzymes of oral streptococci.
AB  == members of the streptococcus sanguis group (ssg) and streptococcus milleri group  (smg) were screened for their ability to produce glycosidase, arylamidase (peptidase), protease, dextranase and glycosyltransferase activities. species within each group produced unique patterns of activity. the most commonly produced glycosidases were beta-d-glucosidase, beta-d-galactosidase, n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase and n-acetyl-beta-d-galactosaminidase and the least commonly produced glycosidase activity was beta-fucosidase with streptococcus intermedius (smg) being the only species capable of producing the activity. for arylamidase activity, the most commonly produced type was lysine-arylamidase. glycosidase and arylamidase activities were localized to particular sub-cellular fractions. alpha-galactosidase was found only in culture  supernatant fluids whereas n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase was found in all fractions; the culture supernatant, cell wall, cell membrane and cytoplasm. no arylamidase activity was seen in culture supernatants. phe-arg-arylamidase was found only in cytoplasmic fractions whereas val-pro-argarylamidase was found in cell walls, cell membranes and cytoplasmic fraction. protease activity was measured as the degradation of bovine serum albumin (bsa) and casein. casein was  degraded by a number of strains whereas no species/strains were able to degrade bsa. streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus (smg), streptococcus mitior and streptococcus defectivus (ssg) were the only species that produced hyaluronidase and no species produced chondroitin sulphatase. the groups were also examined for their abilities to produce glycosyltransferase and dextranase.  strep. sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis produced glucosyltransferase and, with the exception of the latter species, fructosyltransferase. no species within the smg was capable of producing either glycosyltransferase.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == a comparison of the microbial flora in carious dentine of clinically detectable and undetectable occlusal lesions.
AB  == it is not known whether the aetiology of occlusal hidden caries lesions (hcl) is  identical to that of small visible lesions (svl). previous studies of the microflora of hcl suggest that relatively few species can be isolated. the aim of the present study was to compare the bacterial composition of dentine from 10 hcl and 17 svl in a population of children aged 8-18 years. the following bacteria were identified: actinomyces spp., mutans streptococci, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii. streptococcus mitis, and lactobacillus spp. streptococcus mutans was found more often in the hcl group (p  = 0.03), while streptococcus sobrinus was found more often in the svl group (p =  0.05). however, proportions of both species were lower in the svl group as compared with the hcl group (s. mutans p = 0.07; s. sobrinus p = 0.03). lactobacilli and actinomyces spp. were found at similar levels in both groups. a  more diverse range of streptococcal species and veillonella was found in the svl  group (p = 0.001). these results show a less complex microflora in hcl as compared with svl, indicating that the aetiology of hidden caries might be different from that of open caries.

TI  == streptococci and actinomyces inhibit regrowth of streptococcus mutans on gnotobiotic rat molar teeth after chlorhexidine varnish treatment.
AB  == clinical studies suggest that the long-term suppression of mutans streptococci on tooth surfaces after intensive chlorhexidine therapy is mainly due to bacterial interference. other streptococci and also actinomyces naeslundii are proposed to  inhibit regrowth of mutans streptococci after suppression by the agent. we have tested this hypothesis in gnotobiotic rats associated with streptococcus mutans alone, or associated with s. mutans and strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis biovar i, and  a. naeslundii. left lower jaws in these rats were treated with concentrated chlorhexidine varnish, and the return of s. mutans on the treated jaws monitored. in mono-associated rats, s. mutans regained the level of the untreated right lower jaw in approximately 1 week. in contrast, s. mutans remained suppressed for several weeks in rats multi-associated with other streptococci and actinomyces strains. the suppression was more pronounced in the rats fed on basal diet with little free sugars than in rats fed on a sucrose-containing diet. counts of other streptococci recovered quickly from the intensive chlorhexidine treatment, but a. naeslundii remained suppressed for at least 1 week. the findings demonstrate the  crucial importance of the oral microflora in controlling regrowth of mutans streptococci after chemotherapy.

TI  == adsorption of salivary proteins to the surface of oral streptococcal cells.
AB  == oral tissues, especially tooth surfaces, are covered with a layer of salivary proteins. oral bacterial cells that adsorb to salivary components accumulated on  the tooth surface are, as a rule, covered with the same components, especially proteins. thus, it is possible that the salivary proteins covering the bacterial  cells are related to the adhesion of bacteria to oral tissues. the aim of this study was to clarify the mechanisms of adsorption of salivary proteins to the surface of streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis and s. salivarius using an adsorption  assay with salivary proteins labeled with tritiated formaldehyde. the results showed that salivary proteins adsorbed more to s. salivarius than to s. mitis, and least to s. sanguis. it was evident that hydrophobic bonding was involved in  the adsorption of salivary proteins to the bacterial cells tested. the amount of  salivary proteins adsorbed to s. mitis and s. salivarius was decreased by the presence of phosphate, that to s. sanguis was increased by the presence of a divalent cation such as ca2+, and that to all bacteria tested was inhibited in different ways by the presence of sugars. the amount of salivary proteins adsorbed to s. sanguis and s. salivarius was reduced effectively by pretreatment  of the cells with trypsin, chymotrypsin and papain. in the case of s. mitis, the  amount of adsorbed salivary proteins was decreased by pretreatment of the cells with chymotrypsin only, and was increased by pretreatment with lipase. these results indicate that there are different mechanisms of adsorption of salivary protein to the cell surfaces of oral streptococci.

AB  == the aim of the present study was to compare two methods for estimation of bacterial growth interference between various bacteria using a bioscreen robot analyzer, allowing kinetic documentation, and a cocultivation test on blood agar  plates. six laboratory strains with different virulence and growth requirements were used: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mitis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the interference activity was correlated with a reference system of streptococcus sanguis (strain alpha 89) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci, gas serotypes t 9 and t 22). the methods used and results obtained were as follows: 1. estimation of synergistic and antagonistic bacterial interferences using a bioscreen robot analyzer. suspensions of viable bacteria were added to microtiter plates with different concentrations of uv light-killed bacteria in liquid media. the bioscreen analyzer monitored bacterial growth every 10 min for 24 h giving kinetic data during the growth period. synergisms as well as antagonisms were demonstrated between the tested bacterial  strains which have not earlier been reported in the literature. however, the antagonistic effect observed between the six strains was less than that induced by the s. sanguis strain on the two strains of s. pyogenes. 2. cocultivation of bacterial strains on blood agar surface with precultivated or simultaneously stamped interfering bacteria indicated no detectable interference between the six tested bacterial strains, while the s. sanguis strain inhibited the growth of s.  pyogenes strains as well as the hemolysis around the colonies. the bioscreen method was found more sensitive for testing bacterial interference compared to the commonly used blood agar test.

AB  == background: the viridans group streptococcus (svg) include species which may have different pathogenic capacity. this study was aimed at evaluating the clinical significance of bacteremia by different species of svg. patients and methods: one hundred ninety-four clinical records of patients with blood culture(s) isolation  (hemoline/biomerieux) of svg (api 20 strep/biomerieux) over 9 years were reviewed with criteria of clinical significance being established and the results analyzed by the chi square test. results: the most frequent species of svg isolated were:  s. sanguis ii (29.4%), s. mitis (27.3%) and s. anginosus (12.9%). with regard to  the criteria established, 36% of the isolates were clinically significant, associating s. anginosus with significant bacteremia (p = 0.001) and s. mitis with non significant bacteremia (p = 0.04). more than half of the isolations of s. anginosus, s. bovis, s. mutans and s. adjacens were clinically significant with this rate being lower in the remaining species (s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii, s. mitis, s. salivarius and s. acidominimus). the significant isolations correspond with endocarditis (s. sanguis ii being responsible for 44%; p = 0.05). in 54.3% of the cases followed by abscesses or other localized infections and severe sepsis in patients with a solid or hematologic tumor with a mortality of 20%. the endocarditis/other disease relation was: greater for the existence of endocarditis for s. sanguis ii, s. sanguis i, s. mutans, s. bovis and s. adjacens; similar in both diseases for s. mitis, and greater for the existence of a non endocardic disease for s. anginosus. conclusions: in this series the isolation of svg group was clinically significant in 36% of cases with a probability of clinical significance and disease association related to the species isolated of svg.

TI  == bacteremia due to viridans streptococci in neutropenic patients: a review.
AB  == viridans streptococci have long been considered, with the exception of the ability to cause endocarditis, as minor pathogenic agents. more recently, however, these bacteria have become a major concern in neutropenic patients undergoing a chemotherapeutic treatment. in this high-risk population, they can be responsible for up to 39% of bacteremia cases and are the most frequent cause  of this type of infection. the most frequently isolated species in blood cultures are streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis ii. viridans streptococcus bacteremia can be accompanied by serious complications, like adult respiratory distress syndrome (ards) (3% to 33%), shock (7% to 18%) or endocarditis (7% to 8%). mortality rates range from 6% to 30%. case-control studies have identified the following risk factors: severe neutropenia (< 100 neutrophils/mm3), prophylactic antibiotic treatments with quinolone or co-trimoxazole, absence of intravenous antibiotics at the time of bacteremia, high doses of cytosine arabinoside, oropharyngeal mucositis, and heavy colonization by viridans streptococci. the introduction of penicillin in prophylactic antibiotic treatments has reduced the incidence of these infections, but the long-term use of penicillin could be compromised by the emergence of resistant strains.

TI  == antigenic relationships among immunoglobulin a1 proteases from haemophilus, neisseria, and streptococcus species.
AB  == to investigate the antigenic variation and relationships of immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) proteases among different species and genera, we examined a comprehensive  collection of serine type and metallo-type iga1 proteases and corresponding antisera in enzyme neutralization assays. sharing of neutralizing epitopes of metallo-type iga1 proteases from streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis and of serine type iga1 proteases from haemophilus and pathogenic neisseria species was extremely limited. a number of limited to strong cross-reactions in such epitopes were found among serine type iga1 proteases released by members of the genera haemophilus and neisseria,  reflecting the common origin of their iga gene. however, the relatively limited prevalence of shared "neutralizing" epitopes of iga1 proteases from the two genera indicates that they rarely induce immunity to each other. in contrast, extensive sharing of neutralizing epitopes was found between n. meningitidis and  n. gonorrhoeae iga1 proteases, making them potentially attractive vaccine components. among metallo-type iga1 proteases, several pneumococcal proteases were found to induce neutralizing antibodies to iga1 proteases of oral streptococci whereas the opposite was not the case.

TI  == pioneer oral streptococci produce immunoglobulin a1 protease.
AB  == as part of a longitudinal study of the relationship between bacterial colonization and the secretory immune response, 367 isolates of pioneer viridans  streptococci collected from 40 breast- and bottle-fed neonates within the first month postpartum were tested for the production of immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease and glycosidases. fifty percent of the streptococci isolated produced iga1 protease, including all isolates of streptococcus oralis and s. sanguis, 60.7% of s. mitis biovar 1 isolates, and some isolates that could not be identified. three cleavage patterns of alpha 1 heavy chains were observed. six isolates of s. mitis biovar 1 that did not produce iga1 protease attacked the alpha 1 chain. incubation of iga1 protease-negative s. mitis biovar 1 isolates with iga1, either prior to or together with s. sanguis, rendered the iga1 paraprotein resistant to cleavage by the iga1 protease of s. sanguis. the ability of some pioneer streptococci in the human oral cavity to produce iga1 protease and of others to modify the susceptibility of iga1 to cleavage by iga1 protease perhaps enhances their ability to survive in this habitat.

AB  == in this study we localized more precisely the salivary glycoprotein-interacting and the human immunoglobulin g (higg)-cross-reacting domains on the sr molecule,  an antigen i/ii-related protein from s. mutans serotype f. mapping of the sr molecule with polypeptides expressed by subclones covering the entire molecule and with synthetic peptides demonstrates that the salivary glycoprotein-binding domain is located in the n-terminal alanine-rich repeats of the sr molecule. in order to investigate the degree of conservation of both regions in various oral streptococci, we tested the reactivity of 8 representative strains of the mutans  group and 11 nonmutans oral streptococcus strains (s. anginosus, s. milleri, s. constellatus, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. sanguis, s. gordonii, s. salivarius, and s. mitis strains) with antipeptide antibodies in a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay together with colony hybridization analysis using dna probes  designed to map these two regions. all the mutans group strains except s. rattus  and the 11 nonmutans streptococcal strains showed a high conservation of the c-terminal part of the sr molecule, especially the higg-cross-reacting domain, and less homology for the n-terminal salivary glycoprotein-binding region. almost all of the sera from patients with rheumatic disease reacted strongly with sr from s. mutans serotype f, p1 from s. mutans serotype c, and four peptides located in the higg-cross-reacting region and not with peptides located at the c  and n termini and in the proline-rich repeats. these results confirm that epitopes located within this region are immunogenic in humans and could lead to the synthesis of natural anti-igg antibodies.

AB  == the interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. ep-gp could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of elisa or by electrophoresis in combination with western transfer. the results indicated that ep-gp is bound only by streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides fragilis, s. gordonii, s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. rattus, s. constellatus, and s. anginosus. binding of ep-gp to s. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be ph-dependent with a maximum binding between ph 5 and 6. for further characterization of the binding of ep-gp  to s. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. ep-gp was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. we were able to identify a 27-kd ep-gp binding protein, by extraction of s. salivarius-cell wall  antigens and electrophoretic techniques. in addition to ep-gp, s. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory iga and low-molecular-weight mucin (mg-2).

TI  == evaluation of the capacity of oral streptococci to produce hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == the capacity of 11 strains of oral streptococcal species (streptococcus sanguis,  s. oralis, s. mitis and s. sobrinus) to produce hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) was studied in vitro. detection of this property in solid media, particularly with trypticase soy agar-benzidine-peroxidase, was more sensitive than in liquid media. the addition of carbohydrates (arabinose, xylose, mannose, sorbose and lactose), sorbitol and saccharine to buffered trypticase soy broth increased h2o2 production in s. oralis nctc 11427, although the concentrations obtained with some substrates (glucose, galactose, mannitol and xylitol) were lower than those  obtained in controls. in s. sanguis nctc 7863, h2o2 production was detected only  with galactose, sorbitol, lactose and saccharin.

TI  == biologically active extracellular products of oral viridans streptococci and the  aetiology of kawasaki disease.
AB  == a bacteriological study of isolates from the oral cavity of patients with kawasaki disease (kd), age-matched non-kd patients and healthy children, showed that over half the kd and control isolates had gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci. about 50% of these organisms were identified as viridans streptococci by means of an api strep 20 kit. further identification by fluorometric dna-dna hybridisation demonstrated that the predominant species were s. oralis and s. mitis, each of which accounted for 25% of the isolates of viridans streptococci;  40% of viridans strains were unidentifiable; and s. sanguis and s. parasanguis were minor components. studies in vivo showed that insertion of culture supernates of most of the viridans streptococci increased capillary permeability  and induced redness with swelling and occasional bleeding in rabbit skin. one-third of s. mitis strains and one-fifth of the unidentified strains caused aggregation of human blood platelets, whereas s. oralis and other strains had no  such effect. the distribution of extracellular lipoteichoic acids and glucan produced in the presence of sucrose was also examined. there were no significant  differences in the recovery rate of viridans streptococci forming these biologically active extracellular products between kd and control groups.

TI  == antibacterial effectiveness of dentin bonding systems.
AB  == this study examined the antibacterial activities of several commercially available glass ionomer cements, dentin bonding systems and luting agents by employing both agar plate diffusion (apd) and growth inhibition (gi) methods. amalgam and resin composites were also tested as control materials. in both methods (apd and gi), cylindrical specimens were used. four bacteria strains were tested: streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius, s. mitis and s. sanguis. these studies were performed using standardized innoculums with selective media, and the assayed materials were directly applied on the assay cultures and plates. the results of agar plate assay were in accordance with the results of growth inhibition method. the glass ionomer cements showed marked antibacterial activity. on the contrary, amalgam, composites, luting agents and dentinal bonding systems did not affect bacterial growth. the sensitivity of the growth method showed that all the strains were inhibited in the same way by each inhibitory material. the data suggest that the use of glass ionomer cements as cavity liners/bases may reduce the consequences of microleakage due to its antibacterial properties.

TI  == identity of viridans streptococci isolated from cases of infective endocarditis.
AB  == the oral streptococci have undergone considerable taxonomic revision in recent years but there is still little information concerning associations between the newly defined species and disease. this study examined the identities of 47 strains of oral streptococci collected from 42 confirmed cases of infective endocarditis. by means of recently described physiological schemes, the most common species identified were streptococcus sanguis sensu stricto (31.9%), s. oralis (29.8%) and s. gordonii (12.7%). other related species including s. mitis  and "s. parasanguis" were less common. this indicates that attention should be focused on s. sanguis sensu stricto and s. oralis when considering possible pathogenic mechanisms involved in viridans streptococcal endocarditis.

TI  == simulated human serum profiles of one daily dose of ceftriaxone plus netilmicin in treatment of experimental streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  == we performed experiments in rats aimed at determining whether a combination of ceftriaxone (cro) and netilmicin (net), by using once-daily administration in rats, which simulated profiles of drug in human serum, was more effective than either agent alone in the treatment of endocarditis caused by viridans group streptococci. a programmable infusion pump system enabled the production of profiles of cro in serum that simulate those found in humans after the intravenous administration of 2 g. the subcutaneous administration of 18 mg of net per kg of body weight produced levels in the sera of rats comparable to those after the intravenous administration of a dose of 5 mg of net per kg in humans. rats with catheter-induced aortic vegetations were infected intravenously with two test strains, a cro-susceptible streptococcus sanguis strain (mics of cro and net, 0.064 and 8 mg/liter, respectively) and a relatively cro-resistant streptococcus mitis strain (mics of cro and net, 2 and 8 mg/liter, respectively). against both strains, the combination of cro and net was synergistic in vitro as  determined by time-kill curves. treatment of rats was started 48 h postinfection  and lasted for 3 days. cro alone was effective against the susceptible strain (p  < 0.001 compared with control animals) but was not effective against the resistant organism. a significantly enhanced antibacterial activity of the cro-net combination in reducing the valvular bacterial counts was observed with both test strains (p < 0.001). the synergistic effect was obtained with a single  daily injection of net which provided detectable levels in serum for only 8 h, suggesting that in vivo synergism in the treatment of infections caused by viridans group streptococci can be obtained without 24 h of aminoglycoside coverage. these experimental data might provide a rationale for clinical trials of a once-a-day dosing regimen in the treatment of streptococcal but nonenterococcal endocarditis.

TI  == species identification of oral viridans streptococci by restriction fragment polymorphism analysis of rrna genes.
AB  == oral streptococci formerly classified as streptococcus sanguis have been divided  into six genetic groups. methods to identify those species by genotype are needed. this study compared restriction fragment polymorphisms of rrna genes (ribotypes) for seven s. gordonii, three s. sanguis, four s. oralis, three s. mitis, one s. crista, and seven s. parasanguis strains classified in previous dna hybridization studies, as well as one clinical isolate. dna was digested with hindiii, pvuii, hindiii and pvuii combined, ecori, bamhi, aatii, alwni, and draii. dna fragments were hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled cdna probe obtained by reverse transcription of escherichia coli 16s and 23s rrna. s. oralis, s. mitis, and s. parasanguis all showed an isolated 2,290-bp band in aatii ribotypes that was absent from s. gordonii, s. sanguis, and s. crista. the  last three groups showed species-specific bands with aatii and also with pvuii. s. oralis could be distinguished from s. mitis and s. parasanguis in alwni and draii ribotypes. s. mitis and s. parasanguis could not be distinguished, since they shared multiple bands in pvuii, alwni, and ecori patterns. the clinical isolate in the panel was very similar to s. sanguis by all enzymes used. our findings suggest that ribotyping may be useful for genotypic identification of oral viridans streptococci. initial digests of clinical isolates might be made with aatii, followed by pvuii or alwni. isolates then could be identified by comparing ribotype patterns with those of reference strains. this approach could  facilitate clinical studies of these newly defined species.

TI  == antibacterial activity of dentinal bonding agents.
AB  == the susceptibility of five bacterial species to seven dentinal bonding agents was examined in vitro. agar diffusion tests using filterpaper disks containing 10 microl each of conditioner, primer, or resin were performed on blood agar and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar. chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. after incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. of  all the compounds tested, gluma cleanser and gluma etchant showed the strongest growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. no antibacterial effect was noted for prisma universal bond 2 and superlux universal bond 2 systems. the primers of gluma, denthesive, and scotchbond 2 displayed antibacterial activity that, in some cases, was comparable to that of 0.2% chlorhexidine. zones of inhibition were seen for the resin materials of scotchbond 2 and tripton with streptococcus  mutans, streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces viscosus. no inhibition was seen after these resins were cured, whereas the antibacterial effect of xr-bond on s sanguis and a viscosus was not affected by light curing.

TI  == longitudinal study of relations between human salivary antimicrobial proteins and measures of dental plaque accumulation and composition.
AB  == many studies have attempted to relate levels of antimicrobial proteins in saliva  to oral health; results have been inconsistent, and one reason might be inconsistency of measures of plaque and saliva within subjects. this study investigated associations between plaque and salivary variables in longitudinal data. whole saliva, and 8-h plaque pooled from buccal first permanent molars, was obtained from 32 dental students on tuesdays from 3:00-6:00 p.m. over 4 weeks. salivary flow rate was determined, and samples were assayed for lysozyme, lactoferrin, total peroxidase, myeloperoxidase, oscn-, siga and total protein. colonies on mitis-salivarius agar were assigned to streptococcus sanguis, strep.  mutans or strep. salivarius on the basis of morphology, supplemented by the api rapid strep identification system. consistency of values within subjects across weeks was evaluated by repeat-measures analysis of variance and intraclass correlation; data were transformed to reduce skewness. pearson's r was used to determine associations between plaque and salivary variables. significant intraclass correlations (alpha = 0.05) were found for all salivary variables except myeloperoxidase, and for total flora, total streptococci, strep. sanguis and strep. sanguis as a proportion of total streptococci. significant pearson correlations with strep. sanguis as a proportion of total streptococci were found for total protein (r = -0.24), siga (r = -0.22), lactoferrin (r = -0.19) and oscn- (r = 0.20) when data from all weeks were pooled (n = 128). strep. sanguis proportions tended to be low in subjects with high values for salivary proteins;  the range of proportions was wider in subjects with low salivary values. these findings suggest some consistency of weekly values for many plaque and salivary variables. they also support previous cross-sectional data which suggested that salivary antimicrobial proteins may have some effect on plaque composition. this  study was made before recent revisions in streptococcal taxonomy, and further research is needed to clarify interactions of salivary proteins with currently defined species.

TI  == an analysis of the subgingival microflora in randomly selected subjects.
AB  == the aim of this study was to describe the presence of some microbial species in the subgingival microflora of a randomly selected subject sample. a further objective was to analyze the association between some microbiological characteristics and the periodontal conditions of the subjects. a total of 171 individuals aged 30-65 years were included. a pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained from the mesial aspect of the 6 ramfjord teeth by the use of the paper-point method. the samples were processed and analyzed according to standardized procedures. the periodontal condition of the subjects was examined clinically and included assessment of plaque, gingivitis, probing pocket depth and probing attachment level. the results showed that 81% of the subjects were positive for campylobacter rectus, 80% for fusobacterium nucleatum, 77% for streptococcus sanguis, 72% for streptococcus mitis, 66% for eikenella corrodens,  58% for prevotella intermedia, 32% for capnocytophaga, 27% for selenomonas, 25% for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 14% for porphyromonas gingivalis and 13% for streptococcus mutans. small differences in the periodontal conditions were observed between subjects harboring p. gingivalis, a. actinomytecomitans or  > 5% p. intermedia and the rest of the sample. similarly small differences in the clinical parameters were revealed when the subjects were grouped according to proportions of disease-associated and health-associated species in their subgingival samples.

TI  == oral streptococcal colonization of infants.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and proportions of different streptococcal species among the streptococcal flora during infancy. a total of 60 oral samples were collected by oral swabbing of the buccal mucosa and alveolar ridges of 18 infants before tooth eruption and from buccal and lingual surfaces of teeth after tooth eruption. a total of 549 isolates on mitis salivarius agar were speciated, principally by recently revised biochemical criteria of kilian et al. streptococcus mitis biovar 1 predominated, both in prevalence (89%) and proportion of oral streptococci recovered in each sample (median = 87% of streptococcal flora). streptococcus salivarius was also prevalent (94%) but generally represented a small percentage of the total streptococcal flora (median = 3%). streptococcus oralis and streptococcus anginosus strains were detected in approximately one third of predentate and dentate infants in the first year of life. streptococcus sanguis strains were not detected before tooth eruption, but could be detected in 7/14 of the infants with teeth. thus, s. mitis constitutes the major component of the initially colonizing streptococcal microbiota of the young infant.

TI  == synergistic activity of ceftriaxone combined with netilmicin administered once daily for treatment of experimental streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  == we have conducted experiments to determine if one daily injection of netilmicin (net) would be synergistic with the broad-spectrum cephalosporin ceftriaxone (cro) in the treatment of experimentally induced endocarditis. rats with catheter-induced aortic vegetations were infected intravenously with 3 x 10(7) cfu of a beta-lactam-sensitive strain of streptococcus sanguis or a beta-lactam-resistant strain of streptococcus mitis. treatment with the antibiotics alone (cro, 10 mg/kg of body weight every 8 h; net, 18 mg/kg every 24 h) or in combinations which had proved synergistic in in vitro time-kill curves was commenced 48 h postinfection and continued for 72 h. the results show that the combination was markedly effective against s. sanguis and moderately effective against s. mitis, while, with the protocol used here, the agents alone  were not. the results suggest that cro-net should be an effective combination for treating streptococcal endocarditis in humans and may permit a shorter duration of treatment and once-a-day dosing to be used.

TI  == distribution and isolation frequency of eight streptococcal species in saliva from predentate and dentate children and adults.
AB  == the isolation frequency and distribution of eight recently defined streptococcal  species have been investigated in the saliva of adults and that of both predentate and dentate children. the effects of frequency of sugar intake and tooth presence on the distribution of streptococcal species were also analyzed. saliva samples were collected from 121 subjects divided into three study groups:  (a) 56 predentate children (predentate group), (b) 37 dentate children (dentate group), and (c) 28 adults (adult group). up to 17 biochemical and enzymatic tests were used to categorize streptococcal isolates into s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. mutans, and s. gordonii. the mean total and streptococcal salivary colony-forming units (cfu) were lowest in the predentate group and highest in the adult group. streptococci  were found in all the study subjects, and there was no obvious relationship between the total or streptococcal cfu and the number of teeth or the frequency of sugar intake. there was a wide variation in the isolation frequency of streptococcal species in the three study groups. s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. salivarius were the most frequent species isolated, and together they comprised 83% of the total streptococcal isolates. in contrast to studies using older classifications, s. sanguis was a minor species in the saliva though found more often in adults than in children (p < 0.04). s. anginosus was a minor species found in about 10% of adults and children. s. gordonii was detected rarely and only in dentate subjects. s. mutans was detected only in dentate subjects, significantly greater in adults (57.1%) than in children (5.4%, p < 0.001).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == emergence of immune competence in saliva.
AB  == saliva contains essentially no iga at birth. however, secretory immune responses  to oral and non-oral microbial antigens emerge early in life. we have investigated the characteristics of these responses in salivas of infants less than 1 month through 4 years of age, using cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches. antibody specificities (iga, iga1, and iga2) were measured in elisa and western blot analysis to antigens of streptococcus mitis and s. salivarius that colonize during the neonatal period. antibodies reactive with s. sanguis and mutans streptococci, which colonize later in the infant's life, were also determined. concurrent investigation of the oral flora of each infant was performed and related to the observed antibody specificities. the secretory nature of the immunoglobulins in these salivas was analyzed immunologically and chromatographically. the primary molecular form of salivary iga was dimeric in all salivas tested. both iga subclasses were found, although a subset of infant salivas initially contained > 90% iga1. igm (> 1 microgram/ml) was detected in 58% of 3- to 17-week-old infants. by 2 months of age, salivas from most infants contained iga antibody reactive with at least two s. mitis components. many salivas also contained antibody reactive with s. salivarius components. by the end of the first year, most salivas contained iga1 and iga2 antibody to s. mitis  antigens. maturation of secretory responses in the second and third year was evidenced by the appearance of increased concentrations and additional specificities of salivary iga antibodies to s. mitis antigens. antibody to s. mitis, s. salivarius, and s. sanguis extracellular components was detected only after infection with the respective species.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [morphologic and biochemical characteristics of viridans streptococci isolated from dental plaque].
AB  == the purposes of this study were to give the characteristics of viridans streptococci isolated from dental plaque, and the relationships with dental caries. we stained 69 patients' teeth on supragingival plaques (plaque index = 1) with the pfiffer's reagent or fd&c red#28 dye, then isolated 80 strains of oral streptococci from 69 patients. cultures were grown in tsb, ms, and msb media. a total of 80 fresh-isolated plaque streptococci, including strains of s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. mitis, and s. mutans were identified on the basis of morphologic, dark field, sem, and biochemical characteristics. all of the oral plaque streptococci were to be found in significant percentages in dental plaque. patients who had caries harboured s. mutans more often (37/40) than patients without caries (7/29). s. mutans comprised the greatest percentage (37/69) of microorganisms encountered in caries' plaque, and there was an association between high counts of s. mutans and the presence of dental caries. cultural and  biochemical methods were used for the isolation and identification of the different species of s. mutans. the result indicated that biotype i were the most predominant species (50%) in dental plaque. thus, it is possible to isolate, screen and identify unknown strains through the morphologic, darkfield, sem, and  biochemical characteristics of viridans streptococci isolated from human dental plaque. by means of the present methods for identification, we hold considerable  promises for contributing to the prevention and diagnosis of dental diseases.

TI  == restriction endonuclease-fragment polymorphisms of oral viridans streptococci, compared by conventional and field-inversion gel electrophoresis.
AB  == oral streptococci formerly classified as streptococcus sanguis or streptococcus mitis have recently been divided into four species. two additional species have also been proposed for this group. each species is genetically distinct, but they have many traits in common, which makes it difficult for clinical isolates to be  identified by phenotypic tests. genotypic comparison may provide an alternative approach. this study used dna fingerprint analysis for comparison of genotypes of 21 reference strains--classified as streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis, "streptococcus parasanguis", or "streptococcus crista" in previous dna hybridization studies--and 17 clinical and laboratory strains placed in those groups on the basis of phenotypic tests. hindiii and pvuii digests were run in conventional horizontal agarose gels. sfii digests of reference strains and two laboratory strains were run in field-inversion gels. fingerprint patterns were compared by visual examination, cluster analysis of densitometric traces, and lane-matching software. only two "s. crista" strains and two parent mutant lineages showed fingerprint patterns that were identical by visual examination. fingerprint patterns of all other strains were unique. cluster analysis results could not be considered valid, since replicate lanes in  different gels were not grouped together. hindiii and pvuii digests contained too many bands for correct matching by lane-matching software. sfii digests were correctly matched by computer, with the same results as visual examination. results indicate that the diversity of strains within these streptococcal species was too great to permit species identification by dna fingerprint patterns. this  genotypic diversity suggests that isolates from unrelated hosts may have been separate for long periods of time.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == enumeration of subgingival species on primary isolation plates using colony lifts.
AB  == this study evaluated the feasibility of using a colony lift method and dna probes to enumerate bacterial species cultured on primary isolation plates. fourteen digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes representing 12 subgingival species were validated by hybridization with colony lifts prepared from 249 reference strains of 51 species grown on trypticase soy agar plates supplemented  with 5% sheep blood. colonies of reference strains were lifted onto nytran filters from plates and treated to lyse cells, remove cellular proteins, denature and fix microbial dna to the filters. positive reactions were detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and revealed by bromo-chloro-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. cross-reactions were not observed for 13/14 probes, but 2 strains of streptococcus mitis reacted with  the probe to streptococcus sanguis ii. subgingival plaque samples were taken by means of a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of teeth present in each of  26 subjects with differing periodontal disease states. samples were dispersed, diluted, plated and incubated anaerobically for 7 d at 35 degrees c. colonies were lifted as described above. filters were cut into sections and hybridized with the 14 digoxigenin-labeled dna probes. the probes were used to enumerate the test species and the total number of isolates was determined in 711 plaque samples. the colony lift method and dna probes provided a sensitive, economical and quantitative method for enumerating cultivable microbial species in subgingival plaque samples. in addition, the amplification provided by growing the organisms on agar plates facilitated determination of numbers of organisms in small plaque samples, such as those from healthy sites.

TI  == inhibition of microbial adherence and growth by various glass ionomers in vitro.
AB  == this study measured the in vitro inhibition of growth and adherence of five oral  bacteria by glass-ionomer materials. disks were prepared from two cavity liners and four restorative class materials, by use of teflon plates with circular wells, five mm wide and two mm deep. the bacterial species tested included: a. viscosus, s. mitis, s. mutans, l. casei, and s. sanguis. growth inhibition studies were performed by the spreading of 0.1 ml of standardized inocula over agar plates produced with selective media, followed by the direct application of  glass-ionomer disks onto the agar. on other plates, disks were placed onto uninoculated agars for 48 h, followed by bacterial inoculation. all agar plates were incubated under optimal growth conditions for each bacterial species. the four restorative materials were also placed aseptically into sterilized bovine incisors and placed into sucrose containing broth media, inoculated with s. mutans for three days. adhering materials were disclosed and scored. an ion-exchange electrode was used to measure fluoride release over a seven-day period for all six glass ionomers. the two cavity liners and two of the restorative materials produced the largest growth inhibition zones by direct contact. no growth inhibition occurred when the specimens were allowed to come into contact with the agars prior to inoculation. all four restorative materials  reduced bacterial accumulations on enamel surfaces by over 80%. elevations in short-term fluoride release levels were positively correlated with growth inhibition.

TI  == relatedness between streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans streptococci: transfer  of penicillin resistance determinants and immunological similarities of penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  == the occurrence of highly variable penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) in penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae suggested that transfer of homologous genes from related species may be involved in resistance development.  antiserum and monoclonal antibodies raised against pbps 1a and 2b from the susceptible s. pneumoniae r6 strain were used to identify related pbps in 41 s. mitis, s. sanguis i and s. sanguis ii strains mostly isolated in south africa with mic values ranging from less than 0.15 to 16 mg/ml. furthermore, the possibility of genetic exchange was examined with 30 penicillin-resistant strains of this collection (mic greater than 0.06 mg/ml) as donors using s. pneumoniae r6 as recipient in transformation experiments. the majority of s. mitis and s. sanguis ii strains but none of the s. sanguis i strains could transform penicillin resistance genes into s. pneumoniae r6. all positive donor strains and all susceptible isolates of s. mitis and s. sanguis ii strains contained pbps which cross-reacted with the anti-pbp 1a and/or anti-pbp 2b antibodies. on the other hand, only five of the 14 s. sanguis i strains contained a pbp that reacted with one of the antibodies. this strongly suggested the presence of genes homologous to the pneumococcal pbp 1a and 2b genes in viridans streptococci, and  documents that penicillin resistance determinants can be transformed from viridans streptococci into the pneumococcus.

TI  == a scheme for the identification of viridans streptococci.
AB  == a collection of strains representing all the currently recognised species of oral or viridans streptococci (streptococcus sanguis, s. parasanguis, s. gordonii, s.  oralis, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. vestibularis, s. anginosus, s. constellatus,  s. intermedius, s. mutans and s. sobrinus) were tested for the production of a range of glycosidase activities with 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked fluorogenic substrates, and for reactions in a range of conventional fermentation and hydrolytic tests. the resulting biochemical scheme, consisting of 14 tests, enabled the differentiation of all these species and distinguished three biotypes within s. sanguis. the scheme reported here represents an improvement over currently available schemes for the identification of viridans streptococci.

AB  == tosufloxacin tosylate (tosu) and temafloxacin hydrochloride (tema) were tested in vitro against 248 clinical isolates of various species of streptococci recovered  in a hospital microbiology laboratory (bellevue regional teaching hospital). species included s. pneumoniae (n = 20), group a streptococci (n = 22), group b streptococci (n = 30), group g streptococci (n = 17), group d s. bovis (n = 19),  enterococcus faecium (n = 45), enterococcus faecalis (n = 28), s. sanguis (n = 21), s. milleri (n = 29) and s. mitis (n = 17). activities of each of the two study drugs were evaluated comparatively with two other fluoroquinolones, i.e., ciprofloxacin (cip) and pefloxacin (pef). activities of each of these four antibiotics, expressed as the mic 90%, varied as follows according to the species of streptococci: tosu, 0.25 to 1 mg/l, tema 0.5 to 2 mg/l, cip, 1 to 4 mg/l and pef 8 to 32 mgl. overall, tosu and tema exhibited the greatest activity of the various species. the size of the inoculum had no significant effect on mic values.

TI  == enumeration of oral streptococci on media containing different concentrations of  sodium and potassium ions.
AB  == laboratory "type" strains of oral streptococci were screened for their ability to grow on mitis-salivarius agar (msa) in the presence of increasing concentrations  of either na+ or k+ up to 500 mmol/l. strains were generally better able to withstand increasing concentrations of na+ than k+, although low numbers of colony-forming units (cfus) were seen with the highest concentration of either cation. two strains of streptococcus mutans, ingbritt 162 and ingbritt 175, behaved differently when the concentration of cation was increased from 50 to 200 mmol/l; the latter showed a marked increase in the number of cfus when the na+ concentration was increased from 50 to 200 mmol/l, whereas there was a decrease with strain ingbritt 162. strains of oral streptococci from the saliva of adults  and children were isolated on modified msa containing known concentrations of na+ and k+ and further examined if they showed "mutans-like" colony morphology. the number of cfus generally dropped as the concentration of na+ or k+ was increased  from 200 to 350 or 500 mmol/l. greater numbers of streptococci were tolerant to na+ than to k+. half of the isolates were members of the streptococcus sanguis group (ssg), either streptococcus mitis or s. sanguis ii, and these were more tolerant to high concentrations of na+ or k+ than other isolates that were identified as streptococcus morbillorum, streptococcus acidominimus, and streptococcus milleri.

TI  == subclass distribution of salivary secretory immunoglobulin a antibodies to oral streptococci.
AB  == the ability of specific secretory immunoglobulin a (s-iga) antibodies to inhibit  bacterial colonization of mucosal surfaces may be neutralized by the activity of  bacterial iga1 proteases. because of the resistance of the iga2 subclass to these enzymes, the biological effect of iga1 proteases in vivo may depend on the subclass distribution of the bacterium-specific antibodies. we have estimated the subclass distribution of s-iga antibodies in saliva samples from 13 individuals against iga1 protease-producing (streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis)  and nonproducing (streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mitis bv. 2) oral streptococci. iga1 was found to be the predominant subclass of antibodies against these four bacteria in most of the saliva samples, corroborating previous data suggesting a role of iga1 proteases in plaque formation. however, variation in the subclass distribution of s-iga antibodies against the same strain was observed. in one individual, iga2 was the predominant subclass of antibodies against all four streptococci and of total salivary s-iga, pointing to the possible significance of genetic variations. the study also addresses methodological problems related to the quantitation of salivary antibodies by solid-phase immunoassays.

[case 1] 6 year old girl who had been suffering from acute lymphocytic leukemia. she had sepsis and bacterial meningitis in maintenance-therapy for leukemia. streptococcus sanguis was isolated from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (csf). [case 2] 11 year old girl  who had had malignant lymphoma (non-hodgkin type). she also had sepsis and bacterial meningitis due to streptococcus mitis which was isolated from blood and csf in maintenance-therapy. both cases had been treated with anti-cancer drugs and had severe granulocytopenia. positive rate of blood cultures during the recent 6 years (1984.1-1989.12) at our department was 6.0% (total number of cultures were 2,019, positive cultures were 121). strains of 131 bacteria were determined; gram-positive cocci were 70 strains (53.4%) and gram-negative rods were 52 strains (39.7%). fifteen strains (11.5%) of alpha-hemolytic streptococci  were isolated during 6 years. one hundred thirteen cases of septicemia were analysed in medical charts and 12 cases of alpha-hemolytic streptococcal septicemia were observed (5 cases with infective endocarditis and 7 cases in immunocompromised states).

TI  == clinical and microbiological findings on newly inserted hydroxyapatite-coated and pure titanium human dental implants.
AB  == the clinical and microbiologic features of 30 hydroxyapatite-coated root-form endosseous dental implants (tri-stage) were compared to 10 similar pure titanium  implants without hydroxyapatite coatings. in 7 of 9 partially edentulous patients studied, pure titanium fixtures were placed adjacent to hydroxyapatite-coated implants. implants in the maxilla were submerged beneath mucosal tissues after implant placement for a minimum of 6 months, and in the mandible for at least 4 months. all patients were prescribed short-term beta-lactam antibiotic therapy after fixture placement, and 8 of 9 used chlorhexidine mouthrinses after fixture  exposure. clinical and microbiological examination was carried out 7-10 months after fixed prosthetic loading of the implants. clinical measurements included the gingival index, plaque index, bleeding on probing and peri-implant probing depths determined with the florida probe system. subgingival microbial samples were collected with paper points and transported in vmga iii. specimens were examined by direct phase-contrast microscopy and were plated onto nonselective and selective culture media for anaerobic and aerobic incubation. no significant  mean clinical or microbiological differences were found between the implant types, although one hydroxyapatite-coated implant exhibited deep probing depths,  bleeding on probing and marked radiographic crestal bone loss. streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis were the most predominant organisms recovered from clinically stable implants, whereas high proportions of fusobacterium species and peptostreptococcus prevotii were isolated from the ailing hydroxyapatite-coated implant. one or more implants in 8 of the study subjects yielded enteric rods, pseudomonads, enterococci or staphylococci. the prognosis of implants with varying early microbiotas needs to be established in longitudinal studies.

TI  == ecology of viridans streptococci in the oral cavity and pharynx.
AB  == recently published taxonomic studies of viridans streptococci have resulted in several changes in the nomenclature and definition of oral streptococcal species. with this background, the ecology of streptococci in the oropharyngeal cavities was reinvestigated. the results based on the examination of 1426 streptococcal isolates confirmed and extended earlier findings. apart from mature supragingival plaque, which contained a mixture of all orally encountered streptococci, each site showed a characteristic streptococcal flora. initial dental plaque formation is primarily associated with streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis biovar 1  and streptococcus oralis. our investigation showed that s. sanguis and s. mitis biovar 1 were the most prominent streptococci, also on buccal mucosa. in contrast, s. oralis was almost exclusively found in initial dental plaque. streptococcus gordonii, formerly part of s. sanguis, was found in small numbers on the oropharyngeal mucosa and in mature supragingival plaque. the dorsum of the tongue was dominated by s. mitis biovar 2 and streptococcus salivarius, the latter of which was predominant also on the pharyngeal mucosa. streptococcus anginosus was by far the most predominant streptococcus in subgingival plaque. immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease-producing streptococci were primarily isolated  from initial dental plaque and from the buccal mucosa. this lends further support to the concept of iga1 proteases being important for the ability of streptococci  to evade the local immune defence during their initial colonization of certain oral surfaces.

TI  == analysis of adherence of streptococcus defectivus and endocarditis-associated streptococci to extracellular matrix.
AB  == pathogenesis of nutritionally variant streptococcal (nvs) endocarditis initiates  with bacterial attachment to and colonization of the damaged heart valve surface. underlying extracellular matrix (ecm) exposed to the environment during damage to cardiac endothelium provides additional receptors that could be involved in bacterial adherence. the ability of nvs and endocarditis-associated streptococci  to bind ecm was investigated by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system that incorporated ecm secreted by baby hamster kidney and human umbilical vein endothelial cells in culture. streptococcus defectivus, the major species isolated from nvs endocarditis cases, bound ecm of fibroblasts and endothelial cells, indicating that the ecm molecule involved in the binding was a common constituent of diverse matrices. the specific binding of s. defectivus to ecm was demonstrated by saturation binding and specific antibody inhibition studies. of the 15 s. defectivus strains analyzed, 13 bound ecm, whereas streptococcus adjacens and nvs serotype iii strains were unable to bind the matrix. this selective binding suggested that s. defectivus binds to heart valves through a mechanism different from those of other nvs in subacute bacterial endocarditis. a survey of non-nvs streptococcal endocarditis isolates demonstrated that s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguis, and s. faecalis also bound ecm, whereas other viridans species were unable to bind the matrix.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by treponema denticola, porphyromonas  gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga orchracea, capnocytophaga sp., actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis. the enzymes produced by capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while  the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mm chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mm inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. these observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.

TI  == inhibition of adsorption of oral streptococci to saliva treated hydroxyapatite by chitin derivatives.
AB  == this study estimated the effects of five chitin derivatives low molecular chitosan (lmcs), ethyleneglycol chitin (pegt), carboxymethyl chitin (pcmt), sulphated chitosan (psss), and phosphorylated chitin (pppt) on the adsorption of  three oral streptococci to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite (s-ha). the adsorption was evaluated by measuring the optical density of the bacterial cell suspensions  released from saliva-treated hydroxyapatite by 0.5 n hcl. the adsorption of test  strains to s-ha progressively decreased in proportion to each additional volume of pegt, pppt, or psss. pppt and psss quite effectively inhibited the adsorption  of s. mutans onto s-ha, but were less effective against s. sanguis and s. mitis.  pppt, psss, and pcmt all markedly promoted the desorption of s. mutans cells pre-adsorbed onto s-ha. pretreatment of s-ha with pppt, psss, or pcmt significantly decreased the subsequent adsorption of s. mutans and s. mitis. pretreatment of these cells with pegt also decreased their adsorption to s-ha. these findings suggest that these chitin derivatives may change the ionic natures of the s-ha and the bacterial cell surface, resulting in a less favorable interaction.

TI  == antibiotic-resistant oral streptococci in dental patients susceptible to infective endocarditis.

TI  == sorbitol transport and metabolism by oral streptococci.
AB  == sorbitol transport by oral streptococci was mediated by a phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (pts). the transition of s. sanguis 160 from continuous growth on limiting glucose to limiting sorbitol resulted in induction of eiisor of the sorbitol-pts, as well as sorbitol-6-p dehydrogenase which converts sorbitol-6-p to fructose-6-p. sorbitol transport activity required the presence of a soluble sorbitol-specific component of the pts, tentatively identified as an enzyme iii for sorbitol (iiisor). in addition, the results indicated that sorbitol transport can be mediated by the ellglc, particularly in the presence of the sorbitol-specific component. s. sanguis 160 utilized sorbitol in a manner different from that reported for s mutans. growth on glucose by s. sanguis 160 was inhibited by the presence of sorbitol in the growth medium and sorbitol was utilized in the presence of glucose. in addition, pulses of glucose added to cultures growing on sorbitol resulted in expulsion of sorbitol from the cell. sorbitol was shown to interfere with glucose metabolism by s. sanguis 160 by inhibiting glucose transport by sorbitol-limited cells, but not by glucose-limited cells, and by inhibiting glycolytic activity with glucose as the  substrate. furthermore, sorbitol was an effective repressor of the glucose-pts, exhibiting negative regulation over synthesis of both eiiglc and a soluble component of the glucose-pts, presumably iiiglc. oral streptococci metabolize sorbitol to large amounts of formate and ethanol in addition to smaller amounts of lactate and acetate. the metabolism of sorbitol by s. sanguis and s. gordonii  was less sensitive to oxygen than that by s. mutans and s. mitis.

TI  == oxygen and the sugar metabolism in oral streptococci.
AB  == streptococci have several ways of adapting themselves to the constantly changing  environment of the human oral cavity. this paper discusses the adaptation of sugar metabolism to variations in oxygen levels. in all streptococci the embden-meyerhof pathway of glycolysis works under aerobic as well as anaerobic conditions, but pyruvate is converted into different metabolic end products depending on the oxygen levels. under anaerobic conditions all streptococci form  formate, acetate, and ethanol by a pyruvate formate-lyase pathway. if sugar is in excess, they also form lactate using a lactate dehydrogenase. under aerobic conditions pyruvate formate-lyase is inactivated. this enzyme is then replaced by a pyruvate oxidase in some streptococci and by a pyruvate dehydrogenase in others. the characteristics of these enzymes help streptococci like s. sanguis, s. oralis, s. gordonii, and s. mitis to compete successfully with other bacteria  in those sites of the oral cavity that are freely exposed to saliva, while mutans streptococci have to colonize anaerobic sites such as those in-between the teeth  and in the occlusal fissures of the teeth.

TI  == secretory iga adsorption and oral streptococcal adhesion to human enamel and artificial solid substrata with various surface free energies.
AB  == in this paper, secretory iga adsorption from a single component siga solution and from human whole saliva onto human enamel and artificial solid substrata with various surface free energies was studied as a function of time. elisa indicated  that screening or displacement of adsorbed siga by other salivary proteins occurred only on low surface free energy substrata, not on high surface free energy substrata such as enamel. in addition, the adhesion of three oral streptococcal strains (streptococcus mitis bms, s. sanguis 12, and s. mutans ns), also having widely different surface free energies, to siga-coated surfaces was studied. the adhesion of all three streptococcal strains was significantly reduced in the presence of a siga coating. however, ranking the adhesion data with respect to the various substrata revealed a similar order to that in the case of uncoated substrata, indicating that substratum properties were at least partly transferred by the adsorbed protein film to the interface with adhering micro-organisms. for s. sanguis 12 and s. mitis bms, adhesion decreased proportionally with the amounts of siga detected by elisa, but for s. mutans ns such relations with the amounts of siga detected on the protein-coated substrata  were not found. thus, for s. mutans ns a specific antibody effect seems to exist  in addition to a non-specific protein effect like that observed for s. sanguis 12 and s. mitis bms.

TI  == prevention of gram-positive and candida albicans infections using teicoplanin and fluconazole: a randomized study in neutropenic children.
AB  == we have shown that the combination of teicoplanin (t) and ceftriaxone (c) given once daily as first-line empirical antimicrobial therapy is very effective (85%)  and safe in febrile neutropenic children (icaac, 1988). like others (icaac, 1989) we have stressed the new life-threatening problems with streptococcus mitis and strep. sanguis. considering the regular sensitivity of gram-positive organisms to t, it is possible that the introduction of the glycopeptide at the onset of aplasia may be helpful. the high incidence of fungal infection or superinfection  supports the routine use of an effective antifungal agent when fever is still present or relapse occurs. our study was designed to assess the prevention of (1) staphylococcal and streptococcal infections using t when the central catheter is  being placed, and (2) candida infection by the simultaneous use of a new anti-mycotic agent fluconazole (f) administered once-daily. patients were randomized into two arms of the study. arm a received t 6 mg/kg/d and f 3 mg/kg/d starting when the catheter was put in place. if fever occurred, c 50 mg/kg/d and  amikacin (a) 15 mg/kg/d were added and t increased to 10 mg/kg/d. if a febrile relapse occurred, amphotericin b was added. in arm b the combination of the three agents t 10 mg/kg/d, c 50 mg/kg/d and a 15 mg/kg/d was started only if there was  fever. amphotericin b was used in febrile relapses. forty-six patients were eligible (23 in each arm; no statistically significant differences between the two groups). the mean age of the patients was 8 years and mean duration of aplasia 23 and 24 d. results were as follows: arm a the duration of t + f alone was 10 d, 22 patients had a febrile episode with 1 gram-positive, 11 gram-negative and one candida strain isolated in eight patients. c + a were effective in 72% of these patients. there were no deaths. in arm b, fever occurred in all patients during the first 6 d, with eight gram-positive and six gram-negative organisms isolated in nine patients. c + t + a were successful in 83% of patients. a bacterial superinfection was documented in four patients, candida superinfection in seven patients and one patient died from candida parakrusei septicaemia. when the total amount of c and a used in both arms was compared, there was a reduction in 20% of the two agents in arm a, but t was equivalent in both arms. treatment was well tolerated in both arms.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == plaque from the root surfaces of 165 subjects (mean age 65.5 years, 22-26 teeth/subject) was analysed for specific bacteria. five subject groups were defined: a (dmfs 16.4), b (dmfs 55.9), c1 (dmfs 55.6), c2 (dmfs 57.0) and c3 (dmfs 48.1). groups c1 and c2 had unrestored root surface lesions; group a, b and c3 were free of unrestored root caries and differed in their coronal caries experience. streptococcus mutans was isolated more frequently from the root lesions in groups c1 and c2 than from intact root surfaces in group a. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis 1 and streptococcus sanguis were isolated more frequently from group a. the percentage contribution that s. mutans made to plaque from lesions in groups c1 and c2 was higher than that from plaque  in group a and actinomyces viscosus serovar 2 contributed more to plaque in group c1 than in samples from group a. the percentage counts of lactobacillus in plaque from lesions in groups c1 and c2 were higher than those from intact roots in groups a, b, and c3. subjects were also grouped on the presence of lactobacillus  and s. mutans in plaque samples. samples with both organisms (n = 17) showed significantly higher isolation frequencies of specific strains of s. mitis 1 and  also a. viscosus serovar 2 compared with samples of plaque containing s. mutans or lactobacillus. actinomyces naeslundii serovar 1 was not isolated from samples  containing both s. mutans and lactobacillus. the results confirm an association of s. mutans and lactobacillus with root surface lesions and suggest a relationship between lesions and a. viscosus serovar 2.

TI  == ability to bind salivary alpha-amylase discriminates certain viridans group streptococcal species.
AB  == a collection of 144 viridans group streptococcal strains recently characterized as part of a taxonomic study was examined for the ability to bind salivary alpha-amylase. this property was found in most strains of streptococcus gordonii  and streptococcus mitis and in occasional strains of streptococcus anginosus and  streptococcus salivarius. in contrast, all strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus vestibularis, and streptococcus mutans lacked alpha-amylase-binding capacity. a rapid and easy assay described in this paper may be an important supplementary test for identification of oral streptococci.

TI  == platelet aggregation by oral streptococci.
AB  == one proposed mechanism in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis is the direct aggregation of platelets by the bacteria causing the disease. some, but not all, strains of streptococcus sanguis have been reported to aggregate platelets but the taxonomy of this and related taxa has changed recently. the ability to aggregate platelets by 24 genetically grouped laboratory stock strains was studied along with 8 recent isolates from cases of endocarditis. strains belonging to s. sanguis could aggregate platelets, but not s. gordonii, "s. parasanguis", s. mitis, s. oralis or related taxa. also, preliminary data indicate that certain biotypes of s. sanguis lack the ability to aggregate platelets. of the recent clinical isolates, only 4 aggregated platelets and each  of these showed phenotypes typical of s. sanguis. these data suggest that the ability to aggregate platelets is not essential for an organism to be able to cause endocarditis, although it may be a significant virulence factor.

TI  == predominance of resistant oral streptococci in saliva and the effect of a single  course of josamycin or erythromycin.
AB  == we have investigated the influence of the macrolides erythromycin and josamycin on the selection of resistant oral streptococci by sampling saliva of volunteers  before and after oral administration of 1.5 g of either agent followed by a further 0.5 g of the same drug after 6 h, as in routine prophylaxis for oral or dental procedures. the small proportion of resistant organisms present before antibiotic administration increased substantially 48 h after the macrolides were  given. after antibiotic administration mean counts of oral streptococci resistant to 1, 4 and 64 mg/l erythromycin were 23%, 17% and 6%, respectively, of the total numbers of streptococci isolated; after josamycin, the values were 13%, 6% and 4% respectively. the proportion of resistant streptococci then declined gradually but remained above pre-antibiotic levels three months later. streptococci isolated on media containing 64 mg/l of macrolides were mainly streptococcus sanguis and s. mitis with one isolate of s. salivarius; the majority were resistant to 256 mg/l erythromycin, josamycin, all other macrolides tested and clindamycin. amoxycillin and pristinamycin were the only compounds tested that were inhibitory to these organisms at therapeutically attainable concentrations.

TI  == adherence of mutans streptococci to other oral bacteria.
AB  == adherence of mutans streptococci to strains of actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane was measured. strains of streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, and s. rattus bound in a lactose-independent manner to a variety of the actinomyces and  streptococci. most of these reactions could proceed in the presence of whole saliva although adherence of s. rattus bht to the streptococci was inhibited by salivary molecules. in contrast, adherence of s. mutans 10449 and kpsk2 to a. viscosus, s. sanguis, and s. mitis was enhanced by salivary molecules. s. mutans  kpsk2, s. sobrinus omz 176, and s. rattus fa-1 binding to a. viscosus nc3 and s.  sanguis g9b exhibited saturation kinetics. adherence to a. viscosus nc3 was of a  higher avidity than adherence to s. sanguis g9b. attachment of s. mutans kpsk2 to s. sanguis g9b and of s. mutans omz 176 to a. viscosus nc3 and s. sanguis g9b was inhibited by heat treatment of the mutans streptococci. attachment of s. mutans kpsk2 to a. viscosus nc3 and of s. rattus fa-1 to a. viscosus nc3 and s. sanguis  g9b was unaffected by heat. these observations suggest that the mutans streptococci can adhere to a variety of early plaque bacteria by several distinct mechanisms. such interactions may be important in the colonization of tooth surfaces by the mutans streptococci.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to clarify the etiological role of immune responses in tonsillar lymphocytes of the patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp). in order to determine their immune response to s. pyogenes t4, s. pyogenes t12, s mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii and s. pneumoniae, tonsillar lymphocytes from patients with ppp, ct, and sleep apnea syndrome (control) were cultured with formalinized streptococcal cellular antigens. blastoid transformation was investigated by [3h] -thymidine uptake, while antistreptococcal antibody production were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the results were as follows. 1. tonsillar lymphocytes from ppp patients underwent blastoid transformation and accelerated the production of immunoglobulin g following the addition of s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii s. mitis, s. pyogenes t4, and s. pyogenes t12, while those form ct patients and controls did so only with s. pyogenes t4 and s. pyogenes t12. 2. the spontaneous production of specific igg against various streptococci, including s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii and s. mitis by tonsillar lymphocytes from patients with ppp was already higher than that from ct patients and controls. the specific igm  production was also increased above that in ppp patients without any antigens. 3. s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii and s. salivarius antigens stimulated antigen-specific igm production in tonsillar lymphocytes from ppp patients. 4. the levels of specific igg production against s. sanguis i and s. sanguis ii by tonsillar lymphocytes from ppp patients showed a relationship with the serum levels of the ppp patients. these results suggested that the sensitization of alpha-streptococci, especially s. sanguis, in the tonsillar lacunae may lead to the specific production of anti-s. sanguis antibodies in patients with ppp, and these may be involved in the pathogenesis of ppp.

AB  == viridans group streptococci were examined for the production of sialidase (neuraminidase) activity, using the fluorescent substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-d-n-acetylneuraminic acid in a simple and rapid (15-min) assay. sialidase was produced by all strains of streptococcus oralis and s. intermedius and by a majority of s. mitis strains. s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s.  gordonii, s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus, "s. parasanguis," and the "tufted fibril group" were uniformly negative. sialidase production may be a useful characteristic to assist in the identification of viridans group streptococci.

TI  == [investigation of the bacterial flora in the tonsillar lacunae and serum levels of streptococcal antigen-specific antibodies in patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris].
AB  == the purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between bacterial flora in tonsillar lacunae and antistreptococcal antibody in sera of the patients with  pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp). since the pustules develops or worsens after tonsillitis in many patients with ppp, a pathogenic role of tonsillar bacteria is suggested, but no significant association has been proven so far. in  this study, the aerobes in the tonsillar lacunae were identified and quantitated  in 15 adult patients with ppp and 9 adult patients with chronic tonsillitis (ct). in addition, serum streptococcal antigen-specific antibody levels in 40 adult patients with ppp, 18 adult patients with chronic tonsillitis, and 11 healthy volunteers (controls) were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the results were as follows. 1. a total of 53 strains (17 species) of aerobes were isolated and identified from the tonsillar lacunae in patients with ppp, while 35 strains (12 species) of aerobes were found in the patients with ct. 2. s. salivarius and s. pneumoniae were the dominant aerobes isolated from patients  with ppp or ct. 3. although the rates of isolation for staphylococcus and s. pneumoniae were lower in ppp patients than in ct patients, the rate for s. sanguis i was higher in ppp patients than in ct patients. 4. the percentage of alpha, gamma-streptococci to total aerobes in ppp patients was higher than in ct  patients. 5. the igg antibody titers against s. sanguis and s. mitis, and the igm antibody titers against all streptococci investigated in ppp patients were higher than those in both ct patients and controls. 6. moreover, both the igg antibody titers against s. pyogenes t4 and s. sanguis i and the igm antibody titers against s. sanguis i and s. sanguis ii of the patients in which ppp markedly improved after tonsillectomy were higher than those in which ppp showed less improvement postoperatively.

TI  == microbiology of root surface caries in humans.
AB  == studies on the microbiology of root surface caries between 1970 and 1975 placed emphasis on gram-positive pleomorphic filamentous rods, particularly actinomyces  viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii. both of these species had been shown to produce root surface caries in experimental animals. since this time, studies have placed more emphasis on streptococcus mutans, and s. mutans and lactobacillus are significant in prediction of root surface caries risk in patients. subsequent studies confirmed an association between s. mutans and 'soft' or 'initial' root lesions. thus, it is important when determining the microflora of root surface lesions to make careful characterization of the state  of the lesion. a second important aspect of the analysis of bacterial communities associated with root surface caries is better definition of the organisms. most studies have concentrated on 'target organisms' s. mutans, s. sanguis, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, lactobacillus, and veillonella. however, it has been known for 17 years that the actinomyces associated with the lesions may be variants of a. viscosus and a. naeslundii. such strains (intermediate strains) have been described in taxonomic studies of actinomyces, yet little is known of the differences in physiology of these strains or their relationship to root surface caries. a similar situation exists with oral streptococcus where new taxonomic divisions are being proposed. recognition of the potential diversity within the 'target' genera of root surface caries could yield valuable data. recent studies suggest that this is so, since samples from root surface lesions which contain s. mutans and lactobacillus show a high isolation of s. mitis 1 and no isolations of a. naeslundii. careful definition of the lesions of root surface caries and the flora will allow analysis to relate a specific bacterial community to the state fo the lesion and assist in monitoring the control of the lesion through fluoride and antibacterials.

TI  == molecular aspects of immunoglobulin a1 degradation by oral streptococci.
AB  == using a panel of 143 strains classified according to a novel taxonomic system for oral viridans-type streptococci, we reexamined the ability of oral streptococci to attack human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) molecules with iga1 protease or glycosidases. iga1 protease production was an exclusive property of all strains belonging to streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis (previously s. mitior) and of some strains of streptococcus mitis biovar 1. these are all dominant initiators of dental plaque formation. degradation of the carbohydrate moiety of iga1 molecules accompanied iga1 protease activity in s. oralis and protease-producing strains of s. mitis biovar 1. neuraminidase and beta-galactosidase were identified as extracellular enzymes in organisms of these taxa. by examination with enzyme-neutralizing antisera, four distinct iga1 proteases were detected in s. sanguis biovars 1 to 3, s. sanguis biovar 4, s. oralis, and strains of s. mitis, respectively. the cleavage of iga1 molecules by  streptococcal iga proteases was found to be influenced by their state of glycosylation. treatment of iga1 with bacterial (including streptococcal) neuraminidase increased susceptibility to protease, suggesting a cooperative activity of streptococcal iga1 protease and neuraminidase. in contrast, a decrease in susceptibility was observed after extensive deglycosylation of the hinge region with endo-alpha-n acetylgalactosaminidase. the effector functions of iga antibodies depend on the carbohydrate-containing fc portion. hence, the observation that oral streptococci may cleave not only the alpha 1 chains but also the carbohydrate moiety of iga1 molecules suggests that the ability to evade secretory immune mechanisms may contribute to the successful establishment of these bacteria in the oral cavity.

TI  == selective modulation of bacterial attachment to oral epithelial cells by enzyme activities associated with poor oral hygiene.
AB  == the present investigation explored the hypothesis that elevated levels of certain enzymes in the gingival crevicular environment of individuals with poor oral hygiene and/or gingival inflammation may modify the surfaces of epithelial cells  and thereby modulate the types of bacteria which attach and colonize. buccal epithelial cells treated with neuraminidase and certain proteases were used as a  model for study. bacteria studied included streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis which have been associated with gingival health, actinomyces  species which are increased in plaque associated with developing gingivitis, and  bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans which are associated with destructive periodontal diseases. treatment of epithelial cells with the enzymes studied produced selective effects on their receptivity for bacteria. neuraminidase treatment of epithelial cells greatly reduced the attachment of all strains of s. sanguis and s. mitis studied. in contrast, the number of actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii and a. israelii cells which attached was significantly increased. neuraminidase treatment also appeared to enhance attachment of b. intermedius and b. gingivalis. treatment of  buccal cells with trypsin, chymotrypsin or papain also selectively affected bacterial attachment. such protease treatment greatly reduced the numbers of streptococci and a. viscosus cells which attached, while the numbers of b. gingivalis and b. intermedius were significantly increased. treatment of epithelial cells with preparations of lysosomal enzymes derived from human pmns produced similar selective effects. the changes in bacterial adhesion observed by the enzyme treatments studied are consistent with the shifts in the composition of the gingival crevice flora which occur when oral hygiene is terminated and gingivitis develops.

AB  == the ability of oral streptococcus strains to utilize oligosaccharide chains in mucin as a source of carbohydrate was studied in batch cultures. pig gastric mucin, as a substitute of human salivary mucin, was added to chemically defined medium containing no other carbohydrates. strains of s. mitior attained the highest cell density, while mutans streptococci: s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. rattus, grew very little in the medium with mucin. s. mitis, s. sanguis, and s. milleri in decreasing order, showed intermediate growth. mucin breakdown as measured by sugar analyses indicated that oligosaccharide chains were only partially degraded. every strain produced one or more exoglycosidases potentially involved in hydrolysis of oligosaccharide. the enzyme activities occurred mainly  associated with the cells, and very little activity was found in the culture fluids. the relationships between glycosidase activities and growth, or mucin degradation were not always clear.

AB  == the ability of 51 strains, belonging to streptococcus sanguis, 's. mitior', s. oralis and related groups, to bind salivary amylase was studied. most strains were grouped according to their dna-relatedness and then compared using 14 phenotypic tests. s. mitis, 's. mitior' and three relatively new groups of strains ('cr', 'mgh' and 'tufted mitior') bound salivary amylase, while strains of s. sanguis and s. oralis did not. the ability of strains to bind amylase or not was remarkably consistent within groups and the test proved to be reproducible, rapid and easy to perform. combination of the amylase-binding test  with 6 other conventional physiological tests allowed the construction of a dichotomous identification key which correctly identified 95% of strains for which genetic data was available. these findings suggest that the ability of organisms to bind salivary amylase could become a key test in identification schemes for certain oral streptococci.

TI  == classification and identification of the viridans streptococci.
AB  == this review traces the history of the human, nonhemolytic, or viridans, streptococci and describes improvements in their taxonomy wrought by study of their biochemical profiles and analysis of their nucleic acids. the goal was to define species on the basis of genetic relationships and to describe these species by their phenotypic characteristics so that they can be easily identified. this method has resulted in the division of some species. streptococcus mutans has been divided into four species, two of which are common  in humans. three more mutans group species are indigenous to animals. conversely, s. constellatus, s. intermedius, and "s. milleri" have been combined under s. anginosus. s. mitis (or "s. mitior") can be well-defined and includes s. sanguis  ii. there is genetic heterogeneity within s. sanguis, but the species is usually  easy to identify. there is also some heterogeneity in s. bovis, but most human isolates are genetically related. discussions of the taxonomy of these species are accompanied by descriptions of the characteristics by which these streptococci can be identified. among these species are potential pathogens which should be suspected in cases of endocarditis and purulent infections of liver, brain, and other tissues.

TI  == molecular surface characterization of oral streptococci by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
AB  == in order to characterize the molecular composition of oral streptococci, infrared transmission spectroscopy on freeze-dried cells dissolved in kbr was used. all infrared spectra show similar absorption bands for the strains studied with the most important absorption bands located at 2930 cm-1 (ch), 1653 cm-1 (ami), 1541  cm-1 (amii) and two bands at 1236 cm-1 and 1082 cm-1, which were assigned to phosphate and sugar groups. however, calculation of absorption band ratios normalized with respect to the integrated intensity of the ch stretching region around 2930 cm-1, show significant differences between the strains. both streptococcus mitis strains possess high ami/ch and amii/ch absorption band ratios compared to the other strains. streptococcus salivarius hbc12, a mutant strain devoid of all proteinaceous surface appendages, shows significantly lower  ami/ch and amii/ch band ratios with respect to its parent strain s. salivarius hb. two positive relationships could be established both between the amii/ch absorption band ratio and the n/c elemental surface concentration ratio of the strains previously, determined from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) and also between ami/ch and the fraction of carbon atoms at the surface involved in amide bonds, determined by xps as well. from this comparison, it is concluded that transmission infrared spectroscopy can be employed as a technique to study the molecular surface composition of freeze-dried microorganisms.

AB  == the influence of a pellicle on streptococcal adhesion was studied. a "ripened" two-hour salivary pellicle and an "early" five-minute salivary pellicle were formed on human enamel and artificial solid substrata with varying surface free-energies. three strains of oral streptococci, also with widely different surface free-energies, were used for adhesion studies. pellicle formation and streptococcal adhesion took place at a constant shear rate of 21 s-1. adhesion of s. mitis bms to bare and pellicle-covered enamel was low and not significantly affected by the presence of a pellicle (0.7 x 10(6) and 0.6 x 10(6) cells.cm-2, resp.), whereas the numbers of s. sanguis 12 and s. mutans ns adhering to bare enamel (4.2 x 10(6) cells.cm-2 and 13.8 x 10(6) cells, cm-2, resp) were significantly reduced by the presence of a pellicle. this reduction was almost complete after only five minutes of salivary protein adsorption (1.9 x 10(-6) and 1.1 x 10(6) cells.cm-2 for s. sanguis and s. mutans, resp.) but further reduced for s. sanguis adhering to a ripened pellicle (0.7 x 10(6) cells.cm-2). the numbers of streptococci adhering at equilibrium to bare enamel could be fitted to a thermodynamically based model, which was previously described for bacterial adhesion to homogenous artificial substrata. streptococcal adhesion to artificial substrata exposed to saliva was low, and the differences among uncoated materials were markedly reduced even after only five minutes' exposure to saliva.

TI  == speciation of viridans streptococci & their significance in human infections.
AB  == sixty strains of viridans streptococci recovered, from various infections, encountered in a large referral hospital in tamil nadu (south india) from december 1983 to may 1985 were characterised by conventional tests. of these, 57  (95%) belonged to four species viz., sanguis ii, mitis, intermedius and constellatus. of the 40 strains that were assessed for their clinical significance, 23 (57.5%) were found to be either significant or of suggestive significance. the study suggested viridans streptococci are not particularly virulent pathogens. but local/systemic factors were found to predispose the subjects to this infection.

TI  == effect of neuraminidase on the adherence to salivary pellicle of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis.
AB  == neuraminidase-sensitive adherence to experimental salivary pellicles was studied  using eight strains of streptococcus sanguis and five strains of streptococcus mitis. approximately 60% of the strains of each species showed significantly lower adherence to neuraminidase-treated versus untreated saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. in addition, the adherence of several of these streptococcal strains to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite and neuraminidase-treated saliva-coated hydroxyapatite was inhibited using galactose and n-acetyl-d-galactosamine. results from these studies suggested that several salivary receptors mediate adherence of these species.

TI  == zeta potential and the adhesion of oral streptococci to polymethylmethacrylate.
AB  == adhesion of candida albicans to the acrylic fitting surface of dentures can lead  to the development of denture induced stomatitis and is suggested to be preceeded by the adhesion of indegeneous oral bacteria. bacterial adhesion can be considered as a result of attractive van der waals and repulsive electrostatic forces. in this paper we investigate the role of electrostatic interactions in the adhesion of oral streptococci to polymethylmethacrylate (pmma), the most commonly employed denture-base material. zeta potentials of the bacterial strains as well as of pmma fillings were reduced by increasing the ionic strength in the  buffer suspension, causing an elevated number of adhering s. mitis, s. sanguis and s. mutans. as streptococcal adhesion is suggested to be a prerequisite for the subsequent adhesion of candida albicans, the use of more negatively charged denture-base materials can be recommended in order to prevent streptococcal adhesion and therewith adhesion of candidae, and the occurrence of denture-induced stomatitis.

AB  == the ecology and identity of iga1 protease-producing streptococci in the human oral cavity were studied in an attempt to obtain insight into the significance of iga1 proteases for host-parasite relationships. contrary to previous observations, a detailed taxonomic analysis of oral streptococci revealed that all strains of s. sanguis and s. oralis ("s.mitior") produced iga1 protease. in addition, iga1 protease activity was observed in some isolates of s.mitis. of the streptococci that initiate plaque formation on dental enamel 88% (median value) had iga1 protease activity. low proportions of the streptococci that colonize the tongue and oropharyngeal mucosae produced iga1 protease, in contrast to 60% of streptococci isolated from buccal mucosa. the iga1 proteases from s. sanguis i-iii, s. sanguis iv, s. oralis, and s.mitis were distinct as revealed by studies using enzyme-neutralizing antibodies.

TI  == a comparison between the elemental surface compositions and electrokinetic properties of oral streptococci with and without adsorbed salivary constituents.
AB  == in order to characterize the functional cell surface, isoelectric points and elemental surface concentration, the ratios of nitrogen, oxygen and phosphorus to carbon of saliva-coated strains were determined by ph-dependent zeta potential measurements and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and compared with those of uncoated strains. the measurements of potential were carried out on completely hydrated cells, whereas the spectroscopy was on freeze-dried micro-organisms. the small increase in the nitrogen:carbon surface concentration ratio of saliva-coated streptococci in comparison to uncoated strains varied from 0.001 (streptococcus mitis ba) to 0.029 (streptococcus sanguis ch3) and was concurrent  with an increase of the isoelectric point, ranging from 0.0 to 0.9. increases in  the oxygen:carbon ratio ranged from 0.006 (strep. mitis ba) to 0.041 (streptococcus mutans ns), whereas the phosphorus:carbon surface concentration ratio was unchanged after saliva treatment. despite the fact that isoelectric and compositional measurements were made in different states of surface hydration, a  decrease in the nitrogen:carbon ratio accompanied by an increase in oxygen:carbon ratio, was related to a decrease of the isoelectric point of the saliva-coated strains, and so analogous with previous observations for uncoated strains. although there were changes in the physico-chemical properties of the strains upon saliva coating, all more or less kept their own surface identity despite adsorption of salivary constituents, possibly indicating some capacity to protect their own physico-chemical identity.

TI  == surface structures, co-aggregation and adherence phenomena of streptococcus oralis and related species.
AB  == seven strains of streptococcus oralis were found to possess surface structures. four strains possessed long fimbriae which ranged in length from 266-366 nm, while the remaining three strains possessed shorter peritrichously distributed fibrils which ranged in length from 80-197 nm. the fibrillar strains were morphologically similar to strains of streptococcus sanguis i and ii and streptococcus mitis. no strain of s. oralis produced tufts of fibrils like certain strains of s. sanguis i. strains of streptococcus milleri produced peritrichously distributed fimbriae which were morphologically dissimilar to the  fimbriae produced by s. oralis strains. s. oralis strains were moderately to highly hydrophobic, but hydrophobicity could not be related to adhesion parameters or type or length or density of surface structures. furthermore, there appeared to be no correlation between type of surface structures and adhesion parameters. two of the three fibrillar strains of s. oralis and the peritrichously fibrillar strains of s. sanguis, together with one strain of s. milleri, were able to co-aggregate with actinomycetes.

TI  == inhibition of adhesion of viridans streptococci to fibronectin-coated hydroxyapatite beads by lipoteichoic acid.
AB  == fibronectin-coated hydroxyapatite (fnha) beads were used in a model adhesion assay to isolate the lipoteichoic acid (lta) mediated adhesion of oral streptococci. representative strains of the commonly isolated viridans streptococci were incubated with fnha beads in the presence and absence of exogenous lta. the lta inhibited the adhesion of all strains to a greater or lesser extent, but only a very few strains were inhibited by more than 90%. strains of streptococcus sanguis type ii and streptococcus mitis which synthesize an amphiphile other than lta were also inhibited. the findings provided circumstantial evidence for the involvement of lta in the adhesion of this group  of oral bacteria.

TI  == relationship of subgingival microbial complexes to clinical features at the sampled sites.
AB  == subgingival plaque samples from 100 active destructive periodontal lesions and 150 inactive subgingival sites in 33 subjects were analyzed by predominant cultivable microbiota techniques. 50 isolates were characterized from each sample and where possible, the isolate was placed in 1 of 134 microbial species or groups. the sites were clustered on the basis of the proportions of all of the species detected in each sample using a minimum similarity matching coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. 10 clusters containing 166 sites were formed which exhibited greater than 35% minimum similarities. all clusters were made up of sites from multiple subjects and were formed on the basis of different combinations of micro-organisms. certain complexes of micro-organisms appeared to relate to the severity of periodontal destruction and the activity of the sampled site. the combination of f. nucleatum, b. forsyth and w. recta (cluster vii) or b. gingivalis, b. intermedius and s. intermedius (cluster viii) distinguished clusters made up of sites which on average had the most attachment loss and the deepest pockets. these clusters contained the highest proportions of active sites and sites which lost greater than 3 mm of attachment after therapy. clusters dominated by v. parvula (cluster iii), the actinomyces sp. (cluster x) or the combination of s. sanguis ii, s. mitis, v. parvula and s. intermedius (cluster ii) were made up of sites which exhibited less active disease and responded more  favorably to therapy. sites in other clusters exhibited moderate levels of prior  destructive disease and disease activity status closer to the mean values for all 250 sites.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == association of viridans group streptococci from pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis and upper genital tract infection.
AB  == the prevalence and role of viridans group streptococci in the female genital tract have not been well described. in this study of 482 pregnant women, 147 (30%) were culture positive for viridans group streptococci. of 392 women with predominant lactobacillus morphotypes by gram stain (normal), 110 (28%) were colonized with viridans group streptococci, compared with 37 (41%) of 90 women with bacterial vaginosis (bv) (p = 0.02). to determine whether any species were associated with bv, 177 consecutively isolated viridans group streptococci from the vagina were identified to the species level by using the facklam scheme. the  most frequently isolated species from the vagina was streptococcus intermedius (13%), followed by streptococcus acidominimus (6%), streptococcus constellatus (5%), streptococcus sanguis ii (4%), streptococcus mitis (2%), streptococcus salivarius (2%), streptococcus morbillorum (2%), streptococcus sanguis i (1%), streptococcus mutans (0.2%), and streptococcus uberis (0.2%) with an average of 1.2 species per woman. the distribution of the species among women with bv compared with normal women was not significantly different, with the exception of two species which were associated with bv: s. acidominimus (18% versus 3%, p less than 0.001) and s. morbillorum (6% versus 0.7%, p = 0.005). amniotic fluid and placenta cultures yielded 54 isolates: s. sanguis ii (13 isolates), s. acidominimus (9 isolates), s. intermedius (10 isolates), s. constellatus (3 isolates), s. mitis (4 isolates), s. sanguis i (4 isolates), s. morbillorum (5 isolates), s. mutans (2 isolates), s. uberis (1 isolate), mannitol-positive s. intermedius (1 isolate), and 2 isolates which were not classified. the distribution of species isolated from the upper genital tract was not a reflection of the distribution in the lower genital tract. dextran-producing species of viridans group streptococci may have a greater pathogenic potential in the placenta than the non-dextran-producing species.

TI  == the predominant cultivable microbiota of active and inactive lesions of destructive periodontal diseases.

AB  == six species of microorganisms commonly found within the oral cavity were exposed  for either one minute or two hours to 5% lidocaine liquid topical anesthetic and  benzocaine liquid topical anesthetic. mixtures of microorganisms and anesthetics  were diluted and plated onto a brain heart infusion medium. reduction in cell viability was 73-100% after exposure to the anesthetic agents when compared with  the saline/buffer controls. a significant reduction (p < .005) in cell growth by  streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. salivarius, actinomyces viscosus,  and candida albicans was associated with a one-minute and two-hour exposure to lidocaine, benzocaine, 5% lidocaine, and the benzocaine vehicle control. five percent lidocaine reduced growth of the test orgainisms more than benzocaine in one-minute exposures to s. mutans, a. viscosus and s. salivarius and with a two-hour exposure to s. salivarius.five percent lidocaine was bacteriocidal or fungicidal to all microorganisms for both time periods whereas, benzocaine liquid topical anesthetic was predominately bacteriostatic or fungistatic after one-minute exposures and bacteriocidal or fungicidal after two hours.the results  indicated that two dental liquid topical anesthetics containing lidocaine or benzocaine possessed considerable antimicrobial activity to selected oral microorganisms. the exclusive use of a topical liquid anesthetic may be an adequate means to render the oral mucosa aseptic before injection of a local anesthetic.

TI  == partial characterisation of the inhibitory substances produced by streptococcus oralis and related species.

TI  == the growth of oral bacteria on saliva.
AB  == the present experiments were aimed at studying the degradation of salivary glycoproteins by the oral microflora. to this end, s. sanguis i strain ny476 and  s. sanguis ii (s. mitior) strain ny581 were grown continuously in human-whole saliva. under these conditions, the strains produced a variety of cell-associated hydrolytic activities, including glycosidases, exo- and endopeptidases, and esterases. s. sanguis ii generally exhibited higher levels of enzyme activity than did s. sanguis i, in particular of neuraminidase that was produced only by s. sanguis ii. in accordance, s. sanguis ii had a higher cell yield and consumed  a higher proportion of the sugars and sialic acid in the glycoproteins than did s. sanguis i. interestingly, s. sanguis i, which is devoid of neuraminidase, is known to have a lectin with specificity for sialic acid, whereas s. sanguis ii has affinity for galactose residues in the glycoproteins. we propose that specific binding of glycoproteins by oral bacteria constitutes a mechanism to collect nutrients in the vicinity of the cell. the special ability of s. sanguis  ii to utilize saliva for growth was further exemplified by its selection in batch-wise enrichments of dental plaque on saliva. the microflora in these enrichment cultures always consisted of peptostreptococcus micros, s. sanguis ii, and fusobacterium nucleatum as the dominant organisms. further, s. mitis and gemella haemolysans were generally found to be present. the enrichment cultures produced a wide variety of mainly cell-bound hydrolytic enzymes. this resulted in almost complete breakdown of salivary glycoproteins in the culture.

AB  == a simple dip-slide test (cariescreen sm) based on msb selective agar was devised  for detection and quantitation of streptococcus mutans in oral samples. for this  test, a bacitracin tablet is dissolved in a vial containing buffered saline diluent. paraffin-stimulated saliva is collected in this diluent vial. a dip slide which incorporates a modified msb agar (minus bacitracin) is immersed briefly in the diluted saliva. after addition of a co2-generating tablet, the screw-cap dip slide is closed tightly in the vial and incubated for two days at 37 degrees c and one day at room temperature. s. mutans populations in saliva are estimated by comparison with a colony density chart. growth of reference strains  of s. mutans was equivalent on cariescreen sm dip slides and on msb agar plates.  reference strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus milleri did not grow on cariescreen sm dip slides. aliquots of saliva from 50 schoolchildren and 51 adults were tested by the dip-slide method and by conventional plating methods in msb agar. very good correlation (0.93) between the two methods was obtained. this simplified s. mutans detection system is suitable for use by clinical personnel in dental clinics or other non-laboratory settings for identification of subjects potentially at risk for caries.

TI  == interbacterial adhesion between pseudomonas aeruginosa and indigenous oral bacteria isolated from patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == interbacterial adhesion between strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and strains of  indigenous oral bacteria, both of which were isolated from the oral cavity of cystic fibrosis patients, was investigated by the phenomenon of the coaggregation reaction. a total of 22 strains of p. aeruginosa were isolated from the oral cavity of 17 patients and examined for their abilities to coaggregate with 5 strains each of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, and actinomyces naeslundii. coaggregation reactions were common between these oral bacteria and both the mucoid and nonmucoid variants of p. aeruginosa. all strains of p. aeruginosa were also able to agglutinate neuraminidase-treated or untreated human erythrocytes of blood types a, b, and o. positive coaggregation reactions were further characterized by determining the effects of several sugars, and of heat and protease treatments of the bacteria. none of the coaggregtion reactions were inhibited by 0.05 m lactose, galactose, glucose, fucose, or mannose. all coaggregation reactions were dependent upon heat- and protease-sensitive components of the pseudomonas. thus, the interbacterial adhesions between p. aeruginosa and the oral bacteria studied appears to involve  adhesins on the pseudomonas cell, which bind to complementary receptors, on the cell surfaces of oral bacteria. the apparent prevalence and diversity of interbacterial adhesions between p. aeruginosa strains originating from the oral  cavity of cystic fibrosis patients and strains of the indigenous oral bacteria suggest that some of these reactions may affect the extent to which p. aeruginosa colonizes in the oral cavity of cystic fibrosis patients, and thereby, influence  susceptibility of the host to infection.

TI  == penicillin-induced effects on streptomycin uptake and early bactericidal activity differ in viridans group and enterococcal streptococci.
AB  == in vitro studies with penicillin and [3h]streptomycin in four strains of streptococci (s. faecalis, s. sanguis, and s. mitis) were performed by simultaneously measuring the rates of bacterial killing and uptake of streptomycin. in s. faecalis, penicillin stimulated streptomycin uptake, as has been shown by moellering and weinberg (r. c. moellering, jr., and a. n. weinberg, j. clin. invest. 50:2580-2584, 1971). moreover, the antibiotic combination was associated with an enhanced bactericidal rate which temporally correlated with beta-lactam-induced aminoglycoside uptake. in contrast, in viridans group streptococci (s. sanguis and s. mitis) penicillin had no effect on streptomycin uptake and a minimal effect on bactericidal rate when compared with either drug alone. these data suggested that the stimulation of streptomycin uptake in streptococci by penicillin is strain or species specific and that important differences exist between enterococci and viridans group streptococci regarding the mechanisms of beta-lactam-aminoglycoside potentiation.

AB  == a recent report has identified a lectin on the surfaces of several strains of streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis with specificity for an n-acetylneuraminic acid alpha 2,3-galactose-beta 1,3-n-acetylgalactosamine sequence (p.a. murray, m.j. levine, l.a. tabak, and m.s. reddy, biochem. biophys. res. commun. 106:390-396, 1982). in the present study, purification and characterization of this sialic acid-binding protein (sabp) was begun. a clinical isolate of s. mitis was grown to mid stationary phase in synthetic fmc medium and then extracted with lithium 3,5-diiodosalicylate. lyophilized extract was subjected to gel filtration on a sephadex g-200 column, giving four protein peaks (a to d). peak b, shown by hemagglutination assay to contain sabp, was next subjected to affinity chromatography on a sepharose-4b matrix coupled to fetuin glycopeptides. after an extensive washing, peak b materials bound to the affinity matrix were eluted with buffered n-acetylneuraminic acid. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 2-mercaptoethanol on 7.5% gels of affinity-purified materials revealed components of 96, 70, and 65 kilodaltons (kda). without reducing agent, only the 65-kda band and materials which did not penetrate the gel were visualized, suggesting that the 96- and 70-kda components  were disulfide linked. the chemical cross-linking agent, disuccinimidyl suberate, was used to demonstrate specific interactions between the sabp preparation and [14c]fetuin glycopeptides. after cross-linking, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography revealed the 96- and  70-kda components, indicating that the sabp is at least bivalent. these findings  support our previous suggestion that human salivary glycoproteins facilitate clearance of selected oral streptococci via specific interactions between sialic  acid-containing oligosaccharides and a carbohydrate-binding protein on the bacterial cell surface.

TI  == the intra-oral effect on enamel demineralization of extracellular matrix material synthesized from sucrose by streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the role of extracellular matrix material (emm) synthesized from sucrose (s) by streptococcus mutans ib-1600 in altering the demineralizing potential of artificial plaque was evaluated with an intraoral enamel demineralization test (iedt). the artificial plaque samples were prepared from cells cultivated in todd-hewitt broth (thb) supplemented with various s concentrations and by mixing  thb-grown cells with increasing proportions of emm (heat-killed thb + 2% s-cultivated cells). the samples were also evaluated for cell density (dna content) and acidogenicity in vitro (ph-stat), as well as for in situ ph changes  during a 45-minute intra-oral test following a 10% glucose rinse. an increase in  the proportion of emm relative to cell density was associated with an increase in enamel demineralization. this trend reversed when the ratio of cells to emm was less than 1:19. experiments involving strains of s. mitis, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius suggested a similar effect of emm. the intra-oral ph data suggest that the presence of emm may enhance demineralization by altering diffusion properties of plaque.

TI  == cell surface hydrophobicity of group d and viridans streptococci isolated from patients with septicaemia.
AB  == sixty-three strains of group d streptococci and viridans streptococci isolated from blood cultures during a two year period were typed to the species level with conventional biochemical tests and api strep. streptococcus faecalis was the most common species isolated followed by s. sanguis, s. mitis and s. constellatus (s.  milleri). one of the two isolates of s. faecium was a contamination. the reported increasing frequency of this organism and other group d and viridans streptococci as well as the association of s. bovis with malignant bowel disease indicate the  need for full identification of streptococcal isolates from blood cultures. pronounced surface hydrophobicity as measured with the salt aggregation test (sat) was expressed by 59/63 (94%) of the blood culture isolates whereas strains  isolated from commercial fermentation products and strains passaged several times were hydrophilic. in the presence of human serum albumin which binds to lipoteichoic acid only one strain decreased in surface hydrophobicity. the surface hydrophobicity of two strains even slightly increased indicating that lipoteichoic acid but marginally contributes to surface hydrophobicity of streptococcal cells from these species.

TI  == molecular cloning and characterization of scrb, the structural gene for the streptococcus mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sucrose phosphotransferase system sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase.
AB  == a dna fragment encoding the sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase component of the streptococcus mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sucrose phosphotransferase system has been recovered from a plasmid-based genomic library of strain gs5. the locus, designated scrb, was found to reside within a 2.9-kilobase-pair restriction fragment present on the chimeric molecule pva1343 (7.3 kilobase pairs). minicell analysis of pva1343-directed translation products revealed that  the scrb product synthesized in escherichia coli v1343 was a single peptide of mr 57,000. this polypeptide was reactive with antiserum prepared against s. mutans intracellular invertase, which has been previously shown to have an mr of 43,000  to 48,000. the basis of this difference in mr was not established but may represent a posttranslational proteolytic event which occurred in s. mutans but not in recombinant v1343. sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase purified to homogeneity from v1343 exhibited michaelis constants of 180 mm for sucrose and 0.08 mm for sucrose-6-phosphate. deletion analysis of pva1343 facilitated the assignment of a coding region for the hydrolase within the insert, as well as an orientation for  the transcription of scrb. scrb-defective strains of s. mutans constructed by additive integration of an insertionally inactivated scrb locus exhibited the sucrose sensitivity characteristic of this mutant class. similar loci were detected by dna-dna hybridization in additional strains of s. mutans and two strains of streptococcus cricetus, but not in single strain representatives of s. rattus, s. sobrinus, s. sanguis i and ii, s. salivarius, or s. mitis.

TI  == isolation and characterization of a 60-kilodalton salivary glycoprotein with agglutinating activity against strains of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a bacterial agglutinin specific for strains of streptococcus mutans was isolated  from human saliva. physiochemical analyses showed the agglutinin to be a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 60,000. the agglutinin aggregated four of the eight strains of streptococcus mutans tested but did not aggregate the strains of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis tested. chemical modification of carbohydrate moieties of the agglutinin with sodium metaperiodate had no effect on aggregation, whereas modification of the polypeptide portion with trypsin abolished aggregating activity. a set of five murine hybridoma antibodies was employed to further analyze the agglutinin.  two carbohydrate-specific antibodies, directed against d-mannose and n-acetylgalactosamine moieties, respectively, failed to block agglutinin- or whole saliva-mediated aggregation of s. mutans cells. in contrast, two antibodies directed against pronase-sensitive antigenic sites blocked both agglutinin- and saliva-mediated aggregation of s. mutans cells. western blot analysis with the agglutinin-specific hybridoma antibodies demonstrated the agglutinin in whole saliva and in artificial tooth pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite beads incubated with saliva. these results suggest that a 60-kilodalton glycoprotein of human saliva is a bacterial agglutinin with specificity for certain strains of s. mutans. they further suggest that aggregation is mediated by polypeptide rather than carbohydrate determinants of the glycoprotein.

TI  == in vitro activity of a-16686, a new glycopeptide.
AB  == a-16686 is a novel glycopeptide antibiotic derived from actinoplanes. a-16686 inhibited hemolytic streptococci groups a, b, c, f, and g at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml, with 90% inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, including erythromycin-resistant isolates. s. bovis, various viridans groups streptococci, s. mitis, s. mutans, and s. sanguis were inhibited  by less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, and mics of s. faecalis and s. faecium were 0.5-2 micrograms/ml. most staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant strains, were inhibited by 1 or 2 micrograms/ml. a-16686 was bactericidal with minimal difference between mic and mbc for gram-positive species. a-16686 did not inhibit enterobacteriaceae or pseudomonas.

TI  == effect of monoclonal antibodies against lipoteichoic acid from the oral bacterium streptococcus mutans on its adhesion and plaque-accumulation in vitro.
AB  == five monoclonal antibodies directed against streptococcus mutans strain jbp lipoteichoic acid (lta) were characterized. they were all similarly reactive with the immunizing lta-containing extract, with intact strep. mutans jbp cells and with lta purified from lactobacillus casei. immobilized anti-lta antibodies removes lta from lta-containing extracts. the binding of antibodies to lta was inhibited by the aqueous extract but not by the organic extract of de-acylated lta, indicating reactivity with the polyglycerol-phosphate portion of the molecule. antibodies were reactive with all serotypes of strep. mutans, as well as with strains of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and l. casei,  but not with lta-negative species streptococcus mitis or actinomyces viscosus. anti-lta antibodies at doses of 0.3 or 3.0 micrograms/ml, had no effect on the adherence of strep. mutans jbp to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite, but enhanced adherence 150-300 per cent at 30 micrograms/ml. there was no effect of anti-lta antibodies in a chemostat model which measured sucrose-dependent plaque accumulation by strep. mutans. the results argue against a major role for lta in strep. mutans adherence or plaque accumulation in vitro.

TI  == enamel demineralization by acid produced from endogenous substrate in oral streptococci.
AB  == bovine enamel blocks were covered by a bacterial cell mass and held in the mouths of human volunteers by a palatal appliance, to study the effects of acid production from endogenous bacterial substrate on the ph of the mass and on enamel demineralization. variables were cells with and without endogenous substrate, rinsing with 10 per cent glucose or sucrose solution, or no rinsing and the type of organism. acid production from endogenous substrate by streptococcus mutans strain ib-1600, due, at least in part, to intracellular glycogen degradation, caused a marked and prolonged ph drop and significant enamel demineralization. a similar but less marked effect was obtained with a strain of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces viscosus. thus acid production from endogenous sources by plaque bacteria may be of importance in the aetiology of dental caries.

TI  == characterization of nutritionally variant streptococci by biochemical tests and penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  == a comparative study of 60 strains of nutritionally variant streptococci (nvs) with 34 strains of streptococcus mitis and 37 strains of streptococcus sanguis ii showed the presence of a red chromophore which was absent in the other streptococcal species. by using the conventional microbiological tests, only small differences were found between the nvs and the two other related species. in contrast a clear-cut delineation was found by the api 20 strep system of identification. all nvs contained pyrrolidonylarylamidase, an enzyme which was absent in s. mitis and s. sanguis ii strains, and lacked the alkaline phosphatase enzyme which was present in 56% of s. mitis strains and 62% of s. sanguis ii strains. according to the additional enzymatic and biochemical tests of the api 20 strep system, there were three biotypes among nvs. the major biotype included  33 of 60 strains which were characterized by the presence of both alpha- and beta-galactosidases and the capacity to hydrolyze trehalose. this biotype also showed a specific pattern of penicillin-binding proteins. these results show that nvs are recognized as a separate variety distinct from s. mitis and s. sanguis ii species, despite some common biochemical properties. moreover, the delineation of 33 strains with a specific biotype and a specific penicillin-binding protein pattern strongly suggests that a large part of nvs strains belong to an individual species.

TI  == the surface free energy of oral streptococci after being coated with saliva and its relation to adhesion in the mouth.
AB  == contact angle measurements on layers of bacteria were used to determine the bacterial surface free energy (gamma b) of a variety of oral streptococcal strains, both without and after being coated with human whole saliva. at least four isolates of each species, either freshly isolated or laboratory strains, were used. the species streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius were homogeneous, having high surface free energies, and were not affected by saliva treatment (gamma b = 106 +/- 12 and 107 +/- 10 erg x cm-2 in the absence and presence of saliva coating, respectively; n = 20). s. mitis had a very low surface free energy (46 +/- 15; n = 5), which was significantly increased after salivary adsorption (71 +/- 14 erg x cm-2; p less than 0.002). the species s. milleri contained strains with both high and low gamma b. calculation of the interfacial free energy of adhesion (delta f adh) for bacteria from a saliva suspension to solid surfaces with various arbitrary surface free energies (gamma  s) showed that, theoretically, most strains will encounter thermodynamically favorable conditions for adhesion to surfaces with a gamma s above 62 erg x cm-2. however, s. mitis strains not coated with saliva would only be able to adhere to  surfaces with gamma s lower than this value. saliva-coating reverses the calculated relationship with gamma s for these strains. the results indicate that an enamel surface with a low gamma s value would be thermodynamically unfavorable for adhesion of most oral streptococci.

TI  == genetic transformation in streptococcus sanguis. effects on genetic transformation by culture filtrates of streptococcus sanguis (serogroups h and w) and streptococcus mitis (mitior) with reference to identification.
AB  == streptococcus sanguis (serogroups h and w) strains are frequently competent in genetic transformation. in a collection of 18 strains of s. sanguis isolated from blood cultures, 12 strains were spontaneously competent in transformation by streptomycin-resistant dna, and three strains were induced to competence by the use of culture filtrates containing competence factor (cf). culture filtrates from spontaneously competent s. sanguis strains only induced competence in transformation of strains of the same species. in addition to the three "constitutional" types of s. sanguis with regard to specificity of transformation previously reported (originally represented by the strain challis, 13b and nctc 7863), a possible fourth type, (represented by strain 21452) was found. further studies are required to ascertain the role of these types. the "constitutional" types are characterized by the range of activity of their cf's. these specificities seem useful in identification of s. sanguis and its separation from s. mitis (mitior). tests of spontaneously competent strains with culture filtrates from other competent strains showed variable effects on the transformation frequencies in different strains.

TI  == genetic transformation in streptococcus sanguis. identification, surface spreading and competence of invasive strains of streptococcus sanguis lancefield  groups h and w and other invasive viridans streptococci.
AB  == of 46 viridans streptococci isolated from cases of probably true bacteremia, 26 strains or 56% could be grouped serologically in the lancefield system. eight strains (17%) were identified as serogroup h (characteristic of streptococcus sanguis), ten strains (22%) as serogroup w (a new group antigen found in s. sanguis) and eight strains (17%) as serogroup k (related to s. mitis (mitior)). the high number of serogroupable viridans streptococci was specially due to the introduction of serogroup w and indicates the importance of this serogroup in cases of bacteremia. a set of six diagnostic tests (production of hydrogen peroxide, arginine and esculin hydrolysis, polysaccharide production, voges-proskauer reaction, mannitol fermentation) was used for speciation of the viridans streptococci; in addition, search for spreading zones around the colonies was included in the diagnostic procedure. spreading zones were only present in s. sanguis and occurred more frequently in group h strains than group  w strains. the 46 viridans streptococci were tested in genetic transformation. the prevalence of spontaneous competence in strains isolated from the blood was high, particularly in s. sanguis serogroup h (88%) and w (50%). for serogroup h,  spontaneous competence was found as frequently among invasive strains as among carrier isolates previously studied.

AB  == the serostat latex agglutination test (scott laboratories, inc., fiskesville, r.i.) for identification of group d streptococci was compared with bile-esculin agar and lancefield grouping by using 110 clinical isolates of group d streptococci (s. faecalis, 74; s. bovis, 24; s. durans, 3; s. faecium, 9) and 65  viridans streptococci (s. anginosus-constellatus, 2; streptococcus mg, 15; s. sanguis ii, 14; s. mitis, 7; s. mutans, 5; s. salivarius, 8; s. sanguis i, 8; s.  acidominimus, 1; s. morbillorum, 2; s. pneumoniae, 3). all strains of group d streptococci were bile-esculin positive. serostat reactions were falsely positive with 2 strains of s. sanguisii and 1 strain of streptococcus mg (4.6% of all viridans streptococci tested) and falsely negative with 10 s. bovis, 8 s. faecalis, 1 s. durans, and 6 s. faecium strains (22.7% of all group d streptococci tested). when considered with colonial morphology and hemolytic reaction, serostat is a rapid (60-s) and useful test for recognition of group d streptococci.

TI  == disseminated tetracycline resistance in oral streptococci: implication of a conjugative transposon.
AB  == a dna sequence specifying tetracycline resistance (tcr) has been previously cloned from a clinical isolate of streptococcus mutans designated u202 (j. a. tobian and f. l. macrina, j. bacteriol. 152:215-222, 1982). we used this sequence as a molecular probe in studying the dissemination of tcr among oral streptococcal species isolated from patients treated with tetracycline. eleven strains (including s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii, s. mitis, and s. salivarius) from seven patients were examined by southern blot analysis. seven strains showed strong hybridization to the tcr probe, two showed weak hybridization, and two did not display detectable hybridization. based on previous characterization of the cloned sequence, our data suggest the dissemination of the tetm class of resistance determinants among these oral streptococci. one of the clinical s. sanguis i isolates studied was able to transfer its tcr phenotype to other oral streptococci and to enteric streptococci in the absence of plasmid dna. this transfer appeared to be conjugation-like on the basis of its insensitivity to dnase and its dependence on intimate cell-to-cell contact. using the cloned tcr sequence, we were able to study the progeny of the matings. our data suggest that this resistance transfer element occupies a chromosomal location in streptococcal cells and that it strongly resembles the conjugative transposon tn916 in its behavior.

TI  == reaction of human colostral and early milk antibodies with oral streptococci.
AB  == colostrum or early breast milk or both from each of 16 healthy women contained agglutinating antibodies for all normal streptococcal inhabitants of the human oral cavity (s. mutans, s. sanguis, s. mitis, and s. salivarius), including those which colonize the neonatal oral cavity in significant numbers. agglutination correlated with the amount of immunoglobulin a (iga) binding to bacterial surfaces as measured by mixed reverse passive antiglobulin hemagglutination. surprisingly, colostral iga agglutinated our control organism, brucella abortus.  low levels of colostral or milk igm and igg antibodies also reacted with all of the test bacteria. absorption studies with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that a proportion of antibodies in colostrum and early milk is specific for each of the different oral streptococci. fractionation on sepharose 4b indicated that 11s secretory iga is the predominant form of colostral and milk antibody for all of the test bacteria, including b. abortus. no evidence was found that reactions other than antigen-antibody reactions resulted in binding of colostral immunoglobulins by any of the test bacteria.

TI  == adherence of oral streptococci: evidence for nonspecific adsorption to saliva-coated hydroxylapatite surfaces.
AB  == it is proposed that binding of oral streptococci to saliva-coated hydroxylapatite (sha) surfaces is a multifactorial process involving both specific and nonspecific receptors. in this context, specific binding is described as a high-affinity, saturable interaction between the cell and binding surface. conversely, nonspecific binding is considered to be a nonsaturable, generalized,  low-affinity reaction. experimental differentiation of specific binding from nonspecific binding was achieved with a competition assay which utilized a large  excess of nonradiolabeled bacteria to compete with the 3h-labeled cells for attachment to receptors on 1.5 mg of sha crystals. competition assays of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis adhesion clearly demonstrated that  the total binding isotherm was composed of a saturable specific binding reaction  and a minor nonspecific binding component. this was further substantiated by analysis of nonlinear scatchard plots of the total binding data. the competition  data for streptococcus mutans binding indicated that ca. 50% of the s. mutans binding appeared to be specific, although saturation of the sha surfaces with bacterial cells could not be demonstrated. experiments measuring desorption of radiolabeled cells from sha crystals into buffer showed that ca. 50% of the bound s. mutans cells were removed after 4 h, whereas less than 5% of the s. sanguis cells were eluted from the sha surfaces. the kinetics of attachment were studied  by using an extract of persea americana as a noncompetitive inhibitor of adherence. the total cell binding data for these experiments suggested a very rapid binding reaction followed by a slower rate of attachment. it was concluded  from these three different experimental approaches that adherence of selected oral streptococci to sha surfaces involves specific, high-affinity and nonspecific, low-affinity binding reactions. the concept is developed that in vitro streptococcal attachment to sha can be described as a two-reaction process  in which the low-affinity interaction of the cell with the sha surface precedes the establishment of the stronger, specific bonds needed for the maintenance of streptococci in the oral cavity.

TI  == regulation of glucose metabolism in oral streptococci through independent pathways of glucose 6-phosphate and glucose 1-phosphate formation.
AB  == in vivo rates of glucose uptake and acid production by oral streptococci grown in glucose- or nitrogen-limited continuous culture and batch culture were compared with the glucose phosphorylation activities of harvested, decryptified cells. the strains examined contained significant phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system (pts) activity, measured by a glucose 6-phosphate (g6p) dehydrogenase-linked assay procedure, but this activity was insufficient to account for the in vivo glucose uptake rates. however, atp was a superior phosphoryl donor to phosphoenolpyruvate, and unlike the pts, phosphoryl transfer  with atp was insensitive to bacteriostatic concentrations of chlorhexidine, suggesting glucokinase-mediated g6p formation. again, g6p formation from the pts  and glucokinase reactions was not commensurate with some of the glucose uptake rates observed, implying that other phosphorylation reactions must be occurring.  two novel reactions involving carbamyl phosphate and acetyl phosphate were identified in some of the strains. no g6p formation was detected with these potential phosphoryl donors, but in the presence of phosphoglucomutase, glucose 1-phosphate (g1p) formation was evident, which was insensitive to chlorhexidine.  g1p is a precursor of glycogen, and good correlation was obtained between g1p formation activity and endogenous metabolism of washed cells measured either as a rate of acid production at a constant ph 7 or as a decrease in ph with time in the absence of titrant. a "league table" of abilities to synthesize g1p and produce acid from endogenous metabolism was compiled for oral streptococci grown  in batch culture. this indicated that streptococcus mutans ingbritt and streptococcus sanguis challis were unable to form g1p or produce much acid endogenously, whereas increasing activities were obtained with streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis. in particular, s. mitis had the highest g1p formation activities and was able to decrease the ph to less than 5 in 15 min by endogenous metabolism alone. the data are consistent with the intracellular accumulation of free glucose driven by proton motive force when pts activities are low and the subsequent phosphorylation to either g6p for  metabolism via glycolysis or g1p for glycogen biosynthesis. the accumulation of acetyl phosphate during glucose-limited growth and the availability of arginine for catabolism to carbamyl phosphate provide an explanation as to why some glucose-limited oral streptococci continue to synthesize glycogen under these conditions, which might prevail in plaque.

AB  == selected reference and freshly isolated strains of streptococcus mitis (mitior) and streptococcus sanguis were assayed for cell-associated neuraminidase activity by their ability to hydrolyze [3h-] sialyllactitol. a cell-associated neuraminidase was detected with s. mitis and s. sanguis serotype ii (reclassified as s. mitis) but not with s. sanguis serotypes i and iii. neuraminidase activity  of s. mitis correlated with this organism's inability to hydrolyze arginine, aesculin, and few, if any, sugars. the findings indicate that the presence of cell-associated neuraminidase activity is useful for the taxonomic classification of s. mitis.

AB  == sixteen strains of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguis i and strep. sanguis ii were tested for cariogenic potential and in-vivo plaque-forming ability in a gnotobiotic wag/rij rat test system. all strains produced far less fissure plaque in vivo than strains of streptococcus milleri or streptococcus mutans. there was less extracellular matrix around cells of strep. mitis or strep. sanguis than around strep. mutans, in the fissures. dense sheets of cells  were observed only with strep. mutans. some localized colonization of exposed smooth surfaces occurred with most strains. strep. mitis produced no caries in three tests, low-caries scores in two tests and high-caries scores in one test. a single strain of strep. mitis produced a highly-cariogenic variant able to ferment raffinose. strep. sanguis i induced low-levels of caries in 12 tests; one test of nctc 7865 produced moderate levels of caries, and another test of 311 produced no caries. strep. sanguis 311 was dextran-negative. strep. sanguis ii strains induced no caries in three tests, low caries scores in six tests and moderate levels of caries with strep. sanguis 402. no strain of strep. mitis or strep. sanguis was able to induce smooth-surface lesions.

AB  == sugar transport and glycolysis in streptococcus sanguis nctc 7865, streptococcus  mitis atcc 903, streptococcus salivarius nctc 8606 and several strains of streptococcus mutans were investigated by following the rate of acid production by washed bacteria at a constant ph of 7.0. the phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system (pts) was inhibited by low concentrations of chlorhexidine. when this pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine was added to cells washed and re-suspended in kcl, glucose uptake and glycolysis continued at a greatly-reduced rate. chlorhexidine abolished glucose and sucrose uptake and metabolism in bacteria washed and incubated in saline. the na+-inhibition was reproduced in kcl-washed bacteria using the cyclic peptide ionophores, valinomycin and gramicidin, to dissipate k+ and h+ gradients  across the cell membrane. glucose metabolism by strep. mutans b13 was more resistant to chlorhexidine than that of strep. mutans nctc 10449 or strep. sanguis but was more sensitive to the ionophores. valinomycin had a greater inhibitory effect on strain b13 than the other two. that ion gradients are important in the chlorhexidine-resistant glucose-uptake mechanism was confirmed using the classical uncoupling agents, carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone, 2,4-dinitrophenol and kscn. glucose metabolism was inhibited in the presence of both the uncouplers and the pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine and significant inhibition was also observed in the absence of the pts inhibitor. lactate or the atpase inhibitor, dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (dccd), had similar inhibitory effects on the non-pts uptake system.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == comparative hydrophobicities of oral bacteria and their adherence to salivary pellicles.
AB  == oral bacteria were found to differ in their surface hydrophobicities as determined by their ability to adsorb to hexadecane. strains of actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis, and bacteroides gingivalis proved highly hydrophobic. strains of b. intermedius, s. salivarius, s. mutans, and b. melaninogenicus were less hydrophobic, whereas strains of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were hydrophilic. an overall correlation was noted between the adsorption of bacteria to hexadecane and their numbers which attached to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite surfaces. this suggests that hydrophobic bonding plays an important role in this process. pellicles prepared from saliva which had been extracted with chloroform-methanol  to remove lipids adsorbed comparable numbers of s. sanguis and a. viscosus and increased numbers of s. mutans. analyses of adsorption isotherms indicated that pellicles formed from lipid-depleted saliva contained increased numbers of binding sites for the s. mutans strains studied, and this likely accounts for their enhanced adsorption. absorption of saliva with 10% octyl or phenyl sepharose reduced the protein content of saliva by almost half, but the numbers of bacteria which attached to pellicles prepared from such absorbed saliva were similar to or higher than those which attached to control pellicles. these observations suggest that saliva does not contain unique highly hydrophobic salivary macromolecules which serve as essential pellicle receptors for the bacteria studied. the data obtained are consistent with the view that hydrophobic bonding together with interactions between complementary molecules are involved in bacterial attachment to salivary pellicles on teeth.

AB  == fresh oral isolates from human dental plaque were selected on the basis of their  spherical morphology. in a double-blind experiment, their species identity and ability to coaggregate with human oral actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii were determined. of the 110 isolates characterized, 30 were identified as either streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus-constellatus, or veillonella parvula; none of these coaggregated with the actinomycetes. the remaining 80 isolates were identified as streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mg-intermedius, or streptococcus morbillorum. of these 49 isolates (61%) coaggregated with actinomycetes, and nearly 90% (43 of 49 isolates) exhibited lactose-inhibitable coaggregations. compared with previously  characterized coaggregation properties determined with stock culture strains of streptococci, 82% of the fresh isolates exhibited identical coaggregations. the other 18% made up a new coaggregation group that possessed a related lactose-inhibitable coaggregation pattern. thus, most fresh isolates that coaggregated exhibited lactose-inhibitable coaggregations with human oral actinomycetes. it is suggested that these coaggregations are mediated by a network of lectin-carbohydrate interactions similar to those already characterized in previous studies with stock cultures of actinomycetes and streptococci.

TI  == production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  == staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. these strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of staphylococcus aureus fda209p. the frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. strain iys2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. iys2 was identified to be s. aureus, based on its biological properties. the bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. the isoelectric point was 10.0. in amino acid  composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. the bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. the bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. an analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that streptococcus salivarius, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium parvulum, and actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterionema matruchotii, and bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. the majority of s. aureus tested were susceptible, and all staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.

TI  == the clinical significance of streptococcal species isolated from cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == alpha-hemolytic (viridans) streptococci are often isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (csf); however, the significance of such isolates is poorly understood. in  order to clarify the clinical significance of isolating these organisms from csf, we did a retrospective analysis of 43 patients, from whom eight different species of alpha-hemolytic streptococci were recovered. eight patients (19%) had significant infections based on bacteriologic, laboratory, and clinical findings. significant infections were associated with s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. intermedius, s. faecalis, and s. bovis. thirty-five patient isolates (81%) from csf were considered as contaminants, with s. mitis being the most frequently isolated organism (49%). direct gram stain of csf sediment, csf glucose concentration, and csf cell differential were clearly abnormal in most patients with significant infections, in contrast to patients with streptococci isolated as contaminants. cultures of the lumbar puncture skin site yielded streptococci and other bacteria, suggesting a possible reservoir for contaminants.

TI  == penicillin therapy of experimental endocarditis induced by tolerant streptococcus sanguis and nontolerant streptococcus mitis.
AB  == the response of tolerant streptococcus sanguis and nontolerant streptococcus mitis infections to penicillin therapy was compared in the rabbit model of endocarditis. the minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of penicillin were 0.1 and 0.1 mug/ml, respectively, for s. mitis and 0.05 and 6.2 mug/ml, respectively, for s. sanguis. time-kill studies done in vitro with penicillin concentrations of 2 and 20 mug/ml demonstrated minimal killing of the  tolerant strain, with a 3 log difference in survival between the two strains after 24 and 48 h. both strains produced endocarditis with comparable bacterial densities on the valvular vegetations. rabbits were treated with procaine penicillin g in two dosage regimens, 80,000 or 5,000 u/kg given every 8 h. there  was no difference between bacterial densities in valvular vegetations removed from rabbits infected with either strain after 2, 4, or 6 days of treatment with  the high-dose regimen (serum penicillin concentration at 0.5 h, 9.4 mug/ml), despite the fact that serum bactericidal activity against the tolerant strain at  0.5 h was minimal. with the low-dose penicillin regimen (serum concentration at 0.5 h, 2.5 mug/ml), therapy was significantly less effective in the tolerant group only after 6 days of treatment. similar results were obtained when penicillin was administered in low and high doses to prevent infection. in this animal model of infection, penicillin tolerance was associated with a diminished  response to penicillin therapy only when the dose was severely restricted. in the high-dose regimen, there was no difference in the response to penicillin therapy  between animals infected with either strain, despite the presence of only minimal serum bactericidal activity in the rabbits infected with the tolerant strain.

TI  == inhibition by the antimicrobial agent chlorhexidine of acid production and sugar  transport in oral streptococcal bacteria.
AB  == oral streptococci transport sugars via the phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase (pep-pts) system. in a specific assay of this system, low concentrations of chlorhexidine abolished the activity of the glucose and sucrose pts in batch-grown cells of streptococcus mutans ingbritt and b13, strep. sanguis nctc 7865, strep. mitis atcc 903, strep. milleri nctc 10709 and strep. salivarius nctc 8606. intact cells and cells made permeable to the assay reagents with toluene were used. toluenized cells were more sensitive to chlorhexidine than intact cells (0.09 and 0.25 mm, respectively). this pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine reduced acid production from glucose in ph fall experiments to values higher than are obtained solely from endogenous metabolism. the effect of  chlorhexidine on rates of acid production was determined at ph 7.0 using cells washed with either 135 mm nacl or 135 mm kcl. in general, faster rates of acid production from the metabolism of glucose and sucrose were obtained with potassium-treated cells. addition of the pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine markedly reduced or totally abolished acid production by nacl-treated cells; a greater residual-activity was detected in the same cells washed with kcl (except with strep. mutans b13 and strep. mitis atcc 903). the pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine had little or no effect on the viability of cells. the results confirm the existence of sugar uptake systems in  oral streptococci additional to the pts and provide an explanation for the additive anti-caries effect of mouth-rinses containing both fluoride and chlorhexidine.

TI  == inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis by soluble bacterial products.
AB  == bacterial-neutrophil interactions may be critical determinants of virulence in periodontal diseases. this study was undertaken to examine the ability of major bacterial species from the human oral cavity to inhibit (1) peripheral blood neutrophil chemotaxis, (2) chemotactic formylmethionyl peptide binding, and (3) phagocytosis. included were cultured supernatants and sonic extracts obtained from strains of capnocytophaga, bacteroides gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum,  bacteroides asaccharolyticus, capnocytophaga species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, neisseria, actinomyces viscosus, bacterionema matruchotii, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguis. chemotaxis  was measured using boyden chambers; phagocytosis was determined using staphylococcus aureus as the indicator organism and radioactive chemotactic peptide binding was assessed by a rapid filtration assay. none of the test organisms were cytotoxic to neutrophils or inhibited neutrophil phagocytosis. capnocytophaga species., bacteroides species., a. actinomycetemcomitans, and f. nucleatum produced factors which specifically inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis. activity was lost after dialysis. extracts of bacteroides species, a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum, which were not chemotactic by themselves, inhibited binding of chemotactic peptide suggesting that in vitro chemotaxis inhibition was mediated by nonchemotactic components that compete for the chemotactic factor receptor on the neutrophil. the exception was capnocytophaga which appeared to inhibit chemotaxis by inhibition of a post-binding event. such  chemotactic inhibitors from periodontopathic organisms that inhibit neutrophil function may be important determinants of virulence.

TI  == adsorption of lysozyme from human whole saliva by streptococcus sanguis 903 and other oral microorganisms.
AB  == several strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, and actinomyces naeslundii plus fresh isolates of streptococcus salivarius were surveyed for their abilities to deplete lysozyme from human-whole-saliva supernatant. bacteria were incubated in saliva for 60 min at 37 degrees c and then removed by centrifugation, and the recovered supernatant solutions were assayed for lysozyme activity by using whole cells of micrococcus  lysodeikticus as the substrate. mean lysozyme depletions by bacterial strains varied over a wide (eightfold) range. the greatest mean depletion of lysozyme (60 to 70%) was observed with s. sanguis (biotype i), serotype b of s. mutans, and the fresh s. salivarius isolates. the lowest mean depletion was noted with s. mitis (15%) and biotype ii s. sanguis (ca. 30%). the remaining species and strains exhibited an intermediate degree of depletion. in studies with s. sanguis 903, lysozyme was depleted by normal or heated (90 degrees c, 30 min) bacteria and could be recovered from the organism. furthermore, under appropriate conditions, lysozyme depletion by cells at 0 and 37 degrees c was very similar. on the basis of these observations, we concluded that depletion was due to the adsorption of lysozyme by the organism. with s. sanguis 903, lysozyme adsorption  depended on the concentration of bacteria, time of incubation, and the ionic strength of the medium. the extent of adsorption, however, was independent of ph's of 3.9 to 8.3. when a low concentration of s. sanguis 903 was used, lysozyme adsorption reached saturation (4 mug of adsorbed lysozyme per 10(7) cells) at 20  mug of lysozyme added per ml. salivary lysozyme adsorption by several other oral  microorganisms (a. viscosus wvu 626 and wvu 627, s. sanguis 73x11, s. mutans bht, and s. salivarius ng) was similar to that of s. sanguis 903 in sensitivity to ionic strength. lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis 903 from either a buffer solution or a saliva supernatant was more sensitive to ionic strength at 0 than at 37 degrees c. on the basis of results from experiments in saliva versus buffer, we concluded that saliva had no major effect on the extent of lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis 903 other than providing a source of ionic strength. a comparison of ph and ionic strength effects on lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis  903 with literature reports of lysozyme lysis of whole cells and hydrolysis of cell walls, peptidoglycan, and (glcnac)(4) suggested that adsorption by s. sanguis 903 was more dependent on electrostatic interactions than was lysozyme catalysis. the possibility is discussed that anionic bacterial surface components mediate lysozyme adsorption and temper the potential effects of lysozyme on the microorganisms.

TI  == enzymatic modification of bacterial receptors on saliva-treated hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  == certain properties of experimental pellicles formed by the adsorption of salivary components on hydroxyapatite surfaces change over time. to determine whether enzymes likely to be present in the oral environment could induce such changes, pellicles were treated with saliva which had been incubated for 18 h at 35 degrees c to promote the elaboration of microbial enzymes. this treatment markedly reduced the numbers of streptococcus mutans mt3 and jbp and s. sanguis fc-1 and c5 cells which attached, but it had little or no effect on the attachment of s. mitis re7, actinomyces viscosus ly7 and ck-8, bacteroides gingivalis 381, or b. melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius 581. heating the incubated saliva at 60 degrees c for 30 min partially reduced its pellicle-modifying activity, whereas heating at 80 degrees c for 30 min or 100 degrees c for 15 min completely eliminated such activity. this indicated that the saliva contained heat-labile substances, presumably enzymes, which could affect the pellicle receptors involved in the attachment of s. mutans and s. sanguis. treatment of saliva-treated hydroxyapatite with commercially obtained enzyme preparations also affected bacterial attachment. thus, treatment with galactose oxidase reduced the numbers of the s. mutans strains which attached, whereas treatment with neuraminidase reduced the adsorption of s. sanguis fc-1 but not that of s. sanguis c5. treatment with beta-glucosidase preparations derived from  almonds significantly reduced the attachment of all of the streptococcal strains  studied, but, when subjected to isoelectric fractionation, the adherence-inhibiting activity did not correlate directly with beta-glucosidase activity. treatment of the pellicles with trypsin or eight other glycosidases did not affect streptococcal attachment. exposure of the enzymatically modified pellicles to fresh saliva did not restore the streptococcal receptors. collectively, the data suggest that some bacterial receptors in the pellicle coating of teeth can be modified by enzymes likely to be present in the oral environment, and these interactions may affect oral bacterial ecology.

TI  == characteristic differences between saliva-dependent aggregation and adhesion of streptococci.
AB  == comparison of saliva-mediated aggregation of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus mutans and adhesion of these organisms to saliva-coated  hydroxyapatite showed that there was no relationship between these two activities. adsorption of salivary aggregating activity to bacteria appears to have little effect on the ability of the residual saliva to support adherence; conversely, adsorption of salivary adherence factors to hydroxyapatite does not affect aggregation. although heating saliva significantly reduces bacterial aggregation, it has little or no effect on adherence. a comparison of aggregation and adhesion with serial dilutions of saliva demonstrated that adhesion could still be detected at 100 to 500-fold-lower concentrations of salivary protein that bacterial aggregation. these findings support the concept that aggregation and adherence involve two distinct mechanisms of microbial clearance in the oral  cavity.

TI  == effect of bacterial aggregation on the adherence of oral streptococci to hydroxyapatite.
AB  == several in vitro assay systems to measure the adherence of human dental plaque bacteria to solid surfaces such as teeth, glass, and hydroxyapatite have been published. in many studies a variety of macromolecular solutes have been used to  study the adherence process. often these solutes are able to aggregate the test bacterial and thus may alter the outcome of adherence experiments. in this study, the effects of the aggregation of streptococcus sanguis on adherence to spheroidal hydroxyapatite is described. adherence of preformed aggregates and of  bacteria which were aggregating during the adherence reaction was examined. bacteria were aggregated with whole saliva, concanavalin a, and wheat germ lectin. further effects of the coaggregation of s. mitis and actinomyces viscosus to saliva-coated spheroidal hydroxyapatite are presented. these studies suggest that formation of large aggregates resulted in a decrease in the numbers of organisms which adhered. in contrast, the formation of small aggregates actually  increased the numbers of bacteria that adhered. all increases in adherent bacteria occurred at low concentrations of aggregating substance in which visible bacterial aggregation was not evident. the data indicate that adequate dose-response experiments must be performed to ensure that solutes used as probes to study adherence mechanisms do not affect the adherence simply as a result of aggregation of the test microorganisms.

TI  == effect of human saliva on glucose uptake by streptococcus mutans and other oral microorganisms.
AB  == we examined the effects of human whole salivary supernatant and parotid fluid on  glucose uptake by streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. the following three effects of saliva were observed: (i) inhibition of glucose uptake (s. mutans, s. sanguis), (ii) promotion of a transient, rapid (0 to 30 s) burst of glucose uptake (s. mutans, s. sanguis), and (iii) enhancement of glucose uptake (s. mitis, a. viscosus, s. aureus, e. coli). we observed no differences between the effects of whole salivary supernatant and the effects of parotid fluid. heat treatment (80 degrees c, 10 min) of saliva or the addition of dithiothreitol abolished inhibition of glucose uptake. supplementation of saliva  with h(2)o(2) potentiated inhibition of glucose uptake. s. mitis and a. viscosus, which were stimulated by saliva alone, were inhibited by h(2)o(2)-supplemented saliva; 50% inhibition of glucose uptake by s. mutans and s. mitis required ca. 10 mum h(2)o(2) in 50% (vol/vol) saliva. loss of the inhibitory action of saliva  occurred at about 5% (vol/vol) saliva. supplementation of saliva dilutions with scn(-) and h(2)o(2) extended the inhibitory activity to solutions containing ca.  0.2% (vol/vol) saliva. we suggest that the salivary lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system is responsible for the inhibitory activity of saliva reported here. furthermore, we concluded that lactoperoxidase and scn(-) are present in saliva specimens in concentrations that exceed minimal inhibitory levels by factors of ca. 500 and 10 to 20, respectively. the resistance of a. viscosus, s. aureus, and e. coli to the inhibitory potential of  saliva alone was probably due to the production of catalase by these organisms. the resistance of s. mitis may have been due to special effects of saliva on h(2)o(2) accumulation by this organism compared with s. mutans and s. sanguis. the basis of saliva-dependent enhancement of glucose uptake and the basis of promotion of a transient, rapid burst of glucose uptake are unknown. the role of  the salivary lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system in the oral microbial ecosystem is discussed.

TI  == interaction of parotid saliva basic glycoprotein with streptococcus sanguis atcc  10557.
AB  == it is postulated that an initial step in dental plaque formation is the adherence of oral bacteria to the salivary pellicle. recently, we have found that a proline-rich and basic glycoprotein (mgp) from human parotid saliva, which is successfully purified by concanavalin a-sepharose affinity chromatography, binds  to some oral streptococci such as s. mitis and s. sanguis. this paper deals with  some inhibitors which affect the binding of the mgp to s. sanguis atcc 10557. the assay for the binding ability of the radioactive mgp to the bacterial cells was performed by incubation of the reaction mixture containing 10 microgram of [3h]mgp (6000 dpm) and about 4.5 mg of bacterial cells (dry weight) in 0.5 ml of  0.05 m tris-hcl buffer containing 0.05 m nacl, ph 8.0 with a final volume of 0.51 ml. after 1 hour standing at 4 degrees c, the cells were washed five times with the same buffer. the resulting sediment was solubilized in 0.5 ml of ncs tissue solubilizer and the radioactivity was measured. the binding of the radioactive mgp to bacterial cells was specifically inhibited by galactose, lactose and n-acetyllactosamine. applications of heat and trypsin on the cell surface, strikingly reduced the binding ability. these findings strongly suggested that a  lectin-like substance may be present on the bacterial cell surface.

AB  == the effects of several microbial residents of human oral cavities on the attachment of actinomyces viscosus t14v to tooth surfaces were assessed by using  the saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha) in vitro system. attachment to sha by a. viscosus t14v was not inhibited in the presence of streptococcus mutans gs5, either in the presence or absence of sucrose. precoating sha beads with s. mutans in the presence of sucrose also did not retard strain t14v attachment. however, the presence of streptococcus sanguis m5 during strain t14v attachment markedly inhibited the interaction of a. viscosus t14v with sha, whereas another s. sanguis strain, strain g9b, produced relatively weak inhibition. the inhibitory effect of s. sanguis m5 appeared to result from the direct interaction of this organism with a. viscosus t14v. conversely, the presence of strain t14v markedly  increased the attachment of s. sanguis m5 to sha while partially inhibiting the attachment of s. sanguis g9b. moreover, sha beads precoated with a. viscosus t14v bound much higher levels of s. sanguis m5 relative to uncoated sha, whereas s. sanguis g9b attachment was only weakly inhibited. it was also observed that sha beads precoated with either s. sanguis m5 or g9b inhibited subsequent attachment  by strain t14v. these results suggest the possibility that the attachment sites for both s. sanguis strains partially overlap those for a. viscosus t14v. streptococcus mitis weakly inhibited attachment of strain t14v to sha, and both streptococcus salivarius and lactobacillus casei had little effect on attachment. in addition, both a radioisotope attachment assay and fluorescent microscopy demonstrated no significant attachment of a. viscosus t14v to human epithelial cells.

AB  == streptococci isolated from "corn cob" configurations of human dental plaque possess a polar fibrillar tuft extending 100 to 150 nm from one pole of the cell. the two strains studied were physiologically related to the streptococcus sanguis-streptococcus mitior group and were most similar to streptococcus mitis atcc 903. the corn cob streptococci were serologically related to s. sanguis serotype 1. the polar tuft contained at least two antigenically distinct components, one serologically related to the glycerol phosphate backbone of teichoic acid. the other was an electrophoretically slow-moving antigen similar to a component of s. mitis atcc 903. it is suggested that the corn cob streptococci in vivo adhere to bacterionema matruchotii by means of the polar tuft.

TI  == in vitro studies of dental plaque formation: adsorption of oral streptococci to hydroxyaptite.
AB  == a mixture of saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads and radioactively labeled bacteria has been employed as an in vitro model for the initial phase of dental plaque formation. adsorption in this model can be expressed by the langmuir adsorption isotherm, and the adherence of oral streptococci can be expressed as the product of the affinity constant (ka) and the number of binding sites (n), kan. with this approach, streptococcus sanguis serotype 1 strains adhered better  (kan = [187 +/- 72] x 10(-2)) than serotype 2 strains (kan = [97 +/- 84] x 10(-2)); a t test showed this difference to be statistically significant to the 99.99% confidence level. strains of s. mitis, s. mutans, and s. salivarius did not appear to adhere as well. to analyze the bacterial receptors involved in adherence, competition studies in which increasing quantities of unlabeled bacteria were added to a fixed quantity (4 x 10(9) cells per ml) of 3h-labeled serotype 1, reference strain s. sanguis g9b, were performed. these studies indicated that the type 1 strains competed for the same, or closely related, binding sites. competition studies using serotype 2 s. sanguis strains resulted in an increased binding of reference strain g9b to hydroxyapatite. scanning electron microscopy indicated this effect was due to the formation of localized aggregations of bacteria, presumably representing the two bacterial types. the results of competition studies with s. mitis were variable, and several strains of other oral bacteria showed little or no competition.

TI  == specificity of coaggregation reactions between human oral streptococci and strains of actinomyces viscosus or actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == coaggregation reactions between actinomycete and streptococcal cells occurred frequently when human strains of actinomyces viscosus or a. naeslundii were mixed with human isolates of streptococcus sanguis or s. mitis, but were infrequent with other oral actinomycetes and streptococci. two groups of actinomycetes and four groups of streptococci were defined by the patterns of their coaggregation reactions and by the ability of beta-linked galactosides (i.e., lactose) to reverse these reactions. coaggregations occurred by one of the following three kinds to cell-cell interactions: (i) coaggregation that was blocked by heating the streptococcus but not the actinomycete and was not reversed by lactose; (ii)  coaggregation that was blocked by heating the actinomycete but not the streptococcus and was reversed by lactose; and (iii) coaggregation that was blocked only by heating both cell types. the latter reaction was a combination of the first two since lactose reversed coaggregation between heated streptococci and unheated actinomycetes but did not reverse coaggregations between unheated streptococci and heated actinomycetes. cells that could be heat inactivated also  were inactivated by amino group acetylation or protease digestion, whereas cells  that were unaffected by heat were not inactivated by these treatments. coaggregation reactions of each kind were ca2+ dependent and insensitive to dextranase treatment. these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that human strains of a. viscosus and a. naeslundii coaggregate with strains of s. sanguis and s. mitis by a system of specific cell surface interactions between protein or glycoprotein receptors on one cell type and carbohydrates on the other type.

TI  == selective binding of blood group-reactive salivary mucins by streptococcus mutans and other oral organisms.
AB  == strains of streptococcus mutans of four genetic groups and five serotypes, and strains of s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and a. viscosus, were found to bind blood group-reactive (bgr) mucin isolated from whole human saliva. the bacteria studied bound mucins with blood type a or b reactivity to a similar extent, suggesting that the carbohydrate moieties responsible for the a and b antigenic determinants were not involved. the organisms studied appeared to bind different fractions of bgr mucin molecules because preparations  absorbed with cells of a given oral species no longer contained bgr molecules which bound to homologous organisms but still possessed bgr components which bound to varying degrees to other bacteria. differences were even noted among s.  mutans strains belonging to different genetic groups and serological types. immunoglobulins could not be detected in the mucin preparations, and addition of  anti-human immunoglobulin a (iga), igg, or igm serum to reaction mixtures did not affect binding. mucin pretreated with periodate or iodoacetate no longer bound to s. mutans h12 cells, suggesting that carbohydrate moieties and sulfhydryl groups  played an essential role. active cell metabolism was not required for bgr mucin binding; however, pretreatment of h12 cells with periodate or heat (100 degrees c for 15 min) reduced binding. mucin labeled with [(14)c]phenyl isothiocyanate appeared to bind to s. mutans h12 cells comparably to untreated mucin; the binding also appeared to be specific because less than 15% of the labeled material became bound when incubated with an excess of streptococci. binding of [(14)c]phenyl isothiocyanate-labeled mucin was not affected by neutral sugars tested or by preparations of c antigen, glycerol teichoic acid, dextran, or crude glucosyltransferase. however, binding was inhibited by several amines. bgr salivary mucins are present in the acquired pellicle covering teeth; the ability  of bacteria to selectively bind such components suggest that they may serve as receptor molecules involved in the attachment of bacteria to teeth.

TI  == microbiota of gingivitis in man.
AB  == a study on the predominant cultivable microorganisms inhabiting gingival crevices affected with a chronic gingivitis was carried out using the roll tube culture technique. samples were obtained from nine individuals 25--42 years of age. gram-positive rods make up 29.1% of the isolates and included mainly actinomyces  naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, and actinomyces viscosus. streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis together made up 26.8% of the cultivable organisms. peptostreptococcus averaged 3.0% of the organisms recovered. gram-negative anaerobic rods constituted 25.0% of the total isolates with fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides melaninogenicus ss. intermedius. bacteriodes ochraceus, other bacteroides species, selenomonas sputigena, and campylobacter sputorum as the most predominant isolates. haemophilus parainfluenzae averaged about 14% and  veillonella species 4.3% of the cultivable microflora. the data presented indicate that the subgingival microflora of a chronic gingivitis differs from those of healthy periodontium and advanced adult and juvenile periodontis. this might suggest that different infectious processes may be operative in various clinical entities of periodontal disease.

TI  == comparative estimates of bacterial affinities and adsorption sites on hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  == the adsorption of strains of prominent oral bacteria to hydroxyapatite (ha) surfaces was studied by use of an adsorption model based on the langmuir adsorption isotherm; this permitted comparative estimates of the number of adsorption sites and the strength of the adsorption bonds on untreated and salivatreated ha surfaces for strain of streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. mitis, actinomyces viscosus, and a. naeslundii. the experimental data closely followed the adsorption model as judged by the high correlation coefficients obtained for all strains studied. adsorption to untreated ha was similar for strains of the six species studied, suggesting that a common adsorption mechanism, possibly ca(2+) bridging, may exist for attachment to ha. more complex interactions appeared to be involved in bacterial adsorption to saliva-treated ha since adsorption of the strains tested at unsaturating cell concentrations varied more than 30-fold. this indicates that adsorbed salivary components on ha surfaces impart a higher order of specificity for subsequent bacterial adsorption. fewer cells of strains of s. mutans, s. salivarius, and a.  naeslundii adsorbed to saliva-treated ha than to untreated ha because adsorbed salivary components presented fewer adsorption sites. substantially higher numbers of cells of strains of s. sanguis, s. mitis, and a. viscosus adsorbed to  saliva-treated ha because the film of adsorbed salivary components increased the  number of adsorption sites for these strains. the affinity constants for all but  one strain studied were lower on saliva-treated ha than on untreated ha. the number of bacterial cells which adsorbed to saliva-treated ha more closely related to the number of available binding sites than to the strength of their adsorption bonds when tested at an initial concentration of 2 x 10(7) organisms/ml. although some differences were observed in the adsorption of strains of s. mutans representative of five serological groups, the numbers which attached to saliva-treated ha did not vary widely; this suggests that factors other than their ability to attach to a pellicle-covered ha surface may be responsible for their varying geographic distribution in human populations.

TI  == attachment of bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. asaccharolyticus to oral surfaces and its possible role in colonization of the mouth and of periodontal pockets.
AB  == this investigation examined the ability of cells of bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. asaccharolyticus 381 to adhere to surfaces that might be important for its initial colonization of the mouth and its subsequent colonization in periodontal  pockets. of 48 asaccharolytic strains of b. melaninogenicus, 47 agglutinated human erythrocytes, whereas none of 20 fermentative strains, which included reference cultures of the subspecies intermedius and melaninogenicus, were active. electron microscopy indicated that both asaccharolytic and fermentative strains possessed pili; hence, the presence of pili did not correlate with the hemagglutinating activities of b. melaninogenicus strains. both asaccharolytic and fermentative b. melaninogenicus strains suspended in phosphate-buffered saline adhered in high numbers to buccal epithelial cells and to the surfaces of  several gram-positive bacteria tested, including actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, a. israelii, streptococcus sanguis, and s. mitis. b. melaninogenicus  subsp. asaccharolyticus 381 also attached, but in comparatively low numbers, to untreated and to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite. addition of clarified whole saliva to suspensions of strain 381 almost completely eliminated adherence to buccal epithelial cells and to hydroxyapatite surfaces, but saliva had no detectable effect on attachment to gram-positive plaque bacteria. both fermentative and nonfermentative strains of b. melaninogenicus also attached in high numbers to crevicular epithelial cells derived from human periodontal pockets, but normal human serum strongly inhibited attachment. serum also inhibited attachment of strain 381 to saliva- and serum-treated hydroxyapatite, but it had little effect upon attachment to gram-positive bacteria. these observations suggested that salivary and serum components would strongly inhibit  the attachment of b. melaninogenicus cells to several oral surfaces, but not to the surfaces of certain gram-positive bacteria commonly present in human dental plaque. this was confirmed by an in vivo experiment in which streptomycin-labeled cells of b. melaninogenicus 381-r were introduced into the mouths of two volunteers. after 10 min, several hundred-fold higher numbers of the organism were recovered from preformed bacterial plaque present on teeth than from clean tooth surfaces or from the buccal mucosa and tongue dorsum. high numbers of b. melaninogenicus cells were also recovered from preformed plaque after 150 min, but virtually no cells of the organism were recovered from the other surfaces studied. these data suggest that the presence of dental plaque containing actinomyces and other gram-positive bacteria may be essential for the attachment  and colonization of b. melaninogenicus cells after their initial introduction into the mouth. similarly, the presence of subgingival plaque containing gram-positive bacteria may be necessary for its secondary colonization in periodontal pockets.

TI  == survival of bacteria from human dental plaque under various transport conditions.
AB  == the effects of transport media, temperature, and anaerobiosis on the survival of  bacteria from human supragingival dental plaque were studied. individual samples  were obtained by passing sterile, unwaxed dental floss through the interproximal  spaces. the plaque-bearing portion of floss was immediately placed in vials containing reduced transport fluid, viability-preserving microbistatic medium, or reduced salt solution transport fluid. plaque samples were dispersed by ultrasonic oscillation, serially diluted, and plated in duplicate on mm10-sucrose-blood agar, mitis salivarius bacitracin agar, and rogosa tomato juice agar. initial viable counts (time 0) were compared with viable count determinations after 48- and 72-h storage. quantitative recovery (>30%) of various groups of oral bacteria was accomplished from both reduced transport fluid and viability-preserving microbistatic medium after 48- and 72-h storage. storage of dental plaque in reduced salt solution proved unsatisfactory for most  bacteria (less than 10% survival). since growth of some bacteria may occur in viability-preserving microbistatic medium and the charcoal present interferes with colonly enumeration on low-dilution plates, we found reduced transport fluid to be the most suitable medium for transport and recovery of bacteria from supragingival dental plaque. subzero storage (-196 and -40 degrees c) did not enhance the survival of bacteria from dental plaque; storage at moderate (5 and 20 degrees c) temperatures gave better recovery of viable bacteria. survival after anaerobic or aerobic storage was comparable for total colony-forming units; however, anaerobic storage enhanced survival of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus. since these organisms are specifically associated with dental caries, anaerobic techniques are preferred for caries activity testing of plaque.

AB  == sucrose metabolism by resting-cell suspensions of pure cultures of representative members of the predominant cultivable flora isolated from cariogenic and non-cariogenic dental plaque was investigated by means of radiochemical techniques. streptocococcus mutans utilized sucrose at a considerably faster rate than s. sanguis, s. mitis, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, or lactobacillus  casei, forming lactic acid, intracellular polysaccharide, insoluble extracellular glucan, and lactic acid from intracellular polysaccharide catabolism at faster rates than the other bacteria. the actinomyces formed more volatile acids than the streptococci, mostly acetic, and s. sanguis formed more soluble extracellular polysaccharide than the other bacteria. the metabolic activity of s. mutans resembled the pattern of sucrose metabolism of cariogenic plaque, whereas the metabolic activity of the actinomyces species, the predominant members of non-cariogenic plaque flora, resembled the sucrose metabolism of non-cariogenic plaques.

TI  == new method for the isolation of streptococcus mutans and its differentiation from other oral streptococci.
AB  == a new, improved agar medium for the isolation of streptococcus mutans, the etiological agent of dental caries, was developed. in contrast to mitis-salivarius agar, this medium not only recovers a greater number of s. mutans strains from most oral specimens but, because of its mannitol and sorbitol content, it also facilitates the differentiation of s. mutans from other oral streptococci, e.g., s. salivarius, s. mitis, and s. sanguis, which do not grow or produce scanty growth only after 10 days of incubation. the medium is easy to prepare because of its simple and unique composition, is characterized by the presence of an acid indicator, and can be utilized under aerobic and anaerobic conditions as well. the medium cannot be used to distinguish among the eight serotypes, a to g and sl-1, of s. mutans. mannitol-utilizing bacteria such as streptococci (e.g., s. faecalis) and other microorganisms (e.g., staphylococcus aureus) are able to grow on this medium and can be distinguished from s. mutans by their unique colony morphology.

AB  == morphological and physiological characteristics of 103 streptococcal isolates obtained from positive routine cultures of material from dental root canals at filling, were studied. the majority of the isolates were those which at a primary identification not fullfilled the criteria of enterococci, strep. sanguis, strep. mutans or strep. salivarius. only a few representative strains of the latter types were included in the study as a control of the method. the resemblance of the 103 isolates to 38 reference strains were assessed with numerical methods. the isolates formed 9 clusters with reference strains occurring in all but one. of the isolates which it was intended to identify and characterize with numerical taxonomic analysis, all but one joined one of 3 clusters and were identified as strep. milleri or strep. mitior (mitis). the most useful cultural characteristics to dfferentiate the two species were growth on the sulphonamide containing mc-agar and 7.5% bile blood agar by strep. milleri and production of hydrogen peroxide by strep. mitior. the characteristics of the strains in the nine 80-phenons are given in table 2. other characteristics that appeared to be of interest for differentiating strep. milleri from strep. mitior and these two species from other viridans streptococci are underlined in table 2. strep. milleri seems not earlier to have been reported to occur in infected root canals. the occurrence of strep. milleri is in agreement with the data given on serological groups found among streptococcal isolates from routine root canal cultures. little is known about the occurrence and distribution of strep. milleri in the human oral cavity, which therefore warrant further investigations.

TI  == streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus "mitis" as indicators of contamination of root canal cultures.
AB  == small samples were taken from the first drop of saliva entering an operation field for root canal treatment isolated by rubber dam, which was intentionally leaky. the samples were primarly cultured in tas- and blh-medium and on ms-agar aerobically. the culture media were inoculated directly and via transport medium  (vmg iii). the cultures were analysed for strep. salivarius, strep. sanguis and/or strep. "mitis" after subculture on ms-agar as soon as visible growth had appeared in the broth media and again after a further 2 days. the following observations were made: 1. strep. salivarius was almost regularly found in either or both of tas- and blh-medium at primary culture of the samples contaminated with saliva. the result was the same whether these broth media were inoculated directly or via vmg iii. 2. strep. salivarius was always found in mixed cultures  and was nearly always accompanied by strep. sanguis and/or strep. "mitis". 3. strep. salivarius as well as strep. sanguis survived two days after visible growth significantly more oftern in blh-medium than in tas-medium. the findings lend support to the hypothesis based on clinical studies that when present in root canal cultures strep. salivarius is ascribable to contamination with saliva.

TI  == efficiency of various growth media in recovering oral bacterial flora from human  dental plaque.
AB  == mm10 sucrose blood agar (mm10 sb agar), n(2)c agar, schaedler agar (sh agar), and mitis salivarius agar (ms agar) were tested for their ability to recover human dental plaque flora by a continuous anaerobic procedure and by a conventional anaerobic method. mm10 sb agar yielded higher recovery of bacteria from plaque samples as determined by the enumeration of colony-forming units (cfu). the cfu on n(2)c agar, sh agar, and ms agar were lower than mm10 sb agar when the continuous anaerobic procedure was used. the superior performance of mm10 sb agar was much more apparent when used for the cultivation of dental plaque by the conventional anaerobic method. under these conditions the counts were consistently higher on mm10 sb agar as compared to the other media tested. however, the differential counts of streptococcus sanguis and s. mutans from carious plaque samples were in general comparable on all culture media. deletion  of blood from mm10 sb agar did not lower counts. the elimination of dithiothreitol from this medium resulted in a significantly lower recovery of bacteria from the plaque samples when cultured by the conventional anaerobic method. the storage of mm10 sb agar for varying periods of time aerobic conditions did not seem to affect its performance. these findings suggest that mm10 sb agar is an ideal culture medium for the isolation, nonselective enumeration, and differential counts of bacteria present in normal and disease-associated plaques.

TI  == inhibition of enzymes by human salivary immunoglobulin a.
AB  == human whole saliva inhibited bacterial neuraminidases and the inhibition was found to reside in the salivary iga fraction. further, salivary immunoglobulin (ig)a inhibited various bacterial enzymes and toxins: neuraminidases from streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguis, and clostridium perfringens, hyaluronidase and chondroitin sulfatase from oral bacteria, diphtheria toxin, and streptolysin o. the inhibitory activity of salivary iga did not correlate with that of serum on the basis of minimum inhibitory dose. a small amount of salivary iga was required to inhibit oral bacterial neuraminidases, whereas a large amount was required to inhibit other bacterial neuraminidase. therefore, it is concluded that the absence of neuraminidase activity of oral bacteria in whole saliva may be due to specific inhibition by salivary iga.

TI  == saliva-induced aggregation of oral streptococci.
AB  == cells of several species of oral microorganisms have been shown, in earlier studies, to be aggregated by saliva. in the present study some of the basic properties of the aggregation system are examined. the observation is made that the saliva-induced aggregates of streptococcus sanguis and s. mitis can be dissociated to stable particles which consist of about 100 cells and have a median diameter of about 4.5 mum. it is proposed that these are subunits, or core aggregates, of the large primary aggregates. counts of the core aggregates can be taken as a precise and accurate measure of aggregation. experiments based on this procedure show that the aggregation of s. sanguis is maximal at 10 c and at 1 meq of ca(2+) ions per liter and is not affected by a change in ph between 3.9 and 8.7 or by a change in the phase of growth of the microorganisms. core aggregates  diminish in number with prolonged incubation, suggesting that the aggregating factors break down with time. formalinized cells yield stable aggregates. however, with formalinized cell aggregation is maximal between 20 and 30 c and proceeds in the absence of calcium ions. evidence is presented that whole saliva  contains separate aggregating factors for s. sanguis and s. mitis. the factors differ in their affinity for intact cells and for hydroxyapatite and differ in their stability to dialysis. these findings suggest that many different aggregating factors exist in saliva, each of which may be capable of interacting  with cells of one or several bacterial species.
