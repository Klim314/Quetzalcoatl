TI  == full-length structure of the major autolysin lyta.
AB  == lyta is responsible for the autolysis of many streptococcus species, including pathogens such as s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae and s. mitis. however, how this major autolysin achieves full activity remains unknown. here, the full-length structure of the s. pneumoniae lyta dimer is reported at 2.1 a resolution. each subunit has an n-terminal amidase domain and a c-terminal choline-binding domain consisting of six choline-binding repeats, which form five canonical and one single-layered choline-binding sites. site-directed mutageneses combined with enzymatic activity assays indicate that dimerization and binding to choline are two independent requirements for the autolytic activity of lyta in vivo. altogether, it is suggested that dimerization and full occupancy of all choline-binding sites through binding to choline-containing ta chains enable lyta to adopt a fully active conformation which allows the amidase domain to cleave two lactyl-amide bonds located about 103 a apart on the peptidoglycan.

TI  == antibacterial effects of traditional chinese medicine monomers against streptococcus pneumoniae via inhibiting pneumococcal histidine kinase (vick).
AB  == two-component systems (tcss) have the potential to be an effective target of the  antimicrobials, and thus received much attention in recent years. vick/vicr is one of tcss in streptococcus pneumoniae (s. pneumoniae), which is essential for pneumococcal survival. we have previously obtained several traditional chinese medicine monomers using a computer-based screening. in this study, either alone or in combination with penicillin, their antimicrobial activities were evaluated  based on in vivo and in vitro assays. the results showed that the mics of 5'-(methylthio)-5'-deoxyadenosine, octanal 2, 4-dinitrophenylhydrazone, deoxyshikonin, kavahin, and dodecyl gallate against s. pneumoniae were 37.1, 38.5, 17, 68.5, and 21 mug/ml, respectively. time-killing assays showed that these compounds elicited bactericidal effects against s. pneumoniae d39 strain, which led to a 6-log reduction in cfu after exposure to compounds at four times of the mic for 24 h. the five compounds inhibited the growth of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans or streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, meanwhile, deoxyshikonin and dodecyl gallate displayed strong inhibitory activities against staphylococcus aureus. these compounds showed no obvious cytotoxicity effects on vero cells. survival time of the mice infected by s. pneumoniae strains was prolonged by the treatment with the compounds. importantly, all of the five compounds exerted antimicrobial effects against multidrug-resistant clinical strains of s. pneumoniae. moreover, even at sub-mic  concentration, they inhibited cell division and biofilm formation. the five compounds all have enhancement effect on penicillin. deoxyshikonin and dodecyl gallate showed significantly synergic antimicrobial activity with penicillin in vivo and in vitro, and effectively reduced nasopharyngeal and lung colonization caused by different penicillin-resistant pneumococcal serotypes. in addition, the two compounds also showed synergic antimicrobial activity with erythromycin and tetracycline. taken together, our results suggest that these novel vick inhibitors may be promising compounds against the pneumococcus, including penicillin-resistant strains.

TI  == use of maldi biotyper plus clinprotools mass spectra analysis for correct identification of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis/oralis.
AB  == background: differentiation of streptococcus pneumoniae from other viridans group streptococci is well known to be challenging in clinical laboratories. matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof  ms) had been reported to be a good alternative for streptococcus species level identification. however, differentiation of s. pneumoniae from other streptococcus mitis group organisms was found to be problematic using the bruker  maldi biotyper system. methods: this study used the bruker maldi biotyper system  in addition to a mass spectra model analysis generated by 10 reference strains of s. pneumoniae, 8 strains of s. mitis and 2 strains of s. oralis in the clinprotools to identify 28 clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae and 47 isolates of s. mitis/oralis. the results were compared with those generated by the maldi biotyper system alone. results: the percentages of correct species level identification using the maldi biotyper system alone and the direct transfer and  extraction method were 66.7% (50/75) and 70.7% (53/75), respectively. with the additional clinprotools mass spectra analysis, the percentages of correct identification by the direct transfer and extraction method increased to 85.3% (64/75) and 100% (75/75), respectively. this new workflow significantly improved  the accuracy of s. pneumoniae and s. mitis/oralis identification. conclusions: the additional clinprotools mass spectra analysis with extraction method after maldi biotyper identification significantly improved the accuracy of identification among s. pneumoniae, s. oralis and s. mitis. the extra 15 min processing time of spectra analysis should be affordable in most clinical laboratories. we suggest that the same approach could be further explored in handling other bacterial species with high similarities.

TI  == cxcl14 displays antimicrobial activity against respiratory tract bacteria and contributes to clearance of streptococcus pneumoniae pulmonary infection.
AB  == cxcl14 is a chemokine with an atypical, yet highly conserved, primary structure characterized by a short n terminus and high sequence identity between human and  mouse. although it induces chemotaxis of monocytic cells at high concentrations,  its physiological role in leukocyte trafficking remains elusive. in contrast, several studies have demonstrated that cxcl14 is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptide that is expressed abundantly and constitutively in epithelial tissues. in this study, we further explored the antimicrobial properties of cxcl14 against respiratory pathogens in vitro and in vivo. we found that cxcl14 potently killed  pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus pneumoniae in a dose-dependent manner in part through membrane depolarization and rupture. by performing structure-activity studies, we found that the activity against gram-negative bacteria was largely associated with the n-terminal peptide cxcl141-13. interestingly, the central part of the molecule representing the beta-sheet also maintained approximately 62% killing activity and was sufficient  to induce chemotaxis of thp-1 cells. the c-terminal alpha-helix of cxcl14 had neither antimicrobial nor chemotactic effect. to investigate a physiological function for cxcl14 in innate immunity in vivo, we infected cxcl14-deficient mice with lung pathogens and we found that cxcl14 contributed to enhanced clearance of streptococcus pneumoniae, but not pseudomonas aeruginosa. our comprehensive studies reflect the complex bactericidal mechanisms of cxcl14, and we propose that different structural features are relevant for the killing of gram-negative  and gram-positive bacteria. taken together, our studies show that evolutionary-conserved features of cxcl14 are important for constitutive antimicrobial defenses against pneumonia.

TI  == platelet activation is a key event in the pathogenesis of streptococcal infections.
AB  == diverse streptococcus species including streptococcus pneumoniae, sanguis, gordonii, mitis and mutans cause life-threatening conditions including pneumonia, bacteremia and meningitis. these diseases bear a high morbidity and mortality and for this reason, understanding the key events in the pathogenesis of these infections have a great significance in their prevention and/or treatment. here,  we describe as how the activation of the platelets and their affinity to bind to  bacterial proteins act as early key events in the pathogenesis of streptococcal infections.

TI  == prevalence of the f-type lectin domain.
AB  == f-type lectins are fucolectins with characteristic fucose and calcium-binding sequence motifs and a unique lectin fold (the "f-type" fold). f-type lectins are  phylogenetically widespread with selective distribution. several eukaryotic f-type lectins have been biochemically and structurally characterized, and the f-type lectin domain (fld) has also been studied in the bacterial proteins, streptococcus mitis lectinolysin and streptococcus pneumoniae sp2159. however, there is little knowledge about the extent of occurrence of flds and their domain organization, especially, in bacteria. we have now mined the extensive genomic sequence information available in the public databases with sensitive sequence search techniques in order to exhaustively survey prokaryotic and eukaryotic flds. we report 437 fld sequence clusters (clustered at 80% sequence identity) from eukaryotic, eubacterial and viral proteins. domain architectures are diverse but mostly conserved in closely related organisms, and domain organizations of bacterial fld-containing proteins are very different from their eukaryotic counterparts, suggesting unique specialization of flds to suit different requirements. several atypical phylogenetic associations hint at lateral transfer. among eukaryotes, we observe an expansion of flds in terms of occurrence and domain organization diversity in the taxa mollusca, hemichordata and branchiostomi, perhaps coinciding with greater emphasis on innate immune strategies in these organisms. the naturally occurring flds with diverse domain organizations that we have identified here will be useful for future studies aimed at creating designer molecular platforms for directing desired biological activities to fucosylated glycoconjugates in target niches.

TI  == commensal streptococci serve as a reservoir for beta-lactam resistance genes in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of pneumonia, meningitis, septicemia, and middle ear infections. the incidence of s. pneumoniae isolates that are not susceptible to penicillin has risen worldwide and may be above 20% in some countries. beta-lactam antibiotic resistance in pneumococci is associated with significant sequence polymorphism in penicillin-binding proteins (pbps). commensal streptococci, especially s. mitis and s. oralis, have been identified as putative donors of mutated gene fragments. however, no studies have compared sequences of the involved pbp genes in large collections of commensal streptococci with those of s. pneumoniae. we therefore investigated the sequence  diversity of the transpeptidase region of the three pbp genes, pbp2x, pbp2b, and  pbp1a in 107, 96, and 88 susceptible and nonsusceptible strains of commensal streptococci, respectively, at the nucleotide and amino acid levels to determine  to what extent homologous recombination between commensal streptococci and s. pneumoniae plays a role in the development of beta-lactam resistance in s. pneumoniae. in contrast to pneumococci, extensive sequence variation in the transpeptidase region of pbp2x, pbp2b, and pbp1a was observed in both susceptible and nonsusceptible strains of commensal streptococci, conceivably reflecting the  genetic diversity of the many evolutionary lineages of commensal streptococci combined with the recombination events occurring with intra- and interspecies homologues. our data support the notion that resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in pneumococci is due to sequences acquired from commensal mitis group streptococci, especially s. mitis. however, several amino acid alterations  previously linked to beta-lactam resistance in pneumococci appear to represent species signatures of the donor strain rather than being causal of resistance.

TI  == diverse virulent pneumophages infect streptococcus mitis.
AB  == streptococcus mitis has emerged as one of the leading causes of bacterial endocarditis and is related to streptococcus pneumoniae. antibiotic resistance has also increased among strains of s. mitis and s. pneumoniae. phages are being  reinvestigated as alternatives to antibiotics for managing infections. in this study, the two virulent phages cp-1 (podoviridae) and dp-1 (siphoviridae), previously isolated from s. pneumoniae, were found to also infect s. mitis. microbiological assays showed that both pneumophages could not only replicate in  s. mitis but also produced more visible plaques on this host. however, the burst  size and phage adsorption data were lower in s. mitis as compared to s. pneumoniae. a comparison of the genomes of each phage grown on both hosts produced identical nucleotide sequences, confirming that the same phages infect both bacterial species. we also discovered that the genomic sequence of podophage cp-1 of the felix d'herelle collection is different than the previously reported  sequence and thus renamed socp.

TI  == recfor is not required for pneumococcal transformation but together with xers for resolution of chromosome dimers frequently formed in the process.
AB  == homologous recombination (hr) is required for both genome maintenance and generation of diversity in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. this process initiates from single-stranded (ss) dna and is driven by a universal recombinase, which promotes strand exchange between homologous sequences. the bacterial recombinase, reca, is loaded onto ssdna by recombinase loaders, recbcd and recfor for genome maintenance. dpra was recently proposed as a third loader dedicated to genetic transformation. here we assessed the role of recfor in transformation of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. we firstly established that recfor proteins are not required for plasmid transformation, strongly suggesting that dpra ensures annealing of plasmid single-strands internalized in the process. we  then observed no reduction in chromosomal transformation using a pcr fragment as  donor, contrasting with the 10,000-fold drop in dpra- cells and demonstrating that recfor play no role in transformation. however, a approximately 1.45-fold drop in transformation was observed with total chromosomal dna in recfor mutants. to account for this limited deficit, we hypothesized that transformation with chromosomal dna stimulated unexpectedly high frequency (>30% of cells) formation  of chromosome dimers as an intermediate in the generation of tandem duplications, and that recfor were crucial for dimer resolution. we validated this hypothesis,  showing that the site-specific recombinase xers was also crucial for dimer resolution. an even higher frequency of dimer formation (>80% of cells) was promoted by interspecies transformation with streptococcus mitis chromosomal dna, which contains numerous inversions compared to pneumococcal chromosome, each potentially promoting dimerization. in the absence of recfor and xers, dimers persist, as confirmed by dapi staining, and can limit the efficiency of transformation, since resulting in loss of transformant chromosome. these findings strengthen the view that different hr machineries exist for genome maintenance and transformation in pneumococci. these observations presumably apply to most naturally transformable species.

TI  == the novel species streptococcus tigurinus and its association with oral infection.
AB  == streptococcus tigurinus is a novel species of viridans streptococci, shown to cause severe invasive infections such as infective endocarditis, spondylodiscitis and meningitis. s. tigurinus belongs to the streptococcus mitis group and is most closely related to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and streptococcus infantis. the presence of s. tigurinus in the human oral cavity has been documented, including  in patients with periodontal disease. this review addresses the available scientific knowledge on s. tigurinus and its association with closely related streptococci, and discusses its putative involvement in common oral infections. while there is as yet no strong evidence on the involvement of s. tigurinus with  oral infections, its presence in the oral cavity and its association with endocarditis warrants special attention for a link between oral and systemic infection.

TI  == identification of proteins in streptococcus pneumoniae by reverse vaccinology and genetic diversity of these proteins in clinical isolates.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. virulence-associated proteins common and conserved among all capsular types now represent the best strategy to combat pneumococcal infections. our aim was to identify conserved targets in pneumococci that showed positive prediction for lipoprotein and extracellular subcellular location using bioinformatics programs  and verify the distribution and the degree of conservation of these targets in pneumococci. these targets can be considered potential vaccine candidate to be evaluated in the future. a set of 13 targets were analyzed and confirmed the presence in all pneumococci tested. these 13 genes were highly conserved showing  around >96 % of amino acid and nucleotide identity, but they were also present and show high identity in the closely related species streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. s. oralis clusters away from s. pneumoniae, while s. pseudopneumoniae and s. mitis cluster closer. the divergence between the selected targets was too small to be observed consistently in phylogenetic groups between the analyzed genomes of s. pneumoniae. the proteins analyzed fulfill two of the initial criteria of a vaccine candidate: targets are present in a variety of different pneumococci strains including different serotypes and are conserved among the samples evaluated.

TI  == real-time comparative evaluation of biomerieux vitek ms versus bruker microflex ms, two matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry systems, for identification of clinically significant bacteria.
AB  == background: matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) recently became available for the identification of bacteria in routine diagnostic laboratories. it is rapid and cost-effective and likely to replace phenotypic identification. this study was undertaken to compare two maldi-tof ms-based, bruker microflex ms (bms) and vitek ms (vms) systems, for identification (id) of clinically significant bacterial isolates. clinically relevant broad diversity of bacterial isolates obtained during a 6-consecutive months of routine laboratory processing of clinical specimens were subjected to id by the bms and vms in parallel with vitek 2, a conventional phenotypic system  (cps). for the bms, the isolates were tested in duplicates directly and after pretreatment. identification was provided with accompanying scores according to manufacturers' instructions. with vms, single deposits of the same sets of isolates were tested in duplicates directly on maldi-plate. results were interpreted according to the manufacturer's protocols. discrepant results were resolved by 16s rrna gene amplification and sequencing. results: a total of 806 pathogens comprising 507 gram-negative bacilli (gnb), 16 gram-negative cocci (gnc), 267 gram-positive cocci (gpc), and 16 gram-positive bacilli (gpb) were tested. bms and vms correctly identified isolates to genus and species levels (id 97.3% and 93.2%, and 99.8% and 99.0%, respectively). both systems as well as the  cps correctly identified the majority of the species in the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas spp., and acinetobacter baumannii. turnaround time for identification by bms and vms was <20 min compared with 24-48 h by the cps. conclusions: vms performed slightly better than bms with gpc id, especially  the streptococcus spp. some s. mitis isolates were identified as s. pneumoniae by bms. bms and vms were rapid and proved to be consistently accurate for producing  bacterial identification in a fraction of time it takes for identification by cps.

TI  == evaluation of verigene gram-positive blood culture assay performance for bacteremic patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere inc., northbrook, il) is a microarray-based test designed to rapidly identify directly  from positive blood cultures multiple bacterial species and their antimicrobial resistance markers. nonduplicate blood cultures from 118 patients admitted to erasme hospital were prospectively enrolled. all but six organisms were members of the panel (95.6 %). for the identification of pathogens and detection of the meca gene, the agreement with routine methods was 87.6 % and 97.7 %, respectively. the performance of the bc-gp assay was lower with polymicrobial than with monomicrobial blood cultures. another concern of the bc-gp assay was the misidentification of streptococcus mitis as s. pneumoniae (3/8). the bc-gp assay is a rapid and accurate tool for the simultaneous detection of multiple sepsis-causing bacteria and resistant genes from blood cultures, which could have an impact on patient management and healthcare cost.

TI  == clinical and microbiological differences between pyriform sinus fistulae in pediatric and non-pediatric patients.
AB  == objective: to review our 15-year experience with pyriform sinus fistula (psf) in  a single institution for a better understanding of the disease, pertaining especially to symptom onset at different ages. methods: medical records were reviewed for all 21 psf patients presenting between 1998 and 2012. patients were  then divided into pediatric (</= 15 years old) and non-pediatric (>15 years old)  groups according to the age at symptom onset. clinical and microbiological features of both groups were compared. results: there were 12 (57.1%) pediatric and 9 (42.9%) non-pediatric patients. it took an average of 13.1 months for the diagnosis of psf to be confirmed in pediatric patients from the time of symptom onset, whereas the same interval was only 0.7 month in the non-pediatric group. the sensitivity of computed tomography was more than 90% in both age groups, whereas that of barium esophagography was higher in non-pediatric (50.0%) than in pediatric (28.6%) patients. recurrence occurred after initial treatment in only three patients, all of whom were in the pediatric age group. bacteriological studies showed that streptococcus mitis was the most common species isolated from pediatric patients, while klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common pathogen in the non-pediatric group. conclusion: non-pediatric psf with late onset of symptoms is more common than expected or reported in the literature so far. this  form of psf present different clinical and microbiological characteristics compared to pediatric psf. therefore, diagnostic and therapeutic counseling for psf should be tailored according to the age of symptom onset.

TI  == the oral commensal streptococcus mitis shows a mixed memory th cell signature that is similar to and cross-reactive with streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == background: carriage of and infection with streptococcus pneumoniae is known to predominantly induce t helper 17 (th17) responses in humans, but the types of th  cells showing reactivity towards commensal streptococci with low pathogenic potential, such as the oral commensals s. mitis and s. salivarius, remain uncharacterized. methods: memory cd4(+) t helper (th) cell subsets were isolated  from healthy human blood donors according to differential expression of chemokine receptors, expanded in vitro using polyclonal stimuli and characterized for reactivity against different streptococcal strains. results: th cells responding  to s. mitis, s. salivarius and s. pneumoniae were predominantly in a ccr6(+)cxcr3(+) subset and produced ifn-gamma, and in a ccr6(+)ccr4(+) subset and produced il-17 and il-22. frequencies of s. pneumoniae-reactive th cells were higher than frequencies of s. mitis- and s. salivarius-specific th cells. s. mitis and s. pneumoniae isogenic capsule knock-out mutants and a s. mitis mutant  expressing the serotype 4 capsule of s. pneumoniae showed no different th cell responses as compared to wild type strains. s. mitis-specific th17 cells showed cross-reactivity with s. pneumoniae. conclusions: as th17 cells partly control clearance of s. pneumoniae, cross-reactive th17 cells that may be induced by commensal bacterial species may influence the immune response, independent of capsule expression.

TI  == competence for genetic transformation in streptococcus pneumoniae: mutations in sigmaa bypass the comw requirement.
AB  == competence for genetic transformation in the genus streptococcus depends on an alternative sigma factor, sigma(x), for coordinated synthesis of 23 proteins, which together establish the x state by permitting lysis of incompetent streptococci, uptake of dna fragments, and integration of strands of that dna into the resident genome. initiation of transient accumulation of high levels of  sigma(x) is coordinated between cells by transcription factors linked to peptide  pheromone signals. in streptococcus pneumoniae, elevated sigma(x) is insufficient for development of full competence without coexpression of a second competence-specific protein, comw. comw, shared by eight species in the streptococcus mitis and streptococcus anginosus groups, is regulated by the same  pheromone circuit that controls sigma(x), but its role in expression of the sigma(x) regulon is unknown. using the strong, but not absolute, dependence of transformation on comw as a selective tool, we collected 27 independent comw bypass mutations and mapped them to 10 single-base transitions, all within rpod,  encoding the primary sigma factor subunit of rna polymerase, sigma(a). eight mapped to sites in rpod region 4 that are implicated in interaction with the core beta subunit, indicating that comw may act to facilitate competition of the alternative sigma factor sigma(x) for access to core polymerase.

TI  == parallel evolution of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis to pathogenic and mutualistic lifestyles.
AB  == the bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the leading causes of fatal infections affecting humans. intriguingly, phylogenetic analysis shows that the species constitutes one evolutionary lineage in a cluster of the otherwise commensal streptococcus mitis strains, with which humans live in harmony. in a comparative analysis of 35 genomes, including phylogenetic analyses of all predicted genes, we have shown that the pathogenic pneumococcus has evolved into  a master of genomic flexibility while lineages that evolved into the nonpathogenic s. mitis secured harmonious coexistence with their host by stabilizing an approximately 15%-reduced genome devoid of many virulence genes. our data further provide evidence that interspecies gene transfer between s. pneumoniae and s. mitis occurs in a unidirectional manner, i.e., from s. mitis to s. pneumoniae. import of genes from s. mitis and other mitis, anginosus, and salivarius group streptococci ensured allelic replacements and antigenic diversification and has been driving the evolution of the remarkable structural diversity of capsular polysaccharides of s. pneumoniae. our study explains how the unique structural diversity of the pneumococcal capsule emerged and conceivably will continue to increase and reveals a striking example of the fragile border between the commensal and pathogenic lifestyles. while genomic plasticity enabling quick adaptation to environmental stress is a necessity for the pathogenic streptococci, the commensal lifestyle benefits from stability. importance: one of the leading causes of fatal infections affecting humans, streptococcus pneumoniae, and the commensal streptococcus mitis are closely related obligate symbionts associated with hominids. faced with a shortage of accessible hosts, the two opposing lifestyles evolved in parallel. we have shown  that the nonpathogenic s. mitis secured harmonious coexistence with its host by stabilizing a reduced genome devoid of many virulence genes. meanwhile, the pathogenic pneumococcus evolved into a master of genomic flexibility and imports  genes from s. mitis and other related streptococci. this process ensured antigenic diversification and has been driving the evolution of the remarkable structural diversity of capsular polysaccharides of s. pneumoniae, which conceivably will continue to increase and present a challenge to disease prevention.

TI  == structure of pneumococcal peptidoglycan hydrolase lytb reveals insights into the  bacterial cell wall remodeling and pathogenesis.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae causes a series of devastating infections in humans. previous studies have shown that the endo-beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase lytb is critical for pneumococcal cell division and nasal colonization, but the biochemical mechanism of lytb action remains unknown. here we report the 1.65 a crystal structure of the catalytic domain (residues lys-375-asp-658) of lytb (termed lytbcat), excluding the choline binding domain. lytbcat consists of three structurally independent modules: sh3b, ww, and gh73. these modules form a "t-shaped" pocket that accommodates a putative tetrasaccharide-pentapeptide substrate of peptidoglycan. structural comparison and simulation revealed that the gh73 module of lytb harbors the active site, including the catalytic residue  glu-564. in vitro assays of hydrolytic activity indicated that lytb prefers the peptidoglycan from the lytb-deficient pneumococci, suggesting the existence of a  specific substrate of lytb in the immature peptidoglycan. combined with in vitro  cell-dispersing and in vivo cell separation assays, we demonstrated that all three modules are necessary for the optimal activity of lytb. further functional  analysis showed that the full catalytic activity of lytb is required for pneumococcal adhesion to and invasion into human lung epithelial cells. structure-based alignment indicated that the unique modular organization of lytb  is highly conserved in its orthologs from streptococcus mitis group and gemella species. these findings provided structural insights into the pneumococcal cell wall remodeling and novel hints for the rational design of therapeutic agents against pneumococcal growth and thereby the related diseases.

TI  == diarrhea in young children from low-income countries leads to large-scale alterations in intestinal microbiota composition.
AB  == background: diarrheal diseases continue to contribute significantly to morbidity  and mortality in infants and young children in developing countries. there is an  urgent need to better understand the contributions of novel, potentially uncultured, diarrheal pathogens to severe diarrheal disease, as well as distortions in normal gut microbiota composition that might facilitate severe disease. results: we use high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing to compare fecal microbiota composition in children under five years of age who have been diagnosed with moderate to severe diarrhea (msd) with the microbiota from diarrhea-free controls. our study includes 992 children from four low-income countries in west and east africa, and southeast asia. known pathogens, as well as bacteria currently not considered as important diarrhea-causing pathogens, are positively associated with msd, and these include escherichia/shigella, and granulicatella species, and streptococcus mitis/pneumoniae groups. in both cases  and controls, there tend to be distinct negative correlations between facultative anaerobic lineages and obligate anaerobic lineages. overall genus-level microbiota composition exhibit a shift in controls from low to high levels of prevotella and in msd cases from high to low levels of escherichia/shigella in younger versus older children; however, there was significant variation among many genera by both site and age. conclusions: our findings expand the current understanding of microbiota-associated diarrhea pathogenicity in young children from developing countries. our findings are necessarily based on correlative analyses and must be further validated through epidemiological and molecular techniques.

TI  == protective role of the capsule and impact of serotype 4 switching on streptococcus mitis.
AB  == the polysaccharide capsule surrounding streptococcus pneumoniae is essential for  virulence. recently, streptococcus mitis, a human commensal and a close relative  of s. pneumoniae, was also shown to have a capsule. in this study, the s. mitis type strain switched capsule by acquisition of the serotype 4 capsule locus of s. pneumoniae tigr4, following induction of competence for natural transformation. comparison of the wild type with the capsule-switching mutant and with a capsule  deletion mutant showed that the capsule protected s. mitis against phagocytosis by raw 264.7 macrophages. this effect was enhanced in the s. mitis strain expressing the s. pneumoniae capsule, which showed, in addition, increased resistance against early clearance in a mouse model of lung infection. expression of both capsules also favored survival in human blood, and the effect was again more pronounced for the capsule-switching mutant. s. mitis survival in horse blood or in a mouse model of bacteremia was not significantly different between the wild type and the mutant strains. in all models, s. pneumoniae tigr4 showed higher rates of survival than the s. mitis type strain or the capsule-switching mutant, except in the lung model, in which significant differences between s. pneumoniae tigr4 and the capsule-switching mutant were not observed. thus, we identified conditions that showed a protective function for the capsule in s. mitis. under such conditions, s. mitis resistance to clearance could be enhanced  by capsule switching to serotype 4, but it was enhanced to levels lower than those for the virulent strain s. pneumoniae tigr4.

AB  == we report bronchoscopic changes observed in children with recurrent lower airways infections (rlai) and findings in control children undergoing bronchoscopy for causes other than rlai. patients and methods: retrospective case-control cohorts  study. the clinical records of children who had fiberoptic bronchoscopy (fb) for  a history of rlai without any known underlying disorder between 2007 and 2013 and of control children who required fb for other causes were reviewed. clinical features, bronchospic findings and bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) results were assessed. results: cases were 62 (32 female) children aged 5 years (1-12) and controls 29 children aged 4.5 years (0.5-14). airway malacia was observed in 32 (52%) vs. 4 (13%) (p = 0.001), profuse respiratory secretions in 34(55%) vs. 6 (20%) (p = 0.007). endobronchial obstruction: 4 (6.4%) and tracheobronchomegaly were observed only in cases. in cases with profuse respiratory secretions there was a higher prevalence of airways malacia: 64.7% vs. 35.7% (p = 0.04) and of positive bal cultures: 45.5% vs. 13.3% (p = 0.04). isolated organisms in cases were non-typable haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae most frequently. pneumocystiis jirovecii, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus mitis were isolated in controls. conclusions: half of the children with rlai had  tracheo and/or bronchomalacia, their frequency being in keeping with previous reports and far higher than that observed in controls. it was associated with profuse respiratory secretions and with a higher frequency of positive bal cultures mostly for non typable h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae which were not isolated in controls.

TI  == effective oral health in infective endocarditis: efficacy of high-street mouthwashes against the viridans group streptococci.
AB  == aim: recent uk national institute for health and clinical excellence guidelines state that there is no longer a need for oral antibiotic prophylaxis in patients  undergoing dental procedures who are at risk of infective endocarditis (ie), and  advocate the importance of maintaining good oral health. as viridans group streptococci (vgs) are common etiological agents of ie and inhabitants of the mouth, the purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of common high-street mouthwashes against four classes of vgs organisms (salivarius, mitis, anginosus, and mutans groupings). methods: the survival of vgs, streptococcus gordonii (national collection of type cultures [nctc] 7865), streptococcus intermedius (nctc 11324), streptococcus mutans (nctc 10449), streptococcus oralis (nctc 11427), streptococcus pneumoniae (nctc 7465, nctc 7978, & american type culture collection 49619) and streptococcus salivarius (nctc 8618) was assessed in vitro following treatment of approximately 10(7) c.f.u. in planktonic state with four mouthwashes. results: no organisms were culturable following 1-min exposure, and were not recovered following non-selective enrichment following incubation in brain heart infusion broth supplemented with 0.8% (w/v) yeast extract. conclusions: these data indicate that such mouthwashes are able to completely kill vgs organisms tested in planktonic solution, where their use would promote good oral hygiene in patients at risk of ie.

TI  == [molecular-genetic and phylogenetic characteristic of streptococcus pneumoniae strains isolated from patients with meningitis and carriers].
AB  == aim: analyze genetic and phylogenetic interrelations between s. pneumoniae strains isolated from meningitis patients and carriers. materials and methods: 23 s. pneumoniae isolates (9 from bacterial meningitis patients, 9 from nasopharynx  of bacterial carriers, 5 strains from museum collection of gabrichevsky moscow research institute of epidemiology and microbiology) were studied. s. pneumoniae  atcc 49619, s. mitis atcc 49456 served as control strains. s. pneumoniae serotype determination was carried out in latex-agglutination reaction and quelling reaction. multiplex pcr according to who protocols was used for molecular-genetic study and pneumolysin (ply), autolysin (lyta), surface cellular adhesin a (psaa)  and capsule polysaccharide (cpsa) gene determination. multilocus sequence-typing  was carried out according to who scheme for 7 "housekeeping" segments--aroe, gdh, gki, recp, spi, xpt and ddl. computer programs from available internet resources  were used for data processing and dendrogram building. results; the s. pneumoniae isolates analyzed were established to belong to 19 sequence types that may be combined into 4 subclusters. results of molecular-genetic and serologic typing were completely comparable. conclusion: attribution of isolates from the same serotype and serogroup to different sequence-types gives evidence on the ongoing  changes within serotype and as a result changes in allele profile of circulating  s. pneumoniae isolates. membership of isolates in separate subclusters gives evidence on close evolution relationship between isolates obtained from patients  with bacterial meningitis and carriers. certain isolates had not previously been  registered in russia and were probably imported from the territories of other countries.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in the community.
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated the upper respiratory tract of adult and paediatric patients within the community. vgs are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of  the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (ar). laboratory examination of the colonising vgs species  may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the ar reservoir in this population. freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis, s. constellatus, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius,  s. sanguinis and s. vestibularis. the most frequent vgs organisms isolated was s. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by s. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), s. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), s. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), s. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), s. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), s. australis (3/363; 0.8%), s. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), s. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and s. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). all patients examined carried at least one vgs organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of vgs species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different vgs species, respectively. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by  standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime,  with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. s. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all vgs species examined (s. vestibularis v s. salivarius p=0.011), followed by s. anginosis. s. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible vgs species examined. overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. however, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae. in conclusion, these data indicate that vgs colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible s. salivarius.

TI  == streptococcal taxonomy based on genome sequence analyses.
AB  == the identification of the clinically relevant viridans streptococci group, at species level, is still problematic. the aim of this study was to extract taxonomic information from the complete genome sequences of 67 streptococci, comprising 19 species, by means of genomic analyses, multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa), average amino acid identity (aai), genomic signatures, genome-to-genome distances (ggd) and codon usage bias. we then attempted to determine the usefulness of these genomic tools for species identification in streptococci. our results showed that mlsa, aai and ggd analyses are robust markers to identify streptococci at the species level, for instance, s. pneumoniae, s. mitis, and s.  oralis. a streptococcus species can be defined as a group of strains that share >/= 95% dna similarity in mlsa and aai, and > 70% dna identity in ggd. this approach allows an advanced understanding of bacterial diversity.

TI  == rapid detection of gram-positive organisms by use of the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the bact/alert pediatric fan system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  == assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. we evaluated the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp) in two pediatric hospitals. positive bact/alert pediatric fan blood cultures with gram-positive organisms were tested using the bc-gp in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. to test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles  were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 cfu  per milliliter. a total of 249 gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%,  respectively. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis  with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. the  bc-gp correctly identified 14/15 cases of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus  faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae. it misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with streptococcus anginosus group as s. pneumoniae. the bc-gp detected a case of streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus agalactiae. bc-gp's rapid accurate detection of staphylococcus spp., e. faecium, and e. faecalis and its ability to  ascertain meca, vana, and vanb status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining  to optimal antibiotic use. false-positive s. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the bc-gp.

TI  == bacterial diversity in meconium of preterm neonates and evolution of their fecal  microbiota during the first month of life.
AB  == the establishment and succession of bacterial communities in infants may have a profound impact in their health, but information about the composition of meconium microbiota and its evolution in hospitalized preterm infants is scarce.  in this context, the objective of this work was to characterize the microbiota of meconium and fecal samples obtained during the first 3 weeks of life from 14 donors using culture and molecular techniques, including dgge and the human intestinal tract chip (hitchip) analysis of 16s rrna amplicons. culture techniques offer a quantification of cultivable bacteria and allow further study  of the isolate, while molecular techniques provide deeper information on bacterial diversity. culture and hitchip results were very similar but the former showed lower sensitivity. inter-individual differences were detected in the microbiota profiles although the meconium microbiota was peculiar and distinct from that of fecal samples. bacilli and other firmicutes were the main bacteria groups detected in meconium while proteobacteria dominated in the fecal samples.  culture technique showed that staphylococcus predominated in meconium and that enterococcus, together with gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli, escherichia fergusonii, klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia marcescens, was more abundant in fecal samples. in addition, hitchip results showed the prevalence of  bacteria related to lactobacillus plantarum and streptococcus mitis in meconium samples whereas those related to enterococcus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and yersinia predominated in the 3(rd) week feces. this study highlights that spontaneously-released meconium of preterm neonates contains a specific microbiota that differs from that of feces obtained after the first week of life. our findings indicate that the presence of serratia was strongly associated with a higher degree of immaturity and other hospital-related parameters, including antibiotherapy and mechanical ventilation.

TI  == comparative genomic analyses of provide insight into virulence and commensalism dynamics.
AB  == streptococcus pseudopneumoniae (sppn) is a recently described species of the viridans group streptococci (vgs). although the pathogenic potential of s. pseudopneumoniae remains uncertain, it is most commonly isolated from patients with underlying medical conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. s. pseudopneumoniae can be distinguished from the closely related species, s. pneumoniae and s. mitis, by phenotypic characteristics, including optochin resistance in the presence of 5% co2, bile insolubility, and the lack of the pneumococcal capsule. previously, we reported the draft genome sequence of s. pseudopneumoniae is7493, a clinical isolate obtained from an immunocompromised patient with documented pneumonia. here, we use comparative genomics approaches to identify similarities and key differences between s. pseudopneumoniae is7493,  s. pneumoniae and s. mitis. the genome structure of s. pseudopneumoniae is7493 is most closely related to that of s. pneumoniae r6, but several recombination events are evident. analysis of gene content reveals numerous unique features that distinguish s. pseudopneumoniae from other streptococci. the presence of loci for competence, iron transport, pneumolysin production and antimicrobial resistance reinforce the phylogenetic position of s. pseudopneumoniae as an intermediate species between s. pneumoniae and s. mitis. additionally, the presence of several virulence factors and antibiotic resistance mechanisms suggest the potential of this commensal species to become pathogenic or to contribute to increasing antibiotic resistance levels seen among the vgs.

TI  == identification of clinical streptococcus pneumoniae isolates among other alpha and nonhemolytic streptococci by use of the vitek ms matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry system.
AB  == discrimination between streptococcus pneumoniae and its close relatives of the viridans group is a common difficulty in matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry-based identification. in  the present study, the performances of the vitek ms maldi-tof mass spectrometry system were assessed using 334 pneumococci, 166 other s. mitis group streptococci, 184 non-s. mitis group streptococci, and 19 related alpha- and nonhemolytic aerobic gram-positive catalase-negative coccal isolates. pneumococci had been identified by means of optochin susceptibility and bile solubility or serotyping, and other isolates mainly by use of rapidid32 strep strips. in case of discordant or low-discrimination results, genotypic methods were used. the sensitivity of the vitek ms for the identification of s. pneumoniae was 99.1%, since only three bile-insoluble isolates were misidentified as streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis. conversely, two optochin-resistant pneumococci were correctly identified (specificity, 100%). three streptococcus pseudopneumoniae isolates were also correctly identified. among nonpneumococcal isolates, 90.8% (n = 335) were correctly identified to the species or subspecies level and 2.4% (n = 9) at the group level. for the remaining 25 isolates, the vitek ms proposed a bacterial species included in the list of possible species suggested by genotypic methods, except for 4 isolates which were not identified due to the absence of the species in the database. according to our study, the vitek ms displays performance similar to that of the optochin susceptibility test for routine identification of pneumococcal isolates. moreover, the vitek ms is efficient for  the identification of other viridans group streptococci and related isolates, provided that the species are included in the database.

TI  == understanding the pneumococcus: transmission and evolution.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is part of the normal bacterial flora of the narsopharynx, but is also associated with several invasive and non-invasive diseases. recently, there has been a plethora of research information on the pneumococcus, however, there are few comprehensive review papers discussing the research information. this paper provides a review of the pneumococcus in two vital areas related to its biology including transmission and evolution. transmission of the pneumococcus is a highly efficient process that usually occurs through respiratory droplets from asymptomatic carriers. following acquisition, the pneumococcus may only establish in the nasopharynx of the new host, or further progress to sites such as the lungs and cause disease. pneumococcus transmission risk factors, as well as factors involved in its translocation from the nasophyarnx to diseases sites are still not fully understood. pneumococcal evolution is dominated by recombination. the recombinational events usually involve genetic exchange with streptococci of the  mitis group and some pneumococci are thought to exhibit hyper-recombination.

TI  == disease isolates of streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and non-typeable s. pneumoniae presumptively identified as atypical s. pneumoniae in spain.
AB  == we aimed to obtain insights on the nature of a collection of isolates presumptively identified as atypical streptococcus pneumoniae recovered from invasive and non-invasive infections in spain. one-hundred and thirty-two isolates were characterized by: optochin susceptibility in ambient and co(2)-enriched atmosphere; bile solubility; pcr-based assays targeting pneumococcal genes lyta, ply, pspa, cpsa, spn9802, alib-like orf2, and a specific 16s rrna region; multilocus sequence analysis; and antimicrobial susceptibility.  by multilocus sequence analysis, 61 isolates were s. pseudopneumoniae, 34 were pneumococci, 13 were s. mitis, and 24 remained unclassified as non-pneumococci. among s. pseudopneumoniae isolates, 51 (83.6%) were collected from respiratory tract samples; eight isolates were obtained from sterile sources. high frequency  of non-susceptibility to penicillin (60.7%) and erythromycin (42.6%) was found. only 50.8% of the s. pseudopneumoniae isolates displayed the typical optochin phenotype originally described for this species. none harbored the cpsa gene or the pneumococcal typical lyta restriction fragment length polymorphism. the spn9802 and the specific 16s rrna regions were detected among the majority of the s. pseudopneumoniae isolates (n = 59 and n = 49, respectively). the ply and pspa  genes were rarely found. a high genetic diversity was found and 59 profiles were  identified. among the s. pneumoniae, 23 were capsulated and 11 were non-typeable. three non-typeable isolates, associated to international non-capsulated lineages, were recovered from invasive disease sources. in conclusion, half of the atypical pneumococcal clinical isolates were, in fact, s. pseudopneumoniae and one-fourth  were other streptococci. we identified s. pseudopneumoniae and non-typeable pneumococci as cause of disease in spain including invasive disease.

TI  == discrimination between streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis based on  sorting of their maldi mass spectra.
AB  == accurate species-level identification of alpha-hemolytic (viridans) streptococci  (vgs) is very important for understanding their pathogenicity and virulence. however, an extremely high level of similarity between vgs within the mitis group (s. pneumoniae, s. mitis, s. oralis and s. pseudopneumoniae) often results in misidentification of these organisms. earlier, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) has been suggested as  a tool for the rapid identification of s. pneumoniae. however, by using biotyper  3.0 (bruker) or vitek ms (biomerieux) databases, streptococcus mitis/oralis species can be erroneously identified as s. pneumoniae. clinprotools 2.1 software was used for the discrimination of maldi-tof mass spectra of 25 s. pneumoniae isolates, 34 s. mitis and three s. oralis. phenotypical tests and multilocus gene typing schemes for the s. pneumoniae (http://spneumoniae.mlst.net/) and viridans  streptococci (http://viridans.emlsa.net/) were used for the identification of isolates included in the study. the classifying model was generated based on different algorithms (genetic algorithm, supervised neural network and quickclassifier). in all cases, values of sensitivity and specificity were found  to be equal or close to 100%, allowing discrimination of mass spectra of different species. three peaks (6949, 9876 and 9975 m/z) were determined conferring the maximal statistical weight onto each model built. we find this approach to be promising for viridans streptococci discrimination.

TI  == [vitreal surgery and etiological diagnosis of bacterial endophthalmitis].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the clinical effects of vitreal surgery and the importance of etiological diagnosis in the treatment for bacterial endophthalmitis. methods: retrospective series case study. 20 cases (20 eyes) of bacterial endophthalmitis  that were treated in peking union hospital were enrolled. 14 eyes were post-traumatic endophthalmitis, and 6 eyes were postoperative endophthalmitis. twenty cases of aged 3 to 83 years [mean (40.5 +/- 23.9) years] were enrolled, including 12 male and 8 female patients. pre-operative visual acuity: 2 cases were able to count fingers, 6 cases were able to perform hand movement, 11 cases  had light perception, light projection were uncertain in all cases, and there was no light perception in 1 case. hypopyon was seen in 13 eyes. severe anterior chamber inflammatory reaction was seen in the other 7 eyes. the fundus could not  be observed in all 20 eyes. b-scan ultrasound examination indicated that all 20 eyes displayed moderate to severe vitreous opacity; proliferation and organization were apparent in 12 eyes, and retinal detachment in 2 eyes. vitrectomy and intravitreal injection of antibiotics were performed in 18 eyes, and only intravitreal injection of antibiotics was administered in the other 2 eyes. at the beginning of operation, vitreous fluids were smeared and gram stained. to eyes that showed a positive result in gram staining, 1 mg of vancomycin was injected into the vitreous cavity or added in the perfusion fluid  (balanced salt solution, bss) in the eyes. to eyes that showed a negative result  in gram staining, 2 mg or 4 mg of ceftazidime was injected into the vitreous cavity or added in the perfusion fluid (bss) in the eyes, respectively. additionally, we examined the vitreous specimens and performed drug susceptibility testing of the bacteria cultured from the specimens. the antibiotics that the bacteria were susceptible to were chosen according to the drug sensitivity tests. the follow-up period is from 1 to 102 months (average 16.6 months). results: thirteen eyes presented with a positive gram staining result, and 3 eyes presented a negative result; the other 4 eyes were not infected. bacteria were cultured in 15 eyes. the detection rate of pathogen was 75%. the result for 11 eyes was consistent with the smear results. the bacteria detected were staphylococcus aureus in 3 eyes, staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 eyes, and bacillus spp in 2 eyes. streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis,  plesiomonas, pseudomonas cepacia, klebsiella oxytoca, loffi acinetobacter and pseudomonas fluorescens were detected in 1 eye. the remaining 5 eyes did not have bacterial growth. the intraocular infection of all 20 eyes was controlled, and the intraocular inflammation was relieved. the visual acuity was significantly elevated. postoperative visual acuity achieved were >/= 0.3 in 4 eyes, 0.1 to 0.2 in 4 eyes, 0.02 to 0.09 in 6 eyes, cf in 2 eyes, hm in 3 eyes and lp in 1 eye. the retinas of 17 eyes were normal, but recurrent retinal detachment occurred in  the other 3 eyes, postoperatively. conclusions: vitrectomy combined with antibiotics and intravitreal injection of antibiotics were an effective treatment of bacterial endophthalmitis. we obtained the vitreous fluid smears at the beginning of surgery to quickly and accurately obtain etiological diagnoses by gram staining. it is crucial to use etiological diagnosis to choose the susceptible antibiotics.

TI  == m-ficolin binds selectively to the capsular polysaccharides of streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 19b and 19c and of a streptococcus mitis strain.
AB  == the three human ficolins (h-, l-, and m-ficolins) and mannan-binding lectin are pattern recognition molecules of the innate immune system mediating activation of the lectin pathway of the complement system. these four human proteins bind to some microorganisms and may be involved in the resolution of infections. we investigated binding selectivity by examining the binding of m-ficolin to a panel of more than 100 different streptococcal strains (streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis), each expressing distinct polysaccharide structures. m-ficolin binding was observed for three strains only: strains of the pneumococcal serotypes 19b and 19c and a single s. mitis strain expressing a similar polysaccharide structure. the bound m-ficolin, in association with masp-2, mediated the cleavage of complement factor c4. binding to the bacteria was inhibitable by n-acetylglucosamine, indicating that the interaction with the  bacterial surface takes place via the fibrinogen-like domain. the common n-acetylmannosamine residue present in the structures of the four capsular polysaccharides of group 19 is linked via a phosphodiester bond. this residue is  apparently not a ligand for m-ficolin, since the lectin binds to two of the group 19 polysaccharides only. m-ficolin bound strongly to serotype 19b and 19c polysaccharides. in contrast to those of serotypes 19a and 19f, serotype 19b and  19c polysaccharides contain an extra n-acetylmannosamine residue linked via glycoside linkage only. thus, this extra residue seems to be the m-ficolin ligand. in conclusion, we were able to demonstrate specific binding of m-ficolin  to some capsular polysaccharides of the opportunistic pathogen s. pneumoniae and  of the commensal bacterium s. mitis.

TI  == characterization of recombinant fluoroquinolone-resistant pneumococcus-like isolates.
AB  == fourteen fluoroquinolone-resistant streptococcal isolates with recombinant dna topoisomerase genes, preliminarily identified as pneumococci, were further characterized using phenotypic and genotypic approaches. phenotypic tests classified them as atypical pneumococci. phylogenetic relationships were analyzed by using the sequences of seven housekeeping alleles from these isolates and from isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis,  and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. four isolates grouped with s. pneumoniae, seven grouped with s. pseudopneumoniae, and three grouped with s. mitis. these results generally agreed with those obtained with an optochin susceptibility test and with the organization of the atp operon chromosomal region, encoding the f(o)f(1) h(+)-atpase (the target of optochin). all seven isolates grouping with s. pseudopneumoniae share the same spr1368-atpc-atpa gene order; all four grouping with s. pneumoniae share the spr1368-is1239-atpc-atpa order, and two out of the three grouping with s. mitis share the spr1284-atpc-atpa order. in addition, evidence for recombination within the seven housekeeping alleles of the s. pseudopneumoniae population was provided by several methods: the index of association (0.4598, p < 0.001), the pairwise homoplasy index, and the split-decomposition method. this study confirms the existence of pneumococci among the alpha-hemolytic streptococci with dna topoisomerase genes showing a mosaic structure and reveals a close relationship between atypical pneumococci and s. pseudopneumoniae.

TI  == occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

TI  == a novel computational method identifies intra- and inter-species recombination events in staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == advances in high-throughput dna sequencing technologies have determined an explosion in the number of sequenced bacterial genomes. comparative sequence analysis frequently reveals evidences of homologous recombination occurring with  different mechanisms and rates in different species, but the large-scale use of computational methods to identify recombination events is hampered by their high  computational costs. here, we propose a new method to identify recombination events in large datasets of whole genome sequences. using a filtering procedure of the gene conservation profiles of a test genome against a panel of strains, this algorithm identifies sets of contiguous genes acquired by homologous recombination. the locations of the recombination breakpoints are determined using a statistical test that is able to account for the differences in the natural rate of evolution between different genes. the algorithm was tested on a  dataset of 75 genomes of staphylococcus aureus and 50 genomes comprising different streptococcal species, and was able to detect intra-species recombination events in s. aureus and in streptococcus pneumoniae. furthermore, we found evidences of an inter-species exchange of genetic material between s. pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis, a closely related commensal species that colonizes the same ecological niche. the method has been implemented in an r package, reco, which is freely available from supplementary material, and provides a rapid screening tool to investigate recombination on a genome-wide scale from sequence data.

TI  == regulation of neuraminidase expression in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == background: sialic acid (n-acetylneuraminic acid; neunac) is one of the most important carbohydrates for streptococcus pneumoniae due of its role as a carbon  and energy source, receptor for adhesion and invasion and molecular signal for promotion of biofilm formation, nasopharyngeal carriage and invasion of the lung. results: in this work, neunac and its metabolic derivative n-acetyl mannosamine (mannac) were used to analyze regulatory mechanisms of the neuraminidase locus expression. genomic and metabolic comparison to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguinis elucidates the metabolic association of the two amino sugars to different parts of the locus coding for the two main pneumococcal neuraminidases and confirms the substrate specificity of the respective abc transporters. quantitative gene expression analysis shows repression of the locus by glucose and induction of all predicted transcriptional units by mannac and neunac, each inducing with higher efficiency the operon encoding for the transporter with higher specificity for the respective amino sugar. cytofluorimetric analysis demonstrated enhanced surface exposure of nana on pneumococci grown in neunac and mannac and an activity assay allowed to quantify approximately twelve times as much neuraminidase activity on induced cells as opposed to glucose grown cells. conclusions: the present data increase the understanding of metabolic regulation  of the nanab locus and indicate that experiments aimed at the elucidation of the  relevance of neuraminidases in pneumococcal virulence should possibly not be carried out on bacteria grown in glucose containing media.

TI  == streptococcus pneumoniae r6 interspecies transformation: genetic analysis of penicillin resistance determinants and genome-wide recombination events.
AB  == interspecies gene transfer has been implicated as the major driving force for the evolution of penicillin resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae. genomic alterations of s. pneumoniae r6 introduced during four successive transformations with dna of the high-level penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis b6 with beta-lactam selection have now been determined and the contribution of genes to high resistance levels was analysed genetically. essential for high level resistance to penicillins of the transformant cccb was the combination of murm(b) (6) and the 3' region of pbp2b(b) (6) . sequences of both genes were detected in  clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae, confirming the participation of s. mitis in the global gene pool of beta-lactam resistance determinants. the s. mitis pbp1b gene which contains an authentic stop codon within the transpeptidase domain is now shown to contribute only marginal to resistance, but it is possible that the  presence of its transglycosylase domain is important in the context of cognate pbps. the genome sequence of cccb revealed 36 recombination events, including deletion and acquisition of genes and repeat elements. a total of 78 genes were affected representing 67 kb or 3.3% of the genome, documenting extensive alterations scattered throughout the genome.

TI  == the enhanced pneumococcal lamp assay: a clinical tool for the diagnosis of meningitis due to streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == background: streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of invasive bacterial disease in developed and developing countries. we studied the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) technique to assess its suitability for detecting s. pneumoniae nucleic acid in cerebrospinal fluid (csf). methodology/principal findings: we established an improved lamp assay targeting the lyta gene (streptococcus pneumoniae [sp] lamp). the analytical specificity of the primers was validated by using 32 reference strains (10 streptococcus and seven non-streptococcus species) plus 25 clinical alpha-hemolytic streptococcal strains, including four s. pneumoniae strains and 21 other strains (3 s. oralis,  17 s. mitis, and one streptococcus species) harboring virulence factor-encoding genes (lyta or ply). within 30 minutes, the assay could detect as few as 10 copies of both purified dna and spiked csf specimens with greater sensitivity than conventional polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the linear determination range for this assay is 10 to 1,000,000 microorganisms per reaction mixture using real-time turbidimetry. we evaluated the clinical sensitivity and specificity of  the sp lamp assay using 106 randomly selected csf specimens from children with suspected meningitis in korea, china and vietnam. for comparison, csf specimens were also tested against conventional pcr and culture tests. the detection rate of the lamp method was substantially higher than the rates of pcr and culture tests. in this small sample, relative to the lamp assay, the clinical sensitivity of pcr and culture tests was 54.5% and 33.3%, respectively, while clinical specificity of the two tests was 100%. conclusions/significance: compared to pcr, sp lamp detected s. pneumoniae with higher analytical and clinical sensitivity. this specific and sensitive lamp method offers significant advantages for screening patients on a population basis and for diagnosis in clinical settings.

TI  == uv-c-irradiation sublethal stress does not alter antibiotic susceptibility of the viridans group streptococci to beta-lactam, macrolide, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents.
AB  == aim: previous work has indicated that environmental stresses on bacteria might lead to an upregulation of stress response. led curing lights (315-400 nm) and other uv lights used in tooth whitening cosmetic procedures might act as stresses. we examined the effect of uv-c light, as a high-energy surrogate to the lower-energy uv-a light used in such instruments, to examine its effect on the antibiotic susceptibility of viridans group streptococci. methods: twelve species of viridans group streptococci were examined in this study: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus australis, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis. these organisms were exposed to varying degrees of sublethal uv-c radiation, and their minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility was determined by broth dilution assay against three classes of commonly-used antibiotics: beta-lactams (penicillin), macrolides (erythromycin), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). results: there was no significant difference between antibiotic susceptibility before uv-c exposure and following maximum sublethal stress, prior to cell death due to fatal uv-c exposure. conclusions: exposure to uv-c light will not result in altered antibiotic susceptibility patterns on viridans group streptococci. given that uv-c is more toxic and mutagenic than uv-a light, it is unlikely than uv-a light  would yield any difference in response to such exposure.

TI  == streptococcus tigurinus, a novel member of the streptococcus mitis group, causes  invasive infections.
AB  == we recently described the novel species streptococcus tigurinus sp. nov. belonging to the streptococcus mitis group. the type strain az_3a(t) of s. tigurinus was originally isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis. according to its phenotypic and molecular characteristics, s. tigurinus is most closely related to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus infantis. accurate identification of s. tigurinus is facilitated by 16s rrna gene analysis. we retrospectively analyzed our 16s rrna gene molecular database, which contains sequences of all clinical samples obtained in our institute since 2003. we detected 17 16s rrna gene sequences which were assigned to s. tigurinus, including sequences from the 3 s. tigurinus strains described previously. s. tigurinus originated from normally sterile body sites, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or heart valves, of 14 patients and was initially detected by culture or broad-range 16s rrna gene pcr, followed by sequencing. the 14 patients had serious invasive infections, i.e., infective endocarditis (n = 6), spondylodiscitis (n = 3), bacteremia (n = 2), meningitis (n = 1), prosthetic joint infection (n = 1), and thoracic empyema (n = 1). to evaluate the presence of streptococcus tigurinus in the endogenous oral microbial flora, we screened saliva specimens of 31 volunteers. after selective growth, alpha-hemolytic growing colonies were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) and subsequent molecular methods. s. tigurinus was not identified among 608 strains analyzed. these data indicate that s. tigurinus is not widely distributed in the oral cavity. in conclusion, s. tigurinus is a novel agent of invasive infections, particularly infective endocarditis.

TI  == differentiation of streptococcus pneumoniae from nonpneumococcal streptococci of  the streptococcus mitis group by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == the differentiation of species within the streptococcus mitis group has posed a problem in the routine diagnostic microbiology laboratory for some time. it also  constitutes a major weakness of recently introduced matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) fingerprinting systems. as the phylogenetic resolution of the spectral similarity measures employed by these systems is insufficient to reliably distinguish between the most closely related members of the group, the major pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae is frequently misidentified. in this study, a comparative analysis of maldi-tof spectra of several species from the s. mitis group has been performed in order to identify single peaks that could be used to  improve mass spectrometry-based identification of the respective species. a characteristic peak profile could be identified that unambiguously distinguished  the 14 s. pneumoniae isolates studied from 33 nonpneumococcal isolates of the s.  mitis group. in addition, specific peak combinations could be assigned to other members of the group. the findings of this study suggest that it is possible to distinguish different species of the s. mitis group by close analysis of their mass peak profiles.

TI  == microbiological etiology and susceptibility of bacterial conjunctivitis isolates  from clinical trials with ophthalmic, twice-daily besifloxacin.
AB  == introduction: bacterial conjunctivitis is a contagious infection of the surface of the eye usually treated empirically with topical antibiotics. since the etiologic agent is rarely identified, it is important to monitor which bacteria cause conjunctivitis and determine their antibacterial resistance profiles. methods: a total of 496 bacterial samples were isolated during a randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study conducted in the united states with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% dosed twice daily. species were determined by standard biochemical and/or molecular identification methods.  minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined according to clinical and laboratory standards institute standards. results: the most prevalent species was haemophilus influenzae, followed by staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, the streptococcus mitis group, and streptococcus pneumoniae. one species  identified in this study, which was not previously noted as a common cause of bacterial conjunctivitis, was dolosigranulum pigrum. ampicillin resistance was common among h. influenzae isolates, while macrolide resistance was high among s. pneumoniae, s. epidermidis, and s. aureus. the latter two species also included a number of isolates resistant to methicillin and ciprofloxacin. conclusion: antibiotic resistance among isolates remains a concern and the appearance of an emerging ocular pathogen, d. pigrum, suggests the need for continued observation. the topical ophthalmic fluoroquinolones continue to provide a good balance of low to moderate (i.e., manageable) levels of resistance plus broad-spectrum coverage  for empiric treatment of ocular infections.

TI  == comparative transcriptomic analysis of streptococcus pseudopneumoniae with viridans group streptococci.
AB  == background: streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, is a novel member of the genus streptococcus, falling close to related members like s. pneumoniae, s. mitis, and s. oralis. its recent appearance has shed light on streptococcal infections, which has been unclear till recently. in this study, the transcriptome of s. pseudopneumoniae ccug 49455t was analyzed using the s. pneumoniae r6 microarray platform and compared with those of s. pneumoniae kctc 5080t, s. mitis kctc 3556t, and s. oralis kctc 13048t strains. results: comparative transcriptome analysis revealed the extent of genetic relatedness among the species, and implies that s. pseudopneumoniae is the most closely related to s. pneumoniae. a  total of 489, 444 and 470 genes were upregulated while 347, 484 and 443 were downregulated relative to s. pneumoniae in s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis and s.  mitis respectively. important findings were the up-regulation of tcs (two component systems) and transposase which were found to be specific to s. pseudopneumoniae. conclusions: this study provides insight to the current understanding of the genomic content of s. pseudopneumoniae. the comparative transcriptome analysis showed hierarchical clustering of expression data of s. pseudopneumoniae with s. pneumoniae and s. mitis with s. oralis. this proves that transcriptional profiling can facilitate in elucidating the genetic distance between closely related strains.

TI  == sequetyping: serotyping streptococcus pneumoniae by a single pcr sequencing strategy.
AB  == the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines necessitates continued monitoring of circulating strains to assess vaccine efficacy and replacement serotypes. conventional serological methods are costly, labor-intensive, and prone to misidentification, while current dna-based methods have limited serotype coverage requiring multiple pcr primers. in this study, a computer algorithm was  developed to interrogate the capsulation locus (cps) of vaccine serotypes to locate primer pairs in conserved regions that border variable regions and could differentiate between serotypes. in silico analysis of cps from 92 serotypes indicated that a primer pair spanning the regulatory gene cpsb could putatively amplify 84 serotypes and differentiate 46. this primer set was specific to streptococcus pneumoniae, with no amplification observed for other species, including s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. pseudopneumoniae. one hundred thirty-eight  pneumococcal strains covering 48 serotypes were tested. of 23 vaccine serotypes included in the study, most (19/22, 86%) were identified correctly at least to the serogroup level, including all of the 13-valent conjugate vaccine and other replacement serotypes. reproducibility was demonstrated by the correct sequetyping of different strains of a serotype. this novel sequence-based method  employing a single pcr primer pair is cost-effective and simple. furthermore, it  has the potential to identify new serotypes that may evolve in the future.

TI  == novel molecular method for identification of streptococcus pneumoniae applicable  to clinical microbiology and 16s rrna sequence-based microbiome studies.
AB  == the close phylogenetic relationship of the important pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae and several species of commensal streptococci, particularly streptococcus mitis and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and the recently demonstrated sharing of genes and phenotypic traits previously considered specific for s. pneumoniae hamper the exact identification of s. pneumoniae. based on sequence analysis of 16s rrna genes of a collection of 634 streptococcal strains, identified by multilocus sequence analysis, we detected a cytosine at position 203 present in all 440 strains of s. pneumoniae but replaced by an adenosine residue in all strains representing other species of mitis group streptococci. the s. pneumoniae-specific sequence signature could be demonstrated by sequence analysis or indirectly by restriction endonuclease digestion of a pcr amplicon covering the site. the s. pneumoniae-specific signature offers an inexpensive means for validation of the identity of clinical isolates and should  be used as an integrated marker in the annotation procedure employed in 16s rrna-based molecular studies of complex human microbiotas. this may avoid frequent misidentifications such as those we demonstrate to have occurred in previous reports and in reference sequence databases.

TI  == biosynthesis of teichoic acids in streptococcus pneumoniae and closely related species: lessons from genomes.
AB  == the cell wall of streptococcus pneumoniae contains an unusually complex wall teichoic acid (wta), which has identical repeating units as the membrane-anchored lipoteichoic acid (lta). both polymers share a common cytoplasmic pathway of precursor synthesis, but several ta enzymes have remained elusive. bioinformatic  analysis of the genome of various pneumococcal strains, including choline-independent mutant strains, has allowed us to identify the missing ta genes. we present here the deduced complete pathways of wta and lta synthesis in  s. pneumoniae and point to the variations occurring in different pneumococcal strains and in closely related species such as streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis.

TI  == identification of a functional capsule locus in streptococcus mitis.
AB  == the polysaccharide capsule of streptococcus pneumoniae is a hallmark for virulence in humans. in its close relative streptococcus mitis, a common human commensal, analysis of the sequenced genomes of six strains revealed the presence of a putative capsule locus in four of them. we constructed an isogenic s. mitis  mutant from the type strain that lacked the 19 open reading frames in the capsule locus (deltacps mutant), using a deletion strategy similar to previous capsule functional studies in s. pneumoniae. transmission electron microscopy and atomic  force microscopy revealed a capsule-like structure in the s. mitis type strain that was absent or reduced in the deltacps mutant. since s. mitis are predominant oral colonizers of tooth surfaces, we addressed the relevance of the capsule locus for the s. mitis overall surface properties, autoaggregation and biofilm formation. the capsule deletion resulted in a mutant with approximately two-fold  increase in hydrophobicity. binding to the stains-all cationic dye was reduced by 40%, suggesting a reduction in the overall negative surface charge of the mutant. the mutant exhibited also increased autoaggregation in coaggregation buffer, and  up to six-fold increase in biofilm levels. the results suggested that the capsule locus is associated with production of a capsule-like structure in s. mitis and indicated that the s. mitis capsule-like structure may confer surface attributes  similar to those associated with the capsule in s. pneumoniae.

TI  == streptococcus pseudopneumoniae identification by pherotype: a method to assist understanding of a potentially emerging or overlooked pathogen.
AB  == the recent identification of streptococcus pseudopneumoniae (pseudopneumococcus)  has complicated classification schemes within members of the "mitis" streptococcal group. accurate differentiation of this species is necessary for understanding its disease potential and identification in clinical settings. this work described the use of the competence-stimulatory peptide comc sequence for identification of s. pseudopneumoniae. comc sequences from clinical sources were  determined for 17 strains of s. pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus oralis. an additional 58 comc sequences from a range of sources were included to understand the diversity and suitability of this protein as a diagnostic marker for species identification. we identified three pherotypes for  this species, delineated csp6.1 (10/14, 79%), csp6.3 (3/14, 21%), and sk674 (1/14, 7%). pseudopneumococcal comc sequences formed a discrete cluster within those of other oral streptococci. this suggests that the comc sequence could be used to identify s. pseudopneumoniae, thus simplifying the study of the pathogenic potential of this organism. to avoid confusion between pneumococcal and pseudopneumococcal pherotypes, we have renamed the competence pherotype csp6.1, formerly reported as an "atypical" pneumococcus, cspps1 to reflect its occurrence in s. pseudopneumoniae.

TI  == cell surface proteins in s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis.
AB  == background and objectives: streptococcus pneumoniae, a major human pathogen, is closely related to the commensal species s. mitis and s. oralis. s. pneumoniae surface proteins are implicated in virulence and host interaction of this species, but many of them have recently been detected in s. mitis b6 in silico. we tested for the presence of such genes usinga set of eight s. mitis and eleven  s. oralis strains from different geographic locations. materials and methods: an  oligonucleotide microarray was designed based on the genomes of s. pneumoniae r6  and tigr4 as well as s. mitis b6 to include 63 cell surface proteins. the s. pneumoniae genes encoding neuraminidases, hyaluronidase and pneumolysin were also included. in addition to comparative genomic hybridization experiments, homologues were identified in silico in the genome of s. oralis uo5. results and  conclusions: the results document that many s. pneumoniae related surface proteins are ubiquitously present among the mitis group of streptococci. all 19 samples hybridized with the pava probe representing a gene important for adherence and invasion of s. pneumoniae. only eight genes were not recognized in  any strain, including the s. pneumoniae pcpc gene as the only virulence gene of the s. pneumoniae core genome.the fact that only 12 out of 26 genes present in the s. oralis uo5 genome could be detected by microarray analysis confirms the sequence variation of surface components.

TI  == evaluation of several biochemical and molecular techniques for identification of  streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and their detection in respiratory samples.
AB  == the identification and detection of mitis group streptococci, which contain streptococcus pneumoniae, have been hampered by the lack of sensitive and specific assays. in this study, we evaluated several biochemical and molecular assays for the identification of s. pneumoniae and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and their distinction from other mitis group streptococci using a collection of 54 isolates obtained by the routine culturing of 53 respiratory specimens from patients with community-acquired pneumonia. the combined results of the biochemical and molecular assays indicated the presence of 23 s. pneumoniae, 2 s. pseudopneumoniae, and 29 other mitis group streptococcal isolates. the tube bile  solubility test that is considered gold standard for the identification of s. pneumoniae showed concordant results with optochin susceptibility testing (co(2)  atmosphere) and a real-time multiplex pcr assay targeting the spn9802 fragment and the autolysin gene. optochin susceptibility testing upon incubation in an o(2) atmosphere, bile solubility testing by oxgall disk, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, and sequence analysis of  the tuf and rpob genes resulted in several false-positive, false-negative, or inconclusive results. the s. pseudopneumoniae isolates could be identified only by molecular assays, and the multiplex real-time pcr assay was concluded to be most convenient for the identification of s. pneumoniae and s. pseudopneumoniae isolates. using this method, s. pneumoniae and s. pseudopneumoniae dna could be detected in the respiratory samples from which they were isolated and in an additional 11 samples from which only other streptococci were isolated.

TI  == accuracy of using the lyta gene to distinguish streptococcus pneumoniae from related species.
AB  == the need for a microbial identification of streptococcus pneumoniae independent of culture methods has resulted in the introduction of other laboratory principles. the verification of a proper and exclusive gene for the detection of  the pneumococcus by nucleic acid-based tests is, however, still unresolved. a previously published lyta-gene-specific real-time pcr method was applied to a panel of bacterial strains to clarify the analytical sensitivity and specificity  of a pcr assay targeting this gene. furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis of published lyta gene sequences was performed to look at gene sequence differences  and the theoretical match with the primers and probes. the lyta-gene-specific pcr detected 46/46 s. pneumoniae isolates. all 49 of the non-pneumococcal isolates tested negative, including 22 isolates from the mitis group streptococci. phylogenetic analysis of 94 sequences of the lyta gene from different strains of  s. pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae showed that 70/87 s. pneumoniae sequences constituted one cluster and a further six sequences were outside but adjacent to this cluster, all with a complete match with primers and probes. the remaining 11 s. pneumoniae strains could be placed in a different cluster, which also contained the five s. mitis and two s. pseudopneumoniae strains. all strains had no match with primers and probes. the s. pneumoniae strains in the second cluster were all characterized by being bile-insoluble, an  infrequent pneumococcal phenotype. routine laboratories can utilize the additional observation that pneumococci that were negative by the specific pcr also carried the phenotype of bile insolubility, thereby observing the incidence  of false-negative results produced by the pcr assay. the real-time pcr targeting  the lyta gene thus constitutes a sensitive and specific assay that distinguishes  s. pneumoniae from its close relatives in the mitis group.

TI  == effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation between oral streptococci and actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == background: the co-aggregation of oral bacteria leads to their clearance from the oral cavity. poor oral hygiene and high saliva viscosity are common amongst the elderly; thus, they frequently suffer from pneumonia caused by the aspiration of  oral microorganisms. objectives: to examine the direct effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces. materials and methods: fifteen oral streptococcal and a single actinomyces strain were used. co-aggregation was assessed by a visual assay in phosphate buffer and a spectrophotometric assay in the same buffer containing 0-60% glycerol or whole saliva. results: nine oral streptococci co-aggregated with actinomyces naeslundii atcc12104 in the visual assay and were subsequently used for the spectrophotometric analysis. all tested strains displayed a decrease in co-aggregation with increasing amounts of glycerol in the buffer. the co-aggregation of streptococcus oralis with a. naeslundii recovered to baseline level following the removal of glycerol. the per cent co-aggregation of s. oralis with a. naeslundii was significantly correlated with the viscosity in unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva samples (correlation coefficients: -0.52 and -0.48, respectively). conclusion: this study suggests that saliva viscosity affects the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces and that bacterial co-aggregation decreases with increasing saliva viscosity.

TI  == population genetics and evolution of the pan-genome of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == the genetic variability in bacterial species is much larger than in other kingdoms of life. the gene content between pairs of isolates can diverge by as much as 30% in species like escherichia coli or streptococcus pneumoniae. this unexpected finding led to the introduction of the concept of the pan-genome, the  set of genes that can be found in a given bacterial species. the genome of any isolate is thus composed by a "core genome" shared by all strains and characteristic of the species, and a "dispensable genome" that accounts for many  of the phenotypic differences between strains. the pan-genome is usually much larger than the genome of any single isolate and, given the ability of many bacteria to exchange genetic material with the environment, constitutes a reservoir that could enhance their ability to survive in a mutating environment.  to understand the evolution of the pan-genome of an important pathogen and its interactions with the commensal microbial flora, we have analyzed the genomes of  44 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, one of the most important causes of microbial diseases in humans. despite evidence of extensive homologous recombination, the s. pneumoniae phylogenetic tree reconstructed from polymorphisms in the core genome identified major groups of genetically related strains. with the exception of serotype 1, the tree correlated poorly with capsular serotype, geographical site of isolation and disease outcome. the distribution of dispensable genes was consistent with phylogeny, although horizontal gene transfer events attenuated this correlation in the case of ancient lineages. homologous recombination, involving short stretches of dna, was the dominant evolutionary process of the core genome of s. pneumoniae. genetic exchange with related species sharing the same ecological niche was the main mechanism of evolution of s. pneumonia; and s. mitis was the main reservoir of genetic diversity of s. pneumoniae. the pan-genome of s. pneumoniae increased logarithmically with the number of strains and linearly with the variability of the sample, suggesting that acquired genes accumulate proportionately to the age  of clones.

AB  == background: streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus sanguinis are members of the mitis group of streptococci and agents of oral biofilm, dental plaque and infective endocarditis, disease processes that involve bacteria-bacteria and bacteria-host interactions. their close relative, the human pathogen s. pneumoniae uses pilus-islet 2 (pi-2)-encoded pili to facilitate adhesion to eukaryotic cells. methodology/principal findings: pi-2 pilus-encoding genetic islets were identified in s. oralis, s. mitis, and s. sanguinis, but were absent from other isolates of these species. the pi-2 islets resembled the genetic organization of the pi-2 islet of s. pneumoniae, but differed in the genes encoding the structural pilus proteins pita and pitb. two and three variants of pita (a pseudogene in s. pneumoniae) and pitb, respectively, were identified that showed approximately 20% difference in nucleotide as well as corresponding protein sequence. species-independent combinations of pita and pitb variants indicated prior intra- and interspecies horizontal gene transfer events. polyclonal antisera developed against pita and pitb of s. oralis type strain atcc35037 revealed that pi-2 pili in oral streptococci were composed of pita and  pitb. electronmicrographs showed pilus structures radiating >700 nm from the bacterial surface in the wild type strain, but not in an isogenic pi-2 deletion mutant. anti-pitb-antiserum only reacted with pili containing the same pitb variant, whereas anti-pita antiserum was cross-reactive with the other pita variant. electronic multilocus sequence analysis revealed that all pi-2-encoding  oral streptococci were closely-related and cluster with non-pi-2-encoding s. oralis strains. conclusions/significance: this is the first identification of pi-2 pili in mitis group oral streptococci. the findings provide a striking example of intra- and interspecies horizontal gene transfer. the pi-2 pilus diversity provides a possible key to link strain-specific bacterial interactions  and/or tissue tropisms with pathogenic traits in the mitis group streptococci.

TI  == molecular characterisation of the quinolone resistance-determining region (qrdr)  of the parc gene locus in viridans-group streptococci.
AB  == forty-eight isolates of viridans-group streptococci (vgs) from adults and children in the community are examined for their resistance to ciprofloxacin phenotypically by determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). in addition, the parc gene locus is amplified and sequenced in all isolates and mutations noted. overall, 44 vgs organisms were found to be susceptible to ciprofloxacin by the broth microdilution method, and the remaining four strains had intermediate susceptibility. reduced mics were observed with intermediate strains when reserpine was added to the broth, inhibiting any efflux activity. overall, the effect of adding reserpine to the broth medium was to add one doubling dilution to the mic in the case of streptococcus mitis, s. oralis and s. salivarius, as well as to increase the mic by two doubling dilutions in two of the three s. parasanguinis isolates. amino acid sequence analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining region (qrdr) of the parc gene locus showed good correlation to the phenotypic resistance to ciprofloxacin, where no confirmed mutation conferring quinolone resistance was found. eleven amino acid positions showed discordance with s. pneumoniae r6 and eight (s52, f55, s58, n91, e135, k137, f141 and s167) were common in the vgs species examined. in addition, minor  substitutions were found at three positions (d51, t54 and v86). in conclusion, this study demonstrates the low occurrence of ciprofloxacin resistance in a population of vgs isolated from the community. in addition, several silent mutations were noted in vgs organisms without any increase in mic against ciprofloxacin.

TI  == rapid identification of noncapsulated streptococcus pneumoniae in nasopharyngeal  samples allowing detection of co-colonization and reevaluation of prevalence.
AB  == noncapsulated pneumococci are atypical streptococcus pneumoniae that lack a capsule and therefore do not react with any available antisera. these isolates, which are often referred as nontypeable pneumococci (ntpn), are difficult to identify as their differentiation from closely related species such as streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and other streptococcus of the mitis group is not  always straightforward. we developed a low-cost and easy assay to detect and quantify ntpn in primary samples (which may contain multiple species) obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs. the strategy is based on a multiplex polymerase chain  reaction targeting lyta, cpsa, alib-like orf2, and 16s rdna genes, plus a restriction fragment length polymorphism assay to differentiate typical from atypical lyta. the application of the proposed methodology to over 500 nasopharyngeal samples found that the prevalence of ntpn in colonization was 3-fold higher than that estimated by routine methods (from 2.9% to 8.6% in the study collection). the international clone norway(nt)st344 was the major clone identified.

AB  == matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) is a novel method for the direct identification of bacteria from blood culture broths. we evaluate for the first time, the performance of the maldi sepsityper kit and ms for the identification of bacteria compared to standard phenotypic methods using the manufacturer's specified bacterial identification criteria (spectral scores >/=1.700-1.999 and >/=2.000 indicated identification to genus and species level, respectively). five hundred and seven  positive blood culture broths were prospectively examined, of which 379 (74.8%; 358 monomicrobial, 21 polymicrobial) were identified by maldi-tof ms; 195 (100%)  and 132 (67.7%) of 195 gram-positive; and 163 (100%) and 149 (91.4%) of 163 gram-negative organisms from monomicrobial blood cultures were correctly identified to genus and species level, respectively. spectral scores <1.700 (no identification) were obtained in 128/507 (25.2%) positive blood culture broths, including 31.6% and 32.3% of gram-positive and polymicrobial blood cultures, respectively. significantly more gram-negative organisms were identified compared to gram-positive organisms at species level (p<0.0001). five blood cultures were  misidentified, but at species level only; including four monomicrobial blood cultures with streptococcus oralis/mitis that were misidentified as streptococcus pneumoniae. positive predictive values for the direct identification of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from monomicrobial blood culture broths  to genus level were 100%. a diagnostic algorithm for positive blood culture broths that incorporates gram staining and maldi-tof ms should identify the majority of pathogens, particularly to genus level.

TI  == misidentification of alpha-hemolytic streptococci by routine tests in clinical practice.
AB  == accurate species-level identification of viridans group streptococci (vgs) is very important for understanding of their pathogenicity and virulence. however, an extremely high level of the similarity between vgs, especially streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, often results in misidentification of these organisms, so there is an urgent need of novel approaches to species identification. a set of 50 randomly selected clinical isolates of alpha-hemolytic streptococci from upper respiratory tract were characterized by the routine phenotypic methods (alpha-hemolysis, colony morphology, gram stain and optochin susceptibility). modern proteomic and genetic approaches - the direct bacterial profiling (dbp) by means of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) technique and multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa) scheme (http://viridans.emlsa.net/) - were applied for the accurate species identification. after that all isolates were stored at -70 degrees c. later they  were re-inoculated, and a number of additional tests (bile solubility, latex agglutination by commercial "slidex(r) pneumo-kit" and repeated optochin test) were performed. a considerable discrepancy was discovered in the results of the different approaches. looking in the future, one could say that mlsa-like schemes based on the analysis of the nucleotide sequences of seven or more loci of the bacterial genome, appeared to be the most useful instrument in the vgs discrimination, in contrast to the numerous one-target identification schemes, which have been introduced into practice by now.

TI  == prevalence of clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeat (crispr)-like sequences in mitis-group streptococci.
AB  == clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats (crisprs) have been discovered in many bacteria and archaea. many crispr-like sequences have been identified in an increasing number of studies on the function of crisprs. one crispr-like sequence of approximately 240 base pairs has been found to be highly  conserved within 11 genome sequences of streptococcus pneumoniae. a specific crispr-like polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay was designed with the novel primers crispr 5f (forward primer) 5'-cta aty tca taa cca tar gaa tc-3' and crispr 3r (reverse primer) 5'-gat aar atc cty taa wct tct ag-3' to detect the presence of this crispr-like sequence in pneumococci, as well as in viridans-group streptococci (vgs). this study investigates the prevalence of this crispr-like sequence in s. pneumoniae and 12 viridans-group streptococcal species and shows its existence to be shared by the majority of s. pneumoniae and, to a lesser extent, s. mitis. this crispr-like sequence was also found in s. australis and it is highly conserved among these strains, suggesting possible biological functional differences from true crispr because this crispr-like sequence has relatively few repeat numbers, and adjacent homology of crispr-associated (cas) genes was absent. the sharing of this crispr-like sequence between pneumococci, the mitis group and other vgs, as well as its high sequence homology, may suggest close evolutionary emergence of this sequence between these species.

TI  == exploring internal features of 16s rrna gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == background: streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. the genus has been divided into different groups based on 16s rrna gene sequence similarity. the variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. the present study was taken up to explore 16s rrna gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification  and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus streptococcus. methods: 16s rrna gene sequences belonging to the isolates of s. dysgalactiae, s. equi, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, s. gallolyticus, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus and s. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. results: the framework based analysis was used to segregate streptococcus spp. previously  identified upto genus level. this segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. conclusions: the markers generated exploring 16s rrna gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus streptococcus.

AB  == the modern phenotypic and genetic methods except for multi locus sequence typing  do not allow the reliable differentiation within mitis group of alpha-hemolytic streptococci. during this study the maldi mass spectra were acquired for 28 clinical isolates initially identified as s. pneumoniae by routine bacteriological tests. due to multi locus sequence typing these isolates were found to belong to two closely related species - s. pneumoniae (n = 22) and s. mitis (n = 6). distribution of those isolates in accordance with cluster analysis of collected mass spectra matched to multi locus sequence typing data. the diagnostic model based on genetic algorithm classifier demonstrated the differentiation of alpha-hemolytic streptococci with 100% sensitivity and 94.6% accuracy. statistical analysis of ms peak areas revealed 2 peaks which are different for s. mitis and s. pneumoniae groups.

TI  == streptococcus
AB  == the genus streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. among  the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. the nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. for several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: s pyogenes (group a streptococci) and s pneumoniae (pneumococci). in 1984, two members were assigned  a new genus - the group d enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and e faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). in recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. a variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. some of the other medically important streptococci are s agalactiae (group b), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease;  e faecalis (group d), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include s mutans and s sanguis (involved in dental caries), s mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "s milleri" (associated with suppurative  infections in children and adults). there remains persistent taxonomic confusion  regarding "s milleri." these and other streptococci of medical importance are listed intable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.

TI  == identification, variation and transcription of pneumococcal repeat sequences.
AB  == background: small interspersed repeats are commonly found in many bacterial chromosomes. two families of repeats (box and rup) have previously been identified in the genome of streptococcus pneumoniae, a nasopharyngeal commensal  and respiratory pathogen of humans. however, little is known about the role they  play in pneumococcal genetics. results: analysis of the genome of s. pneumoniae atcc 700669 revealed the presence of a third repeat family, which we have named sprite. all three repeats are present at a reduced density in the genome of the closely related species s. mitis. however, they are almost entirely absent from all other streptococci, although a set of elements related to the pneumococcal box repeat was identified in the zoonotic pathogen s. suis. in conjunction with information regarding their distribution within the pneumococcal chromosome, this suggests that it is unlikely that these repeats are specialised sequences performing a particular role for the host, but rather that they constitute parasitic elements. however, comparing insertion sites between pneumococcal sequences indicates that they appear to transpose at a much lower rate than is elements. some large box elements in s. pneumoniae were found to encode open reading frames on both strands of the genome, whilst another was found to form a  composite rna structure with two t box riboswitches. in multiple cases, such box  elements were demonstrated as being expressed using directional rna-seq and rt-pcr. conclusions: box, rup and sprite repeats appear to have proliferated extensively throughout the pneumococcal chromosome during the species' past, but  novel insertions are currently occurring at a relatively slow rate. through their extensive secondary structures, they seem likely to affect the expression of genes with which they are co-transcribed. software for annotation of these repeats is freely available from ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/strep_repeats/.

TI  == development of amperometric magnetogenosensors coupled to asymmetric pcr for the  specific detection of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a disposable magnetogenosensor for the rapid, specific and sensitive detection of streptococcus pneumoniae is reported. the developed procedure involves the use of streptavidin-modified magnetic beads, a specific biotinylated capture probe that  hybridizes with a specific region of lyta, the gene encoding the pneumococcal major autolysin, and appropriate primers for asymmetric polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification. capture probes and amplicons specific for s. pneumoniae were selected by a careful analysis of all lyta alleles available. the selected primers amplify a 235-bp fragment of pneumococcal lyta. a detection limit (lod) of 5.1 nm was obtained for a 20-mer synthetic target dna without any amplification protocol, while the lod for the asymmetric pcr amplicon was 1.1 nm. a rsd value of 6.9% was obtained for measurements carried out with seven different genosensors for 1.1-nm apcr product. the strict specificity of the designed primers was demonstrated by apcr amplification of genomic dna prepared from different bacteria, including some closely related streptococci. direct asymmetric pcr (dapcr), using cells directly from broth cultures of s. pneumoniae, showed that dapcr products could be prepared with as few as 2 colony-forming units (cfu). furthermore, this methodology did not show any cross-reaction with closely related streptococci such as streptococcus mitis (or  streptococcus pseudopneumoniae) even when present in the culture at concentrations up to 10(5) times higher than that of s. pneumoniae. preliminary data for rapid detection of pneumococcus directly in clinical samples has shown that it is possible to discriminate between non-inoculated blood and urine samples and samples inoculated with only 10(3) cfu ml(-1) s. pneumoniae.

TI  == molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci in  viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == objectives: ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. however, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (cf) airways has not yet been examined. the aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (vgs), in terms of mics and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs). methods: the mics of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the qrdrs for 190 isolates of vgs, originating from the sputa of adult cf patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. vgs organisms included streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus australis and streptococcus mutans. ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and qrdrs within the gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. results: twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mics >/=8 mg/l) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (mics 4 mg/l). as a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive vgs organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-cf patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. five novel qrdr pcr assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the cf vgs population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential qrdr resistance mutations. double mutations  in gyra and parc/pare led to mics of 16 to >64 mg/l, while single mutations in parc or pare resulted in mics of 8-32 mg/l and 8 mg/l, respectively. the mean homologies of each species to streptococcus pneumoniae r6 were: gyra, 70.3%-95%;  gyrb, 69.6%-96.2%; parc, 76.1%-94.8%; and pare, 70.7%-94.7%. the close relatives  of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). conclusions: treatment of p. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with cf may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal vgs flora, where these organisms may potentially  act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the streptococcus milleri group.

AB  == proper identification of streptococcus pneumoniae by conventional methods remains problematic. the discriminatory power of the 16s rrna gene, which can be considered the "gold standard" for molecular identification, is too low to differentiate s. pneumoniae from closely related species such as streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis in the routine clinical laboratory. a 313-bp part of reca was selected on the basis of variability within the s. mitis group, showing <95.8% interspecies homology. in addition, 6 signature nucleotides specific for s. pneumoniae were identified within the 313-bp reca fragment. we show that reca analysis is a useful tool for  proper identification to species level within the s. mitis group, in particular,  for pneumococci.

TI  == identification of genes for small non-coding rnas that belong to the regulon of the two-component regulatory system ciarh in streptococcus.
AB  == background: post-transcriptional regulation by small rnas (srnas) in bacteria is  now recognized as a wide-spread regulatory mechanism modulating a variety of physiological responses including virulence. in streptococcus pneumoniae, an important human pathogen, the first srnas to be described were found in the regulon of the ciarh two-component regulatory system. five of these srnas were detected and designated csrnas for cia-dependent small rnas. ciarh pleiotropically affects beta-lactam resistance, autolysis, virulence, and competence development by yet to be defined molecular mechanisms. since ciarh is  highly conserved among streptococci, it is of interest to determine if csrnas are also included in the ciarh regulon in this group of organisms consisting of commensal as well as pathogenic species. knowledge on the participation of csrnas in ciarh-dependent regulatory events will be the key to define the physiological  role of this important control system. results: genes for csrnas were predicted in streptococcal genomes and data base entries other than s. pneumoniae by searching for ciar-activated promoters located in intergenic regions that are followed by a transcriptional terminator. 61 different candidate genes were obtained specifying csrnas ranging in size from 51 to 202 nt. comparing these genes among each other revealed 40 different csrna types. all streptococcal genomes harbored csrna genes, their numbers varying between two and six. to validate these predictions, s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. sanguinis were subjected  to csrna-specific northern blot analysis. in addition, a csrna gene from s. thermophilus plasmid pst0 introduced into s. pneumoniae was also tested. each of  the csrnas was detected on these blots and showed the anticipated sizes. thus, the method applied here is able to predict csrnas with high precision. conclusions: the results of this study strongly suggest that genes for small non-coding rnas, csrnas, are part of the regulon of the two-component regulatory  system ciarh in all streptococci.

TI  == [classical and new approaches in laboratory diagnosis of viridans streptococci].
AB  == viridans group streptococci (vgs) are gram-positive microorganisms that can form  alpha-hemolytic colonies on sheep blood agar. they reside as normal flora in oral cavity, respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital tract and on skin. they can cause bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis and septicemia following dental procedures. the diagnosis of vgs are difficult since the taxonomic classification and species na-mes may change due in time. viridans group streptococci are classified into 5 groups (sanguinis, mitis, mutans, salivarius, anginosus) according to biochemical reactions and 16s rrna sequencing. since streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the mitis group, the other important species in this group deserves investigation. genetic exchange between streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis and s.pneumoniae by transformation and lysis mechanisms occur continously as they share the same anatomical region. these mechanisms play role in exchanging capsular and antibiotic resistance genes between these species. the cultivation of vgs usually starts with the inoculation of various patient specimens into sheep blood agar and the detection of alpha-hemolytic colonies. observation of gram-positive cocci microscopically, the detection of optochin-resistant and bile insoluble colonies with few exceptions are the further important steps in laboratory diagnosis. vgs are then identified at species level by using biochemical reactions, automated diagnostic systems and molecular methods. the last step in the laboratory diagnosis of vgs is antibiotic susceptibility testing which is of outmost importance as penicillin and erythromycin resistance are on rise. in this review article, classification of vgs, similarities between s.pneumoniae and mitis group streptococci and the laboratory diagnosis of vgs have been discussed.

AB  == objective: to investigate the etiology and epidemic characteristics of hospital acquired pneumonia (hap) in children. method: a retrospective hospital infection  study was performed in 52,639 children admitted to our hospital from january 2005 to december 2008. result: six hundred and ninety eight patients were diagnosed as hap. the incidence of hap was 1.33%, among which, 108 (15.47%) cases were early-onset hap and 590 (84.53%) were late-onset hap. the hap patients aged 3 days to 15 years (503 male and 195 female). the proportion of patients younger than 1 year was 51.4%. main underlying diseases were cytomegalovirus hepatitis, congenital heart disease, malignant tumor, granulocytopenia or agranulocytosis, prematurity and low birth weight. there was significant difference in the incidences among different departments with the highest one seen in icu, followed by departments of infectious diseases, hematology and digestive diseases. two hundred and thirty one stains of pathogens were identified from sputum of 355 cases. one hundred and fifty six (67.5%) strains were gram-negative bacteria, which accounted for the highest proportion. there were 30 (13.0%) gram-positive bacterial strains, and 29 (12.6%) respiratory tract virus strains, and 15 (6.5%)  fungal strains, and 1 (0.4%) mycoplasma strain. the predominant bacterial pathogens were klebsiella pneumoniae, followed by stenotrophomonas maltophilia, burkholderia cepacia, escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii. the isolation rates of klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli with positive extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) were 94.8% and 85.7%, respectively. those two bacteria were universally resistant to the third and forth generations  cephalosporins. the main pathogens of early-onset hap were respiratory syncytial  virus (rsv), streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumonia, haemophilus influenzae and klebsiella pneumoniae, while the main pathogens of late-onset hap were esbls-positive klebsiella pneumonia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, burkholderia cepacia, escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii. conclusion: hap in children is most common in children younger than 1 year and with underlying diseases. the main pathogens are gram-negative bacteria. rsv was an important pathogen of hap. the pathogens of early-onset hap are different from those of late-onset hap. these results may be of some help in prevention and control of hap in children and in guiding for rational application of antibiotics, especially the empirical antibiotic choice.

AB  == background: streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the most important causes of microbial diseases in humans. the genomes of 44 diverse strains of s. pneumoniae  were analyzed and compared with strains of non-pathogenic streptococci of the mitis group. results: despite evidence of extensive recombination, the s. pneumoniae phylogenetic tree revealed six major lineages. with the exception of serotype 1, the tree correlated poorly with capsular serotype, geographical site  of isolation and disease outcome. the distribution of dispensable genes--genes present in more than one strain but not in all strains--was consistent with phylogeny, although horizontal gene transfer events attenuated this correlation in the case of ancient lineages. homologous recombination, involving short stretches of dna, was the dominant evolutionary process of the core genome of s.  pneumoniae. genetic exchange occurred both within and across the borders of the species, and s. mitis was the main reservoir of genetic diversity of s. pneumoniae. the pan-genome size of s. pneumoniae increased logarithmically with the number of strains and linearly with the number of polymorphic sites of the sampled genomes, suggesting that acquired genes accumulate proportionately to the age of clones. most genes associated with pathogenicity were shared by all s. pneumoniae strains, but were also present in s. mitis, s. oralis and s. infantis, indicating that these genes are not sufficient to determine virulence. conclusions: genetic exchange with related species sharing the same ecological niche is the main mechanism of evolution of s. pneumoniae. the open pan-genome guarantees the species a quick and economical response to diverse environments.

TI  == comparison of maldi tof with conventional identification of clinically relevant bacteria.
AB  == background: a completely new approach to diagnose microbial agents at least one day earlier based on mass spectrometric analysis becomes possible in the microbiology laboratory: maldi tof: matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight. comparison between results of the new procedure with those obtained by conventional testing is mandatory. methods: 204 clinical isolates grown on agar plates were analysed both, by the maldi tof bruker microflex apparatus and by conventional identification using the vitek ii and api systems,  both from biomerieux. results: of the identified isolates, 72 were gram-positive  and 130 gram-negative; 2 were yeasts (candida). concordance was seen with 61/72 (85%) of the gram-positive bacteria and with 115/130 (88%) of the gram-negative bacteria. in 27 samples (13.2%), a discrepancy of the species and/or genus was obvious. the discrepancy appeared with 16 gram-negative (12.2%) and with 11 gram-positive germs (15.3%, n.s.). in the latter group, 6 samples showed discordance with streptococcus pneumoniae (maldi) and streptococcus mitis/oralis  (conventional identification) constellation. among gram-negative samples, most differences occurred on the species level only, e.g. enterobacter cloacae versus  enterobacter kobei. in 5 cases, discordance was major and appeared on the genus level: enterobacter/raoultella, streptococcus/gemella, pseumdomonas/burkholderia, microbacter/sphingomonas and candida/cryptococcus. the most outstanding difference was microbacterium arborescens (maldi tof) and sphingomonas paucimobilis (conventional). molecular biological identification of two streptococcus mitis group bacteria confirmed the erroneous diagnosis by maldi tof of streptococcus pneumoniae. conclusion: good comparability between maldi tof analysis and conventional identification procedures (86.8%) but special caution is needed when identifying streptococcal species.

TI  == bacterial 16s sequence analysis of severe caries in young permanent teeth.
AB  == previous studies have confirmed the association of the acid producers streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp. with childhood caries, but they also  suggested these microorganisms are not sufficient to explain all cases of caries. in addition, health-associated bacterial community profiles are not well understood, including the importance of base production and acid catabolism in ph homeostasis. the bacterial community composition in health and in severe caries of the young permanent dentition was compared using sanger sequencing of the ribosomal 16s rrna genes. lactobacillus species were dominant in severe caries, and levels rose significantly as caries progressed from initial to deep lesions.  s. mutans was often observed at high levels in the early stages of caries but also in some healthy subjects and was not statistically significantly associated  with caries progression in the overall model. lactobacillus or s. mutans was found either at low levels or not present in several samples. other potential acid producers observed at high levels in these subjects included strains of selenomonas, neisseria, and streptococcus mitis. propionibacterium fma5 was significantly associated with caries progression but was not found at high levels. an overall loss of community diversity occurred as caries progressed, and species that significantly decreased included the streptococcus mitis-s. pneumoniae-s. infantis group, corynebacterium matruchotii, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eubacterium ir009,  campylobacter rectus, and lachnospiraceae sp. c1. the relationship of acid-base metabolism to 16s rrna gene-based species assignments appears to be complex, and  metagenomic approaches that would allow functional profiling of entire genomes will be helpful in elucidating the microbial pathogenesis of caries.

TI  == matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry identifies 90% of bacteria directly from blood culture vials.
AB  == matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) is now widely used for marker/multi-biomarker detection in medical diagnosis. we tested a new protocol for bacterial identification from blood culture broths in hospital routine by using collection tubes with separator gels  on 503 included samples examined over 3 months, where 1.5 ml was injected by a syringe into bd vacutainer tubes from bactec-positive bottles, before processing  for bacterial protein extraction. samples were loaded in duplicate onto the maldi ms target, allowing a series of 12 samples to be processed in duplicate within 80 min by using biflex iii and biotyper 2.0 software (bruker). including polymicrobial samples, 193 of 213 of gram-negative bacteria (91.08%) and 284 of 319 of gram-positive bacteria (89.02%) were correctly identified at the species level. enterobacteriaceae constituted 35.15% of all species found, staphylococaceae 37.96%, streptococaceae and enterococaceae 20.85%, pseudomonadaceae 1.69%, and anaerobes 2.44%. in most of the polymicrobial samples, one of the species present was identified (80.9%). seven isolates remained misidentified as streptococcus pneumoniae, all belonging to streptococcus mitis. staphylococcus aureus was identified better when grown on anaero-aerobic medium, and maldi biotyper identification scores as low as 1.4 were pertinent, provided that four successive proposals of the same species were  given. this new protocol correlates with conventional microbiology procedures by  up to 90%, and by >95% for only monomicrobial samples, and provides a decreased turn-around time for identification of bacteria isolated from blood cultures, making this technology suitable also for blood cultures, with less delay and cost decreases in bacterial diagnostics, and favouring better care of patients.

TI  == genome sequence of the temperate bacteriophage ph10 from streptococcus oralis.
AB  == exponential growing cultures of streptococcus oralis strain omz 1038, isolated from human supragingival dental plaque, were found to release a bacteriophage (designated ph10) upon treatment with mitomycin c. the complete genome sequence of phage ph10 was determined. the genome was 31276 bp in size and contained 54 open reading frames. the module encoding structural proteins was highly similar to that of streptococcus pneumoniae prophage phispn_3. the most abundant phage structural protein was encoded by orf35 and was likely processed by proteolytic cleavage. the putative endolysin from ph10, which contained a muramidase domain and a choline-binding domain, was purified and shown to have lytic activity with  s. oralis, s. pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis, but not with other streptococcal species.

TI  == the rgg gene is a specific marker for streptococcus oralis.
AB  == although the pathogenesis of streptococcus oralis may be different from that of other viridans group streptococci, s. oralis shares a high degree of dna sequence similarity with these streptococci. as a result, discrimination of s. oralis from its close relatives has long been considered difficult. this study was conducted  to find specific genes that allow for the in vitro identification of s. oralis, but not other oral commensals. four hundred ninety s. oralis clones obtained by suppressive subtractive hybridization were used for southern hybridization, and positive clones were sequenced. of 5 s. oralis-specific clones, newly designed primer sets based on the glucosyltransferase regulatory gene amplified genomic dna only from s. oralis strains, but not from any of the other 125 strains tested. our findings may be useful for the future development of efficient diagnostic tools for the rapid identification and differentiation of s. oralis from other oral streptococci strains.

TI  == real-time pcr assays for the detection and quantification of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is the main etiologic agent of pneumonia worldwide. because the members of the viridans group streptococci share a high degree of dna sequence homologies, phenotypic and genotypic discriminations of s. pneumoniae from the viridans group are difficult. a quantitative real-time pcr assay targeting the capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis gene (cpsa) was developed as a species-specific detection tool for s. pneumoniae. the specificity was evaluated  using genomic dnas extracted from 135 oral cocci strains. twenty-seven s. pneumoniae strains tested positive, whereas 108 other strains including streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis did not show a specific signal. the linear regression of standard curves indicated high correlations between the log numbers of s. pneumoniae cells and the c(t) values (r(2)=0.99). the minimal limit of detection was 32 fg of purified genomic  dna, equivalent to 14 genomes of s. pneumoniae. this new real-time pcr method may be very useful as a rapid and specific tool for detecting and quantifying s. pneumoniae.

TI  == identification of the cpsa gene as a specific marker for the discrimination of streptococcus pneumoniae from viridans group streptococci.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae, the aetiological agent of pneumonia and non-gonococcal  urethritis, shares a high degree of dna sequence identity with the viridans group of streptococci, particularly streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis. although their clinical and pathological manifestations are different, discrimination between s. pneumoniae and its close viridans cocci relatives is still quite difficult. suppression subtractive hybridization was performed to identify the genomic differences between s. pneumoniae and s. mitis. thirty-four  resulting s. pneumoniae-specific clones were examined by sequence determination and comparative dna sequence analysis using blast. s. pneumoniae-specific primers were subsequently designed from one of the clonal dna sequences containing the cps gene (coding for capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis). the primer specificities were evaluated using 49 viridans streptococci including 26 s. pneumoniae, 54 other streptococci, 14 lactococcus species, 14 enterococcus species and three vagococcus species, and compared with the specificities of previously described autolysin (lyta), pneumolysin (ply), spn9802 and spn9828 primers. the newly designed cpsa-specific primer set was highly specific to s. pneumoniae and was even better than the existing primers. these findings may help improve the rapid identification and differentiation of s. pneumoniae from closely related members of the viridans group streptococci.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI  == identification of horizontal gene transfer and recombination of psaa gene in streptococcus mitis group.
AB  == pneumococcal surface adhesin a (psaa) gene is universally confirmed as one of the streptococcus pneumoniae adhesion genes, but it is disputed whether the psaa gene is a streptococcus pneumoniae species-specific gene. in the present study, the presence of the psaa gene in 34 streptococcus mitis group isolates was identified by the pcr approach and a comparison of sequencing pcr products (streptococcus pneumoniae r6 as the control strain). also, the evolutionary scenarios of these psaa genes in these streptococcus mitis group isolates were analyzed by a phylogenetic tree based on the housekeeping genes (soda and rnpb) and psaa genes. as a result, a high degree of conservation of open reading frame sequences in all six streptococcus pneumoniae strains (100% similarity) and in the other species of the streptococcus mitis group (92.6-100% similarity) was revealed. further genetics research based on housekeeping genes and psaa gene phylogenies showed that the psaa gene was of vertical inheritance only in streptococcus pneumoniae;  however, high-frequency horizontal psaa gene transfer and recombination occurred  in the other species of the streptococcus mitis group. these findings confirmed that the psaa gene was not a streptococcus pneumoniae species-specific gene, and  high-frequency hgt and recombination events may explain the presence of the psaa  gene in the other species of the streptococcus mitis group.

AB  == background: anaerobes are the first and streptococcus species the second most common cause of community-acquired lung abscess (cala) in the west. the etiologic pathogens of this disease have changed in taiwan, with klebsiella pneumoniae being reported as the most common cause of cala. objective: to determine the etiologies of community-acquired lung abscess. methods: we retrospectively reviewed the records of 205 japanese adult patients with cala to evaluate etiologies and outcomes. we used not only traditional microbiological investigations but also percutaneous ultrasonography-guided transthoracic needle  aspiration and protected specimen brushes. results: of these 205 patients, 122 had documented bacteriological results, with 189 bacterial species isolated. pure aerobic, mixed aerobic and anaerobic, and pure anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 90 (73.8%), 17 (13.9%), and 15 (12.3%) patients, respectively. the four most common etiologic pathogens were streptococcus species (59.8%), anaerobes (26.2%), gemella species (9.8%), and k. pneumoniae (8.2%). streptococcus mitis was the most common among the streptococcus species. mean duration of antibiotic administration was 26 days. six patients (2.9%, 3 with actinomycosis and 3 with nocardiosis) were treated with antibiotics for 76-189 days. two patients with anaerobic lung abscess died. conclusions: the first and second most common etiologic pathogens of cala in our hospital were streptococcus species and anaerobes, respectively. the etiologies in our study differ from those in taiwan  and are similar to those in the west with the exception that streptococcus species were the most common etiologic pathogens in our study whereas anaerobes are the most frequent etiologic pathogens in western countries. s. mitis and gemella species are important etiologic pathogens as well. the identification of  actinomyces and nocardia is important in order to define the adequate duration of antibiotic administration.

TI  == rpoa is a useful gene for identification and classification of streptococcus pneumoniae from the closely related viridans group streptococci.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae, the leading etiological agent of pneumonia, shares a high degree of dna sequence homology with the viridans group of streptococci. the clinical and pathological manifestations may present with different features, and discrimination between s. pneumoniae and its close viridans cocci relatives, such as streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis, is still quite difficult. the 445-bp sequences of the n-terminal region of rpoa from nine s. pneumoniae, seven  s. mitis, ten s. oralis, and two related strains were determined and compared with their respective 16s rrna gene sequences to establish their usefulness in phylogenetic analysis. pairwise comparisons of rpoa sequences among the species showed higher rates of evolution with lower similarities (92.3-100%) than those of 16s rrna genes (96.8-100%). the rpoa-based phylogeny generated deeper branches and presented improved discriminatory resolution than the 16s rrna gene-based phylogeny. these results show that rpoa sequences represent a consistent, but more discriminating, genomic marker than 16s rrna gene sequences for investigating the evolutionary relationships of streptococcus at the species level. rpoa could be a useful marker for identifying and classifying s. pneumoniae, s. mitis, and s. oralis from closely related taxa.

TI  == phenotypic and genomic characterization of pneumococcus-like streptococci isolated from hiv-seropositive patients.
AB  == accurate differentiation between pneumococci and other viridans streptococci is essential given their differences in clinical significance. however, classical phenotypic tests are often inconclusive, and many examples of atypical reactions  have been reported. in this study, we applied various phenotypic and genotypic methods to discriminate between a collection of 12 streptococci isolated from the upper respiratory tract of hiv-seropositive individuals in 1998 and 1999. conventional phenotypic characterization initially classified these streptococci  as streptococcus pneumoniae, as they were all sensitive to optochin and were all  bile soluble. however, they did not agglutinate with anti-pneumococcal capsular antibodies and were also far more resistant to antimicrobial agents than typeable pneumococci isolated in the same period. genotypic characterization of these isolates and control isolates by both multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa) and comparative genomic hybridization (cgh) showed that only a single isolate was genetically considered to be a true s. pneumoniae isolate, and that the remaining 11 non-typable isolates were indeed distinct from true pneumococci. of these, 10  most closely resembled a subgroup of streptococcus mitis isolates genetically, while one strain was identified as a streptococcus pseudopneumoniae isolate. cgh  also showed that a considerable part of the proposed pneumococcal core genome, including many of the known pneumococcal virulence factors, was conserved in the  non-typable isolates. sequencing of part of the 16s rrna gene and investigation for the presence of ply by pcr corroborated these results. in conclusion, our findings confirm the close relationship between streptococci of the mitis group,  and show that both mlsa and cgh enable pneumococci to be distinguished from other mitis group streptococci.

AB  == matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry is a rapid, accurate method for identifying bacteria and fungi recovered on agar culture media. we report herein a method for the direct identification of bacteria in positive blood culture broths by maldi-tof mass spectrometry. a total of 212 positive cultures were examined, representing 32 genera and 60 species or groups. the identification of bacterial isolates by maldi-tof mass spectrometry was compared with biochemical testing, and discrepancies were resolved by gene sequencing. no identification (spectral score of < 1.7) was obtained for 42 (19.8%) of the isolates, due most commonly to insufficient numbers of bacteria in the blood culture broth. of the bacteria with a spectral score of > or = 1.7, 162 (95.3%) of 170 isolates were correctly identified. all 8 isolates of streptococcus mitis were misidentified as being streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. this method provides a rapid, accurate, definitive identification of bacteria within 1 h of detection in positive blood cultures with the caveat that the identification of s. pneumoniae would have to be confirmed by an alternative test.

TI  == highly penicillin-resistant multidrug-resistant pneumococcus-like strains colonizing children in oeiras, portugal: genomic characteristics and implications for surveillance.
AB  == while performing surveillance studies in oeiras, portugal, designed to describe the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on colonization, we observed an increase from 0.7% in 2003 to 5% in 2006 in the prevalence of penicillin resistance (mic of 2 to 6 mg/liter) among presumptively identified pneumococcal isolates. although 15 of the 22 penicillin-resistant isolates obtained in 2006 were optochin resistant, they were bile soluble and thus considered to be bona fide pneumococci. this study aimed to clarify the nature of these isolates by using a combination of phenotypic and genotypic approaches that included routine  strategies for pneumococcal identification, multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa),  and comparative genomic hybridization (cgh). by mlsa, all isolates were classified as "streptococci of the mitis group" that, however, were distinct from typical streptococcus pneumoniae or streptococcus mitis. a single isolate was identified as streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. cgh confirmed these findings and further indicated that a considerable part of the proposed pneumococcal core genome is conserved in these isolates, including several pneumococcal virulence genes (e.g., pava, spxb, cbpe, and cbpd). these results suggest that among pneumococci and closely related streptococci, universal unique phenotypic and genetic properties that could aid species identification are virtually impossible to define. in pneumococcal colonization studies, when atypical strains are found, mlsa and cgh are informative tools that can be used to complement routine tests.  in our study, after correct identification of the penicillin-resistant true pneumococci, we found that penicillin resistance levels among pneumococci remained stable from 2003 to 2006.

AB  == objectives: although long-term use of azithromycin has shown a significant clinical improvement for patients with cystic fibrosis (cf), its long-term effect on the susceptibility of commensal flora within cf airways has not yet been examined. we therefore suggest that long-term use of azithromycin increases macrolide resistance in commensal streptococci. methods: erythromycin susceptibility in naturally colonizing viridans group streptococci (vgs) was characterized, as well as macrolide resistance gene determinants through sequence analysis, in pneumococci (n = 15) and vgs [n = 84; i.e. streptococcus salivarius  (n = 30), streptococcus mitis (n = 17), streptococcus sanguinis (n = 11), streptococcus oralis (n = 10), streptococcus parasanguinis (n = 6), streptococcus gordonii (n = 3), streptococcus infantis (n = 3), streptococcus cristatus (n = 2), streptococcus anginosus (n = 1) and streptococcus australis (n = 1)] isolated from sputum from 24 adult cf patients, who were on oral azithromycin therapy for  at least the previous 7 months. results: almost three-quarters of isolates (74; 74.7%) were resistant to erythromycin, whilst a further 15 (15.2%) had reduced susceptibility, leaving only 10 (10.1%) isolates susceptible to erythromycin. the majority (89.8%) were not susceptible to erythromycin, as demonstrated by possession of the erm(b) gene in 25/99 (25.3%), the mef(a) gene in 1/99 (1.0%), the mef(e) gene in 75/99 (75.8%) and both erm(b) and mef(e) genes simultaneously  in 11/99 (11.1%). these results indicate that genotypic resistance for macrolides is common in vgs in adult cf patients, with efflux being over three times more frequent. conclusions: long-term treatment with azithromycin in cf patients may reduce antibiotic susceptibility in commensal vgs, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of macrolide resistance determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens.

AB  == we previously reported that cell wall polysaccharide (cwps) given to mice intranasally with adjuvant induces serotype-independent immunity to pneumococci.  some strains make cwps with one phosphocholine group (cwps/1), but most express two per tetrasaccharide repeat unit (cwps/2). here, cwps/1 and cwps/2 were equally protective against colonization by cwps/2-type pneumococci, but the related streptococcus mitis polymer lacking phosphocholine was non-protective. previously the protection was shown to be cd4+t cell-dependent, abrogated by antiserum to interleukin (il)-17a, and demonstrable in antibody-defective mice. here, cwps failed to protect il-17a receptor knockout mice, further indicating il-17a-dependence. when commercial cwps/1 was size-fractionated preparatively, the larger exceeded the smaller molecules in their capacity to prime for il-17a responses, and only the larger protected against pneumococcal colonization. however, a cwps-tetanus toxoid conjugate - despite raising high titers of phosphocholine antibody - was non-protective, confirming the irrelevance of humoral immunity in this model. the results strengthen the concept that il-17a-mediated t cell immunity is inducible by zwitterionic polysaccharides with sufficient chain length to provide coiled secondary structure. coupling cwps to protein, which paradoxically prevents protection, may occlude this regular linear conformation. we suggest that mucosal immunization with cwps primes t(h)17 cells, which - upon contact with the phosphocholine of colonizing pneumococci - elaborate il-17a, enhancing phagocytosis.

TI  == comparative genomic analysis of ten streptococcus pneumoniae temperate bacteriophages.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is an important human pathogen that often carries temperate bacteriophages. as part of a program to characterize the genetic makeup of prophages associated with clinical strains and to assess the potential roles that they play in the biology and pathogenesis in their host, we performed comparative genomic analysis of 10 temperate pneumococcal phages. all of the genomes are organized into five major gene clusters: lysogeny, replication, packaging, morphogenesis, and lysis clusters. all of the phage particles observed showed a siphoviridae morphology. the only genes that are well conserved in all the genomes studied are those involved in the integration and the lysis of the host in addition to two genes, of unknown function, within the replication module. we observed that a high percentage of the open reading frames contained no similarities to any sequences catalogued in public databases; however, genes that were homologous to known phage virulence genes, including the pblb gene of streptococcus mitis and the vape gene of dichelobacter nodosus, were also identified. interestingly, bioinformatic tools showed the presence of a toxin-antitoxin system in the phage phispn_6, and this represents the first time  that an addition system in a pneumophage has been identified. collectively, the temperate pneumophages contain a diverse set of genes with various levels of similarity among them.

TI  == denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of pcr-amplified gki genes: a new technique for tracking streptococci.
AB  == viridans group streptococci (vgs) are a well-known cause of infections in immunocompromised patients, accounting for severe morbidity and mortality. streptococcus mitis group species (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis) are among the vgs most often encountered in clinical practice. identifying the portal of entry for s. mitis group strains is crucial for interventions preventing bacterial translocation. unfortunately, tracking the source of s. mitis group strains is dependent on a combination of extremely laborious and time-consuming cultivation and molecular techniques (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-pcr [eric-pcr]). to simplify this procedure, a pcr analysis with newly designed primers targeting the household gene glucose kinase (gki) was used in combination with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). this gki-pcr-dgge technique proved to be specific for s. mitis group strains. moreover, these strains could be detected in samples comprised of highly diverse microbiota, without prior cultivation. to study the feasibility of this new approach, a pilot study was performed. this confirmed that the source of s. mitis group bacteremia in pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia could be tracked back to the throat in five out of six episodes of bacteremia, despite the fact that throat samples are polymicrobial samples containing multiple s. mitis group strains. in contrast, using the classical combination of cultivation techniques and eric-pcr, we could detect these strains in only two out of six cases, showing the superiority of the newly  developed technique. the new gki-pcr-dgge technique can track the source of s. mitis group strains in polymicrobial samples without prior cultivation. therefore, it is a valuable tool in future epidemiological studies.

TI  == population structure of streptococcus oralis.
AB  == streptococcus oralis is a member of the normal human oral microbiota, capable of  opportunistic pathogenicity; like related oral streptococci, it exhibits appreciable phenotypic and genetic variation. a multilocus sequence typing (mlst) scheme for s. oralis was developed and the resultant data analysed to examine the population structure of the species. analysis of 113 isolates, confirmed as belonging to the s. oralis/mitis group by 16s rrna gene sequencing, characterized the population as highly diverse and undergoing inter- and intra-species recombination with a probable clonal complex structure. clonalframe analysis of these s. oralis isolates along with examples of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae grouped the named species  into distinct, coherent populations and did not support the clustering of s. pseudopneumoniae with s. mitis as reported previously using distance-based methods. analysis of the individual loci suggested that this discrepancy was due  to the possible hybrid nature of s. pseudopneumoniae. the data are available on the public mlst website (http://pubmlst.org/soralis/).

TI  == identification of clinically relevant nonhemolytic streptococci on the basis of sequence analysis of 16s-23s intergenic spacer region and partial gdh gene.
AB  == nonhemolytic streptococci (nhs) cause serious infections, such as endocarditis and septicemia. many conventional phenotypic methods are insufficient for the identification of bacteria in this group to the species level. genetic analysis has revealed that single-gene analysis is insufficient for the identification of  all species in this group of bacteria. the aim of the present study was to establish a method based on sequence analysis of the 16s-23s intergenic spacer (its) region and the partial gdh gene to identify clinical relevant nhs to the species level. sequence analysis of the its region was performed with 57 nhs reference or clinical strains. satisfactory identification to the species level was achieved for 14/19 nhs species included in this study on the basis of sequence analysis of the its region. streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis obtained the expected taxon as the best taxon match, but there was a short maximum score distance to the next best match (distance, <10). streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus pneumoniae could not be unambiguously discriminated by sequence analysis of the its region, as was also proven by phylogenetic analysis. these five species could be identified to the group level only by its sequence analysis. partial gdh sequence analysis was  applied to the 11 s. oralis strains, the 11 s. mitis strains, and the 17 s. pneumoniae strains. all except one strain achieved a satisfactory identification  to the species level. a phylogenetic algorithm based on the analysis of partial gdh gene sequences revealed three distinct clusters. we suggest that sequence analysis of the combination of the its region and the partial gdh gene can be used in the reference laboratory for the species-level identification of nhs.

TI  == breakthrough in penicillin resistance? streptococcus pneumoniae isolates with penicillin/cefotaxime mics of 16 mg/l and their genotypic and geographical relatedness.
AB  == objectives: to phenotypically and genotypically characterize 11 strains (isolated in four different centres) exhibiting penicillin mic of 8-32 mg/l among isolates  of the spice project. nine isolates were from romania (9/162; 5.56%) and two from poland (2/305; 0.66%). methods: in vitro susceptibility was determined in triplicate by microdilution (clsi guidelines), and additionally, mics of penicillin, cefotaxime and amoxicillin were confirmed in triplicate by agar dilution. multilocus sequence typing (mlst), pfge and gene amplification and sequencing were performed. results: for the nine romanian isolates, mics were >/=16 mg/l for penicillin, cefotaxime and amoxicillin, >/=32 mg/l for cefuroxime  and cefpodoxime, 4-8 mg/l for cefditoren and >/=128 mg/l for erythromycin and gentamicin. all isolates were non-susceptible to imipenem (mic = 0.5-1 mg/l) and  susceptible to levofloxacin (mic = 0.5-1 mg/l) and vancomycin (mic = 0.25-0.5 mg/l). these romanian strains presented a new cluster in the 595-600 region of pbp2x (ysgiql-->lstpwf) conferring 98% homology with streptococcus mitis pbp2x, with a new murm allele (seven strains) with eight amino acid changes versus r6. pbp nucleotide sequences were highly conserved suggesting a common origin. allelic profiles of two strains gave sequence type 321, three strains exhibited a single- and four a double-locus variance. mlst-predicted serotype was 23f in all  but one strain (19f), but three strains were 19a by quellung. conclusions: the multidrug high resistance (precluding adequate oral therapy in children), its origin, the prevalence found in romania and the presence of non-vaccine (7-valent) serotypes should worry the medical community because of a possible clonal diffusion that would limit therapeutic alternatives.

TI  == fluorescence in situ hybridisation (fish) accelerates identification of gram-positive cocci in positive blood cultures.
AB  == sepsis is a life-threatening disease with a high mortality rate. rapid identification of blood culture isolates plays a crucial role in adequate antimicrobial therapy in sepsis patients. to accelerate microbiological diagnosis, a comprehensive panel of oligonucleotide probes for fluorescence in situ hybridisation (fish) targeting gram-positive cocci was compiled and evaluated on 428 positive blood culture specimens. by combining genus-specific and species-specific probes, the assay allowed discrimination of staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci as well as differentiation of therapy-relevant pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium/durans. furthermore, the newly designed fish probes strep2, enco and granu targeted streptococcus pneumoniae/mitis, enterococcus spp. (except e. faecalis) and granulicatella adiacens group, respectively. the fish assay achieved an overall sensitivity of 98.65% and a specificity of 99.0% and therefore allowed rapid and  reliable molecular identification of gram-positive cocci in blood culture specimens.

AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus [pnc]) is a causative agent of many infectious diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media, and conjunctivitis. there have been documented conjunctivitis outbreaks in which nontypeable (nt), nonencapsulated pnc has been identified as the etiological agent. the use of mass spectrometry to comparatively and differentially analyze protein and peptide profiles of whole-cell microorganisms remains somewhat uncharted. in this report, we discuss a comparative proteomic analysis between nt s. pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak strains (cpnc) and other known typeable or  nt pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates (including pnc tigr4 and r6, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes) and nonstreptococcal isolates (including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus) as controls. cpnc cells and controls were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, and subsequently treated with a 10% trifluoroacetic acid-sinapinic acid matrix mixture. protein and peptide fragments of the whole-cell bacterial isolate-matrix combinations ranging in size from 2 to 14 kda were evaluated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. additionally random forest analytical tools and dendrogramic representations (genesis) suggested similarities and clustered the isolates into distinct clonal groups, respectively. also, a peak list of protein and peptide masses was obtained and compared to a known pnc protein mass library, in which a peptide common and unique to cpnc isolates was tentatively identified. information gained from this  study will lead to the identification and validation of proteins that are commonly and exclusively expressed in cpnc strains which could potentially be used as a biomarker in the rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal conjunctivitis.

TI  == evolution of streptococcus pneumoniae and its close commensal relatives.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the mitis group of streptococci which, according to 16s rrna-sequence based phylogenetic reconstruction, includes 12 species. while other species of this group are considered prototypes of commensal bacteria, s. pneumoniae is among the most frequent microbial killers worldwide. population genetic analysis of 118 strains, supported by demonstration of a distinct cell wall carbohydrate structure and competence pheromone sequence signature, shows that s. pneumoniae is one of several hundred evolutionary lineages forming a cluster separate from streptococcus oralis and streptococcus infantis. the remaining lineages of this distinct cluster are commensals previously collectively referred to as streptococcus mitis and each represent separate species by traditional taxonomic standard. virulence genes including the operon for capsule polysaccharide synthesis and genes encoding iga1 protease, pneumolysin, and autolysin were randomly distributed among s. mitis lineages. estimates of the evolutionary age of the lineages, the identical location of remnants of virulence genes in the genomes of commensal strains, the pattern of genome reductions, and the proportion of unique genes and their origin support the model that the entire cluster of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, and s. mitis lineages evolved from pneumococcus-like bacteria presumably pathogenic to the common immediate ancestor of hominoids. during their adaptation to a commensal life style, most of the lineages gradually lost the majority of genes determining virulence and became genetically distinct due to sexual isolation in  their respective hosts.

TI  == risk of bacteremia in bleeding and nonbleeding gastric varices after endoscopic injection of cyanoacrylate.
AB  == background and study aim: bacteremia is common in cirrhosis with gastrointestinal bleeding, including variceal bleeding. elective esophageal sclerotherapy and banding have been reported to cause bacteremia. the risk associated with therapeutic endoscopy in patients with gastric varices has not yet been reported. this study was conducted to compare the risk of bacteremia between patients with  active gastric variceal bleeding and those with gastric varices that were not actively bleeding who underwent n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate injection. patients and methods: patients were categorized into three groups: group i, patients with bleeding gastric varices who underwent cyanoacrylate injection for hemostasis (n  = 20); group ii, patients who underwent elective cyanoacrylate injection for further obliteration of gastric varices (n = 18); and group iii, patients with cirrhosis who underwent endoscopic surveillance for varices, and patients with gastric varices who presented for a follow-up endoscopy without a requirement for treatment (n = 17). blood culture was obtained before and 5 minutes and 3 hours after endoscopy. needle tips were also sent for culture. results: before procedures, blood cultures were positive in 4 patients (20 %) from group i. the number of positive blood cultures in group i at 5 minutes and 3 hours after the procedure were 3 (15 %) and 2 (10 %) respectively. the identified organisms were: klebsiella pneumoniae (2), escherichia coli (1), vibrio cholerae non-o1 (1). no patient from group ii had a positive culture at any point of blood drawn. only one in group iii had a positive culture, for streptococcus mitis at 5 minutes. no clinical evidence of infections occurred in any patient. needle-tip cultures grew mainly organisms from the oral and gastrointestinal tracts. conclusions: elective cyanoacrylate injection for nonbleeding gastric varices is not associated with significant bacteremia or infection. for this reason, prophylactic antibiotics may not be needed in this patient group. by contrast, prophylactic antibiotics are strongly recommended for patients with bleeding gastric varices undergoing cyanoacrylate injection.

TI  == characterization of a streptococcal cholesterol-dependent cytolysin with a lewis  y and b specific lectin domain.
AB  == the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs) are a large family of pore-forming toxins that often exhibit distinct structural changes that modify their pore-forming activity. a soluble platelet aggregation factor from streptococcus mitis (sm-hpaf) was characterized and shown to be a functional cdc with an amino-terminal fucose-binding lectin domain. sm-hpaf, or lectinolysin (lly) as renamed herein, is most closely related to cdcs from streptococcus intermedius (ily) and streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumolysin or ply). the lly gene was identified in strains of s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. lly induces pore-dependent changes in the light scattering properties of the platelets that mimic those induced by platelet aggregation but  does not induce platelet aggregation. lly monomers form the typical large homooligomeric membrane pore complex observed for the cdcs. the pore-forming activity of lly on platelets is modulated by the amino-terminal lectin domain, a  structure that is not present in other cdcs. glycan microarray analysis showed the lectin domain is specific for difucosylated glycans within lewis b (le (b)) and lewis y (le (y)) antigens. the glycan-binding site is occluded in the soluble monomer of lly but is apparently exposed after cell binding, since it significantly increases lly pore-forming activity in a glycan-dependent manner. hence, lly represents a new class of cdc whose pore-forming mechanism is modulated by a glycan-binding domain.

TI  == [periodontitis and cardiovascular disease].
AB  == the prevalence of periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (cvd) is high. a mixed infectious biofilm etiology of periodontitis is known but not fully established in cvd. cofactors; smoking habits, stress, ethnicity, genetics, socioeconomics and age contribute to both diseases. the objectives of this report are to summarize factors in regards to cvd and periodontitis that are clinically relevant. the hypothesis behind a relationship between the two conditions can be  founded in (i) shared infections etiology, (ii) shared inflammatory response, (iii) epidemiological and case-control studies, and (iv) periodontal studies demonstrating improvements of cvd markers. streptococcus species in the s. mitis  group, and s. anginosus group have been identified in periodontitis and are known as pathogens in endocarditis possibly transported from the oral cavity to the heart through bacteremia during dental therapies, and tooth brushing. other periodontal bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and parvimonas micra are beta-lactamase producing and may contribute to antibiotic resistance (extended spectrum beta-lactamases). other bacteria in cvd  and periodontitis include staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. chlamydia pneumoniae and p. gingivalis lipopolyysaccharide capsels share homology and induce heat-shock protein activity and a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines. associations between periodontitis and cvd have been presented in many studies when controlling for confounders. other studies have demonstrated that periodontal therapies increase brachial artery flow rate and reduce serum inflammatory cytokine levels. thus, physicians caring for subjects at cvd risk should consult with dentists/periodontists. dentists must improve their medical knowledge and also learn to consult with physicians when treating patients at cvd risk.

TI  == a predatory mechanism dramatically increases the efficiency of lateral gene transfer in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == bacteria that are competent for natural genetic transformation, such as pneumococci and their commensal relatives streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis, take up exogenous dna and incorporate it into their genomes by homologous recombination. traditionally, it has been assumed that genetic material leaking from dead bacteria constitutes the sole source of external dna for competent streptococci. here we describe a mechanism for active acquisition of homologous dna that dramatically increases the efficiency of gene exchange between and within the streptococcal species mentioned above. this mechanism gives competent  streptococci access to a common gene pool that is significantly larger than their own genomes, a property representing a considerable advantage when these bacteria are subjected to external selection pressures, such as vaccination and treatment  with antibiotics.

TI  == mutations in the tacf gene of clinical strains and laboratory transformants of streptococcus pneumoniae: impact on choline auxotrophy and growth rate.
AB  == the nutritional requirement that streptococcus pneumoniae has for the aminoalcohol choline as a component of teichoic and lipoteichoic acids appears to be exclusive to this prokaryote. a mutation in the tacf gene, which putatively encodes an integral membrane protein (possibly, a teichoic acid repeat unit transporter), has been recently identified as responsible for generating a choline-independent phenotype of s. pneumoniae (m. damjanovic, a. s. kharat, a. eberhardt, a. tomasz, and w. vollmer, j. bacteriol. 189:7105-7111, 2007). we now  report that streptococcus mitis can grow in choline-free medium, as previously illustrated for streptococcus oralis. while we confirmed the finding by damjanovic et al. of the involvement of tacf in the choline dependence of the pneumococcus, the genetic transformation of s. pneumoniae r6 by using s. mitis sk598 dna and several pcr-amplified tacf fragments suggested that a minimum of two mutations were required to confer improved fitness to choline-independent s.  pneumoniae mutants. this conclusion is supported by sequencing results also reported here that indicate that a spontaneous mutant of s. pneumoniae (strain jy2190) able to proliferate in the absence of choline (or analogs) is also a double mutant for the tacf gene. microscopic observations and competition experiments during the cocultivation of choline-independent strains confirmed that a minimum of two amino acid changes were required to confer improved fitness to choline-independent pneumococcal strains when growing in medium lacking any aminoalcohol. our results suggest complex relationships among the different regions of the tacf teichoic acid repeat unit transporter.

TI  == fitness of streptococcus pneumoniae fluoroquinolone-resistant strains with topoisomerase iv recombinant genes.
AB  == the low prevalence of ciprofloxacin-resistant (cp r) streptococcus pneumoniae isolates carrying recombinant topoisomerase iv genes could be attributed to a fitness cost imposed by the horizontal transfer, which often implies the acquisition of larger-than-normal pare-parc intergenic regions. a study of the transcription of these genes and of the fitness cost for 24 isogenic cp r strains was performed. six first-level transformants were obtained either with pcr products containing the parc quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of  s. pneumoniae cp r mutants with point mutations or with a pcr product that includes pare-qrdr-ant-parc-qrdr from a cp r streptococcus mitis isolate. the latter yielded two strains, t6 and t11, carrying parc-qrdr and pare-qrdr-ant-parc-qrdr, respectively. these first-level transformants were used  as recipients in further transformations with the gyra-qrdr pcr products to obtain 18 second-level transformants. in addition, strain tr7 (which contains the gyra e85k change) was used. reverse transcription-pcr experiments showed that pare and parc were cotranscribed in r6, t6, and t11; and a single promoter located upstream of pare was identified in r6 by primer extension. the fitness of the transformants was estimated by pairwise competition with r6 in both one-cycle and two-cycle experiments. in the one-cycle experiments, most strains carrying the gyra e85k change showed a fitness cost; the exception was recombinant t14. in the two-cycle experiments, a fitness cost was observed in most first-level transformants carrying the parc changes s79f, s79y, and d83y and the gyra e85k change; the exceptions were recombinants t6 and t11. the results suggest that there is no impediment due to a fitness cost for the spread of recombinant cp r s. pneumoniae isolates, since some recombinants (t6, t11, and t14) exhibited an ability to compensate for the cost.

TI  == identification of a human immunodominant b-cell epitope within the immunoglobulin a1 protease of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == background: the iga1 protease of streptococcus pneumoniae is a proteolytic enzyme that specifically cleaves the hinge regions of human iga1, which dominates most mucosal surfaces and is the major iga isotype in serum. this protease is expressed in all of the known pneumococcal strains and plays a major role in pathogen's resistance to the host immune response. the present work was focused at identifying the immunodominant regions of pneumococcal iga1 protease recognized by the human antibody response. results: an antigenic sequence corresponding to amino acids 420-457 (epia) of the iga gene product was identified by screening a pneumococcal phage display library with patients' sera. the epia peptide is conserved in all pneumococci and in two out of three s. mitis strains, while it is not present in other oral streptococci so far sequenced. this epitope was specifically recognized by antibodies present in sera from 90% of healthy adults, thus representing an important target of the humoral response  to s. pneumoniae and s. mitis infection. moreover, sera from 68% of children less than 4 years old reacted with the epia peptide, indicating that the human immune  response against streptococcal antigens occurs during childhood. conclusion: the  broad and specific recognition of the epia polypeptide by human sera demonstrate  that the pneumococcal iga1 protease contains an immunodominant b-cell epitope. the use of phage display libraries to identify microbe or disease-specific antigens recognized by human sera is a valuable approach to epitope discovery.

[4]]. the concentration of the cwps antibodies in non-immunized individuals often exceeds the concentration of the serotype-specific pneumococcal antibodies. therefore, the pneumococcal elisa requires an adsorption step to remove the unprotective cwps antibodies [konradsen hb, sorensen ub, henrichsen j. a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for measuring type-specific anti-pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide antibodies. j immunol meth 1993;164(1):13-20.

[8]]. recently a new pneumococcal cps elisa was recommended with an extra serum absorption step with 22f cps to remove antibodies against an extra unknown common cross-reactive component. the aim of this study was to characterize the active component in the  22f capsule. a non-capsulated pneumococci was prepared from a 22f capsulated pneumococci. the cell wall polysaccharide (cwps2) purified from this pneumococci  has a better adsorption potential than 22f capsule in the pneumococci elisa. structure characterization of the commercial available cwps and cwps2 was done by nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr). the nmr results showed that commercial cwps had one phosporylcholine per sugar repeat while the cwps2 had two phosporylcholine per sugar repeat explaining an immunological difference between the two variants  of cwps. in addition the licd2 gene responsible for the attachment of the second  cholin in the cwps tetra sugar repeat was inactive in the strain used for purifying the commercial cwps but active in the strain expressing cwps2.

TI  == bacterial diversity in aphthous ulcers.
AB  == introduction: recurrent aphthous ulcers are common lesions of the oral mucosa of  which the etiology is unknown. this study aimed to estimate the bacterial diversity in the lesions and in control mucosa in pooled samples using a culture-independent molecular approach. methods: samples were collected from ten  healthy individuals and ten individuals with a clinical history of recurrent aphthous ulcers. after dna extraction, the 16s ribosomal rna bacterial gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with universal primers; amplicons were cloned, sequenced and matched to the genbank database. results: a total of 535 clones were analyzed, defining 95 bacterial species. we identified 62 putative novel phylotypes. in recurrent aphthous ulcer lesions 57 phylotypes were detected, of which 11 were known species. control samples had 38 phylotypes, five of which were already known. only three species or phylotypes were abundant and common to both groups (gemella haemolysans, streptococcus mitis strain 209 and streptococcus pneumoniae r6). one genus was found only in recurrent aphthous ulcer samples (prevotella) corresponding to 16% of all lesion-derived clones. conclusion: the microbiota found in recurrent aphthous ulcers and in the control  groups diverged markedly and the rich variety of genera found can provide a new starting point for individual qualitative and quantitative analyses of bacteria associated with this oral condition.

TI  == fluoroquinolone resistance in atypical pneumococci and oral streptococci: evidence of horizontal gene transfer of fluoroquinolone resistance determinants from streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == atypical strains, presumed to be pneumococcus, with ciprofloxacin mics of > or =4.0 microg/ml and unique sequence variations within the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of the gyrase and topoisomerase genes in comparison with the streptococcus pneumoniae r6 strain, were examined. these strains were reidentified using phenotypic methods, including detection of optochin susceptibility, bile solubility, and agglutination by serotype-specific  antisera, and genotypic methods, including detection of pneumolysin and autolysin genes by pcr, 16s rrna sequencing, and multilocus sequence typing (mlst). the analysis based on concatenated sequences of the six mlst loci distinguished the "atypical" strains from pneumococci, and these strains clustered closely with s.  mitis. however, all these strains and five of nine strains from the viridans streptococcal group possessed one to three gyra, gyrb, parc, and pare genes whose qrdr sequences clustered with those of s. pneumoniae, providing evidence of horizontal transfer of the qrdrs of the gyrase and topoisomerase genes from pneumococci into viridans streptococci. these genes also conferred fluoroquinolone resistance to viridans streptococci. in addition, the fluoroquinolone resistance determinants of 32 well-characterized streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis strains from bacteremic patients were also compared. these strains have unique amino acid substitutions in gyra and parc that were distinguishable from those in fluoroquinolone-resistant pneumococci and the "atypical" isolates. both recombinational events and de novo mutations play an important role in the development of fluoroquinolone resistance.

TI  == crossing the barrier: evolution and spread of a major class of mosaic pbp2x in streptococcus pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis.
AB  == a paradigm for streptococcus interspecies gene transfer is represented by the mosaic pbp genes encoding the target enzymes for beta-lactam antibiotics, the penicillin-binding proteins, in streptococcus pneumoniae. we investigated a collection of oral streptococci from three continents by comprehensive multi-locus sequence typing analysis in order to trace the origin of a mosaic block belonging to a dominant family of mosaic pbp2x implicated in penicillin resistance of s. pneumoniae. one widespread family of mosaic pbp2x occurred in all three distinct clusters of s. pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis, documenting independent inter- and intraspecies recombination events. moreover, potential ancestor genes of this mosaic block could be identified in two penicillin-susceptible s. mitis strains from south africa and spain, facilitating the identification of pbp2x mutations relevant for resistance development.

TI  == identification of alpha-hemolytic streptococci by pyrosequencing the 16s rrna gene and by use of vitek 2.
AB  == alpha-hemolytic streptococci are very difficult to identify by phenotypic methods. in this study, a pyrosequencing method for the identification of streptococcal species based on two variable regions of the 16s rrna gene is described. almost all studied streptococcal species (n = 51) represented by their type strains could be differentiated except for some closely related species of the streptococcus bovis or s. salivarius group. the pyrosequencing results of alpha-hemolytic streptococci isolated from blood (n = 99) or from the normal pharyngeal microbiota (n = 25) were compared to the results obtained by the vitek 2 with gp card (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france). as expected, the results of  the two methods did not completely agree, but 93 (75.0%) of the isolates assigned to the same streptococcal group by both methods and 57 (46.0%) reached consistent results at the species level. however, 10 strains remained unidentified by vitek  2, and 4 isolates could not be assigned to any streptococcal group by pyrosequencing. identification of members of the s. mitis and s. sanguinis groups proved difficult for both methods. furthermore, the pyrosequencing analysis revealed great sequence variation, since only 43 (32.3%) of the 133 isolates analyzed by pyrosequencing had sequences identical to a type strain. the variation was greatest in the pharyngeal isolates, slightly lower in the blood culture isolates, and nonexistent in invasive pneumococcal isolates (n = 17) that all had the s. pneumoniae type strain sequence. the resolution of the results obtained by the two methods is impeded by the lack of a proper gold standard.

TI  == identification of a secreted cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (mitilysin) from streptococcus mitis.
AB  == we have detected a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin, which we have named mitilysin, in a small number of streptococcus mitis isolates. we have sequenced the mitilysin gene from seven isolates of s. mitis. comparisons with the pneumococcal pneumolysin gene show 15 amino acid substitutions. s. mitis appear to release mitilysin extracellularly. certain alleles of mitilysin are not recognized by a monoclonal antibody raised to the related toxin pneumolysin. based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and neutralization assay results, one  isolate of s. mitis may produce a further hemolytic toxin in addition to mitilysin. as genetic exchange is known to occur between s. mitis and streptococcus pneumoniae, this finding may have implications for the development  of vaccines or therapies for pneumococcal disease that are based on pneumolysin.

TI  == molecular characterization of disease-associated streptococci of the mitis group  that are optochin susceptible.
AB  == eight optochin-susceptible (opt(s)) alpha-hemolytic (viridans) streptococcus isolates were characterized at the molecular level. these isolates showed phenotypic characteristics typical of both viridans streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae. comparison of the sequence of housekeeping genes from these isolates with those of s. pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae suggested that the opt(s) isolates corresponded to streptococci of the mitis group. besides, the opt(s) streptococci were negative by a gen-probe accuprobe pneumococcus test and hybridized with specific pneumococcal probes (lyta and ply) but also with ant, a gene not present in most s. pneumoniae strains. moreover, the isolates were insoluble in 1% sodium deoxycholate but completely dissolved in 0.1% deoxycholate. sequence analysis of  the lyta gene revealed that the opt(s) streptococci carried lyta alleles characteristic of those present in nonpneumococcal streptococci of the mitis group. the determination of the partial nucleotide sequence embracing the atp operon encoding the f(o)f(1) h(+)-atpase indicated that the optochin susceptibility of the isolates was due to the acquisition of atpc, atpa, and part of atpb from s. pneumoniae by horizontal gene transfer.

TI  == use of the phoenix automated system for identification of streptococcus and enterococcus spp.
AB  == the phoenix system (becton dickinson diagnostic systems, sparks, md) was evaluated for identification (id) to the species level of streptococci and enterococci. two hundred clinical isolates were investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae organisms (n = 46), viridans group streptococci (n = 31), enterococcus faecium (n = 36), enterococcus faecalis (n = 25), and other catalase-negative cocci (n = 12). the api system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) was used as a comparator. molecular methods (sequencing of 16s rrna and zwf and gki genes and ddl gene amplification) were used to investigate discordant results. upon resolution of discrepancies, correct species id was achieved by the phoenix system for 121/129 (93.8%) streptococci and 63/70  (90.0%) enterococci. excellent results were obtained for s. pneumoniae (45/45) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (49/50). with regard to viridans streptococci, the accuracy of the phoenix system was 83.9%. among the latter organisms, the best performance was obtained with isolates of the streptococcus sanguinis group  and streptococcus anginosus group; problems were instead encountered with the streptococcus mitis group. four e. faecium and three e. faecalis isolates were misidentified as enterococcus casseliflavus/enterococcus gallinarum or enterococcus durans. thus, these isolates were identified only at the genus level. compared with commercially available systems, the phoenix system appears a reliable diagnostic tool for identifying clinically relevant streptococci and enterococci. the smic/id-2 panel proved particularly effective for beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci.

TI  == sites in the ch3 domain of human iga1 that influence sensitivity to bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == the influence of regions, other than the hinge, on the susceptibility of human iga1 to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases, was examined using iga1 mutants bearing amino acid deletions, substitutions, and domain swaps. iga1 lacking the tailpiece retained its susceptibility to cleavage by all of the iga1  proteases. the domain swap molecule alpha1alpha2gamma3, in which the ch3 domain of iga1 was exchanged for that of human igg1, was resistant to cleavage with the  type 1 and 2 serine iga1 proteases of neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and haemophilus influenzae, but remained sensitive to cleavage with  the metallo-iga1 proteases of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis. substitution of the iga1 calpha3  domain motif pro440 -phe443 into the corresponding position in the cgamma3 domain of alpha1alpha2gamma3 resulted now in sensitivity to the type 2 iga1 protease of  n. meningitidis, indicating the possible requirement of these amino acids for sensitivity to this protease. for the h. influenzae type 2 protease, resistance of an iga1 mutant in which the ch3 domain residues 399-409 were exchanged with those from igg1, but sensitivity of mutant hubovalpha3 in which the calpha3 domain of bovine iga replaces that of human iga1, suggests that ch3 domain residues glu403, gln406, and thr409 influence sensitivity to this enzyme. hence,  unlike the situation with the metallo-iga1 proteases of streptococcus spp., the sensitivity of human iga1 to cleavage with the serine iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus involves their binding to different sites specifically in the ch3 domain.

TI  == macrolide resistance can be transferred by conjugation from viridans streptococci to streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == efflux pumps encoded by mef genes are among the most common mechanisms of resistance to macrolides. these genes are often located on horizontally transferable elements such as transposons. we present data indicating conjugative transfer of the mef(e) gene from viridans streptococci to the pathogen streptococcus pyogenes. the mef(e) gene is located on the previously described mega (macrolide efflux genetic assembly) element. of 110 isolates tested, 85% of  those that carried the mef(a/e) gene carried it on mega, and in all cases of conjugal transfer of the mef(e) gene it was carried on mega. it therefore appears reasonable to draw the conclusion that this element is important in the lateral transfer of macrolide resistance between streptococci.

TI  == characteristic signatures of the lyta gene provide a basis for rapid and reliable diagnosis of streptococcus pneumoniae infections.
AB  == the nucleotide sequences of the lyta gene from 29 pneumococcal isolates of various serotypes and 22 additional streptococci of the mitis group (including two streptococcus pseudopneumoniae strains) have been compared and found to correspond to 19 typical (927-bp-long) and 20 atypical (921-bp-long) alleles. all the streptococcus pneumoniae strains harbored typical lyta alleles, whereas nonpneumococcal isolates belonging to the mitis group always carried atypical alleles. a sequence alignment showed that the main difference between typical and atypical lyta alleles resided in 102 nucleotide positions (including the 6 bp absent from atypical alleles). these nucleotides were perfectly conserved in all  the typical alleles studied, and the corresponding nucleotides of the atypical alleles were also perfectly conserved. the presence in these signatures of distinctive restriction sites (namely, snabi, xmni, and bsaai) allowed the development of a simple, reliable, and fast method that combines pcr amplification of the lyta gene, digestion with bsaai, and separation of the products by agarose gel electrophoresis. this assay allows the rapid and consistent identification of true s. pneumoniae strains and represents an improved diagnostic tool for the study of pneumococcal carriage.

TI  == distribution and genetic diversity of the abc transporter lipoproteins piua and piaa within streptococcus pneumoniae and related streptococci.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. the existence of approximately 90 antigenically distinct capsular serotypes has greatly complicated the development of an effective pneumococcal vaccine. virulence-associated proteins common and conserved among all capsular types now represent the best strategy to combat pneumococcal infections. piua and piaa are  the lipoprotein components of two pneumococcal iron abc transporters and are required for full virulence in mouse models of infection. here we describe a study of the distribution and genetic diversity of piua and piaa within typical and atypical s. pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus mitis strains. the genes encoding both piua and piaa were present in all typical pneumococci tested, (covering 20 and 27 serotypes, respectively). the piua gene was highly conserved within the typical pneumococci (0.3% nucleotide divergence), but was also present in "atypical" pneumococci and the closely related species s. mitis and s. oralis, showing up to 10.4% nucleotide divergence and 7.5% amino acid divergence from the typical pneumococcal alleles. conversely, the piaa gene  was found to be specific to typical pneumococci, 100% conserved, and absent from  the oral streptococci, including isolates of s. mitis known to possess pneumolysin and autolysin. these are desirable qualities for a vaccine candidate  and as a diagnostic tool for s. pneumoniae.

TI  == allelic variation of polymorphic locus lytb, encoding a choline-binding protein,  from streptococci of the mitis group.
AB  == the choline-binding protein lytb, an n-acetylglucosaminidase of streptococcus pneumoniae, is the key enzyme for daughter cell separation and is believed to play a critical pathogenic role, facilitating bacterial spreading during infection. because of these peculiarities lytb is a putative vaccine target. to determine the extent of lytb polymorphism, the lytb alleles from seven typical, clinical pneumococcal isolates of various serotypes and from 13 additional streptococci of the mitis group (12 atypical pneumococci and the streptococcus mitis type strain) were sequenced. sequence alignment showed that the main differences among alleles were differences in the number of repeats (range, 12 to 18) characteristic of choline-binding proteins. these differences were located in the region corresponding to repeats 11 to 17. typical pneumococcal strains contained either 14, 16, or 18 repeats, whereas all of the atypical isolates except strains 1283 and 782 (which had 14 and 16 repeats, respectively) and the s. mitis type strain had only 12 repeats; atypical isolate 10546 turned out to be a deltalytb mutant. we also found that there are two major types of alternating repeats in lytb, which encode 21 and 23 amino acids. choline-binding proteins are linked to the choline-containing cell wall substrate through choline residues at  the interface of two consecutive choline-binding repeats that create a choline-binding site. the observation that all strains contained an even number of repeats suggests that the duplication events that gave rise to the choline-binding repeats of lytb involved two repeats simultaneously, an observation that is in keeping with previous crystallographic data. typical pneumococcal isolates usually grew as diplococci, indicating that an active lytb  enzyme was present. in contrast, most atypical isolates formed long chains of cells that did not disperse after addition of purified lytb, suggesting that in these strains chains were produced through mechanisms unrelated to lytb.

AB  == viridans streptococci (vs) are common etiologic agents of subacute infective endocarditis and are capable of causing a variety of pyogenic infections. many species of vs are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. an oligonucleotide array based on 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic spacer (its) sequences was developed to identify 11 clinically relevant vs. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the method consisted of pcr amplification of the its regions by using  a pair of universal primers, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled pcr products to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides immobilized on a nylon membrane. after 120 strains of the 11 species of vg and 91 strains of other bacteria were tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide array were found to be 100% (120 of 120 strains) and 95.6% (87 of 91 strains), respectively. s. pneumoniae cross-hybridized to the probes used for the identification of s. mitis, and simple biochemical tests such as optochin susceptibility or bile solubility should be used to differentiate s. pneumoniae from s. mitis. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by use of the present oligonucleotide array is accurate and could be used as an alternative reliable method for species identification of strains of vs.

TI  == effect of mutations in the human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) hinge on its susceptibility to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == components of the human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) hinge governing sensitivity to cleavage by bacterial iga1 proteases were investigated. recombinant antibodies with distinct hinge mutations were constructed from a hybrid comprised of human iga2 bearing half of the human iga1 hinge region. this hybrid antibody and all the mutant antibodies derived from it were resistant to cleavage by the iga1 proteases from streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis biovar 1 strains but  were cleaved to various degrees by those of streptococcus pneumoniae, some streptococcus sanguis strains, and the type 1 and 2 iga1 proteases of haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. remarkably, those  proteases that cleave a pro-ser peptide bond in the wild-type iga1 hinge were able to cleave mutant antibodies lacking a pro-ser peptide bond in the hinge, and those that cleave a pro-thr peptide bond in the wild-type iga1 hinge were able to cleave mutant antibodies devoid of a pro-thr peptide bond in the hinge. thus, the enzymes can cleave alternatives to their preferred postproline peptide bond when  such a bond is unavailable. peptide sequence analysis of a representative antibody digestion product confirmed this conclusion. the presence of a cleavable peptide bond near the ch2 end of the hinge appeared to result in greater cleavage than if the scissile bond was at the ch1 end of the hinge. proline-to-serine substitution at residue 230 in a hinge containing potentially cleavable pro-ser and pro-thr peptide bonds increased the resistance of the antibody to cleavage by many iga1 proteases.

TI  == design of a multiplex pcr for streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydophila pneumoniae to be used on sputum samples.
AB  == a multiplex pcr (mpcr) was developed for simultaneous detection of specific genes for streptococcus pneumoniae (lyta), mycoplasma pneumoniae (p1), chlamydophila pneumoniae (ompa), and haemophilus influenzae (16s rrna, with verification pcr for p6). when the protocol was tested on 257 bacterial strains belonging to 37 different species, no false negatives and only one false positive were noted. one streptococcus mitis out of thirty was positive for lyta. in a pilot application study of 81 sputum samples from different patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection (lrti), mpcr identified s. pneumoniae in 25 samples,  h. influenzae in 29, m. pneumoniae in 3, and c. pneumoniae in 1. all samples culture positive for s. pneumoniae (n=15) and h. influenzae (n=15) were mpcr positive for the same bacteria. in a pilot control study with nasopharyngeal swabs and aspirates from 10 healthy adults, both culture and mpcr were negative.  no pcr inhibition was found in any of the mpcr-negative sputum or nasopharyngeal  samples. whether all samples identified as positive by mpcr are truly positive in an aetiological perspective regarding lrti remains to be evaluated in a well-defined patient material. in conclusion, the mpcr appears to be a promising  tool in the aetiological diagnostics of lrti.

TI  == validation of serotyping of streptococcus pneumoniae in europe.
AB  == introduction: serotyping of pneumococci has become increasingly important as new  pneumococcal vaccines are introduced and place emphasis on knowledge of national  serotype-distributions and their development over time. aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of serotyping of pneumococci in europe, and to  focus on possible problems with methods, procedures, etc. that may lead to wrong  serotypings. methods: this study was part of a larger eu-project. eleven reference laboratories in europe participated in the validation of pneumococcal serotyping. the streptococcus unit at ssi functioned as the gold standard for use of the neufeld test. each laboratory was asked to type 70 blinded pneumococcal strains by use of their normal serotyping procedure and to answer to a questionnaire regarding their experience and serotyping procedure for pneumococci. the 70 strains were chosen to represent all the 23 pneumococcal types included in the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine plus a number of other less  common types. results: a total of 735 serotypings was performed. five laboratories performed complete serotyping whereas the remaining six laboratories performed partial or variable serotyping into groups or types that did not belong to groups. in general, a high degree of consensus appeared between the 11 european reference laboratories. of 735 serotypings, 39 erroneous serotypings were made (5% of all). most serotyping errors included a wrong serotype within the correct serogroup, where especially types 9n, 18c and 19f were mistyped. furthermore, misidentification of noncapsular pneumococci like s. mitis and s. oralis was also a frequent error. for 22 strains (30%) of pneumococci, serotyping mistakes were made. the erroneous serotypings were neither correlated to the use  of other methods than the neufeld test, nor to the serotyping routine of the laboratories. a number of errors may be due to a serotyping result based on a negative reaction with a specific factor serum, instead of a positive reaction with another factor serum. this may be chosen in order to simplify the serotyping procedure. thus, all the necessary factor sera must be used in order to assure correct serotyping. conclusions: overall, the quality of serotyping of pneumococci was high, and a high degree of consensus was found between the eleven laboratories. it is important to use all the necessary factor sera for serotyping, to perform all the necessary tests and to base a serotyping result always on one or more positive reactions and not on a negative reaction alone. more focus on serotyping of serotypes within groups seems to be warranted.

TI  == characterization of lyta-like n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases from two new streptococcus mitis bacteriophages provides insights into the properties of the major pneumococcal autolysin.
AB  == two new temperate bacteriophages exhibiting a myoviridae (phib6) and a siphoviridae (phiher) morphology have been isolated from streptococcus mitis strains b6 and her 1055, respectively, and partially characterized. the lytic phage genes were overexpressed in escherichia coli, and their encoded proteins were purified. the lytaher and lytab6 genes are very similar (87% identity) and appeared to belong to the group of the so-called typical lyta amidases (atypical  lyta displays a characteristic two-amino-acid deletion signature). although they  exhibited several differential biochemical properties with respect to the pneumococcal lyta, e.g., they were inhibited in vitro by sodium deoxycholate and  showed a more acidic ph for optimal activity. however, and in sharp contrast with the pneumococcal lyta, a short dialysis of lytaher or lytab6 resulted in reversible deconversion to the low-activity state (e-form) of the fully active phage amidases (c-form). comparison of the amino acid sequences of lytaher and lytab6 with that of the pneumococcal amidase suggested that val317 might be responsible for at least some of the peculiar properties of s. mitis phage enzymes. site-directed mutagenesis that changed val317 in the pneumococcal lyta amidase to a thr residue (characteristic of lytab6 and lytaher) produced a fully  active pneumococcal enzyme that differs from the parental one only in that the mutant amidase can reversibly recover the low-activity e-form upon dialysis. this is the first report showing that a single amino acid residue is involved in the conversion process of the major s. pneumoniae autolysin. our results also showed  that some lysogenic s. mitis strains possess a lyta-like gene, something that was previously thought to be exclusive to streptococcus pneumoniae. moreover, the newly discovered phage lysins constitute a missing link between the typical and atypical pneumococcal amidases known previously.

TI  == characterisation of viridans group streptococci with different levels of tet(m)-mediated tetracycline resistance.
AB  == streptococcus oralis 264-3, streptococcus mitis 254-1 and s. mitis 264-1, isolated from the oral cavities of two children were each found to carry the tet(m) gene but exhibited different degrees of reduced susceptibility to tetracycline (tetracycline mics of 2, 8 and 64 mg/l, respectively). the aim of this study was to determine the molecular basis for the different levels of tetracycline resistance (tc(r)) observed. escherichia coli hb101 carrying the cloned tet(m) genes exhibited similar levels of tetracycline susceptibility to those observed in the parental streptococcal strains (mics of 1, 16, and 64 mg/l  for tet(m) genes from s. oralis 264-3, s. mitis 254-1 and s. mitis 264-1, respectively). dna sequencing revealed that s. oralis 264-3 had a tet(m) gene highly homologous to tet(m) carried by tn916 from enterococcus faecalis (99.6% identity), while the intermediate- and high-level tc(r) strains had tet(m) sequences that resembled the tet(m) gene of tn5251 from streptococcus pneumoniae  (99.3% and 99.4% identity, respectively). no differences were observed in the upstream attenuator structure for each of the strains and differences in reduced  tetracycline susceptibilities could be attributed to changes in the deduced amino acid sequences of the tet(m) proteins.

TI  == accuracy of phenotypic and genotypic testing for identification of streptococcus  pneumoniae and description of streptococcus pseudopneumoniae sp. nov.
AB  == we have identified an unusual group of viridans group streptococci that resemble  streptococcus pneumoniae. dna-dna homology studies suggested that a subset of these isolates represent a novel species that may be included in the s. oralis-s. mitis group of viridans group streptococci. we suggest that this novel species be termed streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. a combination of phenotypic and genetic reactions allows its identification. s. pseudopneumoniae strains do not have pneumococcal capsules, are resistant to optochin (inhibition zones, less than 14  mm) when they are incubated under an atmosphere of increased co2 but are susceptible to optochin (inhibition zones, >14 mm) when they are incubated in ambient atmospheres, are not soluble in bile, and are positive by the genprobe accuprobe pneumococcus test. the bile solubility test is more specific than the optochin test for identification of s. pneumoniae. genetic tests for pneumolysin  (ply) and manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (soda) and identification tests with a commercial probe, accuprobe pneumococcus, do not discriminate between the new species and s. pneumoniae.

TI  == molecular basis of resistance to macrolides and other antibiotics in commensal viridans group streptococci and gemella spp. and transfer of resistance genes to  streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == we assessed the mechanisms of resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b (mls(b)) antibiotics and related antibiotics in erythromycin-resistant viridans group streptococci (n = 164) and gemella spp. (n = 28). the macrolide resistance  phenotype was predominant (59.38%); all isolates with this phenotype carried the  mef(a) or mef(e) gene, with mef(e) being predominant (95.36%). the erm(b) gene was always detected in strains with constitutive and inducible mls(b) resistance  and was combined with the mef(a/e) gene in 47.44% of isolates. none of the isolates carried the erm(a) subclass erm(tr), erm(a), or erm(c) genes. the mel gene was detected in all but four strains carrying the mef(a/e) gene. the tet(m)  gene was found in 86.90% of tetracycline-resistant isolates and was strongly associated with the presence of the erm(b) gene. the cat(pc194) gene was detected in seven chloramphenicol-resistant streptococcus mitis isolates, and the aph(3')-iii gene was detected in four viridans group streptococcal isolates with  high-level kanamycin resistance. the inttn gene was found in all isolates with the erm(b), tet(m), aph(3')-iii, and cat(pc194) gene. the mef(e) and mel genes were successfully transferred from both groups of bacteria to streptococcus pneumoniae r6 by transformation. viridans group streptococci and gemella spp. seem to be important reservoirs of resistance genes.

TI  == a homologue of alib is found in the capsule region of nonencapsulated streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == the epidemiology, phylogeny, and biology of nonencapsulated streptococcus pneumoniae are largely unknown. increased colonization capacity and transformability are, however, intriguing features of these pneumococci and play  an important role. twenty-seven nonencapsulated pneumococci were identified in a  nationwide collection of 1,980 nasopharyngeal samples and 215 blood samples obtained between 1998 and 2002. on the basis of multilocus sequence typing and capsule region analysis we divided the nonencapsulated pneumococci into two groups. group i was closely related to encapsulated strains. group ii had a clonal population structure, including two geographically widespread clones able  to cause epidemic conjunctivitis and invasive diseases. group ii strains also carried a 1,959-bp homologue of alib (alib-like orf 2) in the capsule region, which was highly homologous to a sequence in the capsule region of streptococcus  mitis. in addition, strains of the two major clones in group ii had an additional sequence, alib-like orf 1 (1,968 to 2,004 bp), upstream of alib-like orf 2. expression of alib-like orf 1 was detected by reverse transcription-pcr, and the  corresponding rna was visualized by northern blotting. a gene fragment homologous to capn of serotypes 33 and 37 suggests that group ii strains were derived from encapsulated pneumococci some time ago. therefore, loss of capsule expression in  vivo was found to be associated with the importation of one or two alib homologues in some nonencapsulated pneumococci.

TI  == detection of penicillin-binding protein 2b gene alteration in streptococcus mitis by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == three isolates of beta-lactam-resistant streptococci from the saliva of healthy adults were identified as streptococcus mitis. minimum inhibitory concentrations  (mics) were 2 to 4 micro g/ml for ampicillin (abpc) and 64 to more than 128 micro g/ml for cefaclor (ccl). to determine the position of base alterations of the penicillin-binding protein 2b ( pbp2b) gene, upstream primers containing possible mutation points were designed, and used for polymerase chain reaction (pcr), together with a downstream primer. alterations adjacent to the conserved motifs of the pbp2b gene were apparent. dna sequencing data indicated replacements in deduced amino acid sequences in all resistant isolates: from threonine to alanine just after the serine-serine-asparagine (ssn) motif, and from alanine to glycine  two residues downstream of the lysine-threonine-glycine (ktg) motif. these changes were the same as those in penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp), suggesting importance for the enzymatic activity of the protein. thus, beta-lactam susceptibility of s. mitis may be partially predicted by pcr using our primer set for pbp2b.

TI  == autolysin-targeted lightcycler assay including internal process control for detection of streptococcus pneumoniae dna in clinical samples.
AB  == the development and clinical evaluation of a lightcycler pcr assay, including an  internal process control (ipc), to detect the streptococcus pneumoniae autolysin  gene in clinical samples is reported. the assay was developed to provide a second target for use in conjunction with existing pneumolysin pcr assays to increase the reliability of non-culture pcr diagnosis of pneumococcal infection. primers amplify a 173 bp fragment of the autolysin gene (lyta), which is detected by fluorescence-labelled hybridization probes. an ipc was designed to check for the  presence of pcr inhibitors and loss of assay sensitivity. the ipc product was amplified by the lyta primers and detected by a second set of hybridization probes. the analytical specificity of the autolysin pcr assay was 100% against 39 other bacterial species tested; these included related streptococci and other organisms. the assay, which could reliably detect 50 fg purified pneumococcal dna per reaction, was capable of distinguishing between s. pneumoniae and atypical streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis strains known to contain the lyta gene. using dna extracts from a panel of edta bloods from patients with blood-culture-confirmed pneumococcal infection, the autolysin pcr had a sensitivity of 42.9%, which was similar to a previously reported taqman pneumolysin pcr (43.8%) run in parallel. total agreement was shown between the autolysin assay and the pneumolysin taqman assay when used to test 23 culture-negative clinical samples, of which eight were positive by pcr, adding valuable clinical information. a specific autolysin-based lightcycler assay has been developed to complement pneumolysin pcr for the detection of s. pneumoniae in clinical samples. this should be a particularly useful tool for the rapid and  sensitive diagnosis of pneumococcal meningitis, even after an antibiotic has been administered. however, poor sensitivity on blood samples limits its usefulness in other bacteraemic infections.

AB  == we developed a new molecular tool based on rpob gene (encoding the beta subunit of rna polymerase) sequencing to identify streptococci. we first sequenced the complete rpob gene for streptococcus anginosus, s. equinus, and abiotrophia defectiva. sequences were aligned with these of s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. pneumoniae available in genbank. using an in-house analysis program (svarap),  we identified a 740-bp variable region surrounded by conserved, 20-bp zones and,  by using these conserved zones as pcr primer targets, we amplified and sequenced  this variable region in an additional 30 streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, granulicatella, and abiotrophia species. this region exhibited 71.2 to 99.3% interspecies homology. we therefore applied our identification system by pcr amplification and sequencing to a collection of 102 streptococci and 60 bacterial isolates belonging to other genera. amplicons were obtained in streptococci and bacillus cereus, and sequencing allowed us to make a correct identification of streptococci. molecular signatures were determined for the discrimination of closely related species within the s. pneumoniae-s. oralis-s. mitis group and the s. agalactiae-s. difficile group. these signatures allowed us to design a s. pneumoniae-specific pcr and sequencing primer pair.

AB  == a retrospective study of bacteremia in children with febrile neutropenia admitted to a medical center in taiwan from january 1999 to december 1999 was performed. there were 190 episodes of febrile neutropenia during this period and 46 pathogens were isolated from blood specimens in 38 bacteremic episodes (7 mixed infections). pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.4%), staphylococcus aureus (10.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (10.9%), and enterobacter cloacae (10.9%) were the most common isolates. three of the 5 isolates of s. aureus were resistant to methicillin. twenty-three episodes of bacteremia (four mixed infections) were associated with recent antibiotic use. of the 23 bacteremic episodes with recent  antibiotic use, p. aeruginosa (20%), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (10%), k. pneumoniae (10%), escherichia coli (10%), and e. cloacae (10%) were isolated most often. relapsed leukemia (odds ratio 3, 95% confidence interval 1.4-6.5) and recent antibiotic therapy (odds ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.7-7.7) were  the independent risk factors of bacteremia. there were 9 mortality cases in patients with bacteremia, including 4 cases with mixed infections, and 5 cases with p. aeruginosa, e. coli, klebsiella oxytoca, s. aureus, and streptococcus mitis, respectively. broad-spectrum antibiotics were necessary in febrile neutropenic children because of the high percentage of mixed infection.

TI  == genetic characterization of optochin-susceptible viridans group streptococci.
AB  == two clinical isolates of viridans group streptococci (vs) with different degrees  of susceptibility to optochin (opt), i.e., fully opt-susceptible (opt(s)) vs strain 1162/99 (for which the mic was equal to that for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.75 micro g/ml) and intermediate opt(s) vs strain 1174/97 (mic, 6 micro g/ml) were studied. besides being opt susceptible, they showed characteristics typical  of vs, such as bile insolubility; lack of reaction with pneumococcal capsular antibodies; and lack of hybridization with rrna (accuprobe)-, lyta-, and pnl-specific pneumococcal probes. however, these vs opt(s) strains and vs type strains hybridized with ant, a gene not present in s. pneumoniae. a detailed characterization of the genes encoding the 16s rrna and soda classified isolates  1162/99 and 1174/97 as streptococcus mitis. analysis of the atpcab region, which  encodes the c, a, and b subunits of the f(0)f(1) h(+)-atpase, the target of optochin, revealed high degrees of similarity between s. mitis 1162/99 and s. pneumoniae in atpc, atpa, and the n terminus of atpb. moreover, amino acid identity between s. mitis 1174/97 and s. pneumoniae was found in alpha helix 5 of the a subunit. the organization of the chromosomal region containing the atp operon of the two opt(s) vs and vs type strains was spr1284-atpc, with spr1284 being located 296 to 556 bp from atpc, whereas in s. pneumoniae this distance was longer than 68 kb. in addition, the gene order in s. pneumoniae was is1239-74 bp-atpc. the results suggest that the full opt susceptibility of s. mitis 1162/99 is due to the acquisition of atpc, atpa, and part of atpb from s. pneumoniae and  that the intermediate opt susceptibility of s. mitis 1174/97 correlates with the  amino acid composition of its a subunit.

TI  == effect of acidic ph on expression of surface-associated proteins of streptococcus oralis.
AB  == streptococcus oralis, a member of the mitis group of oral streptococci, is implicated in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis and is the predominant aciduric non-mutans-group streptococcus in dental plaque. we undertook to identify the most abundant surface-associated proteins of s. oralis and to investigate changes in protein expression when the organism was grown under acidic culture conditions. surface-associated proteins were extracted from cells  grown in batch culture, separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption  ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. putative functions were assigned by homology to a translated genomic database of streptococcus pneumoniae. a total of 27 proteins were identified; these included a lipoprotein, a ribosome recycling factor, and the glycolytic enzymes phosphoglycerate kinase, fructose bisphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and enolase. the most abundant protein, phosphocarrier protein hpr, was present as three isoforms. neither lactate dehydrogenase nor pyruvate oxidase, dominant intracellular proteins, were present among the proteins on the gels, demonstrating that proteins in the surface-associated pool did not arise as a result of cell lysis. eleven of the proteins identified were differentially expressed when cells were grown at ph 5.2 versus ph 7.0, and these included superoxide dismutase, a homologue of dipeptidase v from lactococcus lactis, and the protein translation elongation factors g, tu, and ts. this study has extended the range of streptococcal proteins known to be expressed at the cell surface. further investigations are required to ascertain their functions at this extracellular location and determine how their expression is influenced by other environmental conditions.

TI  == echocardiographic presentations of endocarditis, and risk factors for rupture of  a sinus of valsalva in childhood.
AB  == background: in recent years, the diagnosis of infective endocarditis has been enhanced by the use of echocardiography. we sought, therefore, to review its effect on the management of endocarditis in children. methods: we reviewed all the patients presenting to our institution for evaluation for infective endocarditis from may 1994 to january 2002. the patients were stratified according to whether or not they had congenitally malformed hearts. results: of the 90 referred patients identified, 46 (51%) had positive ultrasonic findings. of these, we excluded 26 patients because of the presence of indwelling lines. the remaining 20 patients with features of endocarditis had a median age of 6.5 years, and a range from 0.14 to 8.5 years. there were 4 patients with normal hearts, and 16 with congenital cardiac malformations. we identified rupture of a  sinus of valsalva in four patients, with rupture into the left ventricle in two,  and into the right ventricle and right atrium in one each. the mitral valve was involved in six patients, the aortic valve in another six, including all four with rupture of the sinus of valsalva, both mitral and aortic valves in three, the pulmonary trunk in three patients, and the tricuspid valve and a blalock-taussig shunt in one patient each. organisms isolated included streptococcus mitis in 4 patients, streptococcus pneumoniae in 2 patients, streptococcus sanguis in 1, staphylococcus aureus in 3, staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, and enteroccocus in 2. cultures proved negative in 7 patients.  surgical intervention was needed in 12 patients, and one died (5%). only the left-sided chambers were involved in those with normal hearts. both patients infected with streptococcus pneumoniae had rupture of a sinus of valsalva. conclusion: involvement of the left-sided chambers is more likely in structurally normal hearts, and in cases with rupture of a sinus of valsalva, in which case infection with streptococcus pneumonia should be suspected.

TI  == viridans group streptococci are donors in horizontal transfer of topoisomerase iv genes to streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a total of 46 ciprofloxacin-resistant (cip(r)) streptococcus pneumoniae strains were isolated from 1991 to 2001 at the hospital of bellvitge. five of these strains showed unexpectedly high rates of nucleotide variations in the quinolone  resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of their parc, pare, and gyra genes. the nucleotide sequence of the full-length parc, pare, and gyra genes of one of these isolates revealed a mosaic structure compatible with an interspecific recombination origin. southern blot analysis and nucleotide sequence determinations showed the presence of an ant-like gene in the intergenic pare-parc regions of the s. pneumoniae cip(r) isolates with high rates of variations in their pare and parc qrdrs. the ant-like gene was absent from typical s. pneumoniae strains, whereas it was present in the intergenic pare-parc regions of the viridans group streptococci (streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis). these results suggest that the viridans group streptococci are acting as donors in the horizontal transfer of fluoroquinolone resistance genes to s. pneumoniae.

TI  == amino acid sequence requirements in the hinge of human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) for cleavage by streptococcal iga1 proteases.
AB  == the amino acid sequence requirements in the hinge of human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) for cleavage by iga1 proteases of different species of streptococcus were  investigated. recombinant iga1 antibodies were generated with point mutations at  proline 227 and threonine 228, the residues lying on either side of the peptide bond at which all streptococcal iga1 proteases cleave wild-type human iga1. the amino acid substitutions produced no major effect upon the structure of the mutant iga1 antibodies or their functional ability to bind to fcalpha receptors.  however, the substitutions had a substantial effect upon sensitivity to cleavage  with some streptococcal iga1 proteases, with, in some cases, a single point mutation rendering the antibody resistant to a particular iga1 protease. this effect was least marked with the iga1 protease from streptococcus pneumoniae, which showed no absolute requirement for either proline or threonine at residues  227 to 228. by contrast, the iga1 proteases of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis had an absolute requirement for proline at 227 but not for threonine at 228, which could be replaced by valine. there was evidence in s. mitis that proteases from different strains may have different amino acid requirements for cleavage. remarkably, some streptococcal proteases appeared able to cleave the hinge at a distant alternative site if substitution prevented efficient cleavage of the original site. hence, this study has identified key residues required for the recognition of the iga1 hinge as a substrate by streptococcal iga1 proteases, and it marks a preliminary step towards development of specific enzyme inhibitors.

AB  == background: monoclonal (ktmab) and recombinant (ktscfv) anti-idiotypic antibodies, representing the internal image of a yeast killer toxin, proved to be microbicidal in vitro against important eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens such as candida albicans, pneumocystis carinii, mycobacterium tuberculosis, staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant strains. ktmab and ktscfv exerted a strong therapeutic effect in well-established animal models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis. streptococcus mutans is the most important etiologic agent of dental caries that might result from the metabolic end products of dental plaque. effective strategies to reduce the disease potential of dental plaque have considered the possibility of using antibiotics or antibodies against oral streptococci in general and s. mutans in particular. in this study, the activity of ktmab and ktscfv against s. mutans and the inhibition and reduction by ktmab of dental colonization by s. mutans and other oral streptococci in an ex vivo model of human teeth were investigated. materials and  methods: ktscfv and ktmab were used in a conventional colony forming unit (cfu) assay against a serotype c strain of s. mutans, and other oral streptococci (s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius). an ex vivo model of human teeth submerged in saliva was used to establish ktmab potential of inhibiting or reducing the adhesion to dental surfaces by s. mutans and other oral streptococci. results: ktmab and ktscfv kill in vitro s. mutans and other oral streptococci. ktmab inhibit colonization of dental surfaces by s. mutans and oral streptococci in the ex vivo model. conclusions: killer antibodies with antibiotic activity or their engineered derivatives may have a potential in the prevention of dental caries in vivo.

TI  == establishment of streptococci in the upper respiratory tract: longitudinal changes in the mouth and nasopharynx up to 2 years of age.
AB  == as part of a series of longitudinal studies on the development of the indigenous  microflora of the upper respiratory tract, the establishment of streptococci in the oral cavity and nasopharynx and iga1 protease production by the early streptococcal flora was examined in 50 healthy caucasian infants at the ages of 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. in the oral cavity, streptococci were found in all infants on every sampling occasion, streptococcus mitis biovar 1 being the main finding in each age group. s. salivarius and s. mitis biovar 2 reached their highest prevalence during the first year of life, whereas the prevalence of s. oralis and s. sanguis showed no significant increase before 12 months of age. salivary streptococci mainly consisted of the above-mentioned species during the  follow-up period. in contrast to the oral cavity, no stable colonisation pattern  was observed for viridans streptococci in the nasopharynx. s. mitis biovar 1 and  s. pneumoniae, a traditional respiratory pathogen, were the principal streptococcal species among nasopharyngeal isolates. iga1 protease production by  early streptococci was common in infancy. among the oral streptococcal microflora, s. mitis biovar 1 (especially during the first year of life) and s. oralis and s. sanguis constituted the main species responsible for this enzyme activity. in the nasopharynx, iga1 protease was produced by s. mitis biovar 1, s. oralis and s. pneumoniae. in conclusion, streptococcal colonisation differs in these two close habitats in the upper respiratory tract.

TI  == distribution of environmentally regulated genes of streptococcus suis serotype 2  among s. suis serotypes and other organisms.
AB  == the occurrence of 36 environmentally regulated genes of streptococcus suis strain 10 among all 35 s. suis serotypes was determined by using hybridization with the  amplified genes as probes. in addition, the distribution of these genes among the virulence phenotypes of serotypes 1 and 2 was assessed. hybridization was also performed with various other streptococcal species and nonstreptococcal bacterial species which may be present in pigs. interestingly, probe ivs-25/iri-1, similar  to agra and sapr, hybridized only with s. suis serotype 1 and 2 strains with virulent phenotypes and is therefore suitable as a diagnostic parameter. only one probe was specific for s. suis. this probe's sequence was identical to the epf gene, a putative virulence factor of s. suis. probe ivs-31 was similar to a virulence factor of s. suis, namely, a gene encoding a fibronectin- and fibrinogen-binding protein. this probe hybridized only with oral streptococci. nearly half of the probes (45%) hybridized with the oral streptococci (s. oralis, s. milleri, s. sanguis, s. gordonii, and s. mitis) and with streptococcus pneumoniae. this indicates a close relationship between s. suis, the oral streptococci, and s. pneumoniae with respect to the selected environmentally regulated genes. one probe only hybridized with gram-negative species and therefore seems to be obtained by s. suis from a gram-negative organism by horizontal transfer.

TI  == molecular peculiarities of the lyta gene isolated from clinical pneumococcal strains that are bile insoluble.
AB  == the autolytic lyta amidase from 12 bile (deoxycholate)-insoluble streptococcal isolates (formerly classified as atypical streptococcus pneumoniae) showing different antibiotic resistance patterns was studied. these atypical strains, which autolyze at the end of the stationary phase of growth, contain highly divergent lyta alleles (pairwise evolutionary distances of about 20%) compared to the lyta alleles of typical pneumococci. the atypical lyta amidases exhibit a peculiar deletion of two amino acids responsible for cell wall anchoring in the carboxy-terminal domain and have a reduced specific activity. these enzymes were  inhibited by 1% deoxycholate but were activated by 1% triton x-100, a detergent that could be used as an alternative diagnostic test for this kind of strain. preparation of functional chimeric enzymes, pcr mutagenesis, and gene replacements demonstrated that the characteristic bile insolubility of these atypical strains was due to their peculiar carboxy-terminal domain and that the 2-amino-acid deletion was responsible for the inhibitory effect of deoxycholate.  however, the deletion alone did not affect the specific activity of lyta. a detailed characterization of the genes encoding the 16s rrna and soda together with multilocus sequence typing indicated that the strains studied here are not a single clone and, although they cannot be strictly classified as typical pneumococci, they represent a quite diverse pool of organisms closely related to  s. pneumoniae. the clinical importance of these findings is underlined by the role of the lyta gene in shaping the course of pneumococcal diseases. this study  can also contribute to solving diagnostic problems and to understanding the evolution and pathogenic potential of species of the streptococcus mitis group.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci: report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1997-2000).
AB  == susceptibility patterns of 15 antimicrobial agents were assessed for 3,400 isolates of beta-hemolytic (betahs) and viridans group (vgs) streptococci in the  four regions of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program: asia-pacific (apac), europe (eu), latin america (la) and north america (na). in 1997 through 2000, sentry program monitors tested strains by reference broth microdilution methods and results were interpreted using national committee for clinical laboratory standards criteria. among the betahs processed, 81.9% of strains were  either streptococcus pyogenes (n = 650) or s. agalactiae (n = 1,190). the vgs were generally classified as unspeciated alpha-hemolytic streptococci (n = 512; 44%) or s. mitis (n = 254; 22%). seven quinolones, two beta-lactams, erythromycin (er), clindamycin (cm), quinupristin/dalfopristin (q/d), vancomycin (va), teicoplanin (tp) and linezolid (lz) were tested. rank order of susceptibility for betahs isolates was: ceftriaxone (ctx) = q/d = va = tp = lz (100.0%) > gatifloxacin (gati) = trovafloxacin (trov, 99.8%) > levofloxacin (levo; 99.7%) >  penicillin (pen; 99.3%) > grepafloxacin (grepa; 97.4%) > cm (94.4%) > er (85.5%). er versus betahs had the highest mic(90) values (2 microg/ml) and the lowest susceptibility rates across all regions (range, 81.4% in na to 97.3% in la). among the vgs, susceptibility rank order was: va = tp = lz (100.0%) > q/d (99.1%) > gati = levo = trova (98.0%) > grepa (96.5%) > ctx (92.8%) > cm (90.3%) > pen (68.6%) > er (64.5%). macrolide resistance in both streptococcal species groups of the m-phenotype was highest in the americas, with erm-patterns predominating in eu and apac regions. bms284756 among the monitored new agents showed a four- to eight-fold greater potency versus these streptococcal isolates when compared to the other six tested quinolones. like streptococcus pneumoniae, these other streptococci appear to have acquired numerous resistances and require continued surveillance to direct adequate therapies.

TI  == study of the intra- and interlaboratory reproducibility of partial single base c-sequencing of the 16s rrna gene and its applicability for the identification of members of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == the use of single base c-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16s rrna-gene (sbcs) combined with capillary electrophoresis was evaluated for the identification of reference strains of 30 different species within the genus streptococcus. for sbcs, only dd-ctp's are used in the sequencing reactions instead of the four dideoxy bases and the primer is fluorescently labeled. the reproducibility, interlaboratory exchangeability and discriminative power of this method were studied by comparing the patterns obtained in three laboratories under highly standardized conditions. the interlaboratory reproducibility proved  to be high, enabling the construction of a common database for the identification of strains belonging to the streptococcal species studied. most of the examined species generated distinguishable profiles. sbcs did not differentiate between the closely related species s. constellatus and s. intermedius. also s. thermophilus and s. vestibularis as well as s. mitis and s. pneumoniae showed highly resembling profiles. the previously reported heterogeneity within the species s. equinus was reflected by sbcs. for all other species, strains belonging to the same species generated indistinguishable patterns. in conclusion, single base c-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16s rrna-gene  could be a useful and widely applicable method for the identification of bacteria at the species level, with the added advantage of being more rapid and easier to  automatize than full sequence determination.

TI  == competence without a competence pheromone in a natural isolate of streptococcus infantis.
AB  == many streptococcal species belonging to the mitis and anginosus phylogenetic groups are known to be naturally competent for genetic transformation. induction  of the competent state in these bacteria is regulated by a quorum-sensing mechanism consisting of a secreted peptide pheromone encoded by comc and a two-component regulatory system encoded by comde. here we report that a natural isolate of a mitis group streptococcus (atu-4) is competent for genetic transformation even though it has lost the gene encoding the competence pheromone. in contrast to other strains, induction of competence in atu-4 is not  regulated by cell density, since highly diluted cultures of this strain are still competent. interestingly, competence in the atu-4 strain is lost if the gene encoding the response regulator come is disrupted, demonstrating that this component of the quorum-sensing apparatus is still needed for competence development. these results indicate that mutations in comd or come have resulted  in a gain-of-function phenotype that allows competence without a competence pheromone. a highly similar strain lacking comc was isolated independently from another individual, suggesting that strains with this phenotype are able to survive in nature in competition with wild-type strains.

TI  == induction of natural competence in streptococcus pneumoniae triggers lysis and dna release from a subfraction of the cell population.
AB  == naturally competent bacteria have the ability to take up free dna from the surrounding medium and incorporate this dna into their genomes by homologous recombination. in naturally competent streptococcus pneumoniae, and related streptococcal species from the mitis phylogenetic group, the competent state is not a constitutive property but is induced by a peptide pheromone through a quorum-sensing mechanism. recent studies have shown that natural genetic transformation is an important mechanism for gene exchange between streptococci in nature. a prerequisite for effective gene exchange is the presence of streptococcal donor dna in the environment. despite decades of study of the transformation process we still do not know how this donor dna is released from streptococcal cells to the external milieu. traditionally, it has been assumed that donor dna originates from cells that die and fall apart from natural causes. in this study we show that induction of the competent state initiates release of  dna from a subfraction of the bacterial population, probably by cell lysis. the majority of the cells induced to competence take up dna and act as recipients, whereas the rest release dna and act as donors. these findings show that natural  transformation in streptococci provides a natural mechanism for genetic recombination that resembles sex in higher organisms.

TI  == possible overestimation of penicillin resistant streptococcus pneumoniae colonization rates due to misidentification of oropharyngeal streptococci.
AB  == standard identification of streptococcus pneumoniae by optochin and bile solubility testing can lead to ambiguous results for certain isolates. newer bacteriologic identification techniques (e.g., dna probes) now exist. in a prospective point prevalence study of oropharyngeal s. pneumoniae carriage rates  among outpatients, we compared standard organism identification techniques to dna probe testing. by standard identification criteria, 35 (4%) of 872 isolates were  characterized as presumptive s. pneumoniae. thirty of 35 presumptive isolates were recoverable for dna probing; 9 (30%) presumptive isolates were confirmed using a dna probe. the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of these dna probe positive isolates closely paralleled that of clinical blood isolates of s. pneumoniae obtained during the study period. the 21 (70%) dna probe negative isolates, which may represent phylogenetically related species (such as s. mitis  or s. oralis), had significantly reduced antimicrobial susceptibility patterns when compared with the dna probe positive isolates. in colonization studies, if classic criteria (optochin disc zone and bile solubility) are the sole means of identification, s. pneumoniae penicillin resistance rates may be over-reported.

TI  == [therapeutic impact of streptococcal and enterococcal bacteremia in hematology patients].
AB  == from january 1999 to may 2000 (17 months), 21 strains of streptococci and four strains of enterococci have been isolated from 74 blood cultures in 25 infectious episodes in hematologic patients. they concerned 21 patients, of 21 to 77 years old. these patients suffered from acute leukaemia (14 cases), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (two cases), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (two cases) or myeloma (three cases). seventeen patients displayed a single streptococcal or enterococcal episode, two had two episodes in the course of a single stay in the hospital, two others in the course of two different stays. during 16 episodes (64%), the bacteremia occurred within 15 days after the onset of neutropenia consecutive to  antimitotic chemotherapy, and in nine episodes (36%) it has occurred after a period exceeding 15 days. in six cases the patients had already received antibiotics with a large antibacterial activity (beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and/or glycopeptide +/- aminoside) and in four cases a single antibiotic (synergistine or cotrimoxazole). most streptococci (20/21) were oral streptococci (ten streptococcus mitis, five s. oralis, two s. sanguis, three s. pneumoniae). a single strain of beta-hemolytic streptococci has been identified as s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. the enterococci were one strain of enterococcus  faecalis and three e. faecium. ten streptococci were susceptible to 0.25 mg/l of  penicillin g, ten were less susceptible (0.5 < or = mic < 32 mg/l), and a strain  was resistant (mic = 32 mg/l). eighteen strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and cefotaxime. for three strains, the mics of amoxicillin and cefotaxime (8-16 mg/l and 8-32 mg/l, respectively) were higher. levels of resistance of the enterococci to the beta-lactam (penicillin, amoxicillin, and piperacillin) were variable. all species were susceptible to glycopeptides. three patients were transferred in intensive care unit for respiratory distress or shock syndrome. their evolution has remained severe under antibiotherapy comprising beta-lactam or vancomycin associated with an aminoside. this results demonstrate the interest of species identification to adapt the antibiotic treatment and confirms the frequency of oral streptococci in severe bacteremia in neutropenic patients.

TI  == a xerd recombinase with unusual active site motifs in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == xerd belongs to the site specific recombinases of the integrase family of proteins that catalyze recombination events via a phosphotyrosine intermediate. sequence alignments and crystal structure resolution of e. coli xerd and related  enzymes demonstrated the importance of four conserved amino acids r-h-r-h that are spaced along the c-terminal domain in addition to a conserved k and the active site y, all of which have been implicated in catalysis. the deduced amino  acid sequence of the putative s. pneumoniae xerd contained three unique replacements at the conserved positions resulting in l-q-r-l; moreover, the active site y was the penultimate amino acid residue, and the extreme c-terminal  region suggested to be involved in interaction of e. coli xerd with xerc was lacking. severe growth defects in a loss-of-function xerd mutant are consistent with an important in vivo function of the s. pneumoniae xerd protein. highly related xerd genes with similar unusual amino acid replacements were found in s.  mitis, s. mutans and s. pyogenes but not in other gram-positive bacteria, although the genetic environment was very similar in many species. there are at least another four genes in the s. pneumoniae knr_7/87 genome encoding xer related peptides, one of which was identified as the xerc homologue. the xerd and xerc genes were present in a sample of 20 s. pneumoniae strains whereas the other xer genes appear to be absent in some of the strains and are more closely related to integrases of phage and transposon origin.

TI  == mosaic genes and mosaic chromosomes: intra- and interspecies genomic variation of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae remains a major causative agent of serious human diseases. the worldwide increase of antibiotic resistant strains revealed the importance of horizontal gene transfer in this pathogen, a scenario that results  in the modulation of the species-specific gene pool. we investigated genomic variation in 20 s. pneumoniae isolates representing major antibiotic-resistant clones and 10 different capsular serotypes. variation was scored as decreased hybridization signals visualized on a high-density oligonucleotide array representing 1,968 genes of the type 4 reference strain knr.7/87. up to 10% of the genes appeared altered between individual isolates and the reference strain;  variability within clones was below 2.1%. ten gene clusters covering 160 kb account for half of the variable genes. most of them are associated with transposases and are assumed to be part of a flexible gene pool within the bacterial population; other variable loci include mosaic genes encoding antibiotic resistance determinants and gene clusters related to bacteriocin production. genomic comparison between s. pneumoniae and commensal streptococcus  mitis and streptococcus oralis strains indicates distinct antigenic profiles and  suggests a smooth transition between these species, supporting the validity of the microarray system as an epidemiological and diagnostic tool.

TI  == mannosidase production by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the production of mannosidase activity by all currently recognized species of human viridans group streptococci was determined using an assay in which bacterial growth was dependent on the degradation of the high-mannose-type glycans of rnase b and subsequent utilization of released mannose. rnase b is an  excellent substrate for the demonstration of mannosidase activity since it is a glycoprotein with a single glycosylation site which is occupied by high-mannose-type glycoforms containing five to nine mannose residues. mannosidase activity was produced only by some members of the mitis group (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus parasanguinis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) and streptococcus intermedius of the anginosus group. none of the other species within the salivarius and mutans groups or streptococcus peroris and streptococcus sanguinis produced mannosidase activity. using matrix-assisted  laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the man(5) glycan alone was degraded while man(6) to man(9), which contain terminal alpha(1-->2) mannose residues in addition to the alpha(1-->3), alpha(1-->6), and beta(1-->4) residues present in man(5), remained intact. investigations on mannosidase production using synthetic (4-methylumbelliferone-  or p-nitrophenol-linked) alpha- or beta-mannosides as substrates indicated that there was no correlation between degradation of these substrates and degradation  of the man(5) glycan of rnase b. no species degraded these alpha-linked mannosides, while degradation of the beta-linked synthetic substrates was restricted to strains within the streptococcus anginosus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius species. the data generated using a native glycoprotein as the substrate demonstrate that mannosidase production within the viridans group streptococci is more widely distributed than had previously been considered.

AB  == the enzyme utp-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase, udpg:pp) is synthesized by practically all organisms, although prokaryotic udpg:pps are evolutionarily unrelated to the eukaryotic counterparts. the primary structure of prokaryotic udpg:pps is well conserved, although little  information exists on the polymorphism of the genes coding for these enzymes. it  has been reported that the galu gene encoding the streptococcus pneumoniae udpg:pp is absolutely required for the synthesis of the capsular polysaccharide,  a sine qua non prerequisite for virulence. a 594 bp fragment covering 66% of the  galu gene from 37 pneumococcal isolates and the type strains of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sobrinus has been amplified by pcr and sequenced. up to 21 different alleles were found in s. pneumoniae. they possess a mosaic-like structure and belong to, at least, two evolutionarily distinct families that show a sequence divergence of 15-20%. in spite of its marked polymorphism, phylogenetic relationships among pneumococcal strains deduced from the galu gene matched those previously established by using alternative approaches. comparison of the pneumococcal galu alleles with those from other streptococci indicated the existence of a complex network of genetic interchange. the galu gene represents an informative marker to be used alone or in conjunction with other molecular typing methods.

TI  == structures of two cell wall-associated polysaccharides of a streptococcus mitis biovar 1 strain. a unique teichoic acid-like polysaccharide and the group o antigen which is a c-polysaccharide in common with pneumococci.
AB  == the cell wall of streptococcus mitis biovar 1 strain sk137 contains the c-polysaccharide known as the common antigen of a closely related species streptococcus pneumoniae, and a teichoic acid-like polysaccharide with a unique structure. the two polysaccharides are different entities and could be partially  separated by gel chromatography. the structures of the two polysaccharides were determined by chemical methods and by nmr spectroscopy. the teichoic acid-like polymer has a heptasaccharide phosphate repeating unit with the following structure: the structure neither contains ribitol nor glycerol phosphate as classical teichoic acids do, thus we have used the expression teichoic acid-like  for this polysaccharide. the following structure of the c-polysaccharide repeating unit was established: where aat is 2-acetamido-4-amino-2,4, 6-trideoxy-d-galactose. it has a carbohydrate backbone identical to that of one of the two structures of c-polysaccharide previously identified in s. pneumoniae. c-polysaccharide of s. mitis is characterized by the presence, in each repeating  unit, of two residues of phosphocholine and both galactosamine residues in the n-acetylated form. immunochemical analysis showed that c-polysaccharide constitutes the lancefield group o antigen. studies using mabs directed against the backbone and against the phosphocholine moiety of the c-polysaccharide revealed several different patterns of these epitopes among 95 s. mitis and streptococcus oralis strains tested and the exclusive presence of the group o antigen in the majority of s. mitis biovar 1 strains.

TI  == serious streptococcal infections produced by isolates resistant to streptogramins (quinupristin/dalfopristin): case reports from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program.
AB  == the emergence and sustained prevalence of gram-positive organisms resistant to antimicrobials has been of interest for over a decade. quinupristin/dalfopristin  (formerly rp 59500 or synercid) is a new injectable streptogramin combination that has been reported to have activity against gram-positive organisms, even those with documented mls(b) resistance. however, the two case reports presented  here illustrate three well-documented streptococcus spp. strains (s. mitis, s. pneumoniae) to be resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin (mics at 3, 8, and 12 microg/ml) following referral as routine isolates in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. the s. pneumoniae pleural fluid isolate was cross-resistant to erythromycin. both bacteremic s. mitis strains were resistant to macrolides (erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin), lincosamides (clindamycin), and fluoroquinolones. patient histories indicated no prior use of mls class antimicrobials for the s. mitis case, but the patient having the s. pneumoniae isolate did receive prior treatment of erythromycin and clindamycin. all isolates had modestly increased penicillin mics of 0.12 microg/ml. the mode of resistance  to quinupristin/dalfopristin was not evident (sat a-negative by pcr); and these cases illustrate the existence of streptogramin-resistant isolates before the introduction of this antimicrobial class into human clinical practice.

TI  == genetic relationships between clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus mitis: characterization of "atypical" pneumococci and organisms allied to s. mitis harboring s. pneumoniae virulence factor-encoding genes.
AB  == the oral streptococcal group (mitis phylogenetic group) currently consists of nine recognized species, although the group has been traditionally difficult to classify, with frequent changes in nomenclature over the years. the pneumococcus  (streptococcus pneumoniae), an important human pathogen, is traditionally distinguished from the most closely related oral streptococcal species streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis on the basis of three differentiating characteristics: optochin susceptibility, bile solubility, and agglutination with antipneumococcal polysaccharide capsule antibodies. however, there are many reports in the literature of pneumococci lacking one or more of these defining characteristics. sometimes called "atypical" pneumococci, these isolates can be the source of considerable confusion in the clinical laboratory.  little is known to date about the genetic relationships of such organisms with classical s. pneumoniae isolates. here we describe these relationships based on sequence analysis of housekeeping genes in comparison with previously characterized isolates of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis, and s. oralis. while most pneumococci were found to represent a closely related group these studies identified a subgroup of atypical pneumococcal isolates (bile insoluble and/or "acapsular") distinct from, though most closely related to, the "typical" pneumococcal isolates. however, a large proportion of isolates, found to be atypical on the basis of capsule reaction alone, did group with typical pneumococci, suggesting that they have either lost capsule production or represent as-yet-unrecognized capsular types. in contrast to typical s. pneumoniae, isolates phenotypically identified as s. mitis and s. oralis, which included isolates previously characterized in taxonomic studies, were genetically diverse. while most of the s. oralis isolates did fall into a well-separated group, s. mitis isolates did not cluster into a well-separated group. during the  course of these studies we also identified a number of potentially important pathogenic isolates, which were frequently associated with respiratory disease, that phenotypically and genetically are most closely related to s. mitis but which harbor genes encoding the virulence determinants pneumolysin and autolysin  classically associated with s. pneumoniae.

TI  == immunoglobulins in nasal secretions of healthy humans: structural integrity of secretory immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) and occurrence of neutralizing antibodies to iga1 proteases of nasal bacteria.
AB  == certain bacteria, including overt pathogens as well as commensals, produce immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) proteases. by cleaving iga1, including secretory iga1, in the hinge region, these enzymes may interfere with the barrier functions of mucosal iga antibodies, as indicated by experiments in vitro. previous studies have suggested that cleavage of iga1 in nasal secretions may be associated with the development and perpetuation of atopic disease. to clarify the potential effect of iga1 protease-producing bacteria in the nasal cavity, we have analyzed  immunoglobulin isotypes in nasal secretions of 11 healthy humans, with a focus on iga, and at the same time have characterized and quantified iga1 protease-producing bacteria in the nasal flora of the subjects. samples in the form of nasal wash were collected by using a washing liquid that contained lithium as an internal reference. dilution factors and, subsequently, concentrations in undiluted secretions could thereby be calculated. iga, mainly in the secretory form, was found by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to be the dominant isotype in all subjects, and the vast majority of iga (median, 91%) was  of the a1 subclass, corroborating results of previous analyses at the level of immunoglobulin-producing cells. levels of serum-type immunoglobulins were low, except for four subjects in whom levels of igg corresponded to 20 to 66% of total iga. cumulative levels of iga, igg, and igm in undiluted secretions ranged from 260 to 2,494 (median, 777) microg ml(-1). iga1 protease-producing bacteria (haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, or streptococcus mitis biovar  1) were isolated from the nasal cavities of seven subjects at 2.1 x 10(3) to 7.2  x 10(6) cfu per ml of undiluted secretion, corresponding to 0.2 to 99.6% of the flora. nevertheless, alpha-chain fragments characteristic of iga1 protease activity were not detected in secretions from any subject by immunoblotting. neutralizing antibodies to iga1 proteases of autologous isolates were detected in secretions from five of the seven subjects but not in those from two subjects harboring iga1 protease-producing s. mitis biovar 1. alpha-chain fragments different from fc(alpha) and fd(alpha) were detected in some samples, possibly reflecting nonspecific proteolytic activity of microbial or host origin. these results add to previous evidence for a role of secretory immunity in the defense  of the nasal mucosa but do not help identify conditions under which bacterial iga1 proteases may interfere with this defense.

TI  == extensive variation in the ddl gene of penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae results from a hitchhiking effect driven by the penicillin-binding protein 2b gene.
AB  == an internal fragment of the ddl gene, encoding the cytoplasmic enzyme d-alanyl-d-alanine ligase, was sequenced from 566 isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae and single isolates of streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis. the 52 alleles found among the s. pneumoniae isolates fell into two groups. group a alleles were very uniform in sequence and were present in both penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant pneumococci. group b alleles were much more diverse and were found only in penicillin-resistant isolates. the streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis alleles were less diverged from group a alleles than some of the group b pneumococcal alleles, suggesting that the latter alleles contain interspecies recombinational replacements. the ddl gene was located 783 bp downstream of the penicillin-binding protein 2b gene (pbp2b). sequencing of the pbp2b-recr-ddl-murf region of three penicillin-resistant pneumococci that had diverged ddl alleles showed that the whole region from pbp2b to ddl (or beyond) was highly diverged (about 8%) compared with the sequences from three penicillin-susceptible isolates. the high  levels of diversity in the group b ddl alleles from penicillin-resistant isolates were ascribed to a hitchhiking effect whereby interspecies recombinational exchanges at pbp2b, selected by penicillin usage, often extend into, or through,  the ddl gene. the data allow the average size of the interspecies recombinational replacements to be estimated at about 6 kb.

AB  == the utility of pcr analysis of transfer dna intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tdna-ilp) for the identification to the species level of clinically relevant viridans streptococci was evaluated with a collection of reference strains of 15  species of the salivarius, anginosus, mitis and mutans rrna homology groups. pcr  products generated by using fluorescent, outwardly directed, consensus tdna primers were analysed by electrophoresis on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and  by laser fluorescence scanning. eleven species showed specific and distinct tdna  patterns: streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis,  streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus criceti and streptococcus ratti. indistinguishable patterns were obtained among two groups of species: streptococcus vestibularis and streptococcus salivarius on the one hand and streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedius on the other. s. mitis strains produced heterogeneous patterns that could be separated into three groups: a group containing s. mitis biovar 1 and two s. mitis biovar 2 groups, one of which clustered with s. parasanguinis strains while the other showed patterns unrelated to other species. these results agree in part with protein electrophoretic analysis showing that s. mitis biovar 2 strains belong to several streptococcal taxa. in conclusion, pcr analysis of tdna-ilp holds promise for rapid identification of viridans streptococci that are difficult to identify by phenotypic tests.

TI  == genetic approaches to the identification of the mitis group within the genus streptococcus.
AB  == the usefulness and reliability of partial sequence analysis of the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase gene (soda), autolysin (lyta) gene amplification and species-specific pcr based on the d-alanine:d-alanine ligase (ddl) gene for differentiating each member of the mitis group of the genus streptococcus was investigated. on the phylogenetic tree based on soda partial sequences (366 bp) from 96 strains, including all species currently within the mitis group isolated in different geographic areas (mainly japan and the uk), eight well separated clusters were generated corresponding to recognized species, and all strains fell into those clusters to which they had also been assigned by  dna-dna hybridization. the streptococcus pneumoniae sub-cluster was located within the streptococcus mitis cluster, but the soda gene of s. pneumoniae was very conserved and therefore could be separated from all other species examined.  furthermore, the lyta gene amplification approach could also be used to differentiate s. pneumoniae from other species. the species-specific amplification product of the ddl gene was successfully detected in streptococcus  sanguinis and streptococcus gordonii, but failed to be detected in some strains of streptococcus oralis including the type strain and s. mitis. we conclude that  the partial sequence analysis of the soda gene could be applied globally as a reliable and easy method for the accurate identification of all species currently within the mitis group.

TI  == antiphosphorylcholine antibody levels are elevated in humans with periodontal diseases.
AB  == human immunoglobulin g2 (igg2) serum concentrations and the igg2 antibody response to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans can be influenced by genes, by environmental factors such as smoking, and by periodontal disease status. examination of the igg2 response to phosphorylcholine (pc), a response thought to be mainly induced by the c polysaccharide of streptococcus pneumoniae, suggested  that periodontal disease status was also associated with this response. this prompted the hypothesis that pc is an important oral antigen associated with organisms in the periodontal flora and that anti-pc antibody is elevated as a consequence of periodontal disease. subjects in various periodontal disease diagnostic categories in which attachment loss is exhibited were tested for anti-pc in serum. those with adult periodontitis, localized juvenile periodontitis, generalized early-onset periodontitis, and gingival recession all  had similar levels of anti-pc igg2 serum antibody which were significantly greater than in the group of subjects with no attachment loss. analysis of plaque samples from subgingival and supragingival sites in all diseases categories for reactivity with the anti-pc specific monoclonal antibody tepc-15 revealed that a  substantial proportion of the bacteria in dental plaque (30 to 40%) bear pc antigen; this antigen was not restricted to morphotypes resembling only cocci but was also present on rods and branched filamentous organisms. we found that s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. sanguis, as well as oral actinomycetes, including a. viscosus, a. odontolyticus, and a. israelii, incorporated substantial amounts of  [(3)h]choline from culture media. further analysis of antigens derived from these organisms by western blot indicated that s. oralis, s. sanguis, a. viscosus, a. odontolyticus, and a. israelii contained tepc-15-reactive antigens. the data show that many commonly occurring bacterial species found in dental plaque contain pc  antigen and that immunization with plaque-derived pc antigens as a consequence of inflammation and periodontal attachment loss may influence systemic anti-pc antibody concentrations.

TI  == streptococcal meningitis in adult patients: current epidemiology and clinical spectrum.
AB  == streptococci other than streptococcus pneumoniae are a rare cause of bacterial meningitis in adults. we report 29 cases of streptococcal meningitis (1977-1997). the patients comprised 19 men and 10 women, with a mean age +/- standard deviation of 47 +/- 18 years. nine cases were secondary to neurosurgical procedures, seven to brain abscess, five to cerebrospinal fluid pericranial fistula, and three to endocarditis. causative microorganisms included the following: viridans group streptococci, 20 cases; anaerobic streptococci, 3; streptococcus agalactiae, 3; streptococcus bovis, 2; and streptococcus pyogenes,  1. four streptococcus mitis strains showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin (mic, 0.5-2 microg/ml). five patients (17%) died. the infection is increasing in  the hospital setting. streptococci resistant to penicillin should be considered in the empirical treatment of nosocomial meningitis. in cases of community-acquired infection, anaerobic streptococci or streptococci of the streptococcus milleri group should alert the clinician to the presence of an undiagnosed brain abscess, whereas oral streptococci of the viridans group suggest the diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis.

AB  == transfer of fluoroquinolone (fq) resistance determinants between streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans streptococci was explored by transformation in vitro. one-step fq-resistant parc mutants were selected, and resistance could be transferred from dna from s. oralis, s. mitis, s. sanguis, and s. constellatus to s. pneumoniae, with frequencies of 10(-3) to <10(-7) in correlation with the homologies of their quinolone resistance determining region sequences (95%, 91%,  85%, and 81%, respectively). reciprocal transfers of mutated parc from dna from s. pneumoniae to s. mitis and s. oralis were also observed. simultaneous transfer of mutated parc and gyra genes from s. mitis to s. pneumoniae yielded high-level-resistant pneumococcal transformants in one step at low frequencies. the pare-parc region of the type strain s. mitis 103335t had >90% homology with that of s. pneumoniae. the efficient interspecific transfer of quinolone resistance determinants in vitro leads us to anticipate their dissemination in the clinical setting.

TI  == genetic diversity of the streptococcal competence (com) gene locus.
AB  == the com operon of naturally transformable streptococcal species contains three genes, comc, comd, and come, involved in the regulation of competence. the comc gene encodes a competence-stimulating peptide (csp) thought to induce competence  in the bacterial population at a critical extracellular concentration. the comd and come genes are believed to encode the transmembrane histidine kinase and response regulator proteins, respectively, of a two-component regulator, with the comd-encoded protein being a receptor for csp. here we report on the genetic variability of comc and comd within streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. comparative analysis of sequence variations of comc and comd shows that, despite  evidence for horizontal gene transfer at this locus and the lack of transformability of many s. pneumoniae strains in the laboratory, there is a clear correlation between the presence of a particular comc allele and the cognate comd allele. these findings effectively rule out the possibility that the presence of noncognate comc and comd alleles may be responsible for the inability to induce competence in many isolates and indicate the importance of a functional com pathway in these isolates. in addition, we describe a number of novel csps from disease-associated strains of s. mitis and s. oralis. the csps from these isolates are much more closely related to those from s. pneumoniae than to most csps previously reported from s. mitis and s. oralis, suggesting that these particular organisms may be a potential source of dna in recombination events generating the mosaic structures commonly reported in genes of s. pneumoniae that are under strong selective pressure.

TI  == bacteremic pneumonia in neutropenic patients with cancer: causes, empirical antibiotic therapy, and outcome.
AB  == background: bacteremic pneumonia is a major cause of death among neutropenic patients with cancer. methods: we analyzed the causes, empirical antibiotic therapy, and outcome of 40 consecutive cases of bacteremic pneumonia identified among 408 episodes of bacteremia in adult neutropenic patients with cancer, prospectively documented from 1986 to 1995. results: the most frequent causative  organisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 cases), streptococcus pneumoniae (12 cases), escherichia coli (5 cases), and streptococcus mitis (3 cases). overall, p. aeruginosa and s. pneumoniae caused 72.5% of all episodes of bacteremic pneumonia, compared with 11.4% of bacteremic episodes from other sources (p< .001). thirty patients received ceftazidime and 10 patients received imipenem as  the beta-lactam component of the initial empirical treatment. all strains of p. aeruginosa were susceptible to both agents. forty-seven percent of streptococcal  strains were penicillin resistant and showed a decreased susceptibility to ceftazidime (minimum inhibitory concentration ranged from 1 to 64 microg/ml). five patients (12.5%) were considered to have received inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy. attributable mortality in patients with bacteremic pneumonia  was higher than in patients with bacteremia from other sources; 22 (55%) of the 40 patients with bacteremic pneumonia died, whereas 39 (10.6%) of the 368 patients with bacteremia from other sources died (p<.001). conclusions: our data  suggest that bacteremic pneumonia in neutropenic cancer patients is associated with a poor outcome and that empirical antibiotic therapy for neutropenic patients with pneumonia should include agents active against both p. aeruginosa and cephalosporin-resistant streptococci.

AB  == penicillin-resistant isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae generally contain mosaic genes encoding the low-affinity penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) pbp2x,  pbp2b, and pbp1a. we now present evidence that pbp2a and pbp1b also appear to be  low-affinity variants and are encoded by distinct alleles in beta-lactam-resistant transformants of s. pneumoniae obtained with chromosomal donor dna from a streptococcus mitis isolate. different lineages of beta-lactam-resistant pneumococcal transformants were analyzed, and transformants with low-affinity variants of all high-molecular-mass pbps, pbp2x, -2a, -2b, -1a, and -1b, were isolated. the mics of benzyl-penicillin, oxacillin, and cefotaxime  for these transformants were up to 40, 100, and 50 microg/ml, respectively, close to the mics for the s. mitis donor strain. recruitment of low-affinity pbps was accompanied by a decrease in cross-linked muropeptides as revealed by high-performance liquid chromatography of muramidase-digested cell walls, but no  qualitative changes in muropeptide chemistry were detected. the growth rates of all transformants were identical to that of the parental s. pneumoniae strain. the results stress the potential for the acquisition by s. pneumoniae of high-level beta-lactam resistance by interspecies gene transfer.

TI  == molecular evolution of rifampicin resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == rifampicin resistance has arisen in several different species of bacteria because of alterations to one or more regions in the target of the antibiotic, the beta-subunit of rna polymerase encoded by rpob. nucleotide sequence analysis of a 270 bp fragment of rpob from 16 clinical rifampicin-susceptible isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, 8 clinical rifampicin-resistant isolates, and 3 spontaneous rifampicin-resistant mutants, has revealed that, as with previously examined species, point mutations within the cluster i region of rpob, at sites encoding asp516 and his526, also confer resistance to rifampicin in this important human pathogen. moreover, the residues within cluster i, that were altered within the rifampicin-resistant mutants of s. pneumoniae, were in the same position as those previously found to alter in resistant isolates of escherichia coli and mycobacterium tuberculosis. sequence analysis of rpob, both  from these isolates of s. pneumoniae and from two strains of s. mitis, reveals that, among a number of clinical isolates, resistance to rifampicin in s. pneumoniae has arisen by point mutation. however, the nucleotide sequence of rpob from one isolate examined suggests that interspecies gene transfer may also have  played a role in the evolution of rifampicin-resistance in s. pneumoniae.

TI  == streptococcus mitis with unusually high level resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == penicillin-resistant oral streptococci constitute the genetic reservoir for beta-lactam resistance in s. pneumoniae. here we report the isolation of clinical strains of s. mitis with unusually high mic values for beta-lactam antibiotics; resistance to benzylpenicillin was 64 microg/ml and to cefotaxime 128 microg/ml.  among the beta-lactam compounds tested, only the carbapenems imipenem and meropenem showed mics below 32 microg/ml. both s. mitis strains were resistant to tetracycline and were highly resistant to aminoglycosides. pulse field mapping of chromosomal dna revealed identical patterns in both strains, indicating clonal identity of the two isolates. using chromosomal s. mitis dna, the laboratory strain s. pneumoniae r6 could be transformed in four successive steps to cefotaxime and benzylpenicillin resistance of 64 microg/ml. the results exemplify the importance of commensal streptococci for the development of cefotaxime resistance in s. pneumoniae.

TI  == an outbreak of penicillin resistant streptococcus pneumoniae investigated by a polymerase chain reaction based genotyping method.
AB  == aims: to characterise the genotypes of penicillin resistant streptococcus pneumoniae infecting patients in a care of the elderly ward and to study its transmission in a hospital environment. methods: isolates of s pneumoniae were cultured from specimens obtained from patients who had been admitted to a care of the elderly ward where an outbreak had occurred. penicillin resistant s pneumoniae were also obtained from a series of surveillance throat swabs taken from patients in the same ward. in addition, all penicillin resistant s pneumoniae isolated from specimens submitted for culture at the time of the outbreak were included. four sensitive strains isolated from a routine microbiology laboratory were included as controls. a simple polymerase chain reaction (pcr) based genotyping method for the penicillin binding protein (pbp) genes 1a, 2x, and 2b was used to characterise the genotypes. results: nine patients were infected with serotype 9 s pneumoniae. four of these patients died; two deaths were directly attributable to the infection. tested against a battery  of haemolytic streptococci and other organisms found in the respiratory tract, only two false positive reactions for pbp 2x were found among s mitis. the method demonstrated that the outbreak strain had altered pbp 1a, 2b, and 2x genes, a pattern clearly distinguishable from other penicillin resistant strains isolated  at the same time. conclusions: this method is simple to perform and would enable  many laboratories to characterise the genotype of penicillin resistant s pneumoniae and investigate transmission in their hospitals.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == a comprehensive genetic study of streptococcal immunoglobulin a1 proteases: evidence for recombination within and between species.
AB  == an analysis of 13 immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease genes (iga) of strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus sanguis was carried out to obtain information on the structure, polymorphism, and phylogeny of this specific protease, which enables bacteria to  evade functions of the predominant ig isotype on mucosal surfaces. the analysis included cloning and sequencing of iga genes from s. oralis and s. mitis biovar 1, sequencing of an additional seven iga genes from s. sanguis biovars 1 through  4, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analyses of iga genes of another 10 strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and 6 strains of s. oralis. all 13 genes  sequenced had the potential of encoding proteins with molecular masses of approximately 200 kda containing the sequence motif hemth and an e residue 20 amino acids downstream, which are characteristic of zn metalloproteinases. in addition, all had a typical gram-positive cell wall anchor motif, lpntg, which, in contrast to such motifs in other known streptococcal and staphylococcal proteins, was located in their n-terminal parts. repeat structures showing variation in number and sequence were present in all strains and may be of relevance to the immunogenicities of the enzymes. protease activities in cultures of the streptococcal strains were associated with species of different molecular  masses ranging from 130 to 200 kda, suggesting posttranslational processing possibly as a result of autoproteolysis at post-proline peptide bonds in the n-terminal parts of the molecules. comparison of deduced amino acid sequences revealed a 94% similarity between s. oralis and s. mitis iga1 proteases and a 75  to 79% similarity between iga1 proteases of these species and those of s. pneumoniae and s. sanguis, respectively. combined with the results of rflp analyses using different iga gene fragments as probes, the results of nucleotide  sequence comparisons provide evidence of horizontal transfer of iga gene sequences among individual strains of s. sanguis as well as among s. mitis and the two species s. pneumoniae and s. oralis. while iga genes of s. sanguis and s. oralis were highly homogeneous, the genes of s. pneumoniae and s. mitis showed extensive polymorphism reflected in different degrees of antigenic diversity.

TI  == effect of radiotherapy on the levels of secretory immunoglobulin a against indigenous and virulent streptococci.
AB  == it is well known that the frequency of upper respiratory infection is clinically  increased after radiotherapy of the head and neck region. this study found higher antibacterial secretory immunoglobulin a (s-iga) activity against three indigenous streptococci (streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius, and s. sanguis i) and s. pneumoniae in patients who had undergone radiation therapy of the head and neck region than in control subjects. this showed no relation to the extent of the radiation field. compared with before radiotherapy, the s-iga titer against s. pneumoniae and its ratio to the activities against the indigenous streptococci were significantly higher in patients with fully irradiated major salivary glands. these results indicated that the radiotherapy promoted the antigen-specific s-iga production of virulent streptococci in most patients with  head and neck cancer, even more than 6 months after radiotherapy. the resulting altered balance in the s-iga system of normal indigenous streptococci may also impair the ability to maintain the stable bacterial interference between normal indigenous and virulent streptococci in the oropharyngeal cavity.

TI  == natural competence in the genus streptococcus: evidence that streptococci can change pherotype by interspecies recombinational exchanges.
AB  == to map the incidence of natural competence in the genus streptococcus, we used pcr to screen a number of streptococcal strains for the presence of the recently  identified competence regulation operon, containing the comc, -d, and -e genes. this approach established that the operon is present in strains belonging to the  s. mitis and s. anginosus groups, but it was not detected in the other strains examined. competence is induced in s. pneumoniae and s. gordonii by strain-specific peptide pheromones, competence-stimulating peptides (csps). with  its unique primary structure, each csp represents a separate pheromone type (pherotype), which is recognized by the signalling domain of the downstream histidine kinase, comd. thus, all bacteria induced to competence by a particular  csp belong to the same pherotype. in this study, we identified a number of new pherotypes by sequencing the genes encoding the csp and its receptor from different streptococcal species. we found that in several cases, these genes have a mosaic structure which must have arisen as the result of recombination between  two distinct allelic variants. the observed mosaic blocks encompass the region encoding the csp and the csp-binding domain of the histidine kinase. consequently, the recombination events have led to switches in pherotype for the  strains involved. this suggests a novel mechanism for the adaptation of naturally competent streptococci to new environmental conditions.

TI  == detection of the phosphorylcholine epitope in streptococci, haemophilus and pathogenic neisseriae by immunoblotting.
AB  == the phosphorylcholine (pc) determinant in streptococcus pneumoniae is known to be linked to the cell wall polysaccharides (c-ps) and to the lipoteichoic acid (lta) (forssman antigen) of the plasma membrane. western blotting with two pc specific  murine monoclonal antibodies (mabs) designated 145,f-2 (igm) and 147,a-1 (iga) showed a similar ladder-like pattern for all examined strains of s. pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis. purified antigens run in parallel indicated that this ladder pattern is due to the pc of lta. unlike other techniques, western blotting thus enables the identification of only one of the streptococcal structures carrying the pc epitope. gram-negative organisms were also examined, and six of 11 haemophilus influenzae strains reacted with the mabs. for this species, unlike the streptococci, only one fast moving band was detected. analyses by thin-layer  chromatography (tlc) detected the pc epitope in lipopolysaccharide (lps) fraction from h. influenzae. some strains of the neisseriaceae family were also positive by western blotting, but tlc and immunostaining did not detect the pc determinant in lps.

TI  == identification and characterization of is1381, a new insertion sequence in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a new insertion sequence (is1381) was identified in the genome of streptococcus pneumoniae r6 as an 846-bp segment containing 20-bp terminal inverted repeats and flanked by 7-bp direct repeats. the three sequenced copies of this element have two overlapping open reading frame (orf) genes named orfa and orfb. however, significant variations between individual copies were found, suggesting that inactivating mutations have occurred in an original single orf. accordingly, the  consensus is1381 element derived from the comparison of the three available copies should contain a single orf sufficient to encode a basic protein of 267 amino acids which exhibited high similarity to the putative transposases of isl2  from lactobacillus helveticus and of is702 from the cyanobacterium calothrix sp.  strain pcc 7601. a minimum of five to seven copies were detected by hybridization experiments in the r6 genome. in remarkable contrast with the two previously reported pneumococcal insertion sequences, several copies of is1381 have been detected in all of the clinical isolates tested so far. interestingly, streptococcus oralis nctc 11427 (type strain), a close relative of pneumococcus,  does not contain this element, but its occurrence in the type strain of streptococcus mitis (nctc 12261) suggests that this species has exchanged dna with s. pneumoniae directly or through an intermediate species.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of 278 streptococcal blood isolates to seven antimicrobial agents.
AB  == a total of 278 streptococci isolated from blood (including 66 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae) were tested for their mic to penicillin g, gentamicin,  rifampicin, clindamycin, erythromycin, vancomycin and teicoplanin to determine the current state of resistance among streptococci isolated from blood at a university hospital in copenhagen, denmark, and thereby to assess alternative treatment for patients who are infected with a penicillin-resistant streptococcal strain or allergic to penicillin. danish blood sensitivity agar and the etest were used. overall, resistance to penicillin among streptococcus mitis strains was 44.4% (37% intermediately susceptible and 7.4% resistant). as penicillin resistance in s. mitis may be an early indication of emerging penicillin resistance among other streptococcal species, this finding is a matter of concern. except for this observation, penicillin remains the best and a safe choice for treatment of streptococcal infection. for alternative treatment when the patient is allergic to penicillin and for prophylaxis, the usual recommendation is macrolide antibiotics or clindamycin. the majority of non-enterococcal groups of streptococci remain sensitive to erthromycin and clindamycin, but the antibiotic susceptibility pattern is unpredictable without testing the isolates, so empirical therapy or prophylaxis may fail.

AB  == genetic and biochemical analysis of exopolysaccharide (eps) production in lactic  acid bacteria has been a growing field of interest in the food industry. we previously identified and characterized a gene cluster composed of 13 genes (epsa to epsm) responsible for eps production in streptococcus thermophilus sfi6. here  we report one further gene, pbp2b, that is connected to eps production. mutants with a gene disruption in pbp2b were no longer able to produce eps, exhibited a reduced growth-rate, and their cell morphology was altered. the predicted gene product showed significant homology to the class b penicillin-binding proteins 2b of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis involved in peptidoglycan synthesis. upstream of pbp2b, we further identified two genes which showed significant homology to the e. coli fold and urfl, which is an unidentified open reading frame presumed to be involved in dna repair. downstream of pbp2b, we identified a gene that showed homology to the bacillus subtilis and  the escherichia coli recm or recr which, respectively, are involved in the methyl-dependent dna mismatch repair. in s. thermophilus, pbp2b and recm were transcribed from their own promoters as monocistronic mrnas and are therefore organized as independent transcriptional units.

TI  == penicillin-binding proteins as resistance determinants in clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == altered penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) with reduced affinity for penicillin are encoded by mosaic genes in penicillin-resistant clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae. generally, members of one bacterial clone contain the same mosaic gene. we report here on a serotype 19a clone of penicillin- and multiple-resistant s. pneumoniae prevalent in hungary, members of which are exceptionally diverse in terms of pbp properties. the pbp2x gene of four 19a isolates was sequenced, and a distinct mosaic structure detected in each case. the pbp2x genes also differed from a homologous gene of a high-level penicillin-resistant s. mitis from hungary. the contribution of pbps to resistance development was studied on transformation experiments using the laboratory strain r6 as recipient, and pbp genes from the type 19a isolate hu11.  pbp2x and pbp2b function as primary resistance determinants for different beta-lactams. secondary transformation with pbp1a increased the resistance level  considerably for penicillins and cefotaxime. chromosomal dna of a high-level penicillin- and cefotaxime-resistant s. mitis from hungary also transformed the r6 strain to increased resistance levels, and pbp2x and pbp2b functioned as primary resistance determinants as above. in contrast, high-level cefotaxime resistance appeared to be due to a low affinity pbp2a, indicating that this pbp can also function as a resistance determinant.

TI  == homeologous recombination and mismatch repair during transformation in streptococcus pneumoniae: saturation of the hex mismatch repair system.
AB  == the ability of the hex generalized mismatch repair system to prevent recombination between partially divergent (also called homeologous) sequences during transformation in streptococcus pneumoniae was investigated. by using as donor in transformation cloned fragments 1.7-17.5% divergent in dna sequence from the recipient, it was observed that the hex system prevents chromosomal integration of the least and the most divergent fragments but frequently fails to do so for other fragments. in the latter case, the hex system becomes saturated (inhibited) due to an excess of mismatches: it is unable to repair a single mismatch located elsewhere on the chromosome. further investigation with chromosomal donor dna, carrying only one genetically marked divergent region, revealed that a single divergent fragment can lead to saturation of the hex system. increase in cellular concentration of either hexa, the muts homologue that binds mismatches, or hexb, the mutl homologue for which the essential role in repair as yet remains obscure, was shown to restore repair ability in previously saturating conditions. investigation of heterospecific transformation  by chromosomal dna from two related streptococcal species, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis, also revealed complete saturation of the hex system. therefore the hex system is not a barrier to interspecies recombination in s. pneumoniae. these results are discussed in light of those described for the mut system of escherichia coli.

TI  == increased proportions of bacteria capable of cleaving iga1 in the pharynx of infants with atopic disease.
AB  == based on the observation that children with a history of atopic disease show significantly increased levels of cleaved secretory iga in nasopharyngeal secretions, we have previously formulated the hypothesis that bacteria-induced local deficiencies of the immune barrier of the upper respiratory tract may be a  contributing factor in the development and perpetuation of atopic diseases. to evaluate this hypothesis, 25 infants were subjected to clinical, bacteriologic, and immunologic examination at the age of 18 mo, 30 mo, and 5 y. the 11 infants,  who showed clinical and immunologic evidence of atopic disease at the age of 18 mo, harbored significantly higher proportions of iga1 protease-producing bacteria (median, 36%; range, 14-64%) than the 14 healthy infants (median, 5%; range, 0.4-14%). no statistically significant differences were observed at the two subsequent examinations, but healthy children showed a statistically significant  increase in proportions of iga1 protease-producing bacteria in the pharynx with increasing age. iga1 protease-producing bacteria detected included streptococcus  mitis biovar 1, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parahaemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and neisseria meningitidis, of which the first mentioned species was mainly responsible for the difference observed at the 18-mo examination. percentage proportions of iga1 protease-producing bacteria were significantly related to passive smoking which may stimulate the premature and more pronounced pharyngeal colonization of the atopic infants with the iga1 protease-producing variant of s. mitis biovar 1. the results of the study support the hypothesis that iga1 protease-producing bacteria colonizing the upper respiratory tract jeopardize the local immune barrier and, thereby, may facilitate the penetration of potential allergens resulting in atopic disease.

AB  == we have developed a pcr assay, with primers derived from the autolysin (lyt) gene, for the detection of streptococcus pneumoniae dna in blood cultures. the predicted fragment of 247 bp was detected in all strains of pneumococci, embracing 12 different serotypes that were tested. although dna extracted from four viridans streptococci spp. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus parasanguis) gave amplification products, these were quite different from the predicted fragment for s. pneumoniae. application of the assay for diagnosis of septicemia caused by s. pneumoniae showed concordance between pcr and culture results. however, on four occasions pcr was positive in supernatants from both paired culture bottles while pneumococci were cultured from only one. performing pcr on negative cultures in controlled studies such as vaccine trials may provide a sensitive tool for increasing case detection.

TI  == mosaic pbpx genes of major clones of penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae have evolved from pbpx genes of a penicillin-sensitive streptococcus oralis.
AB  == penicillin-resistant clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae contain mosaic penicillin-binding protein (pbp) genes that encode pbps with decreased affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics. the mosaic blocks are believed to be the result of gene transfer of homologous pbp genes from related penicillin-resistant species.  we have now identified a gene homologous to the pneumococcal pbp2x gene (pbpx) in a penicillin-sensitive streptococcus oralis isolate m3 from south africa that diverged by almost 20% from pbpx of penicillin-sensitive pneumococci, and a central sequence block of a mosaic pbpx gene of streptococcus mitis strain nctc 10712. in contrast, it differed by only 2-4% of the 1 to 1.5 kb mosaic block in pbpx genes of three genetically unrelated penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates, two of them representing clones of serotype 6b and 23f, which are prevalent in spain and are also already found in other countries. with low concentrations of cefotaxime, transformants of the sensitive s. pneumoniae r6 strain could be selected containing pbpx genes from either s. mitis nctc 10712 or s. oralis m3, demonstrating that genetic exchange can already occur between beta-lactam-sensitive species. these data are in agreement with the assumption that pbps as penicillin-resistance determinants have evolved by the accumulation  of point mutations in genes of sensitive commensal species.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of streptococci isolated from blood from neutropenic patients.
AB  == mics were performed on 62 streptococci isolated from the blood of neutropenic patients from 1986 to 1992 using the nccls broth microdilution procedure. species isolated were 43 s. mitis, 6 s.pneumoniae, 5 s.sanguis, 1 s.pyogenes, 1 beta-hemolytic streptococcus of the group g, 1 s.adjacens, 1 s.intermedius, 4 not identified isolates (2 alpha-hemolytic, 1 non-hemolytic and 1 nutritionally variant strains). 26% of all strains were resistant or intermediate to penicillin (mic 90: 2 mg/l) and 89% to norfloxacine (mic 90: 32 mg/l). all were susceptible  to vancomycin. among cephalosporins, all strains were susceptible to cefotaxime (mic 90: 1 mg/l), ceftriaxone (mic 90: 1 mg/l) and cefepime (mic 90: 2 mg/l) while 19% were r or i to ceftazidime (mic 90: 16 mg/l). all were susceptible to imipenem (mic 90: 0.5 mg/l) and meropenem (mic 90: 1 mg/l). among the third generation cephalosporins, ceftazidime--the agent of this class of antibiotics that is most often used for the empirical therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients (in combination but also in monotherapy)--has a high resistance rate as compared to the other compounds.

TI  == the bacterial etiology of conjunctivitis in early infancy. eye prophylaxis study  group.
AB  == the authors conducted this study to determine the etiologic agents of conjunctivitis in early infancy. from 1985 to 1990, 630 infants enrolled in a randomized, controlled, double-masked study of eye prophylaxis were observed for  60 days after delivery for signs of conjunctivitis. the following isolates were categorized as pathogens: haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria cinerea, klebsiella pneumoniae, and chlamydia trachomatis. using conditional logistic regression for analysis of 97 infant pairs, the authors identified isolates categorized as pathogens almost exclusively among cases (odds ratio (or) = 18.0, 95% confidence interval (ci) 2.3-128). among the microorganisms which have not usually been regarded as pathogens in the etiology  of infant conjunctivitis, streptococcus mitis was the only microorganism associated with an increased risk of conjunctivitis (or = 5.3, 95% ci 1.8-15.0).  the findings concerning the species of bacteria most often associated with conjunctivitis, as well as the finding that method of delivery is unimportant, suggest that bacteria were transmitted to the infants' eyes after birth and not from the birth canal.

TI  == evolution of penicillin resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae; the role of streptococcus mitis in the formation of a low affinity pbp2b in s. pneumoniae.
AB  == penicillin-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae possess forms of penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) that have a low affinity for penicillin compared to those from penicillin-sensitive strains. pbp genes from penicillin-resistant isolates are very variable and have a mosaic structure composed of blocks of nucleotides that are similar to those found in pbp genes from penicillin-sensitive isolates and blocks that differ by up to 21%. these chromosomally encoded mosaic genes have presumably arisen following transformation and homologous recombination with pbp genes from a number of closely related species. this study shows that pbp2b genes from many penicillin-resistant isolates of s. pneumoniae contain blocks of nucleotides originating from streptococcus mitis. in several instances it would appear that this material alone is sufficient to produce a low affinity pbp2b. in other examples pbp2b genes possess blocks of nucleotides from s. mitis and at least one additional unidentified species. mosaic structure was also found in the pbp2b genes of penicillin-sensitive isolates of s. mitis or s. pneumoniae. these mosaics did not confer penicillin resistance but nevertheless reveal something of the extent to which localized recombination occurs in these naturally transformable streptococci.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae: a south african perspective.
AB  == resistance to penicillin among south african strains of streptococcus pneumoniae  increased from 4.9% in 1979 to 14.4% in 1990. except for resistance to co-trimoxazole (44%), resistance to other antimicrobial agents remained relatively low. multiply resistant strains belonged mainly to serovars 6b, 19a, 14, and, more recently, 23f. use of chloramphenicol to treat meningitis caused by strains relatively resistant to penicillin proved to be unsatisfactory, probably  because of the inadequate bactericidal activity of chloramphenicol against these  strains. spread of penicillin-resistant nasopharyngeal strains in pediatric wards was most common among children who received antimicrobial therapy. penicillin-binding protein (pbp) patterns were shown to vary in resistant clinical strains. interspecies transfer of penicillin resistance between streptococcus mitis and s. pneumoniae was demonstrated and antigenic homology was found in pbps 1a and 2b of strains belonging to these species. restriction enzyme mapping following dna amplification of the pbp 2b gene revealed six arrangements  among south african strains within serogroup 19. despite extensive studies in south africa and several other countries, many questions with regard to the global problem of antimicrobial resistance among s. pneumoniae strains remain unanswered, especially those that relate to prevalence in developing regions of the world.

TI  == relatedness between streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans streptococci: transfer  of penicillin resistance determinants and immunological similarities of penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  == the occurrence of highly variable penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) in penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae suggested that transfer of homologous genes from related species may be involved in resistance development.  antiserum and monoclonal antibodies raised against pbps 1a and 2b from the susceptible s. pneumoniae r6 strain were used to identify related pbps in 41 s. mitis, s. sanguis i and s. sanguis ii strains mostly isolated in south africa with mic values ranging from less than 0.15 to 16 mg/ml. furthermore, the possibility of genetic exchange was examined with 30 penicillin-resistant strains of this collection (mic greater than 0.06 mg/ml) as donors using s. pneumoniae r6 as recipient in transformation experiments. the majority of s. mitis and s. sanguis ii strains but none of the s. sanguis i strains could transform penicillin resistance genes into s. pneumoniae r6. all positive donor strains and all susceptible isolates of s. mitis and s. sanguis ii strains contained pbps which cross-reacted with the anti-pbp 1a and/or anti-pbp 2b antibodies. on the other hand, only five of the 14 s. sanguis i strains contained a pbp that reacted with one of the antibodies. this strongly suggested the presence of genes homologous to the pneumococcal pbp 1a and 2b genes in viridans streptococci, and  documents that penicillin resistance determinants can be transformed from viridans streptococci into the pneumococcus.

TI  == postsepsis bradycardia in children with leukemia.
AB  == objective: we observed sinus bradycardia in a small number of children with hematologic malignancies who were recovering from sepsis. our objective was to define this symptom complex and attempt to delineate its etiology. design: retrospective chart review. setting: a pediatric icu in a children's oncology hospital. patients: children admitted to the icu over a 24-month period who developed persistent bradycardia (heart rate less than 5% for age for greater than 1 hr) after an episode of sepsis. measurements and main results: seven children developed postsepsis bradycardia. six patients had a primary diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia and one patient had acute lymphocytic leukemia. all patients had positive blood cultures (streptococcus mitis, n = 4; escherichia coli, n = 2; and klebsiella pneumoniae, n = 1). all seven children were clinically recovering from sepsis when the bradycardia developed. neither hypotension nor other symptom was associated with the bradycardia. no therapy was given for the bradycardia. echocardiograms and ecgs were normal in all patients,  except for the presence of bradycardia. bradycardia persisted for 24 to 72 hrs. after that time, heart rates slowly increased to the normal range for age. conclusions: we speculate that this syndrome may result from alterations in beta-adrenergic receptor function or an unidentified humoral factor produced by the invading organism or as part of the host's response to sepsis. prior drug therapy or the underlying illness may predispose to this condition, since all the patients had acute leukemia. as the bradycardia was clinically insignificant, invasive therapeutic or diagnostic strategies were not indicated.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to clarify the etiological role of immune responses in tonsillar lymphocytes of the patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp). in order to determine their immune response to s. pyogenes t4, s. pyogenes t12, s mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii and s. pneumoniae, tonsillar lymphocytes from patients with ppp, ct, and sleep apnea syndrome (control) were cultured with formalinized streptococcal cellular antigens. blastoid transformation was investigated by [3h] -thymidine uptake, while antistreptococcal antibody production were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the results were as follows. 1. tonsillar lymphocytes from ppp patients underwent blastoid transformation and accelerated the production of immunoglobulin g following the addition of s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii s. mitis, s. pyogenes t4, and s. pyogenes t12, while those form ct patients and controls did so only with s. pyogenes t4 and s. pyogenes t12. 2. the spontaneous production of specific igg against various streptococci, including s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii and s. mitis by tonsillar lymphocytes from patients with ppp was already higher than that from ct patients and controls. the specific igm  production was also increased above that in ppp patients without any antigens. 3. s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii and s. salivarius antigens stimulated antigen-specific igm production in tonsillar lymphocytes from ppp patients. 4. the levels of specific igg production against s. sanguis i and s. sanguis ii by tonsillar lymphocytes from ppp patients showed a relationship with the serum levels of the ppp patients. these results suggested that the sensitization of alpha-streptococci, especially s. sanguis, in the tonsillar lacunae may lead to the specific production of anti-s. sanguis antibodies in patients with ppp, and these may be involved in the pathogenesis of ppp.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between bacterial flora in tonsillar lacunae and antistreptococcal antibody in sera of the patients with  pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp). since the pustules develops or worsens after tonsillitis in many patients with ppp, a pathogenic role of tonsillar bacteria is suggested, but no significant association has been proven so far. in  this study, the aerobes in the tonsillar lacunae were identified and quantitated  in 15 adult patients with ppp and 9 adult patients with chronic tonsillitis (ct). in addition, serum streptococcal antigen-specific antibody levels in 40 adult patients with ppp, 18 adult patients with chronic tonsillitis, and 11 healthy volunteers (controls) were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the results were as follows. 1. a total of 53 strains (17 species) of aerobes were isolated and identified from the tonsillar lacunae in patients with ppp, while 35 strains (12 species) of aerobes were found in the patients with ct. 2. s. salivarius and s. pneumoniae were the dominant aerobes isolated from patients  with ppp or ct. 3. although the rates of isolation for staphylococcus and s. pneumoniae were lower in ppp patients than in ct patients, the rate for s. sanguis i was higher in ppp patients than in ct patients. 4. the percentage of alpha, gamma-streptococci to total aerobes in ppp patients was higher than in ct  patients. 5. the igg antibody titers against s. sanguis and s. mitis, and the igm antibody titers against all streptococci investigated in ppp patients were higher than those in both ct patients and controls. 6. moreover, both the igg antibody titers against s. pyogenes t4 and s. sanguis i and the igm antibody titers against s. sanguis i and s. sanguis ii of the patients in which ppp markedly improved after tonsillectomy were higher than those in which ppp showed less improvement postoperatively.

AB  == crossreactions between bacteria occurring more or less frequently in the respiratory tract were investigated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) developed for the detection of pneumococcal c-polysaccharide. a collection of 218 strains was investigated: 30 streptococcus pneumoniae, 120 alpha-streptococci, and 68 strains representing other species. strong crossreactions were observed with 36% of the alpha-streptococci and with two of 11 staphylococcus aureus strains. the collection of alpha-streptococci consisted  of 90 fresh clinical isolates and 30 stock strains. almost all crossreactions of  alpha-streptococci were found among the clinical isolates. among the stock strains only one of four streptococcus mitis strains was positive. pneumococcal c-polysaccharide and phosphorylcholine inhibited the reactions in elisa with monoclonal antibodies against pneumococcal c-polysaccharide, as well as with a polyclonal antiserum against pneumococcal c-polysaccharide. we suggest that the cross reactions between alpha-streptococci and pneumococci depend on the presence of phosphorylcholine as a common antigenic determinant. the crossreaction in the  elisa with some staphylococcus aureus strains may be explained by the presence of protein a binding to the fc portion of the antibodies. when the 10 alpha-streptococci that showed the strongest crossreactions and ten pneumococci representing different types were tested in different concentrations the absorbance values were lower for most alpha-streptococci compared with the pneumococci. this explains that false positive results with alpha-streptococci do not seem to constitute a practical problem in this elisa developed for detection  of pneumococcal c-polysaccharide in samples from patients with pneumonia.

AB  == resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin b (mls phenotype) appears in  almost all streptococcal species isolated from man. genes coding for mls resistance are located on plasmids and one mls resistance transposon has been described. mls resistance genes have also been found in a large number of plasmid-free strains. plasmids of 17 to 20 megadaltons (mdal) that code either for mls or for both mls and chloramphenicol resistance are found in streptococci  of groups a, b, c, d (streptococcus faecalis) and g. these plasmids have broad host ranges (conjugative intraspecies, interspecies and intergeneric transfer), display similar restriction enzyme patterns and share a considerable degree of homology (78 to 95%). one smaller non-conjugative mls resistance plasmid has been isolated from str. sanguis (4.5 mdal). in group d (str. faecalis, str. faecium) streptococci, mls resistance genes are also found on plasmids that carry other antibiotic resistance (tetracycline, chloramphenicol, high-levels of streptomycin and kanamycin). these multi-resistance plasmids are either conjugative or non-conjugative and are of various sizes and molecular species and those that have been tested have narrow host-ranges. the mls resistance genes of one multi-resistant plasmid, isolated from a strain of str. faecalis, are located on  a transposon of 3.3 mdal, tn917. hybridization studies, with mls determinants as  probes, reveal homologies among various plasmid-borne mls resistance sequences. elements that are thought to be chromosome-borne mediate multiple antibiotic resistance (including mls) in streptococci of groups a, b, c, d (str. bovis), f,  g, str. pneumoniae, str. mitis, str. sanguis and str. milleri. strains harbouring such elements contain no detectable plasmid dna. in some of the strains these elements are conjugative; their resistance markers transfer en bloc at low frequency and display narrow host ranges. such elements, from str. pyogenes and str. agalactiae, were found to translocate onto various streptococcal haemolysin-bacteriocin plasmids.

AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.

TI  == increased bactericidal activity of dilute preparations of povidone-iodine solutions.
AB  == recent confirmation of intrinsic bacterial contamination of 10% povidone-iodine solution has raised questions regarding the bactericidal mechanism of iodophors and the possibility for survival of vegetative bacterial cells in iodophor solutions. in this laboratory investigation, five different species were exposed  to various dilutions of three commercial preparations of 10% povidone-iodine solution; survival was assessed after exposure for time periods varying between 0 and 8 min. all brands of povidone-iodine solution tested demonstrated more rapid  killing of staphylococcus aureus and mycobacterium chelonei at dilutions of 1:2,  1:4, 1:10, 1:50, and 1:100 than did the stock solutions, s. aureus survived a 2-min exposure to full-strength povidone-iodine solution but did not survive a 15-s exposure to a 1:100 dilution of the iodophor. both stock and dilute preparations of 10% povidone-iodine solution demonstrated rapid bactericidal action against klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas cepacia, and streptococcus mitis.
