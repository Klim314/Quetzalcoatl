TI  == the role for tola in enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli pathogenesis and virulence gene transcription.
AB  == loss of the periplasm spanning protein tola in escherichia coli leads to activation of the rcs phosphorelay, and is required for full virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as salmonella enterica and dickeya dadantii. this study explores the role for tola in the pathogenesis of enterohemorrhagic e. coli (ehec) and the effect of its mutation on the transcription of key ehec virulence  genes controlled by rcs phosphorelay, including the type iii secretion system (t3ss) (espa and tir), the e. coli common pilus (ecpa), and motility (flic). promoter activity for t3ss regulator ler was substantially higher following inactivation of tola, and corresponded with a similar elevation in espa and tir transcription. likewise, ecpa transcription was increased in ehecdeltatola. conversely, and in-line with previous studies, inactivation of tola resulted in complete loss of motility and decreased flic transcription. for all genes examined, altered transcription observed for ehecdeltatola was dependent on the outer-membrane lipoprotein rcsf. despite elevated virulence gene transcription, in tola deleted strains virulence of ehec in the galleria mellonella wax worm model was substantially attenuated in a manner at least partly dependent on rcsf, and adherence to cultured ht-29 colonic epithelial cells was markedly reduced. the results of this study broaden the role for tola in ehec pathogenesis, and suggest that significant outer-membrane perturbations are able to promote transcription of important ehec adherence factors.

TI  == bacterial virulence and fis: adapting regulatory networks to the host environment.
AB  == pathogenic bacteria have to cope with adverse conditions, such as the host environment and host defense reactions. to adapt quickly to environmental changes, pathogens have developed complex regulatory networks that ensure adequate expression of their virulence genes. recent evidence suggests that fis,  an abundant nucleoid-associated protein transiently produced during early exponential growth, plays a major role in these networks in several pathogenic bacteria. this review focuses on two enterobacteria, salmonella enterica and dickeya dadantii, that inhabit distinct ecological niches to illustrate how fis uses different strategies to coordinate virulence gene expression, depending on the bacterial lifestyle.

TI  == the salmonella transcriptome in lettuce and cilantro soft rot reveals a niche overlap with the animal host intestine.
AB  == fresh vegetables have been recurrently associated with salmonellosis outbreaks, and salmonella contamination of retail produce has been correlated positively with the presence of soft rot disease. we observed that population sizes of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344 increased 56-fold when inoculated  alone onto cilantro leaves, versus 2,884-fold when coinoculated with dickeya dadantii, a prevalent pathogen that macerates plant tissue. a similar trend in s. enterica populations was observed for soft-rotted lettuce leaves. transcriptome analysis of s. enterica cells that colonized d. dadantii-infected lettuce and cilantro leaves revealed a clear shift toward anaerobic metabolism and catabolism of substrates that are available due to the degradation of plant cells by the pectinolytic pathogen. twenty-nine percent of the genes that were upregulated in  cilantro macerates were also previously observed to have increased expression levels in the chicken intestine. furthermore, multiple genes induced in soft rot  lesions are also involved in the colonization of mouse, pig, and bovine models of host infection. among those genes, the operons for ethanolamine and propanediol utilization as well as for the synthesis of cobalamin, a cofactor in these pathways, were the most highly upregulated genes in lettuce and cilantro lesions. in s. typhimurium strain lt2, population sizes of mutants deficient in propanediol utilization or cobalamin synthesis were 10- and 3-fold lower, respectively, than those of the wild-type strain in macerated cilantro (p < 0.0002); in strain sl1344, such mutants behaved similarly to the parental strain. anaerobic conditions and the utilization of nutrients in macerated plant tissue that are also present in the animal intestine indicate a niche overlap that may explain the high level of adaptation of s. enterica to soft rot lesions, a common postharvest plant disease.

TI  == evolution of the metabolic and regulatory networks associated with oxygen availability in two phytopathogenic enterobacteria.
AB  == background: dickeya dadantii and pectobacterium atrosepticum are phytopathogenic  enterobacteria capable of facultative anaerobic growth in a wide range of o2 concentrations found in plant and natural environments. the transcriptional response to o2 remains under-explored for these and other phytopathogenic enterobacteria although it has been well characterized for animal-associated genera including escherichia coli and salmonella enterica. knowledge of the extent of conservation of the transcriptional response across orthologous genes in more distantly related species is useful to identify rates and patterns of regulon evolution. evolutionary events such as loss and acquisition of genes by lateral transfer events along each evolutionary branch results in lineage-specific genes, some of which may have been subsequently incorporated into the o2-responsive stimulon. here we present a comparison of transcriptional  profiles measured using densely tiled oligonucleotide arrays for two phytopathogens, dickeya dadantii 3937 and pectobacterium atrosepticum scri1043, grown to mid-log phase in mops minimal medium (0.1% glucose) with and without o2. results: more than 7% of the genes of each phytopathogen are differentially expressed with greater than 3-fold changes under anaerobic conditions. in addition to anaerobic metabolism genes, the o2 responsive stimulon includes a variety of virulence and pathogenicity-genes. few of these genes overlap with orthologous genes in the anaerobic stimulon of e. coli. we define these as the conserved core, in which the transcriptional pattern as well as genetic architecture are well preserved. this conserved core includes previously described anaerobic metabolic pathways such as fermentation. other components of  the anaerobic stimulon show variation in genetic content, genome architecture and regulation. notably formate metabolism, nitrate/nitrite metabolism, and fermentative butanediol production, differ between e. coli and the phytopathogens. surprisingly, the overlap of the anaerobic stimulon between the phytopathogens is also relatively small considering that they are closely related, occupy similar niches and employ similar strategies to cause disease. there are cases of interesting divergences in the pattern of transcription of genes between dickeya and pectobacterium for virulence-associated subsystems including the type vi secretion system (t6ss), suggesting that fine-tuning of the stimulon impacts interaction with plants or competing microbes. conclusions: the  small number of genes (an even smaller number if we consider operons) comprising  the conserved core transcriptional response to o2 limitation demonstrates the extent of regulatory divergence prevalent in the enterobacteriaceae. our orthology-driven comparative transcriptomics approach indicates that the adaptive response in the eneterobacteria is a result of interaction of core (regulators) and lineage-specific (structural and regulatory) genes. our subsystems based approach reveals that similar phenotypic outcomes are sometimes achieved by each  organism using different genes and regulatory strategies.

TI  == the dickeya dadantii biofilm matrix consists of cellulose nanofibres, and is an emergent property dependent upon the type iii secretion system and the cellulose  synthesis operon.
AB  == dickeya dadantii is a plant-pathogenic bacterium that produces cellulose-containing biofilms, called pellicles, at the air-liquid interface of liquid cultures. d. dadantii pellicle formation appears to be an emergent property dependent upon at least three gene clusters, including cellulose synthesis, type iii secretion system (t3ss) and flagellar genes. the d. dadantii  cellulose synthesis operon is homologous to that of gluconacetobacter xylinus, which is used for industrial cellulose production, and the cellulose nanofibres produced by d. dadantii were similar in diameter and branching pattern to those produced by g. xylinus. salmonella enterica, an enterobacterium closely related to d. dadantii, encodes a second type of cellulose synthesis operon, and it produced biofilm strands that differed in width and branching pattern from those  of d. dadantii and g. xylinus. unlike any previously described cellulose fibre, the d. dadantii cellulose nanofibres were decorated with bead-like structures. mutation of the cellulose synthesis operon genes resulted in loss of cellulose synthesis and production of a cellulase-resistant biofilm. mutation of other genes required for pellicle formation, including those encoding flia (a sigma factor that regulates flagella production), hrpl (a sigma factor that regulates the t3ss), and adra, a ggdef protein, affected both biofilm and cell morphology.  mutation of the cellulose synthase bcsa or of bcsc resulted in decreased accumulation of the t3ss-secreted protein hrpn.
