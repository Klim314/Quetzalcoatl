inhibitory effects of antiseptic mouthrinses on streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus acidophilus.
background: oral antiseptics are valuable in controlling oral infections caused by cariogenic bacteria. the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of mouthrinses and pure antiseptic compounds on streptococcus mutans and non-mutans bacteria (streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus acidophilus). methods: the agar diffusion assay was employed to determine bacterial growth inhibition. results: commercial mouthrinses containing chlorhexidine gluconate (0.2%), cetylpyridinium chloride (0.05%) and sodium fluoride (0.05%) produced statistically similar growth inhibition of s. mutans, s. sanguinis and l. acidophilus (with zones of inhibition ranging from 7.56 +/- 0.52 mm to 7.39 +/- 0.53 mm, 17.44 +/- 0.94 mm to 18.31 +/- 0.62 mm and 8.61 +/- 1.43 to 8.67 +/- 1.43 mm respectively, p > 0.05). the chlorhexidine mouthwash produced the greatest mean growth inhibition of s. sanguinis and s. mutans compared to all other mouthrinses tested (p < 0.01). the minimum concentrations at which inhibition against s. mutans could be detected were chlorhexidine gluconate at 0.005% (wt/vol), cetylpyridinium chloride 0.01% (wt/ vol), povidone iodine 10% (wt/vol) and sodium hypochlorite 0.5% (vol/vol). conclusions: chlorhexidine (0.01%), cetylpyridinium chloride (0.01%), povidone iodine (10%) and sodium hypochlorite (0.5%) are effective at inhibiting the growth of s. mutans, s. sanguinis and l. acidophilus.
intensity and duration of in-vitro antibacterial activity of different adhesives  used in orthodontics.
this work investigated the antibacterial activity of 14 bonding agents to predict their ability to inhibit white-spot development during orthodontic treatment. standardized, sterilized disks of each material were continuously rinsed (for up to 180 d) in a flow of sterile saline. at predetermined time points, the residual ability of each material to inhibit bacterial growth (determined by measuring the size of inhibition halos around disks placed onto appropriate culture media seeded with streptococcus gordonii dsm6777, streptococcus sanguinis dsm20567, streptococcus mutans dsm20523, or lactobacillus acidophilus dsm20079) and biofilm formation (determined by measuring the numbers of bacteria adherent to disks following incubation in appropriate broths) was tested in triplicate and compared with the baseline activities of freshly prepared materials. overall antibacterial and anti-biofilm activities, adjusted for exposure time and strain of bacteria, were assessed. the decrease of antibacterial activity was faster (30-60 d) and complete for fluoride-enriched materials, but slower (90 d) and partial for antimicrobial-containing materials (benzalkonium chloride, zinc oxide, chlorexidine, or mdpb). materials enriched with benzalkonium chloride, chlorexidine, or mdpb showed the highest antibacterial activities. anti-biofilm assays yielded similar results. these data could be helpful for clinicians in the choice of the best performing bonding agent also in light of duration of the clinical application.
competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
objective: to investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. material and methods: the antimicrobial activity of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains. four probiotic bacterial species (lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium) were isolated from yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. results: fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. in addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', streptococcus sanguinis. the competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. when probiotics were inoculated first, bifidobacterium inhibited porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas circumdentaria, and prevotella nigrescens; l. acidophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. circumdentaria, p. nigrescens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius; l. bulgaricus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. nigrescens; and s. thermophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and p. nigrescens. however, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens) were inoculated simultaneously. when periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, prevotella intermedia inhibited bifidobacterium and s. thermophilus. conclusions: the results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.
in vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
mutanolysin, bacteriolytic agent for cariogenic streptococci: partial purification and properties.
mutanolysin partially purified from the culture filtrate of streptomyces globisporus 1829 consists of two main lytic enzymes with an isoelectric point near ph 8.5 and 10, respectively, and proteolytic enzyme is associated with the latter lytic enzyme. mutanolysin exhibited maximal lytic activity at 60 c in the ph range 6.5 to 7.0 and was stable at 50 c in the acid range. n-bromosuccinimide caused complete inhibition of lytic activity at 1 mm, whereas calcium and magnesium ions at the same concentration caused activation. mutanolysin had lytic or bactericidal activity against the living cells of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus, which are considered to be etiologic agents of dental caries, but had no activity against s. aureus and all gram-negative strains tested. the lytic activity was well retained in human saliva. digestion of the cell walls of s. mutans bht by mutanolysin was accompanied by the liberation of free amino groups and reducing sugars. mutanolysin may be expected to be a useful agent for dental caries control.
