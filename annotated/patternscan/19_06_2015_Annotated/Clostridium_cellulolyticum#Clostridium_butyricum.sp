TI  == identification of the gene encoding nadh-rubredoxin oxidoreductase in clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == nadh-rubredoxin oxidoreductase (nror), a flavoprotein from the obligately anaerobe clostridium acetobutylicum is encoded by an orf (nror) of 1140 nucleotides. whereas primary structure analysis reveals that nror has amino acid  sequence patterns homologous with those involved in fad and nad-binding, the enzyme is distantly related to other flavoproteins in the databank. nror is highly active for reducing clostridial rubredoxin (rd) especially against c. acetobutylicum rd with an efficiency (k(cat)/k(m)) of 400,000 mm(-1)s(-1). these  results suggest that rd from c. acetobutylicum, c. pasteurianum, c. butyricum, and c. cellulolyticum can be interchanged with each other. since c. acetobutylicum is the sole clostridium strain that possesses such an enzyme, possible functions are discussed with regard to desulfovibrio gigas and pyrococcus furiosus, the only two other anaerobic systems for which a similar activity was reported, but no gene isolated.

TI  == gene transfer to clostridium cellulolyticum atcc 35319.
AB  == although much is known about the bacterial cellulosome and its various protein components, their contributions to bacterial growth on cellulose and the process  of cellulolysis in vivo cannot currently be assessed. to remedy this, the authors have developed gene transfer techniques for clostridium cellulolyticum atcc 35319. firstly, transfer of tn1545 has been obtained using an enterococcus faecalis donor. secondly, incp-mediated conjugative mobilization of plasmids from escherichia coli donors has also been achieved. the yield of transconjugants in both cases was low and was probably limited by the suboptimal growth conditions that must of necessity be employed for the co-culture of oligotrophic c. cellulolyticum with copiotrophic donors. a restriction endonuclease was detected  in crude extracts of c. cellulolyticum. this enzyme, named cce:i, is an isoschizomer of msp:i (hpa:ii). electro-transformation was employed to establish  plasmids containing the replication functions of pamss1 (en. faecalis), pim13 (bacillus subtilis), pcb102 (clostridium butyricum), pip404 (clostridium perfringens) and pwv01 (lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris) in c. cellulolyticum. transformants were only obtained if the dna was appropriately methylated on the external c of the sequence 5'-ccgg-3' using either bsu:fi methylase in vivo or msp:i methylase in vitro. plasmids based on the pamss1 and pim13 replicons were more stably maintained than one based on the pcb102 replicon. selection of transformants on solid medium led to low apparent transformation efficiencies (approx. 10(2) transformants per microg dna) which might, in part, reflect the low plating efficiency of the organism. selection of transformants in liquid medium led to a higher apparent yield of transformants (between 10(5) and 10(7) transformants per microg dna). the methods developed here will pave the way for functional analysis of the various cellulosome components in vivo.
