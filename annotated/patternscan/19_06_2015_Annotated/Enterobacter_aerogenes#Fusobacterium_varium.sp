TI  == a simulation of microbial competition in the human colonic ecosystem.
AB  == many investigations of the interactions of microbial competitors in the gastrointestinal tract used continuous-flow anaerobic cultures. the simulation reported here was a deterministic 11-compartment model coded by using the c programming language and based on parameters from published in vitro studies and  assumptions were data were unavailable. the resource compartments were glucose, lactose and sucrose, starch, sorbose, and serine. six microbial competitors included indigenous nonpathogenic colonizers of the human gastrointestinal tract  (escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, bacteroids ovatus, fusobacterium varium, and enterococcus faecalis) and the potential human enteropathogen salmonella typhimurium. flows of carbon from the resources to the microbes were modified by resource and space controls. partitioning of resources to the competitors that could utilize them was calculated at each iteration on the basis of availability of all resources by feeding preference functions. resources did not accumulate during iterations of the model. the results of the computer simulation of microbial competition model and for various modifications of the model. the results were based on few measured parameters but may be useful in the design of user-friendly software to aid researchers in defining and manipulating  the microbial ecology of colonic ecosystems as relates to food-borne disease.

TI  == selected faecal bacteria and nutrients essential for antagonism of salmonella typhimurium in anaerobic continuous flow cultures.
AB  == as few as five of the species of bacteria commonly found in human faeces--escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides ovatus and fusobacterium varium--when grown together in anaerobic continuous flow cultures exerted antagonistic effects on salmonella typhimurium as great as those given by mixed bacteria from extracts of human faeces. in a single culture, the population of s. typhimurium was c. 10(8) cfu/ml but in mixed cultures with the five antagonistic bacteria or mixed faecal bacteria it was reduced to c. 10(3) cfu/ml. antagonism appeared to be the result of competition for the growth limiting amino acids, arginine, serine, threonine and aspartic acid. optimal manifestation of antagonism required the presence of carbon sources fermentable only by antagonistic bacteria, such as lactose 0.1%, w/v, sucrose 0.1% (w/v) and starch 0.2-0.3% w/v. these carbohydrates promoted the growth of the antagonistic bacteria, particularly e. coli and b. ovatus. however, an increase in concentration by several fold of any one of four growth-limiting amino acids in the medium diminished the antagonistic effects and the population  of s. typhimurium rose 10(2)-10(3)-fold.
