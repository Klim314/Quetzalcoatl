TI  - New bacterial species associated with chronic periodontitis.
AB  - Recent investigations of the human subgingival oral flora based on ribosomal 16S  cloning and sequencing have shown many of the bacterial species present to be novel species or phylotypes. The purpose of the present investigation was to identify potential periodontal pathogens among these newly identified species and phylotypes. Species-specific ribosomal 16S primers for PCR amplification were developed for detection of new species. Associations with chronic periodontitis were observed for several new species or phylotypes, including uncultivated clones D084 and BH017 from the Deferribacteres phylum, AU126 from the Bacteroidetes phylum, Megasphaera clone BB166, clone X112 from the OP11 phylum, and clone I025 from the TM7 phylum, and the named species Eubacterium saphenum, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella denticola, and Cryptobacterium curtum. Species or phylotypes more prevalent in periodontal health included two uncultivated phylotypes, clone W090 from the Deferribacteres phylum and clone BU063 from the Bacteroidetes, and named species Atopobium rimae and Atopobium parvulum.
TI  - Characterisation of Eubacterium-like strains isolated from oral infections.
AB  - The genus Eubacterium currently includes a heterogeneous group of gram-positive,  non-spore-forming anaerobic bacilli, many of which are slow growing, fastidious and generally unreactive in biochemical tests. As a consequence, cultivation and identification of isolates are difficult and the taxonomy of the group remains indifferent. In this study, 105 isolates from odontogenic infections, infections associated with dental implants or saliva from healthy subjects and provisionally assigned to the genus Eubacterium were subjected to phenotypic and genotypic analysis. Ninety-one of the isolates were identified as belonging to one of 14 previously described species: Atopobium parvulum (5 isolates), A. rimae (29), Bulleidia extructa (2), Cryptobacterium curtum (1), Dialister pneumosintes (1), Eubacterium saburreum (2), E. sulci (8), E. yurii subsp. yurii (1), Filifactor alocis (3), Lactobacillus uli (1), Mogibacterium timidum (13), M. vescum (6), Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus (6) and Slackia exigua (13). The remaining 14 isolates did not correspond to existing species. This study confirms the diversity of organisms provisionally assigned to the genus Eubacterium by conventional identification methods. This group of organisms is frequently isolated from oral infections but their role in the aetiology of these conditions has yet to be determined.
