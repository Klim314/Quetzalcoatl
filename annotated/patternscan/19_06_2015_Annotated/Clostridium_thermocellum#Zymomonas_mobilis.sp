TI  == clostridium thermocellum atcc27405 transcriptomic, metabolomic and proteomic profiles after ethanol stress.
AB  == background: clostridium thermocellum is a candidate consolidated bioprocessing biocatalyst, which is a microorganism that expresses enzymes for both cellulose hydrolysis and its fermentation to produce fuels such as lignocellulosic ethanol. however, c. thermocellum is relatively sensitive to ethanol compared to ethanologenic microorganisms such as yeast and zymomonas mobilis that are used in industrial fermentations but do not possess native enzymes for industrial cellulose hydrolysis. results: in this study, c. thermocellum was grown to mid-exponential phase and then treated with ethanol to a final concentration of 3.9 g/l to investigate its physiological and regulatory responses to ethanol stress. samples were taken pre-shock and 2, 12, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min post-shock, and from untreated control fermentations for systems biology analyses. cell growth was arrested by ethanol supplementation with intracellular  accumulation of carbon sources such as cellobiose, and sugar phosphates, including fructose-6-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate. the largest response of c. thermocellum to ethanol shock treatment was in genes and proteins related to nitrogen uptake and metabolism, which is likely important for redirecting the cells physiology to overcome inhibition and allow growth to resume. conclusion: this study suggests possible avenues for metabolic engineering and provides comprehensive, integrated systems biology datasets that will be useful for future metabolic modeling and strain development endeavors.

TI  == ethanol production from cellobiose, amorphous cellulose, and crystalline cellulose by recombinant klebsiella oxytoca containing chromosomally integrated zymomonas mobilis genes for ethanol production and plasmids expressing thermostable cellulase genes from clostridium thermocellum.
AB  == the zymomonas mobilis genes for ethanol production have been integrated into the  chromosome of klebsiella oxytoca m5a1. the best of these constructs, strain p2, produced ethanol efficiently from cellobiose in addition to monomeric sugars. utilization of cellobiose and cellotriose by this strain eliminated the requirement for external beta-glucosidase and reduced the amount of commercial cellulase needed to ferment solka floc sw40 (primarily crystalline cellulose). the addition of plasmids encoding endoglucanases from clostridium thermocellum resulted in the intracellular accumulation of thermostable enzymes as coproducts  with ethanol during fermentation. the best of these, strain p2(pct603t) containing celd, was used to hydrolyze amorphous cellulose to cellobiose and produce ethanol in a two-stage process. strain p2(pct603t) was also tested in combination with commercial cellulases. pretreatment of solka floc sw40 at 60 degrees c with endoglucanase d substantially reduced the amount of commercial cellulase required to ferment solka floc. the stimulatory effect of the endoglucanase d pretreatment may result from the hydrolysis of amorphous regions, exposing additional sites for attack by fungal cellulases. since endoglucanase d  functions as part of a complex in c. thermocellum, it is possible that this enzyme may complex with fungal enzymes or bind cellulose to produce a more open structure for hydrolysis.

TI  == the enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation of pretreated wood substrates.
AB  == aspenwood chips were pretreated by steam explosion. the various wood fractions obtained were assayed for their ability to act as substrates for growth and cellulase production of different trichoderma and clostridium thermocellum species. steam exploded aspenwood was as efficiently utilized as solka floc and correspondingly high cellulase activities were detected in the various culture filtrates. when t. harzianum e58 was grown on increasing concentrations of solka  floc, highest cellulase and xylanase activities were detected at 1% substrate concentrations while high substrate concentrations (10-20%) inhibited growth and  enzyme production. when the cellulosic substrates were supplemented with increasing amounts of glucose, cellulase and xylanase production were inhibited when the glucose concentration exceeded 0.1%. highest xylanase activities were detected after growth of t. reesei c30 and t. harianum e58 on xylan and solka floc respectively. all of the steam exploded fractions were at least partially hydrolyzed by the t. harzianum e58 cellulase system. the extent of the pretreatment also influenced the ability of zymomonas mobilis and saccharomyces cerevisiae to ferment the liberated sugars to ethanol. about 85% of the theoretical yield of ethanol from cellulose could be obtained from the combined hydrolysis and fermentation of pretreated aspenwood.
