TI  == peptoniphilus methioninivorax sp. nov., a gram-positive anaerobic coccus isolated from retail ground beef.
AB  == strain nrrl b-23883(t) was isolated from retail ground beef as part of a study on the genetic diversity of clostridium perfringens. the strain was found to be a strictly anaerobic, gram-positive coccus that was able to utilize peptone as a sole carbon source. analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequence revealed that the strain was closely related to species within the genera peptoniphilus and anaerosphaera, but it was substantially different from the closest recognized species by nearly 10 % sequence divergence. the strain was also found to be closely related (>99 % sequence similarity) to an uncultured bacterial strain that was sequenced from a 16s rrna gene clone library constructed to characterize the bacterial community of faeces from a captive spotted hyena. strain nrrl b-23883(t) shared the peptidoglycan type a4beta, l-orn-d-glu with members of the  genus peptoniphilus. further phenotypic analysis revealed that strain nrrl b-23883(t) was able to utilize glycyl l-methionine as a sole carbon source, in contrast to other species of the genus peptoniphilus. therefore, it is proposed that the isolate represents a novel species, peptoniphilus methioninivorax sp. nov.; the type strain is nrrl b-23883(t) ( = dsm 22461(t)).

TI  == peptoniphilus gorbachii sp. nov., peptoniphilus olsenii sp. nov., and anaerococcus murdochii sp. nov. isolated from clinical specimens of human origin.
AB  == three groups of previously unknown gram-positive, anaerobic, coccus-shaped bacteria were characterized using phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. phenotypic and genotypic data demonstrate that these organisms are distinct, and  each group represents a previously unknown subline within clostridium cluster xiii. two groups are most closely related to peptoniphilus harei in the genus peptoniphilus, and the other group is most closely related to anaerococcus lactolyticus in the genus anaerococcus. based on the findings, three novel species, peptoniphilus gorbachii sp. nov., peptoniphilus olsenii sp. nov., and anaerococcus murdochii sp. nov., are proposed. the type strains of peptoniphilus  gorbachii sp. nov., peptoniphilus olsenii sp. nov., and anaerococcus murdochii sp. nov. are wal 10418(t) (= ccug 53341(t) = atcc baa-1383(t)), wal 12922(t) (= ccug 53342(t) = atcc baa-1384(t)), and wal 17230(t) (= ccug 53340(t) = atcc baa-1385(t)), respectively.
