TI  == effects of disodium fumarate on ruminal fermentation and microbial communities in sheep fed on high-forage diets.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate effects of disodium fumarate (df) on fermentation characteristics and microbial populations in the rumen of hu sheep fed on high-forage diets. two complementary feeding trials were conducted. in trial 1, six hu sheep fitted with ruminal cannulae were randomly allocated to a 2 x 2 cross-over design involving dietary treatments of either 0 or 20 g df daily.  total dna was extracted from the fluid- and solid-associated rumen microbes, respectively. numbers of 16s rdna gene copies associated with rumen methanogens and bacteria, and 18s rdna gene copies associated with rumen protozoa and fungi were measured using real-time pcr, and expressed as proportion of total rumen bacteria 16s rdna. ruminal ph decreased in the df group compared with the control (p < 0.05). total volatile fatty acids increased (p < 0.001), but butyrate decreased (p < 0.01). addition of df inhibited the growth of methanogens, protozoa, fungi and ruminococcus flavefaciens in fluid samples. both ruminococcus albus and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens populations increased (p < 0.001) in particle-associated samples. trial 2 was conducted to investigate the adaptive response of rumen microbes to df. three cannulated sheep were fed on basal diet for 2 weeks and continuously for 4 weeks with supplementation of df at a level of 20 g/day. ruminal samples were collected every week to analyze fermentation parameters and microbial populations. no effects of df were observed on ph, acetate and butyrate (p > 0.05). populations of methanogens and r. flavefaciens decreased in the fluid samples (p < 0.001), whereas addition of df stimulated the population of solid-associated fibrobacter succinogenes. population of r. albus increased in the 2nd to 4th week in fluid-associated samples and was threefold higher in the 4th week than control week in solid samples. analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprints revealed that there were significant changes in rumen microbiota after adding df. ten of 15 clone sequences from cut-out bands appearing in both the 2nd and the 4th week were 94% to 100% similar to prevotella-like bacteria, and four sequences showed 95% to 98% similarity to selenomonas dianae. another 15 sequences were obtained from bands, which appeared in the 4th week only. thirteen of these 15 sequences showed 95% to 99% similarity to clostridium sp., and the other two showed 95% and 100% similarity to ruminococcus sp. in summary, the microorganisms positively responding to df addition were the cellulolytic bacteria, r. albus, f. succinogenes and b. fibrisolvens as well as proteolytic bacteria, b. fibrisolvens, p. ruminicola and  clostridium sp.

TI  == isolation and presumptive identification of adherent epithelial bacteria ("epimural" bacteria) from the ovine rumen wall.
AB  == one hundred sixty-one strains of adherent bacteria were isolated under anaerobic  conditions from four sites on the rumen epithelial surface of sheep fed hay or a  hay-grain ration. before isolation of bacteria, rumen tissue was washed six times in an anaerobic dilution solution, and viable bacteria suspended in the washings  were counted. calculation indicated that unattached bacteria would have been removed from the tissue by this procedure, but a slow and progressive release of  attached bacteria also occurred. nevertheless, a wide range of characteristic morphological types remained associated with the epithelium as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. most of these types were represented among the isolates. characterization and presumptive identification of the isolates showed  that 95.0% belonged to previously described genera of functionally significant rumen bacteria, including butyrivibrio sp. (31.1%), bacteroides sp. (22.4%), selenomonas ruminantium (9.9%), succinivibrio dextrinosolvens (8.7%), streptococcus bovis (8.1%), propionibacterium sp. (4.3%), treponema sp. (3.1%), and eubacterium sp., lachnospira multiparus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens (2.5%  each). eight isolates (5.0%) were not identified. l. multiparus was recovered only from hay-fed animals; all other genera were obtained from animals fed either ration. all s. bovis strains and two strains each of bacteroides sp. and butyrivibrio sp. were aerotolerant; all other strains were strictly anaerobic. bacteria representing the gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic flora associated with rumen wall tissue (r. j. wallace, k.-j. cheng, d. dinsdale, and e. r. orskov, nature (london) 279:424-426, 1979) were therefore not recovered by the techniques used; instead a different fraction of the adherent population was isolated. the term "epimural" is proposed to describe the flora associated with the rumen epithelium.
