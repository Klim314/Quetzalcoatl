TI  == [urinary calculi and infection].
AB  == infection urinary stones resulting from urease-producing bacteria are composed by struvite and/or carbonate apatite. bacterial urease splits urea and promotes the  formation of ammonia and carbon dioxide leading to urine alkalinization and formation of phosphate salts. proteus species are urease-producers, whereas a limited number of strains of other gram negative and positive species may produce urease. ureaplasma urealyticum and corynebacterium urealyticum are urease-producers that are not isolated by conventional urine cultures, but require specific tests for identification. primary treatment requires surgical removal of stones as complete as possible. extracorporeal and endoscopic treatments are usually preferred, while open surgery is actually limited to few selected cases. residual stones or fragments should be treated by chemolysis via  ureteral catheter or nephrostomy or administration of citrate salts in order to achieve a stone-free renal unit. postoperatively, recurrent urinary tract infection should be treated with appropriate antibiotic treatment although long-term antibiotic prophylaxis can cause resistance. urinary acidification has  been proposed for the prophylaxis of infection stones, but long-term acidification is difficult to achieve in urine infected by urease-producing bacteria. urease inhibitors lead to prevention and/or dissolution of stones and encrustations in patients with infection by urea-splitting bacteria, but their use is limited by their toxicity. the administration of citrate salts involves an increase of the value of nucleation ph (phn), that is the ph value at which calcium and magnesium phosphate crystallization occurs, in a greater way than the corresponding increase in the urinary ph due to its alkalinizing effect and resulting in a reduction of the risk of struvite crystallization. in conclusion prevention of the recurrence of infection stones can be achieved by an integrated approach tailored on the single patient. complete clearance of the stone must be  achieved by primary surgical procedure and residual fragments should be extensively treated. in the case of persistent infection, conservative measures,  such as acidification and urease inhibitors or citrate administration, should be  adopted to minimize its effect on urinary saturation with respect to struvite.

TI  == characterization of chorioamnionitis in 2nd-trimester c-section placentas and correlation with microorganism recovery from subamniotic tissues.
AB  == prolonged exposure to infection appears to influence fetal/neonatal development.  we characterize the relationship between histologic patterns of inflammation and  microorganism recovery from the placentas of live born infants delivered before the 28th postmenstrual week. the subamniotic parenchyma of 835 placentas delivered by cesarean section were cultured and evaluated for specific histologic patterns of inflammation in a blinded fashion. cases with prolonged membrane rupture were excluded. microorganisms were recovered from 41% of placentas. microorganisms found more frequently in placentas with high-grade chorionic plate inflammation include actinomyces, prevotella bivia, corynebacterium sp., escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, multiple species of streptococci, and mycoplasma sp., including ureaplasma urealyticum. these microorganisms were also associated with fetal vasculitis (neutrophilic infiltration of chorionic plate stem vessels or umbilical cord). recovery of microorganisms from placental  parenchyma is associated with histologic inflammation. the same microorganisms responsible for inciting high-grade chorionic plate inflammation are also most likely to promote fetal inflammation.

TI  == detection of bacteria in placental tissues obtained from extremely low gestational age neonates.
AB  == objective: the objective of the study was to quantify and identify aerobic and anaerobic bacteria as well as mycoplasma and ureaplasma in the chorionic parenchyma. study design: a sample of the chorionic parenchyma from neonates delivered between 23-27 completed weeks was cultured and tested by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods using universal bacterial primers for the presence of bacteria and mycoplasmas. results: the culture positive rate was higher for vaginal deliveries (333/489; 68%) than for cesarean sections (363/876; 41%). thirty percent of all culture-positive samples had only aerobic bacteria, 21% of  the samples had only anaerobic bacteria, and 9% of the samples had only mycoplasma/ureaplasma. the mean concentration of mycoplasma/ureaplasma (4.00 +/-  1.11 log10 cfu/g) was significantly higher (p < .001) than the total count of either aerobes (3.24 +/- 1.12 log10 cfu/g) or anaerobes (2.89 +/- 0.99 log10 cfu/g). staphylococcus sp. and corynebacterium sp. as well as organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis were the most frequently recovered. a pcr product was not detected from either randomly selected or known culture-positive  samples. conclusion: approximately half of second-trimester placentas harbor organisms within the chorionic plate. the chorion parenchyma appears to harbor constituents that prevent the identification of bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid by pcr methods.

TI  == rapid one step detection of pathogenic bacteria in urine with sexually transmitted disease (std) and prostatitis patient by multiplex pcr assay (mpcr).
AB  == we developed a multiplex pcr (mpcr) assay to simultaneously detect chlamydia trachomatis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, mycoplasma genitalium, ureaplasma urealyticum, corynebacterium spp. and seudomona aeruginosa. this method employs a single tube and multiple specific primers which yield 200, 281, 346, 423, 542, and 1,427 bp pcr products, respectively. all the pcr products were easily detected by agarose gel electrophoresis and were sequenced to confirm the specificity of the reactions. to test this method, dna extracted from urine samples was collected from 96 sexually transmitted disease or prostatitis patients at a local hospital clinical center, and were subjected to the mpcr assay. the resulting amplicons were cloned and sequenced to exactly match the sequences of known pathogenic isolates. n. gonorrhoeae and corynebacterium spp. were the most frequently observed pathogens found in the stds and prostatitis patients, respectively. unexpectedly, p. aeruginosa was also detected in some of  the std and prostatitis samples. more than one pathogen species was found in 10%  and 80.7% of std and prostatitis samples, respectively, indicating that std and prostatitis patients may have other undiagnosed and associates. the sensitivity of the assay was determined by sing purified dna from six pathogenic laboratory strains and revealed that this technique could detect pathogenic dna at concentrations ranging from 0.018 to 1.899 pg/ul. moreover, the specificities of  this assay were found to be highly efficient. thus, this mpcr assay may be useful for the rapid diagnosis of causative infectious stds and prostatitis. useful for  the infectious stds and prostatitis.

TI  == role of genital mycoplasmata and other bacteria in urolithiasis.
AB  == urease-producing bacteria have been shown to affect the formation of infection stones by splitting urea into ammonia, bicarbonate and carbonate. an increase in  alkaline ph results in urinary supersaturation of the ions. the increase in ammonia also causes injury to the urothelial glycosaminoglycan layer. non-urease-producing bacteria have been speculated to form urinary stones. midstream voided bladder urine and fractured stone nidus samples from 72 patients undergoing surgery for urolithiasis were cultured on specific media for genital mycoplasmata and on conventional media. urine samples were obtained from a control group of 40 healthy subjects. genital mycoplasmata and other bacteria were evaluated with regard to the composition of urinary stones. compared with other origins of stones, the relation between isolation of ureaplasma urealyticum and infection stone disease was statistically proven. isolation of genital mycoplasmata was significantly higher in women than in men in the study group. the urinary stones comprised 84.7% calcium stones, 8.3% uric acid stones and 6.9% infection (magnesium ammonium phosphate) stones. coagulase-negative staphylococci, escherichia coli, corynebacterium spp., enterobacterium spp. and u. urealyticum were cultured from stone samples. the results suggests that non-urease-producing bacteria, as well as urease-producing bacteria, may influence the formation of urinary stones.

TI  == encrusted cystitis and pyelitis.
AB  == encrusted cystitis (ec) and encrusted pyelitis (ep) are rare chronic inflammatory diseases of the bladder and renal pelvis, respectively, and are characterized by  mucosal inflammation with deposits of ammonium magnesium phosphate on the urothelium. corynebacterium urealyticum is the pathogen responsible in the vast majority of cases. we report 4 cases of ec and 1 case of ep. in 1 case of ec ureaplasma urealyticum was isolated as the microorganism responsible. to the best of our knowledge, u. urealyticum-induced ec has never been reported previously.

TI  == [macrolides. new therapeutic prospects].
AB  == the aim of the development of semisynthetic derivatives was to overcome the problem of chemical stability of erythromycin a in acid medium, with less variability in gastro-intestinal absorption and leading to renewed interest in macrolides. the new macrolides have the same antibacterial spectrum as erythromycin a including gram-positive and gram-negative cocci, intracellular bacteria, mycoplasma, campylobacter sp., helicobacter pylori, mycobacteria spp.,  gram-negative bacilli including haemophilus influenzae, bordetella pertussis, pasteurella multocida, gram-positive bacilli including corynebacterium diphtheriae and anaerobic species. in vitro activity against haemophilus influenzae is still a controversial subject. macrolides are among the best tolerated antibacterial agents. theoretically, macrolides could be given to a large range of patients even those suffering from underlying diseases. the new macrolides, roxithromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, dirithromycin, rokitamycin and miokamycin, are indicated for the treatment of upper respiratory  tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections due to intracellular bacteria or mycoplasma pneumoniae. macrolides could be used as first line therapy for non-gonococcal urethritis, especially those due to chlamydia trachomatis or ureaplasma urealyticum. in pelvic inflammatory infections in which chlamydia trachomatis is involved macrolides could also be used. other non-conventional indications under discussion are h. pylori and lyme's disease. macrolides in combination with other antibacterials could be an alternative for mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infections. the antiparasite effect of erythromycin has been known since the 1950s. extensive experimental work is currently underway to determine the potential use of these drugs in this setting. research during the 80s in the macrolide field, led to enhanced pharmacokinetic properties. current research is focused on expanding the antibacterial spectrum and to overcome cross-resistance among 14-membered-ring macrolides.

TI  == recurrent infection stones with apparently negative cultures. the case for blind  antibacterial treatment.
AB  == infection stones in the urinary tract are always associated with infection with a urease-producing, urea-splitting organism. the most common of these organisms are easy to culture and identify and can be treated early either with an appropriate  antibiotic or with an anti-urease agent. ureaplasma urealyticum and corynebacterium urealyticum are urease-producing organisms which are difficult to grow; their presence and effects frequently go undetected and untreated. other organisms, as yet unknown, may also be involved in the same process. we report the first series of 8 patients with recurrent infection-type stones likely to have been caused by a "hard to grow" organism. five patients never had a positive culture; in 2 patients 1 of 10 urine cultures grew a coagulase-negative staphylococcus and in 1 patient the same organism was grown from a stone but never in the urine. the clinical course of all of these patients was significantly improved after blind treatment with antibiotics and in one case with an anti-urease agent.

TI  == newly documented antimicrobial activity of quinolones.
AB  == the improved antimicrobial activity of newer fluoroquinolones and novel applications recently found for the drugs already marketed are reviewed. several  new compounds are more active against gram-positive bacteria than the presently marketed fluoroquinolones. win 57273, the most potent compound in vitro on a weight basis, is 16 to 128 times more active than ciprofloxacin against various staphylococci, streptococci, enterococcus spp., corynebacterium spp., listeria monocytogenes and bacillus spp. bmy 40062, pd 117558, pd 127391, sparfloxacin, temafloxacin and tosufloxacin also show enhanced in vitro efficacy against these  species. these drugs also possess increased activity against various anaerobes, notably clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile and the bacteroides fragilis group. mycobacterium tuberculosis, rapidly growing mycobacteria other than mycobacterium chelonae, and mycobacterium leprae are often susceptible to quinolones displaying bactericidal activity which is potentially useful for curing difficult-to-treat mycobacteriosis. in addition, a number of new products, notably those containing a cyclopropyl group, are more active than reference fluoroquinolones against mycobacterium leprae. sparfloxacin, bmy 40062 and win 57273 compare favorably with older fluoroquinolones in the killing of intracellular legionella spp., and several of the newer compounds have greater antichlamydial potency. improved antibacterial activity has also been found against mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas maltophilia. by contrast, the newer quinolones have similar or less activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae. recently, pefloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were found to be active against protozoa, including plasmodium spp., trypanosoma cruzi and leishmania donovani, but not against toxoplasma gondii. in the near future, more specific research testing unusual pathogens may lead to the identification of quinolones with more selective activity.

TI  == the acute urethral syndrome in routine practice.
AB  == midstream samples of urine from 185 acutely dysuric women and 89 symptom-free controls were screened according to the modified criteria of kass by both conventional and microaerophilic culture. among the 185 symptomatic women, coliform bacilli were isolated from 125 (67.5%) and in 45 (36%) of the latter the concentration of these organisms in the urine was less than 10(8)/l. fastidious organisms were isolated in pure and mixed cultures from 25 (13.4%) of the 185 patients and from 4 (4.5%) of 89 controls. staphylococcus species were isolated from 10.8% (9.7% s. saprophyticus; 1.1% s. epidermidis) and ureaplasma urealyticum from 2.7%. all patients infected with conventional organisms but only 30.4% of those yielding fastidious organisms had pyuria. the isolation rate of fastidious organisms tended to be higher (p = 0.055) in symptomatic women that in symptom-free controls.

TI  == [comparative bacteriological and chemical analysis of kidney calculi. apropos of  135 cases].
AB  == the formation of some urinary tract stones (struvite stones) is known to be related to infection by urease-possessing microorganisms, such as proteus sp. and some other bacteria. ureaplasma urealyticum, a genital mycoplasma, contains also  urease and is predominantly located in the urogenital tract. its significance in  the production of human urinary stones has not yet been elucidated. in this study, 135 human calculi obtained by surgery were analysed chemically and were cultured for the presence of conventional bacteria and u. urealyticum, 51 were ammonium magnesium phosphate stones and contained proteus (27), e. coli (4), staphylococcus epidermidis (3), streptococcus d (2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1),  staphylococcus aureus (1), corynebacterium (1), candida albicans (1). u. urealyticum was isolated in one patient, from two different calculi (left and right) taken after an interval of fifteen days. different bacteria were isolated  from other calculi (oxalate, uric acid). this findings suggest that ureaplasma urealyticum should be looked for in struvite calculi.

TI  == vaginitis in sexually active women: relationship to nine sexually transmitted organisms.
AB  == women seen for symptoms suggestive of vulvovaginitis were studied for the detection of mycoplasma hominis. ureaplasma urealyticum, yeast, neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, gardnerella vaginalis, herpes simplex virus,  group b beta-hemolytic streptococci, aerobes, anaerobes, and trichomonas vaginalis. asymptomatic women who reported to be sexually active and agreed to undergo comprehensive genital cultures were used as controls. there was a significant association of vulvovaginitis with the recovery of sexually transmitted organisms. however, all organisms were also recovered from asymptomatic patients. a total of 468 sexually transmitted organisms were recovered from 253 symptomatic patients (1.85 organisms per patient), while 125 were recovered from 130 asymptomatic patients (0.96 organisms per patient). the difference in prevalence between symptomatic and asymptomatic women for chlamydia trachomatis, group b streptococcus, and the mycoplasmas was not statistically significant. factors that predispose patients to the manifestations of symptoms are not clearly understood.

TI  == mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, and corynebacterium genitalium recovered from the lower genital tracts of adolescent women.
AB  == the lower genital tracts of 137 adolescent women were examined for the presence of mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, and corynebacterium genitalium in  relation to sexual activity, previous pregnancy, presence of vaginal discharge and oral contraceptive use. none of the sexually inactive and 10% of the sexually active adolescent females were colonized with u. urealyticum. none of the sexually inactive and 4% of the sexually active adolescent females were colonized with c. genitalium. nineteen percent of the sexually inactive and 36% of the sexually active adolescent females were colonized with m. hominis. the presence of m. hominis in the lower genital tract was not associated with any clinically identifiable vaginal discharge or inflammatory changes in exfoliated cervical and vaginal epithelial cells. the presence of m. hominis in the lower genital tract did not appear to be related to the use of oral contraceptives or antecedent pregnancy. there was no significant difference in the recovery rates of these microorganisms when we compared women who had non-specific vaginitis with those who did not. there is no evidence from this study that any of these microorganisms is responsible for non-specific vaginitis.

TI  == preliminary study of the flora in the lower genital tracts of sexually active adolescent females in relation to symptoms and inflammatory response.
AB  == the lower genital tracts of 20 sexually active adolescent females were examined for the presence of mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, corynebacterium genitalium, and corynebacterium pseudogenitalium. fifty percent of the asymptomatic adolescent females and 50% of the symptomatic adolescent females were colonized with m. hominis, which is higher than the percentage reported in adult females. none of the asymptomatic adolescent females and only 10% of the symptomatic adolescent females were colonized with u. urealyticum, which is much  lower than the percentage reported in adults. none of the study patients was colonized with c. genitalium, but 25% were colonized with c. pseudogenitalium. no relationship was found between the presence of m. hominis in the lower genital tract and a clinically identifiable vaginal discharge or inflammatory changes in  exfoliated cervical and vaginal epithelial cells. the presence of m.hominis in the lower genital tract does not appear to be influenced by use of oral contraceptives or antecedent pregnancy.

TI  == culture of seminal fluid in a fertility clinic.
AB  == to determine whether the culture of seminal fluid in a fertility clinic is of importance, bacterial cultures were obtained in a consecutive series of 96 patients. routine bacteriologic cultures were performed within 1 hour of collection. ureaplasma urealyticum (t-mycoplasma) cultures were also obtained in  the last 31 of the patients in this series. of these 96 patients, 11% showed significant bacterial growth (greater than 10(4) colonies/ml) in the semen specimens, 8% in those patients with normal semen analyses and 14% in those with  abnormal analyses. fifty-eight per cent of semen specimens were positive for u. urealyticum. in reference to normal and abnormal semen analyses the distribution  was the same regardless of the presence or absence of u. urealyticum. antibiotic  treatment resulted in minor changes in motility and morphology in a few patients  despite conversion to a negative culture. cultures were also coordinated with microscopic urinalysis and the presence of white blood cells or bacteria in stained smears of semen. there were no significant differences between groups with positive or negative cultures. trichomonas vaginalis was not seen.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  == semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group a) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group b). these 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group a were positive and 73% from group b were positive. mixed bacterial flora were isolated  from both groups but in group b they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group a. staphylococcus epidermidis, staph. aureus, corynebacterium species, mycoplasma hominis, and ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group a. group b revealed these organisma plus streptococcus pneumoniae type iii, strep. pyogenes group a, strep. feacalis, escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, bacteroides species, peptostreptococcus species, and eubacterium species. semen samples from group a were of better quality than those from group  b. in addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group a was greater than that from group b.

TI  == the etiology of nongonococcal urethritis in men attending a venereal disease clinic.
AB  == nongonococcal urethritis was identified as a major reason that men attended our venereal disease clinic. the prevalence of several agents that might cause nongonococcal urethritis was determined. attempts were made to isolate gonococci; chlamydiae, ureaplasms urealyticum, trichmonads, candida sp., and corynebacterium vaginale from urethral swabs from 307 men. chlamydiae were recovered from 31% of  the 67 men with nongonococcal urethritis compared to only 4% of 86 asymptomatic men without pyuria. unexpectedly, cultures from only 4% of the 99 men with gonorrhea also yielded chlamydiae. ureaplasma urealyticum was recovered from 9 of 27 asymptomatic men (33%), 16 of 30 men with nongonococcal urethritis (53%) and 16 of 68 men with gonorrhea (42%). these differences were not statistically significant. however, when chlamydiae-positive men were excluded from the analysis urethritis. twelve of 18 (76%) men with nononchlamdial nongonococcal urethritis yielded the organism compared to 8 of 26 (31%) men without urethritis. the other organisms sought were recovered infrequently and could not be associated with nongonococcal urethritis.
