TI  == plantaricin ld1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of lactobacillus plantarum ld1.
AB  == plantaricin ld1, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum ld1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees c for 20 min and 121 degrees c for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a ph range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of  organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. the crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase k showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. the molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kda, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. it inhibited not only related strains but also other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as lactobacillus curvatus nrrl b-4562, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis nrrl b-1821, enterococcus faecium nrrl b-2354, enterobacter cloacae nrrl b-14298, micrococcus  luteus, staphylococcus aureus, urogenic escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri and vibrio sp. these properties of plantaricin ld1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.

TI  == diversity of the bacterial and fungal microflora from the midgut and cuticle of phlebotomine sand flies collected in north-western iran.
AB  == background: phlebotomine sand flies are the vectors of the leishmaniases, parasitic diseases caused by leishmania spp. little is known about the prevalence and diversity of sand fly microflora colonizing the midgut or the cuticle. particularly, there is little information on the fungal diversity. this information is important for development of vector control strategies. methodology/principal findings: five sand fly species: phlebotomus papatasi, p. sergenti, p. kandelakii, p. perfiliewi and p. halepensis were caught in bileh savar and kaleybar in north-western iran that are located in endemic foci of visceral leishmaniasis. a total of 35 specimens were processed. bacterial and fungal strains were identified by routine microbiological methods. we characterized 39 fungal isolates from the cuticle and/or the midgut. they belong  to six different genera including penicillium (17 isolates), aspergillus (14), acremonium (5), fusarium (1), geotrichum (1) and candida (1). we identified 33 gram-negative bacteria: serratia marcescens (9 isolates), enterobacter cloacae (6), pseudomonas fluorescens (6), klebsiella ozaenae (4), acinetobacter sp. (3),  escherichia coli (3), asaia sp. (1) and pantoea sp. (1) as well as gram-positive  bacteria bacillus subtilis (5) and micrococcus luteus (5) in 10 isolates. conclusion/significance: our study provides new data on the microbiotic diversity of field-collected sand flies and for the first time, evidence of the presence of asaia sp. in sand flies. we have also found a link between physiological stages (unfed, fresh fed, semi gravid and gravid) of sand flies and number of bacteria that they carry. interestingly pantoea sp. and klebsiella ozaenae have been isolated in old world sand fly species. the presence of latter species on sand fly cuticle and in the female midgut suggests a role for this arthropod in dissemination of these pathogenic bacteria in endemic areas. further experiments  are required to clearly delineate the vectorial role (passive or active) of sand  flies.

TI  == phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts of leaf, stem and root from different varieties of labisa pumila benth.
AB  == a local herb, kacip fatimah, is famous amongst malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented.  therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of labisia pumila benth. total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems.  leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. hplc analyses of phenolics and flavonoids  in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin,  kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both gram positive (micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis b145, bacillus cereus b43, staphylococcus aureus s1431) and gram negative (enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumonia k36, escherichia coli e256, pseudomonas aeruginosa pi96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all  plant parts against fusarium sp., candida sp. and mucor using the agar diffusion  disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.

TI  == phytoremediation of mercury in pristine and crude oil contaminated soils: contributions of rhizobacteria and their host plants to mercury removal.
AB  == the rhizospheric soils of three tested legume crops: broad beans (vicia faba), beans (phaseolus vulgaris) and pea (pisum sativum), and two nonlegume crops: cucumber (cucumis sativus) and tomato, (lycopersicon esculentum) contained considerable numbers (the magnitude of 10(5)g(-1) soil) of bacteria with the combined potential for hydrocarbon-utilization and mercury-resistance. sequencing of the 16s rrna coding genes of rhizobacteria associated with broad beans revealed that they were affiliated to citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, exiquobacterium aurantiacum, pseudomonas veronii, micrococcus luteus,  brevibacillus brevis, arthrobacter sp. and flavobacterium psychrophilum. these rhizobacteria were also diazotrophic, i.e. capable of n(2) fixation, which makes  them self-sufficient regarding their nitrogen nutrition and thus suitable remediation agents in nitrogen-poor soils, such as the oily desert soil. the crude oil attenuation potential of the individual rhizobacteria was inhibited by  hgcl(2), but about 50% or more of this potential was still maintained in the presence of up to 40 mgl(-1) hgcl(2). rhizobacteria-free plants removed amounts of mercury from the surrounding media almost equivalent to those removed by the rhizospheric bacterial consortia in the absence of the plants. it was concluded that both the collector plants and their rhizospheric bacterial consortia contributed equivalently to mercury removal from soil.

TI  == effect of plant age on endophytic bacterial diversity of balloon flower (platycodon grandiflorum) root and their antimicrobial activities.
AB  == balloon flower (platycodon grandiflorum) is widely cultivated vegetable and used  as a remedy for asthma in east asia. experiments were conducted to isolate endophytic bacteria from 1-, 3-, and 6-year-old balloon flower roots and to analyze the enzymatic, antifungal, and anti-human pathogenic activities of the potential endophytic biocontrol agents obtained. total 120 bacterial colonies were isolated from the interior of all balloon flower roots samples. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequences showed that the population of 'low g +  c gram-positive bacteria' (lgcgpb) gradually increased 60.0-80.0% from 1 to 6 years balloon flower sample. on the other hand, maximum hydrolytic enzyme activity showing endophytic bacteria was under lgcgpb, among the bacterial strains, bacillus sp. (bf1-1 and bf3-8), bacillus sp. (bf1-2 and bf3-5), and bacillus sp. (bf1-3, bf3-6, and bf6-4) showed maximum enzyme activities. besides, bacillus licheniformis (bf3-5 and bf6-6) and bacillus pumilus (bf6-1) showed maximum antifungal activity against phytophthora capsici, fusarium oxysporum, rhizoctonia solani, and pythium ultimum. moreover, bacillus licheniformis was found in 3 and 6 years balloon flower roots, but bacillus pumilus was found only  in 6 years sample. it is presumed that older balloon flower plants invite more potential antifungal endophytes for there protection from plant diseases. in addition, bacillus sp. (bf1-2 and bf3-5) showed maximum anti-human pathogenic activity. so, plant age is presumed to influence diversity of balloon flower endophytic bacteria.

TI  == chemical composition, antifungal and antibacterial activity of the essential oil  of chamaecyparis nootkatensis from spain.
AB  == the chemical composition of the oil of chamaecyparis nootkatensis (d. don) spach. has been analysed by gas chromatography (gc) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (gc-ms). a total of 34 compounds were identified representing more than 90% of the total oil. the oil was richer in monoterpenes than in sesquiterpenes, the major constituents being limonene (53.2%), 6-3-carene (21.0%) and a-pinene (12.2%). the antibacterial and antifungal activities of the oil were also tested against candida albicans, bacillus subtilis, enterobacter aerogenes,  enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella sp. and serratia marcescens. only two of these, bacillus subtilis and candida albicans, were sensitive to the treatment, inhibition zones  of 11 and 14 mm diameter being obtained, respectively. as far as we know, this is the first report of the antifungal and antibacterial activity of this species.

TI  == growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii grazing on different  bacteria.
AB  == free-living amoebae of the genus acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and  water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, bacillus subtilis, bacillus megaterium, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. all bacteria assayed induced a  dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) ml(-1); except for m. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. in addition, acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. single-dose experiments indicated  a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of m. luteus, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, bacterial species that allowed the highest trophozoite yields. long-term acanthamoeba-bacteria incubation revealed that encystment was significantly delayed by almost all the bacteria assayed (including s. aureus, which elicited a poor growth response) and that the presence of bacteria markedly increased cyst yield; final cyst recovery clearly depended on both the dose and the type of the  bacterium given, being much higher with e. coli, m. luteus and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == selection and identification of bacteria isolated from waste crude oil with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons removal capacities.
AB  == fifteen bacterial strains isolated from solid waste oil samples were selected due to their capacity of growing in the presence of hydrocarbons. the isolates were identified by pcr of the 16s rdna gene using fd1 and rd1 primers. the majority of the strains belonged to genera bacillus, bacillus pumilus (eight strains) and bacillus subtilis (two strains). besides, three strains were identified as micrococcus luteus, one as alcaligenes faecalis and one strain as enterobacter sp. growth of the above-mentioned strains in mineral liquid media amended with naphthalene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene or pyrene as sole carbon source was studied and our results showed that these strains can tolerate and remove different polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that may be toxic in the environment polluted with hydrocarbons. finally, the capacity of certain strains to emulsify  octane, xilene, toluene, mineral oil and crude oil, and its ability to remove hydrocarbons, look promising for its application in bioremediation technologies.

TI  == isolation and insecticidal effects of some bacteria from euproctis chrysorrhoea l. (lepidoptera: lymantriidae).
AB  == in this study, we investigated the bacterial pathogens of euproctis chrysorrhoea  and tested for their insecticidal activities. based on colony color and morphology, four isolates were determined. according to morphological, physiological and biochemical characters of the isolates, they were identified as enterobacter aerogenes, lactobacillus sp., bacillus thuringiensis and micrococcus luteus. the insecticidal effects of these bacterial isolates on third-fourth instar larvae of euproctis chrysorrhoea were investigated. the highest insecticidal effect determined on this pest is 68% with bacillus thuringiensis. the effects of the other isolates are 45% with enterobacter aerogenes, 15% micrococcus luteus and 0% with lactobacillus sp.

TI  == antibacterial activity in the hemolymph of myriapods (arthropoda).
AB  == the hemolymphs of two diplopod (chicobolus sp. and rhapidostreptus virgator) and  two chilopod species (lithobius forficatus and scolopendra cingulata) were tested for the presence of antibacterial substances using petri dish tests. the native hemolymph of all species had substances acting on living micrococcus luteus, whereas only rhapidostreptus, scolopendra, and lithobius were effective against lyophilized micrococcus. the antibacterial activity against living micrococcus increased after inoculation with bacteria (enterobacter cloacae beta-12) in chicobolus and rhapidostreptus and also against lyophilized micrococcus in the latter. thus, these effects appear to be inducible. none of the myriapods tested  had any bacteriostatic effect on escherichia coli d-31 whereas the growth of gram-negative e. cloacae was inhibited. the antibacterial substances in the diplopod species were unstable when heated but were resistant to freezing. at least two antibacterial substances (a lysozyme-like one and another substance) are considered to occur in myriapoda.
