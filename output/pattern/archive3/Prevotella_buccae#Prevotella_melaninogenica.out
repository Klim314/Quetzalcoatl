inhibition of prevotella and capnocytophaga immunoglobulin a1 proteases by human  serum.
oral prevotella and capnocytophaga species, regularly isolated from periodontal pockets and associated with extraoral infections, secret specific immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) proteases cleaving human iga1 in the hinge region into intact fab and fc fragments. to investigate whether these enzymes are subject to inhibition in vivo in humans, we tested 34 sera from periodontally diseased and healthy individuals in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the presence and titers of inhibition of seven prevotella and capnocytophaga proteases. all or nearly all of the sera inhibited the iga1 protease activity of prevotella buccae, prevotella oris, and prevotella loescheii. a minor proportion of the sera inhibited prevotella buccalis, prevotella denticola, and prevotella melaninogenica iga1 proteases, while no sera inhibited capnocytophaga ochracea iga1 protease. all inhibition titers were low, ranging from 5 to 55, with titer being defined as the reciprocal of the dilution of serum causing 50% inhibition of one defined unit of protease activity. no correlation between periodontal disease status and the presence, absence, or titer of inhibition was observed. the nature of the low titers of inhibition in all sera of the iga1 proteases of p. buccae, p. oris, and p. loescheii was further examined. in size exclusion chromatography, inhibitory activity corresponded to the peak volume of iga. additional inhibition of the p. oris iga1 protease was found in fractions containing both iga and igg. purification of the igg fractions of five sera by passage of the sera on a protein g column resulted in recovery of inhibitory igg antibodies against all three iga1 proteases, with the highest titer being for the p. oris enzyme. these finding indicate that inhibitory activity is associated with enzyme-neutralizing antibodies.
comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than bacteroides fragilis.
to assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7 gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. for comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against prevotella oralis, prevotella buccalis, prevotella bivia, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium naviforme and propionibacterium acnes. prevotella oris, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides pneumosintes, and peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. strains of veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus magnus showed mics of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. the results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving bacteroides fragilis.
