TI  == characterization of the vaginal microbiota of healthy canadian women through the  menstrual cycle.
AB  == background: the vaginal microbial community plays a vital role in maintaining women's health. understanding the precise bacterial composition is challenging because of the diverse and difficult-to-culture nature of many bacterial constituents, necessitating culture-independent methodology. during a natural menstrual cycle, physiological changes could have an impact on bacterial growth,  colonization, and community structure. the objective of this study was to assess  the stability of the vaginal microbiome of healthy canadian women throughout a menstrual cycle by using cpn60-based microbiota analysis. vaginal swabs from 27 naturally cycling reproductive-age women were collected weekly through a single menstrual cycle. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was performed to amplify the universal target region of the cpn60 gene and generate amplicons representative of the microbial community. amplicons were pyrosequenced, assembled into operational taxonomic units, and analyzed. samples were also assayed for total 16s rrna gene content and gardnerella vaginalis by quantitative pcr and screened  for the presence of mollicutes by using family and genus-specific pcr. results: overall, the vaginal microbiome of most women remained relatively stable throughout the menstrual cycle, with little variation in diversity and only modest fluctuations in species richness. microbiomes between women were more different than were those collected consecutively from individual women. clustering of microbial profiles revealed the expected groupings dominated by lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus jensenii. interestingly, two additional clusters were dominated by either bifidobacterium breve or a heterogeneous mixture of nonlactobacilli. direct g. vaginalis quantification correlated strongly with its pyrosequencing-read abundance, and mollicutes, including mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma parvum, and ureaplasma urealyticum, were detected in most samples. conclusions: our cpn60-based investigation of the vaginal microbiome demonstrated that in healthy women most vaginal microbiomes remained stable through their menstrual cycle. of interest in these findings was the presence of bifidobacteriales beyond just gardnerella species. bifidobacteriales are frequently underrepresented in 16s rrna gene-based studies, and their detection by cpn60-based investigation suggests that their significance in the vaginal community may be underappreciated.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of atopobium vaginae.
AB  == background: previous studies have indicated that a recently described anaerobic bacterium, atopobium vaginae is associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv). thus far the four isolates of this fastidious micro-organism were found to be highly resistant to metronidazole and susceptible for clindamycin, two antibiotics preferred for the treatment of bv. methods: nine strains of atopobium vaginae, four strains of gardnerella vaginalis, two strains of lactobacillus iners and one strain each of bifidobacterium breve, b. longum, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l.  jensenii were tested against 15 antimicrobial agents using the etest. results: all nine strains of a. vaginae were highly resistant to nalidixic acid and colistin while being inhibited by low concentrations of clindamycin (range: < 0.016 microg/ml), rifampicin (< 0.002 microg/ml), azithromycin (< 0.016-0.32 microg/ml), penicillin (0.008-0.25 microg/ml), ampicillin (< 0.016-0.94 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (0.023-0.25 microg/ml) and linezolid (0.016-0.125 microg/ml). we found a variable susceptibility for metronidazole, ranging from 2  to more than 256 microg/ml. the four g. vaginalis strains were also susceptible for clindamycin (< 0.016-0.047 microg/ml) and three strains were susceptible to less than 1 microg/ml of metronidazole. all lactobacilli were resistant to metronidazole (> 256 microg/ml) but susceptible to clindamycin (0.023-0.125 microg/ml). conclusion: clindamycin has higher activity against g. vaginalis and  a. vaginae than metronidazole, but not all a. vaginae isolates are metronidazole  resistant, as seemed to be a straightforward conclusion from previous studies on  a more limited number of strains.

TI  == [the antagonistic activity of bifidobacteria in vitro and in vivo studied by using gnotobiological technology].
AB  == the antagonistic activity of 4 strains of bifidobacteria (b. adolescentis 2 f1, b. longum z4, b. breve r2 and b. bifidum g1), isolated from the vagina of healthy females of the reproductive age, with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and gardnerella vaginalis were studied in vitro and in vivo. the in vitro experiments revealed that all above-mentioned bifidobacteria were capable of inhibiting the growth of all indicator bacterial strains. still of all the bifidobacteria under  study had different levels of activity. b. adolescentis strain 2 f1 exhibited the highest inhibiting activity in vitro. in contrast to in vitro experiments, in vivo experiments with b. breve r2 demonstrated its high antagonistic activity with respect to e. coli. the data thus obtained indicate that in the study of antagonistic activity the use of the in vivo model as also expedient, for it is mainly in vivo that probiotic preparations show their activity.
