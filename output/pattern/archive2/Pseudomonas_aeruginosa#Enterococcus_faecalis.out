growth inhibition of pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis by crude extractives of mansonia altisima timber sawdust.
crude, aqueous methanol and ethanol extracts of sawdust of mansonia (mansonia altisima) timber inhibited pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. the minimum inhibitory concentration ranged from 4.4 to 9.3 mg/ml, while the minimum bactericidal concentration was 10.0-25.0 mg/ml. enterococcus faecalis was more susceptible, but no marked difference occurred in the antibacterial effect of methanol and ethanol extracts. the aqueous extract was less active.
prediction of piperacillin-tazobactam susceptibility among enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other bacteria using ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, and other broad-spectrum antimicrobial in vitro test results.
the ability of various in vitro beta-lactam susceptibility test results to predict the susceptibility of piperacillin-tazobactam (a new beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combination) was assessed using more than 46,000 recent clinical isolates. the organisms were tested by reference-quality national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) broth microdilution procedures and interpreted by the currently published nccls criteria. the recommended antimicrobial tests that would accurately predict the piperacillin-tazobactam in vitro efficacy had an overall very major, false-susceptible rate of only 0.6% (< or = 1.5% is acceptable). the following drug tests can be used to judge piperacillin-tazobactam activity and spectrum (low patient risk) conservatively: for enterobacteriaceae use ticarcillin-clavulanic acid results (0.6% very major error); for pseudomonas aeruginosa use piperacillin (0.1%) results; for enterococci use ampicillin or ampicillin-sulbactam (1.8%) results; for haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis use cefotaxime or cefuroxime or ceftriaxone (1.5%); and for staphylococci use oxacillin by nccls recommendations. when the piperacillin-tazobactam testing reagents become available, the direct testing of this combination should be applied to relevant clinical isolates. the piperacillin-tazobactam break points should be reassessed as indicated by the cited minimum inhibitory concentration population analysis to improve predictive accuracy; h. influenzae susceptibility modified to < or = 2/4 micrograms/ml and enterococcus species susceptibility tested at < or = 16/4 micrograms.
