TI  - The bactericidal effect of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase on bacteria.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase) on some of  the potential bacterial pathogens of the cow was determined. NAGase treatment significantly decreased the mean log10 number of Actinomyces pyogenes (P less than 0.01) and Staphylococcus aureus (P less than 0.05) after 2 and 4 hours of incubation at 37 degrees C. Similarly NAGase treatment significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced the mean log10 number of Streptococcus agalactiae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa after 4 hours incubation at 37 degrees C. NAGase did not reduce the numbers of Escherichia coli or Enterobacter aerogenes after either 2 or 4 hours incubation. Since NAGase and presumably other lysosomal enzymes are free on normal mucosal surfaces such as the uterus it is suggested that this direct bactericidal activity may be an important component of the normal defense mechanisms.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine in a controlled release delivery system.
AB  - Chlorhexidine is widely used as a mouth rinse in the prevention and treatment of  periodontal diseases and dental caries. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine in a controlled release delivery system. The controlled release dispenser comprised a polymeric inner core matrix containing the medicament with an outer vinyl membrane controlling the drug release. The effect on the following bacteria was studied: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus mutans, Wolinella recta, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Eikenella corrodens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae. Chlorhexidine-containing vinyl patches with a diameter of 5.5 mm were placed on blood agar plates containing the various bacteria. The plates were incubated aerobically or anaerobically at 37 degrees C for 24 h or longer, when appropriate, and examined for inhibition of bacterial growth. Distinct zones of inhibition were seen surrounding all vinyl patches on all plates with all bacteria. Thus, the vinyl dispenser appeared to be an effective vehicle for releasing chlorhexidine to a localized area such as the surface of a tooth, a periodontal pocket, or a root canal.
TI  - Studies on microorganisms secured from different organs of slaughtered sheep with special reference to the microbial load in certain muscles.
AB  - A total of 312 samples collected from different organs and muscles of dead, disabled, diseased, dying, and normal carcasses of sheep were examined bacteriologically to determine the different species of microorganisms as to their public health significance. In addition, the aerobic plate count (APC) and most probable number (MPN) coliform/g were determined of Musculus biceps brachii, Musculus quadriceps femoris, and Musculus longissimus dorsi. The mean bacterial load was higher in summer than in winter in dead and in normal sheep. Moreover, the APC was higher in winter 3 hours after slaughtering than after 24 h cooling. The bacterial load decreased in that order in the muscles of dead, disabled, diseased, and dying sheep carcasses. The lowest bacterial load was recorded in the Musculus longissimus dorsi. The most predominant isolates recovered from different organs and muscles were Escherichia coli (60), staphylococci (33), Proteus vulgaris (12), Enterobacter aerogenes (11), Corynebacterium ovis (9), Alcaligenes faecalis (7), Actinomyces israelii (5), Citrobacter freundii (4), pneumococci (3), and enterococci (2). The importance is discussed of the isolated strains as zoonotic agents and for assessing the hygienic meat quality.
