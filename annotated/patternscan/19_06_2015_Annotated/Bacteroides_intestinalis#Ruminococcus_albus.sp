TI  == detection of possible ai-2-mediated quorum sensing system in commensal intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the vibrio harveyi strain bb170-autoinducer bioassay was used to detect possible  quorum sensing autoinducer-2 molecule (ai-2) in culture fluids of commensal intestinal bacteria. culture fluids of bacteroides vulgatus, clostridium proteoclasticum, escherichia coli, eubacterium rectale, lachnospira multipara, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, roseburia intestinalis, ruminococcus albus and ruminococcus flavefaciens contained ai-2-like molecules. the pcr bands from some  of the tested strains could be also amplified using primers designed for the luxs gene. these findings suggest that ai-2 is present in the gastrointestinal tract;  however, it has not yet been proved whether it is used for bacterial cell-to-cell communication.
