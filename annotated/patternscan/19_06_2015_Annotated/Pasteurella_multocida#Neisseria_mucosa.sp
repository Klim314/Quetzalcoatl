TI  == hazards of disease transfer from marine mammals to land mammals: review and recent findings.
AB  == in a 5-year study (1972-1977) of microbial agents isolated from both clinically normal and diseased marine mammals, it was shown that certain disease agents are  widespread in a diversity of ocean populations and that some are also transmissible to a number of terrestrial mammal species. leptospira interrogans serovar pomona has been isolated repeatedly from 2 species of pinnipeds (zalophus californianus califonianus and callorhinus ursinus). some of the more important bacterial pathogens for land mammals that were isolated from wild marine mammals  are pseudomonas mallei, clostridium chauvoei, c novyi, neisseria mucosa var heidelbergensis, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella spp, and pasteurella multocida. numerous serotypes of viruses classified as caliciviruses were isolated from a variety of marine mammals. some of these are known to infect several land mammal species including swine horses, and primates. for this reason., precautions should be taken to ensure that disease agents shed by captive marine mammals are not transmitted to susceptible terrestrial mammals, including animal handlers and other human beings.

TI  == aerobic bacterial flora of oral and nasal fluids of canines with reference to bacteria associated with bites.
AB  == oral and nasal fluids of 50 dogs were examined to determine the prevalence of aerobic bacteria frequently associated with animal bite wounds. the most frequently isolated microorganisms included: iij, ef-4, pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, group d streptococci, corynebacterium sp., enterobacteria, neisseria sp., moraxella sp., and bacillus sp. other species and genera were infrequently recovered and may represent transient flora. the high incidence of iij, ef-4, p. multocida, and s. aureus, all known human pathogens, suggests that they should be considered as probably contaminants in bite wounds.
