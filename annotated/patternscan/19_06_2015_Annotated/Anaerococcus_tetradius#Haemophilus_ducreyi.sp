TI  == characterization of the tet m determinants in urogenital and respiratory bacteria.
AB  == tetracycline-resistant fusobacterium nucleatum, haemophilus ducreyi, mycoplasma hominis, peptostreptococcus spp., ureaplasma urealyticum, and veillonella parvula had dna sequences which showed homology throughout the length of the tet m transposon, tn916. in contrast, gardnerella vaginalis, commensal neisseria spp.,  and the 25.2-megadalton plasmid family lacked the complete transposon.

TI  == in-vitro activity of a new penem fce 22101.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of a new penem fce 22101 was evaluated in comparison with other antimicrobial agents against 966 aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. fce 22101 inhibited 90% of enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, h. ducreyi, neisseria gonorrhoeae, branhamella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis and group b streptococcus at concentrations of 0.12-4.0 mg/l. pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant with mic90 of greater than 32 mg/l. streptococcus faecalis displayed mic90 of 16 mg/l. bacteroides fragilis, clostridium spp., peptococcus spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited at concentrations of 0.25-2.0 mg/l. beta-lactamase-producing or methicillin resistant bacteria did not have significantly elevated mics. fce 22101 was generally less active than imipenem but more active than other beta-lactam antibiotics examined.
