TI  == lactobacillus gasseri ks-13, bifidobacterium bifidum g9-1, and bifidobacterium longum mm-2 ingestion induces a less inflammatory cytokine profile and a potentially beneficial shift in gut microbiota in older adults: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study.
AB  == objective: this study determined whether older adults who consumed a probiotic mixture would have a greater proportion of circulating cd4+ lymphocytes, altered  cytokine production, and a shift in intestinal microbiota toward a healthier microbial community. methods: participants (70 +/- 1 years [mean +/- sem]; n = 32) consumed a probiotic (lactobacillus gasseri ks-13, bifidobacterium bifidum g9-1, and bifidobacterium longum mm2) or a placebo twice daily for 3 weeks with a 5-week washout period between intervention periods. blood and stools were collected before and after each intervention. the percentage of circulating cd4+  lymphocytes and ex vivo mitogen-stimulated cell cytokine production were measured. in stools, specific bacterial targets were quantified via quantitative  polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) and community composition was determined via pyrosequencing. results: during the first period of the crossover the percentage  of cd4+ cells decreased with the placebo (48% +/- 3% to 31% +/- 3%, p < 0.01) but did not change with the probiotic (44% +/- 3% to 42% +/- 3%) and log-transformed  concentrations of interleukin-10 increased with the probiotic (1.7 +/- 0.2 to 3.4 +/- 0.2, p < 0.0001) but not the placebo (1.7 +/- 0.2 to 2.1 +/- 0.2). with the probiotic versus the placebo a higher percentage of participants had an increase  in fecal bifidobacteria (48% versus 30%, p < 0.05) and lactic acid bacteria (55%  versus 43%, p < 0.05) and a decrease in escherichia coli (52% versus 27%, p < 0.05). several bacterial groups matching faeacalibactierium prausnitzii were more prevalent in stool samples with the probiotic versus placebo. conclusions: the probiotic maintained cd4+ lymphocytes and produced a less inflammatory cytokine profile possibly due to the changes in the microbial communities, which more closely resembled those reported in healthy younger populations.

TI  == interactions of salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar typhimurium with  gut bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the gut microbiota on the growth and survival of s. typhimurium. this was tested in two-species co-cultures and in mixed cultures with a simplified gut model microbiota. subsequently, interactions between s. typhimurium and human faecal bacteria were quantified in  both batch and continuous culture systems simulating the human colon. the exponential growth of s. typhimurium was halted when the population of escherichia coli reached the maximum population density in a two-compartment co-culture system where the two species were separated by a 0.45 mum pore membrane. furthermore, the growth of some gut bacteria such as lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium bifidum was inhibited by the presence of s. typhimurium in the other compartment. the survival of s. typhimurium was severely affected in mixed batch cultures with human faecal samples; a reduction of 10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml in the concentration of s. typhimurium was observed in these cultures. however, no effect on s. typhimurium survival was observed in mixed batch cultures with a simplified gut model microbiota under the same conditions.  the effect of human faecal samples on s. typhimurium in a three-stage continuous  culture was different to that obtained in batch cultures; its growth rather than  survival was affected under these conditions. s. typhimurium growth was inhibited, and the bacterium was therefore eliminated by the continuous flow of the medium. depending upon culturing conditions, the gut microbiota caused either growth inhibition, inactivation or did not affect s. typhimurium.

TI  == polyunsaturated fatty acids modify expression of tgf-beta in a co-culture model ultilising human colorectal cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to , and
AB  == commensal bacteria and polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas) have both been shown independently to modulate immune responses. this study tested the hypothesis that the different colonic immunomodulatory responses to commensal (lactobacillus gasseri) and pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus) may be modified by pufas. experiments used a transwell system combining the colorectal cell line ht29, or its mucous secreting sub-clone ht29-mtx, with peripheral blood mononuclear cells to analyse immunomodulatory signalling in response to bacteria, with and without prior treatment with arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid or docosahexaenoic acid. l. gasseri increased transforming  growth factor beta1 (tgf-beta1) mrna and protein secretion in colonic cell lines  when compared with controls, an effect that was enhanced by pre-treatment with eicosapentaenoic acid. in contrast, the gram-negative pathogen e. coli lf82 had no significant effect on tgf-beta1 protein. l. gasseri also increased il-8 mrna but not protein while e. coli increased both; although differences between pufa treatments were detected, none were significantly different to controls. colonic  epithelial cells show different immunomodulatory signalling patterns in response  to the commensal l. gasseri compared to e. coli and s. aureus and pre-treatment of these cells with pufas can modify responses. practical applications: we have demonstrated an interaction between dietary pufas and epithelial cell response to both commensal and pathogenic bacteria found in the gastrointestinal tract by utilising in vitro co-culture models. the data suggest that n-3 pufas may provide some protection against the potentially damaging effects of pathogens. furthermore, the beneficial effects of combining n-3 pufas and the commensal bacteria, and potential probiotic, l. gasseri are illustrated by the increased expression of immunoregulatory tgf-beta1.

TI  == lactobacillus gasseri k7 modulates the blood cell transcriptome of conventional mice infected with escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == aims: as the immune cells underlying the intestinal barrier sense luminal microbial signals, blood cell transcriptomics may identify subclinical changes triggered by gut bacteria that may otherwise not be detected. we have therefore investigated how lactobacillus gasseri k7 and enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli  o157:h7 modulate the blood cell transcriptome of mice possessing an intact microbiota. methods and results: we have analysed the transcriptome of five groups of c57bl/6j mice: (i) control, (ii) inoculated with a single dose of e. coli, (iii) inoculated during 2 weeks with lact. gasseri, (iv) co-inoculated with e. coli and lact. gasseri, (v) inoculated with lact. gasseri prior to e. coli infection. the transcriptome could distinguish between the five treatment groups. gene characteristics of bacterial infection, in particular inflammation, were upregulated in the mice inoculated with e. coli. lact. gasseri had only mild effects on the transcriptome but modified the gene expression induced by e. coli. conclusions: the transcriptome differentiates mice inoculated orally with e. coli, lact. gasseri and combinations of these two strains. significance and impact of the study: these results suggest that the blood cell transcriptome can  be used as a source of biomarkers to monitor the impact of probiotics in subclinical models of infectious disease.

TI  == differences in tlr9-dependent inhibitory effects of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and nf-kappa b/i kappa b-alpha system activation by genomic dna from five lactobacillus species.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) show anti-inflammatory effects, and their genomic dna  was identified as one of the anti-inflammatory components. despite the differences in anti-inflammatory effects between live lab dependent not only on genus but also species, this effect has not been compared at the genomic dna level. we compared the anti-inflammatory effects of the genomic dna from five lactobacillus species-lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus reuteri-using caco-2 cells. to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects, decreases in h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation were examined. all lab genomic dnas dose-dependently decreased h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibited h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation. comparison of these effects between lactobacillus species showed that the anti-inflammatory effects of l. acidophilus genomic dna are lower than those of the other species. furthermore, suppression of toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9), a specific receptor of bacterial dna, expression by rnai abolished the decrease of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation by lab genomic dna. our results demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effects of genomic dna differ between lactobacillus species and tlr9 is one of the major pathways responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of lab genomic dna.

TI  == evaluation of lactobacillus strains for selected probiotic properties.
AB  == eleven strains of lactobacillus collected in the culture collection of dairy microorganisms (ccdm) were evaluated for selected probiotic properties such as survival in gastrointestinal fluids, antimicrobial activity, and competition with non-toxigenic escherichia coli o157:h7 for adhesion on caco-2 cells. the viable count of lactobacilli was reduced during 3-h incubation in gastric fluid followed by 3-h incubation in intestinal fluid. all strains showed antimicrobial activity  and the three most effective strains inhibited the growth of at least 16 indicator strains. antimicrobial metabolites of seven strains active against lactobacillus and clostridium indicator strains were found to be sensitive to proteinase k and trypsin, which indicates their proteinaceous nature. the degree  of competitive inhibition of non-toxigenic e. coli o157:h7 adhesion on the surface of caco-2 cells was strain-dependent. a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the number of non-toxigenic e. coli o157:h7 adhering to caco-2 cells was observed with all lactobacilli. three strains were selected for additional studies of antimicrobial activity, i.e., lactobacillus gasseri ccdm 215, lactobacillus acidophilus ccdm 149, and lactobacillus helveticus ccdm 82.

TI  == oral administration of lactobacillus gasseri tmc0356 stimulates peritoneal macrophages and attenuates general symptoms caused by enteropathogenic escherichia coli infection.
AB  == background: enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) is an important cause of diarrhea in human. this study was conducted to investigate the ability of orally  administrated probiotic lactobacilli to protect hosts from epec infection via enhancement of immune responses. methods: lyophilized lactobacillus gasseri tmc0356 (tmc0356) was orally administered to institute of cancer research (icr) mice and sprague dawley (sd) rats for 11 and 7 days, respectively. these tested mice and rats were intraperitoneally injected with epec. body weight, general symptoms (piloerection, soft stool, diarrhea, and anal hyperemia), and mortality  of the tested mice were observed. peritoneal macrophages were extracted from peritoneal cavity of tested rats, and their phagocytosis and cytokine production  were analyzed. results: oral administration of tmc0356 accelerated the disappearance of general symptoms and reduced mortality of epec-infected mice in  the early phase. peritoneal macrophages from rats orally administered with tmc0356 showed significant increases in phagocytic activity (p < 0.05) and interleukin (il)-6 production (p < 0.01) compared to those from control rats. tumor necrosis factor-alpha and production of il-1beta, il-10, and il-12 slightly increased, although the changes were not statistically significant. conclusion: these results suggest that some of selected probiotic lactobacilli may, at least  partly, protect hosts from epec infection by the enhancement of innate immunity of host and attenuate symptoms caused by the infection.

TI  == inhibitory potential of lactobacilli against escherichia coli internalization by  ht 29 cells.
AB  == a quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization method was employed to evaluate  the competitive inhibitory effect of three lactobacillus strains (lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus plantarum) against escherichia  coli internalization in a model system of ht 29 cells. furthermore, aggregation and adhesion abilities of the lactobacillus strains were examined. all lactobacilli were able to attach to the ht 29 cells and aggregate with pathogens; however, the adhesion and aggregation degree was strain-dependent. l. reuteri possessed a high capacity of adhesion (6.80 +/- 0.63; log cfu +/- sem per well),  whereas lower capacities were expressed by l. gasseri (4.52 +/- 0.55) and l. plantarum (4.90 +/- 0.98). additionally, l. reuteri showed the rapid or normal ability to aggregate with selected e. coli in comparison with remaining two lactobacilli, which showed only slow or negative aggregative reaction. internalization of e. coli into the cell lines was markedly suppressed by l. reuteri, while l. gasseri and l. plantarum caused only a minimum anti-invasion effect. the fact that l. reuteri in our experiments showed an outstanding potential for adhering to the colon epithelial cell line, compared with the rest  strains, suggested that one of the possible mechanisms of preventing pathogen adhesion and invasion is simple competitions at certain receptors and capability  to block receptor binding sites, or that an avid interaction between l. reuteri and the host cell might be modulating intracellular events responsible for the e. coli internalization. moreover, l. reuteri exhibited a strong ability to aggregate with e. coli, which could be another limiting factor of pathogen invasion.

TI  == [analysis of diversity of vaginal microbiota in healthy chinese women by using dna-fingerprinting].
AB  == objective: to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora in  different physiological states with pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), to establish the basis for the future study of lower genital tract infections, and to provide a theoretical basis for the development of vaginal probiotics adapted to chinese females. methods: women who underwent routine gynecologic examinations in peking university first hospital from october 2009 to january 2010 were enrolled, including 30 at reproductive age and 30 at post menopause age. vaginal samples were collected and then total bacterial dna was extracted. universal bacterial primers were used to amplify the v3 region of 16s  rdna gene. pcr products were analyzed by denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). featured bands on dgge were recovered, cloned and sequenced. alignment with known sequence was made by using blast on genbank to identify bacterial strains so as to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora  in different physiological states. results: (1) vaginal flora in healthy chinese  women at their reproductive age were relatively simple, lactobacillus were the dominant bacteria. common bacteria included: lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners,and lactobacillus gasseri. while l. iners were the dominant vaginal bacteria that could not be recognized by traditional method. (2) vaginal  bacteria in the women at post menopause age were more complex than in those at reproductive age. common bacteria included: lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus crispatus, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus gallolyticus, veillonella sp., streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus anginosus, prevotella sp., anaerococcus lactolyticus and bacteroides fragilis. conclusion: based on the dgge analysis, the most common vaginal bacteria in chinese healthy women at reproductive age are lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners,and lactobacillus gasseri. the most common vaginal bacteria in healthy post-menopausal women are lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus crispatus, escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., prevotella sp.,bacteroides fragilis and lactic acid producing veillonella sp. and anaerococcus lactolyticus. meanwhile lactobacillus iners was firstly found by dgge to be the dominant vaginal bacteria in different physiological states.

TI  == evaluation of probiotic characteristics of newly isolated lactobacillus spp.: immune modulation and longevity.
AB  == in the current study, the probiotic potential of approximately 350 strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from korean infant feces and kimchi was investigated. common probiotic properties of the bacterial strains, such as acid  tolerance, bile tolerance and adhesion to human intestinal epithelial cells (ht-29 cells), were examined. some strains were found to have immune modulatory and antimicrobial properties. antagonistic activity against a panel of pathogenic bacteria was found to be strain dependent. to evaluate the immune modulatory activity of the strains, lymphocyte interferon (ifn)-gamma secretion was determined in conjunction with cell proliferation. some strains of lactobacillus  gasseri, l. fermentum and l. plantarum exhibited increased ifn-gamma levels and lymphocyte proliferation. to evaluate the effects of these immune modulating lactobacilli on host life span, caenorhabditis elegans was used as an in vivo model. nematodes that were supplied heat-killed lactobacilli as a food source exhibited obvious differences in life span compared with those fed escherichia coli op50. the mean life span (determined as mean percent survival) of worms fed  l. plantarum cjlp133 and l. fermentum la12 was 13.89% and 13.69% greater, respectively, than that of control nematodes after 21 days (p=0.036 and 0.043, respectively). in addition, some of safety profiles, including hemolytic type, gelatin hydration and degradation of urea, were found to be positive. these newly identified lactobacilli hold promise for use as probiotic agents, feed additives  and/or in food applications.

TI  == individual and co-operative roles of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide in the killing activity of enteric strain lactobacillus johnsonii ncc933 and vaginal strain lactobacillus gasseri ks120.1 against enteric, uropathogenic and vaginosis-associated pathogens.
AB  == the mechanism underlying the killing activity of lactobacillus strains against bacterial pathogens appears to be multifactorial. here, we investigate the respective contributions of hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid in killing bacterial pathogens associated with the human vagina, urinary tract or intestine  by two hydrogen peroxide-producing strains. in co-culture, the human intestinal strain lactobacillus johnsonii ncc933 and human vaginal strain lactobacillus gasseri ks120.1 strains killed enteric salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344, vaginal gardnerella vaginalis dsm 4944 and urinary tract escherichia coli cft073 pathogens. the cell-free culture supernatants (cfcss) produced the same reduction in sl1344, dsm 4944 and cft073 viability, whereas isolated bacteria had no effect. the killing activity of cfcss was heat-stable. in the presence of dulbecco's modified eagle's minimum essential medium inhibiting the lactic acid-dependent killing activity, cfcss were less effective at killing of the pathogens. catalase-treated cfcss displayed a strong decreased activity. tested alone, hydrogen peroxide triggered a concentration-dependent killing activity against all three pathogens. lactic acid alone developed a killing activity only  at concentrations higher than that present in cfcss. in the presence of lactic acid at a concentration present in lactobacillus cfcss, hydrogen peroxide displayed enhanced killing activity. collectively, these results demonstrate that for hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus strains, the main metabolites of lactobacillus, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, act co-operatively to kill enteric, vaginosis-associated and uropathogenic pathogens.

TI  == cloning and expression of beta-glucuronidase from lactobacillus brevis in e. coli and application in the bioconversion of baicalin and wogonoside.
AB  == the beta-glucuronidase (gus) gene from lactobacillus brevis ro1 was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli gms407. the gus gene was composed of 1812 bp, encoding a 603-amino-acid protein belonging to the glycosyl hydrolase family 2 with three conserved domains. the amino acid similarity was higher than 70% with  the beta-glucuronidases of various microorganisms, yet less than 58% with the beta-glucuronidase of l. gasseri adh. overexpression and purification of the gus  was performed in beta-glucuronidase-deficient e. coli gms407. the purified gus protein was 71 kda and showed 1284 u/mg of specific activity at optimum condition of ph 5.0 and 37 degrees c. at 37 degrees c, the gus remained stable for 80 min at ph values ranging from 5.0 to 8.0. the purified enzyme exhibited a half-life of 1 h at 60 degrees c and more than 2 h at 50 degrees c. when the purified gus was applied to transform baicalin and wogonoside into their corresponding aglycones, 150 microm of baicalin and 125 microm of wogonoside were completely transformed into baicalein and wogonin, respectively, within 3 h.

TI  == cd1d-dependent regulation of bacterial colonization in the intestine of mice.
AB  == the accumulation of certain species of bacteria in the intestine is involved in both tissue homeostasis and immune-mediated pathologies. the host mechanisms involved in controlling intestinal colonization with commensal bacteria are poorly understood. we observed that under specific pathogen-free or germ-free conditions, intragastric administration of pseudomonas aeruginosa, e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, or lactobacillus gasseri resulted in increased colonization of the small intestine and bacterial translocation in mice lacking cd1d, an mhc class i-like molecule, compared with wt mice. in contrast, activation of cd1d-restricted t cells (nkt cells) with alpha-galactosylceramide caused diminished intestinal colonization with the same bacterial strains. we also found prominent differences in the composition of intestinal microbiota, including increased adherent bacteria, in cd1d-/- mice in comparison to wt mice under specific pathogen-free conditions. germ-free cd1d-/- mice exhibited a defect in paneth cell granule ultrastructure and ability to degranulate after bacterial colonization. in vitro, nkt cells were shown to induce the release of lysozyme from intestinal crypts. together, these data support a role for cd1d in  regulating intestinal colonization through mechanisms that include the control of paneth cell function.

TI  == effects of probiotic bacteria and their genomic dna on th1/th2-cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) of healthy and allergic  subjects.
AB  == among the factors potentially involved in the increased prevalence of allergic diseases, modification of the intestinal flora or lack of microbial exposure during childhood has been proposed. t(h)2-cytokines increase the production of ige and stimulate mast cells and eosinophils, whereas t(h)1-cytokines, such as ifn-gamma, may suppress ige synthesis and stimulate the expression of the secretory piece of iga. thus, a dysregulation in the expression of t(h)1- and t(h)2-cytokines may contribute to the initiation and maintenance of allergic diseases. lactobacilli belonging to the natural intestinal microflora were reported to reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis and the severity of allergic manifestations and to modulate t(h)1/t(h)2 responses. the mechanisms still remain to be elucidated. we sought to assess the effect of different probiotics, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus gasseri (pa16/8), bifidobacterium bifidum (mp20/5), and bifidobacterium longum (sp07/3), on the t(h)1 and t(h)2 responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) from healthy subjects and from patients with allergy against house dust mite to staphylococcus enterotoxin a (sea) and dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (dpt). to elucidate the molecular basis of these effects, the effects of bacterial genomic  dna were compared with the effects of viable bacteria. pbmcs from allergic patients and from healthy donors were incubated for 24 or 48 h, respectively, with or without sea and dpt allergens. the effects of preincubation with live probiotic bacteria and the effect of their genomic dna, added simultaneously to cultures and incubated for 24h, were assessed by measuring t(h)1/t(h)2-cytokine production. the tested live gram-positive probiotic bacteria and their genomic dna inhibited sea- and dpt-stimulated secretion of t(h)2-cytokines (il-4 and il-5) and enhanced the stimulation of ifn-gamma. this effect was dose-dependent with a dosage-optimum, which was identical for all lactic acid producing bacteria (lab) tested (10 bacteria per pbmc) and their dna (75 ng/ml). based on the maximal effects achieved with lab and their dna, more than 50% of the effects seem to be contributed by dna. no significant effect was induced by the control,  gram-negative escherichia coli tg1. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria reduced sea-stimulated il-4 and il-5 production more effectively in pbmcs from healthy subjects than from allergic patients. in contrast to this, inhibition of dpt-stimulated il-4- and il-5-secretion was more pronounced in cells from allergic subjects. compared with living lab, bacterial dna inhibited il-4- and il-5-secretion in a similar manner. sea- and even more so dpt-stimulated ifn-gamma stimulation by living lab was less pronounced in allergic than in healthy subjects, whereas ifn-gamma stimulation by their dna was more pronounced  in allergic subjects. the tested probiotic bacteria as well as their genomic dna  modulated the t(h)1/t(h)2 response to some allergens dose-dependently. dna seems  to contribute to 50% of the effect exerted by living bacteria in this in vitro model. the magnitude of the probiotic effects differed between healthy and allergic subjects. whether the modulation found for the tested strains might be useful for the prevention and treatment of allergic diseases has to be assessed in clinical trials.

TI  == the role of prophage for genome diversification within a clonal lineage of lactobacillus johnsonii: characterization of the defective prophage lj771.
AB  == two independent isolates of the gut commensal lactobacillus johnsonii were sequenced. these isolates belonged to the same clonal lineage and differed mainly by a 40.8-kb prophage, lj771, belonging to the sfi11 phage lineage. lj771 shares  close dna sequence identity with lactobacillus gasseri prophages. lj771 coexists  as an integrated prophage and excised circular phage dna, but phage dna packaged  into extracellular phage particles was not detected. between the phage lysin gene and attr a likely maze ("antitoxin")/pemk ("toxin") gene cassette was detected in lj771 but not in the l. gasseri prophages. expressed pemk could be cloned in escherichia coli only together with the maze gene. lj771 was shown to be highly stable and could be cured only by coexpression of maze from a plasmid. the prophage was integrated into the methionine sulfoxide reductase gene (msra) and complemented the 5' end of this gene, creating a protein with a slightly altered  n-terminal sequence. the two l. johnsonii strains had identical in vitro growth and in vivo gut persistence phenotypes. also, in an isogenic background, the presence of the prophage resulted in no growth disadvantage.

AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of milkfat globule membrane fractions.
AB  == milkfat globule membranes (mfgms) were prepared from bovine cream according to standard procedures. these membranes and peptide hydrolysates, which were generated by proteolysis with immobilized digestive enzymes, were screened for antibacterial activity against escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes,  salmonella enterica typhimurium, pseudomonas fluorescens, bacillus cereus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus gasseri. assays were first performed on beef heart infusion (bhi) plates spotted with test protein-peptide fractions and then seeded with lawns of indicator cells to monitor the zone of growth inhibition. under these experimental conditions, mfgms were most active against salmonella typhimurium and p. fluorescens. however, antibacterial activity was not seen after plating on luria-bertani (lb) medium. we determined that the antimicrobial effects observed on bhi plates were due to the generation of h2o2 by xanthine oxidase, a major protein constituent of the mfgms, as a result of purine catalysis. this substrate is present in bhi but lacking in lb medium. evaluation of purified xanthine oxidase alone resulted in analogous data trends.  the growth of probiotic lactobacillus strains were affected only marginally when  grown on lactobacilli deman rogosa sharpe plates, suggesting the decreased sensitivity of these bacteria to h2o2. in this study, several mfgm hydrolysates exhibited variable antibacterial activity against test food pathogens on agar plates prepared with m9 minimal media, and this variation was not attributable to xanthine oxidase enzymatic activity. the probiotic microorganisms were mostly resilient to these antibacterial fractions. bovine mfgm fractions may represent an excellent resource material from which to generate native, naturally occurring biodefensive proteins and/or peptides.

TI  == subtractive screening for probiotic properties of lactobacillus species from the  human gastrointestinal tract in the search for new probiotics.
AB  == in the search for new probiotics, 61 lactobacillus spp. isolates, belonging to 12 species and isolated as dominant lactic acid bacteria from the feces of healthy humans, were subjected to a subtractive system of in vitro analyses, which included desirable and undesirable traits. twenty-four isolates were able to grow in 2% bovine bile, of which 13 grew in acidified broth at ph 3.5 in acidified cysteine-containing mrs broth. intrinsic resistance to certain antimicrobial agents (cefoxitin, metronidazole, vancomycin) was observed in most isolates, but  atypical resistances to erythromycin, clindamycin, or tetracycline were also found in 5 strains. undesirable traits such as alpha-chymotrypsin or n-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activities were not detected, but low beta-glucuronidase and moderate beta-glucosidase activities were recorded in 2 strains. two lactobacillus gasseri and 2 lactobacillus paracasei selected strains inhibited several intestinal pathogens in an agar spot test, including strains of escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus. they also adhered to human caco-2 and ht-29 epithelial cells in a manner comparable to lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg, and were unable to degrade pig gastric mucin in a plate assay. together, these results suggest these 4 strains to be good probiotic candidates, concluding that the subtractive screening devised in this work could be a valuable tool in large-scale surveys for probiotics.

TI  == mutational and biochemical analyses of the endolysin lys(gay) encoded by the lactobacillus gasseri jcm 1131t phage phi gay.
AB  == the lys(gay) of lactobacillus gasseri jcm 1131(t) phage phigay endolysin was purified to homogeneity using the escherichia coli/his.tag system. zymographic and spectrophotometric assays showed that lys(gay) lysed over 20 heated gram-positive bacterial species as the substrates, including lactobacilli, lactococci, enterococci, micrococci, and staphylococci. the enzymatic activity had the ph and temperature optima of about 6.5 and 37 degrees c, respectively. amino-acid substitution analysis revealed that 13 residues of lys(gay) were involved in cell-lytic activity: in the beta/alpha(gay) domain, g10, d12, e33, d36, h60, y61, d96, e98, v124, l132, and d198; in the sh3b(gay) domain, y272 and  w284. in addition, deletion analysis demonstrated that the beta/alpha(gay) domain of n-terminal 216 residues is the core enzyme portion, although the cell-lytic ability is lower than that of lys(gay). these mutational experiments suggested that beta/alpha(gay) (in which two acidic residues of d12 and e98 likely act as catalytic residues) is responsible for cell-lytic activity, and sh3b(gay) promotes beta/alpha(gay) possibly through cell-wall binding function. the purified his-tagged sh3b(gay) domain containing 94 residues from s217 to k310 (i) bound to gram-positive bacteria susceptible to lys(gay), (ii) induced aggregation of exponentially growing cells of l. gasseri jcm 1131(t), l. casei iam 1045, lactococcus lactis c2, l. lactis mg 1363, and enterococcus hirae iam 1262 by forming thread-like chained cells, (iii) inhibited lytic activity of lys(gay), and (iv) impeded autolysis of l. gasseri jcm 1131(t) in buffer systems. a truncated protein hdeltash3b(gay) lacking in n-terminal 21 residues (from s217 to e237) of sh3b(gay) and an amino-acid substituted protein hsh3b(gay)g (w284g) lost the activities of hsh3b(gay), showing that the n-terminal region and w284 probably play important roles in the sh3b(gay) function(s).

TI  == are probiotics detectable in human feces after oral uptake by healthy volunteers?
AB  == goals: assessment of the presence of probiotic bacteria in feces after oral ingestion. background: probiotic bacteria are said to have beneficial effects on  the host. as a precondition for any effect, probiotic strains must survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract. study: the feces of seven volunteers  were analyzed for the presence of probiotic strains after one week's oral ingestion of each of six commercially available products: e. coli nissle 0.5-5 x  10(9) cells (mutaflor), enterococcus faecium sf 68 7.5 x 10(7) cells (bioflorin), lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium infantis both 1 x 10(9) cells (infloran), lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum both 1 x 10(8) cells (omniflora), lactobacillus casei rhamnosus 1 x 10(9) cells (antibiophilus), and yoghurt enriched with lactobacillus casei immunitas 1 x 10(10) cells (actimel). ten colonies were selected from each stool sample, and dna was extracted and typed using random amplification of polymorphic dna (rapd). typing patterns of the ingested probiotics and the fecal isolates were compared. results: fingerprints identical to the ingested probiotic strains were recovered from fecal samples of 4/7 volunteers after one week of mutaflor, from 4/6 after taking bioflorin, and from 1/6 after infloran. cultivation of strains of the same species from fecal specimens was negative after consumption of antibiophilus, omniflora and actimel. conclusions: after oral consumption of probiotics, e. coli and enterococci could be detected in stool samples (57% and 67%, respectively). in contrast, with only one exception, ingested lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could not be detected in human feces.

TI  == modification of lactobacillus beta-glucuronidase activity by random mutagenesis.
AB  == the lactobacillus gasseri adh beta-glucuronidase gene, gusa, was cloned previously and found to exhibit excellent activity in acidic ph ranges, with maximal activity at ph 5.0. in contrast, activity was limited in neutral ph ranges of 6-7. in an effort to improve the activity of the reporter enzyme in neutral ph ranges, the gusa gene was cloned into the broad host range vector, pgk12, and subjected to random mutagenesis by passage through epicurian coli mutator strain xl1-red. two mutant alleles, gusa2 and gusa3, were recovered that  produced beta-glucuronidase with increased activity in neutral ph ranges. one of  these, gusa3, was significantly more active in the ph range of 4-8 in both escherichia coli and l. gasseri. sequence analysis of gusa2 and gusa3 revealed single base pair changes that resulted in d524g and d573a substitutions, respectively. the modified gusa3 enzyme has expanded potential for use as a reporter enzyme in expression hosts that are not acidophilic, as well as lactic acid bacteria and other microorganisms that grow in acidifying environments.

AB  == the microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the rep. of congo) and degue (a millet dough from burkina faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using ttge to separate the amplified target v3 region of the 16s rrna gene from total microbial community, followed by dna sequencing and homology search. three different extraction methods were used. guanidium thiocyanate-based dna extraction provided better performance regarding  purity and dna yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of dna bands by ttge in poto poto. by contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the dna extraction method largely depends on the food composition. sequencing of dna bands from ttge gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of lactobacillus gasseri, enterococcus sp., escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, bacillus sp., lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus casei. the following bacteria were identified in degue: l. gasseri, enterococcus sp., e. coli, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, and l. casei.

TI  == probiotic properties of vaginal lactic acid bacteria to prevent metritis in cattle.
AB  == aims: the isolation of bovine vaginal lactic acid bacteria (lab) and the screening of their beneficial properties to select those that could be used as probiotics in the prevention of bovine metritis were performed. methods and results: out of 76 lactobacillus sp. and seven streptococcus sp. strains, a small number showed high- and medium hydrophobicity when the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons method (math) was applied. in the agar plate diffusion test, a large number of strains inhibited vaginal bovine escherichia coli 99/14 and human e. coli. this inhibition was due to acid. only a few strains inhibited actinomyces pyogenes 96/393, a pathogen isolated from bovine metritis. this inhibition remained after neutralization. the taxonomic identification of the selected strains was carried out by an amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). most of the strains were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, a few as lactobacillus gasseri and one as lactobacillus rhamnosus. conclusions: bovine vaginal lactobacilli strains have differential surface properties. the strains selected are capable of inhibiting specific metritis pathogens. significance and  impact of the study: our results can be applied for future studies to design a probiotic product to prevent metritis in dairy postpartum cows.

AB  == the ability of lactobacillus (lb.) gasseri k 7 to inhibit adhesion of escherichia coli o8:k88 to intestinal mucosa was studied on cultured caco-2 cells and ex vivo on pigs' small intestinal tissue. lactobacilli were added simultaneously with e.  coli, before e. coli and after e. coli for competition, exclusion and displacement assays. the concentration of lactobacilli on fully differentiated caco-2 cells was 4.5+/-0.3 x 10(8) cfu/well, while the concentration of e. coli varied from 1.5 x 10(6) to 4.3 x 10(8) cfu/well. the number of e. coli adhered to caco-2 monolayer (cfu/well) was lineary correlated (r(2)=0.97) to the concentration of added cells. in the assay simulating exclusion, e. coli adhesion was reduced by lb. gasseri k 7 strain by 0.1 to 0.6 log cfu/well. the binding of  e. coli was inhibited even more when incubated simultaneously with lactobacilli,  particularly at the lowest concentration of e. coli (ratio e. coli/lactobacilli 1:248), where five-times reduction (or 0.7 log) was observed. when adhesion to tissue derived from pigs' jejunum was tested, concentration of e. coli was constant (6.9+/-0.14 x 10(7) cfu/ml), while the concentration of lb. gasseri k 7  was 5.9 x 10(7) and 1.3 x 10(7) cfu/ml in two independent experiments, respectively. the adhesion of e. coli and lb. gasseri k 7 cells to jejunal mucosa was similar (1.0+/-0.17 x 10(6) and 1.54+/-0.10 x 10(6) cfu/cm(2)) when the concentrations of single strains in suspensions were approximately the same. no significant competition, exclusion or displacement of e. coli by lactobacilli was observed on jejunal tissue. in conclusion, lb. gasseri k 7 was found to be effective in reducing e. coli adhesion to caco-2 enterocytes, but it was not able to do so in ex vivo conditions tested for pig jejunal tissue.

AB  == beta-glucuronidase activity (encoded by the gus gene) has been characterized for  the first time from ruminococcus gnavus e1, an anaerobic bacterium belonging to the dominant human gut microbiota. beta-glucuronidase activity plays a major role in the generation of toxic and carcinogenic metabolites in the large intestine, as well as in the absorption and enterohepatic circulation of many aglycone residues with protective effects, such as lignans, flavonoids, ceramide and glycyrrhetinic acid, that are liberated by the hydrolysis of the corresponding glucuronides. the complete nucleotide sequence of a 4537 bp dna fragment containing the beta-glucuronidase locus from r. gnavus e1 was determined. five orfs were detected on this fragment: three complete orfs (orf2, gus and orf3) and two partial orfs (orf4 and orf5). the products of orf2 and orf3 show strong similarities with many beta-glucoside permeases of the phosphoenolpyruvate : beta-glucoside phosphotransferase systems (ptss), such as escherichia coli bglc,  bacillus subtilis bglp and bacillus halodurans pts enzyme ii. the product of orf5 presents strong similarities with the amino-terminal domain of clostridium acetobutylicum beta-glucosidase (bgla). the gus gene product presents similarities with several known beta-glucuronidase enzymes, including those of lactobacillus gasseri (69%), e. coli (61%), clostridium perfringens (59%) and staphylococcus aureus (58%). by complementing an e. coli strain in which the uida gene encoding the enzyme was deleted, it was confirmed that the r. gnavus gus gene encodes the beta-glucuronidase enzyme. moreover, it was found that the gus gene was transcribed as part of an operon that includes orf2, orf3 and orf5.

TI  == expression of a heterologous manganese superoxide dismutase gene in intestinal lactobacilli provides protection against hydrogen peroxide toxicity.
AB  == in living organisms, exposure to oxygen provokes oxidative stress. a widespread mechanism for protection against oxidative stress is provided by the antioxidant  enzymes: superoxide dismutases (sods) and hydroperoxidases. generally, these enzymes are not present in lactobacillus spp. in this study, we examined the potential advantages of providing a heterologous sod to some of the intestinal lactobacilli. thus, the gene encoding the manganese-containing sod (soda) was cloned from streptococcus thermophilus ao54 and expressed in four intestinal lactobacilli. a 1.2-kb pcr product containing the soda gene was cloned into the shuttle vector ptrk563, to yield psoda, which was functionally expressed and complemented an escherichia coli strain deficient in mn and fesods. the plasmid,  psoda, was subsequently introduced and expressed in lactobacillus gasseri nck334, lactobacillus johnsonii nck89, lactobacillus acidophilus nck56, and lactobacillus reuteri nck932. molecular and biochemical analyses confirmed the presence of the  gene (soda) and the expression of an active gene product (mnsod) in these strains of lactobacilli. the specific activities of mnsod were 6.7, 3.8, 5.8, and 60.7 u/mg of protein for l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. reuteri, respectively. the expression of s. thermophilus mnsod in l. gasseri and l. acidophilus provided protection against hydrogen peroxide stress. the data show that mnsod protects cells against hydrogen peroxide by removing o(2)(.-) and preventing the redox cycling of iron. to our best knowledge, this is the first report of a soda from s. thermophilus being expressed in other lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == the effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus on enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli infection of human intestinal cells in vitro.
AB  == there are many examples of probiotic effects of various lactic bacteria on enteropathogens. in this study, lactobacillus strains (l. rhamnosus, l. gasseri,  l. casei and l. plantarum) were tested in an in vitro model of enterohemorrhagic  escherichia coli (ehec) infection of a human colon epithelial cell line, c2bbe1.  while the adhesion and colonization of ehec was not affected by any of the lactobacillus strains tested, the internalization of ehec into the cell line was  markedly suppressed by l. rhamnosus, though not by others. concerning the possible mechanisms, the viabilities of ehec and host cell were not affected by the presence of l. rhamnosus. simple competitions at certain receptors were unlikely because the suppressive effect on ehec internalization was strictly dependent on viable l. rhamnosus and could not be observed with the conditioned medium or killed l. rhamnosus. the fact that l. rhamnosus showed outstanding potential for adhering to the colon epithelial cell line, compared with other strains, suggested that an avid interaction between l. rhamnosus and the host cell might be modulating intra-cellular events responsible for the internalization of ehec.

AB  == aims: the study of two human strains of lactobacillus to be used as probiotics in the gastrointestinal tract. methods and results: the lactobacillus acidophilus uo 001 and lact. gasseri uo 002, were resistant to the gastrointestinal conditions (ph 2 and 3, presence of pepsin, pancreatin or bile salts), the resistance was enhanced in the presence of skimmed milk. additionally, adhered to caco-2 cells through glycoproteins in lact. gasseri and carbohydrates in the case of lact. acidophilus. these strains are able to inhibit the growth of certain enteropathogens: salmonella, listeria and campylobacter without interfering with  the normal microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract, as stated by using the mixed culture and the spot agar test. finally, strongly adherent lact. gasseri were found to inhibit the attachment of escherichia coli o111 to intestinal caco-2 cells under the condition of exclusion. conclusions: these results indicate that  the two strains of lactobacillus from human origin present important properties for survival in, and colonization of, the gastrointestinal tract, that give them  potential probiotic. significance and impact of the study: two strains of lactobacillus isolated from human vagina of healthy premenopausal women could be  promising candidates to be used in the preparation of probiotic products and for  their use as health-promoting bacteria.

TI  == isolation and characterization of human colonic bacteria able to hydrolyse chlorogenic acid.
AB  == aims: conjugated hydroxycinnamates, such as chlorogenic acid (caffeoyl-quinic acid), are widely consumed in a western diet, coffee being one of the richest sources. ingested hydroxycinnamate esters can reach the large intestine essentially unaltered, and may then be hydrolysed by esterases produced by the indigenous microflora. this study is aimed at identifying bacterial species responsible for the release of natural antioxidants, such as hydroxycinnamic acids, in the human large intestine. methods and results: thirty-five isolates recovered after anaerobic batch culture incubation of human faecal bacteria in a  chlorogenic acid-based medium were screened for cinnamoyl esterase activity. six  isolates released the hydroxycinnamate, ferulic acid, from its ethyl ester in a plate-screening assay, and these were identified through genotypic characterization (16s rrna sequencing) as escherichia coli (three isolates), bifidobacterium lactis and lactobacillus gasseri (two strains). chlorogenic acid  hydrolysing activities were essentially intracellular. these cinnamoyl esterase-producing organisms were devoid of other phenolic-degrading activities.  conclusion: the results show that certain gut bacteria, including some already recognized as potentially health-promoting (i.e. species belonging to the genera  bifidobacterium and lactobacillus), are involved in the release of bioactive hydroxycinnamic acids in the human colon. significance and impact of the study: free hydroxycinnamates, including caffeic, ferulic and p-coumaric acids, exhibit  antioxidant and anticarcinogenic properties both in vitro and in animal models. given that the gut flora has a major role in human nutrition and health, some of  the beneficial effects of phenolic acids may be ascribed to the microflora involved in metabolism.

TI  == lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  == samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. yeasts (20.1%), streptococcus spp. (8.7%), staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. the lactobacillus isolates were l. brevis (24.6%) l. fermentum (18.5%) l. casei (16.9%), l. delbrueckii (15.4%), l. plantarum (9.23%), l. acidophilus (7.69%), l. jensenii (4.62%), l. salivarius (1.54%) and l. gasseri (1.54%). the most common species was l. brevis (24.6%). the strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. all the lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella dysenteriae, s. sonnei, klebsiella spp. and campylobacter sp. all the lactobacilli except l. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. the involvement of lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. the ability of lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.

TI  == identification and cloning of gusa, encoding a new beta-glucuronidase from lactobacillus gasseri adh.
AB  == the gusa gene, encoding a new beta-glucuronidase enzyme, has been cloned from lactobacillus gasseri adh. this is the first report of a beta-glucuronidase gene  cloned from a bacterial source other than escherichia coli. a plasmid library of  l. gasseri chromosomal dna was screened for complementation of an e. coli gus mutant. two overlapping clones that restored beta-glucuronidase activity in the mutant strain were sequenced and revealed three complete and two partial open reading frames. the largest open reading frame, spanning 1,797 bp, encodes a 597-amino-acid protein that shows 39% identity to beta-glucuronidase (gusa) of e. coli k-12 (ec 3.2.1.31). the other two complete open reading frames, which are arranged to be separately transcribed, encode a putative bile salt hydrolase and  a putative protein of unknown function with similarities to merr-type regulatory  proteins. overexpression of gusa was achieved in a beta-glucuronidase-negative l. gasseri strain by expressing the gusa gene, subcloned onto a low-copy-number shuttle vector, from the strong lactobacillus p6 promoter. gusa was also expressed in e. coli from a pet expression system. preliminary characterization of the gusa protein from crude cell extracts revealed that the enzyme was active  across an acidic ph range and a broad temperature range. an analysis of other lactobacilli identified beta-glucuronidase activity and gusa homologs in other l. gasseri isolates but not in other lactobacillus species tested.

TI  == aggregation of sow lactobacilli with diarrhoeagenic escherichia coli.
AB  == a total of 20 strains of lactobacilli were isolated from the oesophagus and vagina of 20 sows at the time of partus. aggregation activity was seen between six homofermentative autoaggregative lactobacilli and three strains of pathogenic escherichia coli with f4, f5 and f6 fimbriae. the highest aggregation activity was observed between vaginal lactobacillus acidophilus pv 32 or oesophageal oe 2/1 and e. coli with f4 (k88). the presence of aggregation-promoting factor (apf) was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with primers of a specific fragment the apf gene derived from human l. gasseri 4b2 in one oesophageal l. acidophilus strain oe 2/1. we propose that autoaggregative lactobacilli that aggregate with diarrhoeagenic e. coli can express a class of apf proteins that exhibit the function of an aggregation mediator.

TI  == antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
AB  == forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.

TI  == adherence of human vaginal lactobacilli to vaginal epithelial cells and interaction with uropathogens.
AB  == three strains of lactobacillus, identified as lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus jensenii, were selected from among 70 isolates from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women for properties relevant  to mucosal colonization or antagonism. all three self-aggregated and adhered to epithelial vaginal cells, displacing well-known vaginal pathogens, such as g. vaginalis, and inhibiting the growth in vitro of escherichia coli and streptococcus agalactiae. the surface components involved in self-aggregation appeared to be proteins for l. gasseri and lipoproteins for l. acidophilus and l. jensenii, as judged by susceptibility to treatment with appropriate degrading enzymes. the factors responsible for adherence to epithelial vaginal cells seemed to be glycoproteins (l. acidophilus and l. gasseri) and carbohydrate (l. jensenii). the receptors of the vaginal cells were glycolipids, which presumably  were the targets of the competition observed between the lactobacilli and the pathogenic microbes.

TI  == high level heterologous protein production in lactococcus and lactobacillus using a new secretion system based on the lactobacillus brevis s-layer signals.
AB  == a secretion cassette, based on the expression and secretion signals of a s-layer  protein (slpa) from lactobacillus brevis, was constructed. e. coli beta-lactamase (bla) was used as the reporter protein to determine the functionality of the s-layer signals for heterologous expression and secretion in lactococcus lactis,  lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus casei using a low-copy-number plasmid derived from pgk12. in all hosts tested, the bla gene was expressed under the slpa signals and all bla activity was secreted to the culture medium. the lb. brevis s-layer promoters were very efficiently recognized in l. lactis, lb. brevis and lb. plantarum, whereas in lb. gasseri the slpa promoter region appeared to be recognized at a lower level and in lb. casei the level of transcripts was below the detection limit. the production of bla was mainly restricted to the exponential phase of growth. the highest yield of bla was obtained with l. lactis and lb. brevis. without ph control, substantial degradation of bla occurred during prolonged cultivations with all lactic acid bacteria (lab) tested. when growing l. lactis and lb. brevis under ph control, the bla activity could be stabilized also at the stationary phase. l. lactis produced up to 80 mg/l of bla which to our knowledge  represents the highest amount of a heterologous protein secreted by lab so far. the short production phase implied a very high rate of secretion with a calculated value of 5 x 10(5) bla molecules/cell per h. such a high rate was also observed with lb. plantarum, whereas in lb. brevis the competition between the wild type slpa gene and the secretion construct probably lowered the rate of bla  production. the results obtained indicate wide applicability of the lb. brevis slpa signals for efficient protein production and secretion in lab.

TI  == cloning, sequence analysis, and expression of the genes encoding lytic functions  of bacteriophage phi g1e.
AB  == the lysis genes of a lactobacillus phage phi g1e were cloned, sequenced, and expressed in escherichia coli. nucleotide sequencing of a 3813-bp phi g1e dna revealed five successive open reading frames (orf), rorf50, rorf118, hol, and lys and rorf175, in the same dna strand. by comparative analysis of the dna sequence, the putative hol product (holin) has an estimated molecular weight is 14.2 kda, and contains two potential transmembrane helices and highly charged n- and c-termini, resembling predicted holins (which are thought to be a cytoplasmic membrane-disrupting protein) encoded by other phages such as mv1 from lactobacillus bulgaricus, phi adh from lactobacillus gasseri, as well as monocins from listeria. on the other hand, the putative phi g1e lys product (lysin) of 48.4 kda shows significant similarity with presumed muramidase, known as a cell wall peptidoglycandegrading enzyme, encoded by the lactobacillus phage mv1 and phi adh, the lactococcus lactis phage phi lc3, and the streptococcus pneumoniae phages cp-1, cp-7 and cp-9. when expressed in e. coli, the phi g1e lysin and/or holin decreased the cell turbidity significantly, suggesting that the phi g1e hol-lys system is involved in cytolytic process.

TI  == positive selection, cloning vectors for gram-positive bacteria based on a restriction endonuclease cassette.
AB  == lactococcus lactis contains numerous restriction and modification (r/m) systems of different specificities. a novel iis type r/m system encoded by the llai operon has previously been characterized from the l. lactis conjugative plasmid ptr2030. the llai operon is composed of six genes: first, a small regulatory gene llaic precedes the methylase gene llaim. the following three genes, llai.1, llai.2, llai.3, are all essential for restriction endonuclease activity and are designed as the restriction cassette llair. the forth open reading frame of unknown function follows the llair gene cassette. we have successfully subcloned  the three llair genes, llai.1, llai.2, and llai.3, without llaim, as a suicide cassette into the three shuttle vectors ptrkl2, ptrkh2, and pbv5030. a promoter (p6) from lactobacillus acidophilus atcc4356, which is functional in e. coli, lactococci, and lactobacilli (djordjevic and topisirovic, unpublished) was cloned upstream of the three gene cassette. restriction activity was evaluated in escherichia coli and several gram-positive bacteria. the llair restriction cassette was not functional in e. coli, but its presence was lethal to l. lactis, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus acidophilus, carnobacterium pisicola, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, and leuconostoc gelidum. several novel, positive selection cloning vectors were developed that can exploit unique cloning sites within the llair cassette. insertions in llai.1 resulted in complete inactivation of restriction activity and provided unconditional selection for recombinant plasmids in surviving transformants. these positive selection cloning vectors are the first for gram-positive bacteria that are based on a restriction endonuclease cassette. functional activity of the llair genes in various gram-positive bacteria would also enable use of these cloning vectors for positive selection of promoters, terminators, and regulatory sequences across these genera.

TI  == primary structure and functional analysis of the lysis genes of lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage phi adh.
AB  == the lysis genes of the lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage phi adh were isolated  by complementation of a lambda sam mutation in escherichia coli. nucleotide sequencing of a 1,735-bp dna fragment revealed two adjacent coding regions of 342 bp (hol) and 951 bp (lys) in the same reading frame which appear to belong to a common transcriptional unit. proteins corresponding to the predicted gene products, holin (12.9 kda) and lysin (34.7 kda), were identified by in vitro and  in vivo expression of the cloned genes. the phi adh holin is a membrane-bound protein with structural similarity to lysis proteins of other phage, known to be  required for the transit of murein hydrolases through the cytoplasmic membrane. the phi adh lysin shows homology with mureinolytic enzymes encoded by the lactobacillus bulgaricus phage mv4, the streptococcus pneumoniae phage cp-1, cp-7, and cp-9, and the lactococcus lactis phage phi lc3. significant homology with the n termini of known muramidases suggests that phi adh lysin acts by a similar catalytic mechanism. in e. coli, the phi adh lysin seems to be associated with the total membrane fraction, from which it can be extracted with lauryl sarcosinate. either one of the phi adh lysis proteins provoked lysis of e. coli when expressed along with holins or lysins of phage lambda or bacillus subtilis phage phi 29. concomitant expression of the combined holin and lysin functions of phi adh in e. coli, however, did not result in efficient cell lysis.

TI  == isolation of a novel is3 group insertion element and construction of an integration vector for lactobacillus spp.
AB  == an insertion sequence (is) element from lactobacillus johnsonii was isolated, characterized, and exploited to construct an is-based integration vector. l. johnsonii nck61, a high-frequency conjugal donor of bacteriocin production (laf+) and immunity (lafr), was transformed to erythromycin resistance (emr) with the shuttle vector psa3. the nck61 conjugative functions were used to mobilize psa3 into a laf- lafs ems recipient. dna from the emr transconjugants transformed into escherichia coli mc1061 yielded a resolution plasmid with the same size as that of psa3 with a 1.5-kb insertion. the gram-positive replication region of the resolution plasmid was removed to generate a psa3-based suicide vector (ptrk327)  bearing the 1.5-kb insert of lactobacillus origin. plasmid ptrk327 inserted randomly into the chromosomes of both lactobacillus gasseri atcc 33323 and vpi 11759. no homology was detected between plasmid and total host dnas, suggesting a rec-independent insertion. the dna sequence of the 1.5-kb region revealed the characteristics of an is element (designated is1223): a length of 1,492 bp; flanking, 25-bp, imperfect inverted repeats; and two overlapping open reading frames (orfs). sequence comparisons revealed 71.1% similarity, including 35.7% identity, between the deduced orfb protein of the e. coli is element is150 and the putative orfb protein encoded by the lactobacillus is element. a putative frameshift site was detected between the overlapping orfs of the lactobacillus is element. it is proposed that, similar to is150, is1223 produces an active transposase via translational frameshifting between two tandem, overlapping orfs.

AB  == bile acids were analyzed in the bile, small and large intestines, and feces of germ-free rats after a single inoculation with one of six intestinal bacteria that had been originally isolated from human feces. bacteroides vulgatus and bifidobacterium longum preferentially deconjugated tauro-beta-muricholic acid and taurocholic acid, respectively. clostridium ramosum, peptostreptococcus productus and lactobacillus gasseri deconjugated both bile acids, but escherichia coli did  not deconjugate either one. rats inoculated with bacteria that deconjugated tauro-beta-muricholic acid produced delta 22-beta-muricholic acid in the feces. in contrast, delta 22-cholic acid could not be detected in rats inoculated with bacteria that deconjugated taurocholic acid.

TI  == cloning and expression of the manganese superoxide dismutase gene of escherichia  coli in lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus gasseri.
AB  == the escherichia coli soda gene encoding the antioxidant enzyme mn-containing superoxide dismutase (mnsod), was cloned in the expression vector pmg36e. this vector has a multiple cloning site downstream of a promoter and shine-dalgarno sequences derived from lactococcus. the protein-coding region of soda from e. coli was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, using a thermocycler and taq dna polymerase before cloning into pmg36e. when introduced into e. coli, the recombinant plasmid expressed the predicted fusion protein, both in the presence  and absence of oxygen. the expression of the fusion protein in e. coli was verified by sod assays, activity gels and western blots. the recombinant plasmid  was also introduced into lactococcus lactis, which contains a resident sod, and into lactobacillus gasseri, which is devoid of sod. transformed lactococci expressed an active soda fusion protein plus an active hybrid protein composed of subunits of the lactococcus and the recombinant e. coli enzymes. transformants of l. gasseri expressed only the fusion soda protein, which was enzymatically active.
