TI  == dynamics of mdr enterobacter cloacae outbreaks in a neonatal unit in nepal: insights using wider sampling frames and next-generation sequencing.
AB  == objectives: there are limited data on enterobacter cloacae outbreaks and fewer describing these in association with ndm-1. with whole-genome sequencing, we tested the hypothesis that a cluster of 16 e. cloacae bacteraemia cases in a nepali neonatal unit represented a single clonal outbreak, using a wider set of epidemiologically unrelated clinical e. cloacae isolates for comparison. methods: forty-three isolates were analysed, including 23 e. cloacae and 3 citrobacter sp. isolates obtained from blood cultures from 16 neonates over a 3 month period. these were compared with two contemporaneous community-associated drug-resistant  isolates from adults, a unit soap dispenser isolate and a set of historical invasive isolates (n=14) from the same geographical locality. results: there were two clear neonatal outbreaks and one isolated case in the unit. one outbreak was  associated with an ndm-1 plasmid also identified in a historical community-associated strain. the smaller, second outbreak was likely associated with a contaminated soap dispenser. the two community-acquired adult cases and three sets of historical hospital-associated neonatal isolates represented four additional genetic clusters. conclusions: e. cloacae infections in this context represent several different transmission networks, operating at the community/hospital and host strain/plasmid levels. wide sampling frames and high-resolution typing methods are needed to describe the complex molecular epidemiology of e. cloacae outbreaks, which is not appropriately reflected by routine susceptibility phenotypes. soap dispensers may represent a reservoir for  e. cloacae and bacterial strains and plasmids may persist in hospitals and in the community for long periods, sporadically being involved in outbreaks of disease.

TI  == characterization of beta-lactamases in faecal enterobacteriaceae recovered from healthy humans in spain: focusing on ampc polymorphisms.
AB  == the intestinal tract is a huge reservoir of enterobacteriaceae, some of which are opportunist pathogens. several genera of these bacteria harbour intrinsic antibiotic resistance genes, such as ampc genes in species of citrobacter, enterobacter or escherichia genera. in this work, beta-lactamases and other resistance mechanisms have been characterized in enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from healthy human faecal samples, focusing on the ampc beta-lactamase  genes. fifty human faecal samples were obtained, and 70 enterobacteriaceae bacteria were isolated: 44 escherichia coli, 4 citrobacter braakii, 9 citrobacter freundii, 8 enterobacter cloacae, 1 proteus mirabilis, 1 proteus vulgaris, 1 klebsiella oxytoca, 1 serratia sp. and 1 cronobacter sp. a high percentage of resistance to ampicillin was detected (57 %), observing the ampc phenotype in 22  isolates (31 %) and the esbl phenotype in 3 isolates. ampc molecular characterization showed high diversity into bla cmy and bla act genes from citrobacter and enterobacter species, respectively, and the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) analysis demonstrated low clonality among them. the prevalence of people colonized by strains carrying plasmid-mediated ampc genes obtained in this study was 2 %. the unique plasmid-mediated bla ampc identified in this study was the bla cmy-2 gene, detected in an e. coli isolate ascribed to  the sequence type st405 which belonged to phylogenetic group d. the hybridization and conjugation experiments demonstrated that the isecp1-bla cmy-2-blc structure  was carried by a ~78-kb self-transferable inck plasmid. this study shows a high polymorphism among beta-lactamase genes in enterobacteriaceae from healthy people microbiota. extensive ampc-carrier studies would provide important information and could allow the anticipation of future global health problems.

TI  == resistance and inactivation kinetics of bacterial strains isolated from the non-chlorinated and chlorinated effluents of a wwtp.
AB  == the microbiological quality of water from a wastewater treatment plant that uses  sodium hypochlorite as a disinfectant was assessed. mesophilic aerobic bacteria were not removed efficiently. this fact allowed for the isolation of several bacterial strains from the effluents. molecular identification indicated that the strains were related to aeromonas hydrophila, escherichia coli (three strains), enterobacter cloacae, kluyvera cryocrescens (three strains), kluyvera intermedia, citrobacter freundii (two strains), bacillus sp. and enterobacter sp. the first five strains, which were isolated from the non-chlorinated effluent, were used to test resistance to chlorine disinfection using three sets of variables: disinfectant concentration (8, 20 and 30 mg.l(-1)), contact time (0, 15 and 30 min) and water temperature (20, 25 and 30 degrees c). the results demonstrated that the strains have independent responses to experimental conditions and that the most efficient treatment was an 8 mg.l(-1) dose of disinfectant at a temperature of 20 degrees c for 30 min. the other eight strains, which were isolated from the chlorinated effluent, were used to analyze inactivation kinetics using the disinfectant at a dose of 15 mg.l(-1) with various retention times (0, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 min). the results indicated that during the inactivation process, there was no relationship between removal percentage and retention time and that the strains have no common response to the treatments.

TI  == rectal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli in community settings in madagascar.
AB  == background: extended-spectrum ss-lactamase-producing enterobacteria (esbl-pe) emerged at the end of the 1980s, causing nosocomial outbreaks and/or hyperendemic situations in hospitals and long-term care facilities. in recent years, community-acquired infections due to esbl-pe have spread worldwide, especially across developing countries including madagascar. objectives: this study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of intestinal carriage of esbl-pe in the community of antananarivo. methods: non-hospitalized patients were recruited  in three health centers in different socio economic settings. fresh stool collected were immediately plated on drigalski agar containing 3 mg/liter of ceftriaxone. gram-negative bacilli species were identified and esbl production was tested by a double disk diffusion (cefotaxime and ceftazidime +/- clavulanate) assay. characterization of esbls were perfomed by pcr and direct sequencing. molecular epidemiology was analysed by rep-pcr and eric-pcr. results: 484 patients were screened (sex ratio = 1.03, median age 28 years). 53 esbl-pe were isolated from 49 patients (carrier rate 10.1%). the isolates included escherichia coli (31), klebsiella pneumoniae (14), enterobacter cloacae (3), citrobacter freundii (3), kluyvera spp. (1) and pantoae sp. (1). in multivariate  analysis, only the socioeconomic status of the head of household was independently associated with esbl-pe carriage, poverty being the predominant risk factor. conclusions: the prevalence of carriage of esbl in the community of  antananarivo is one of the highest reported worldwide. this alarming spread of resistance genes should be stopped urgently by improving hygiene and streamlining the distribution and consumption of antibiotics.

TI  == the influence of environmental bacteria in freshwater stingray wound-healing.
AB  == invasion by bacteria can influence the course of healing of wounds acquired in aquatic environment. in this study, the bacteria present in potamotrygon motoro stingray mucus and in the alto parana river water were identified, and their ability to induce tissue injury and resist antibiotics was determined. biochemical identification analysis showed that 97% of all bacterial isolates were gram negative, aeromonas spp., enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii being the species most prevalent. gelatinase and caseinase were produced by aeromonas hydrophila, aeromonas sobria and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. erythrocyte hemolysis assay showed that a. sobria, a. hydrophila and to a lesser  extent, other gram-negative bacteria produced hemolysin. it was also observed that molecules released in culture by these bacteria were toxic to human epithelial cells. antibiogram results showed that 68% of all bacterial isolates were resistant to at least one type of antibiotic, mainly b-lactams. finally, it  was demonstrated that although p. motoro venom was toxic to epithelial cells it did not influence bacterial proliferation. in summary, the results obtained in this work indicate that during the accident, the mucus of p. motoro and the environmental water may transfer into the wound pathogenic multi-resistant bacteria with the potential to cause severe secondary infections.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria community sfc-2 used for fermentation of air-dried crop straws].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria community sfc-2 in fermented crop straw. methods: total 13 isolates were obtained from spontaneous fermented rice straw by plating, paper diffusion and denaturing  gradient gel electrophoresis. all these strains were used to determine the antibacterial activity of sfc-2. results: (1) phylogenetic analysis of the 13 strains based on 16s rdna gene sequence data indicated that 9 strains belong to enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, bacillus cereus, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacterfreundii, klebsiella terrigena and citrobacter sp., which were all common pathogens or opportunistic pathogens. (2) indicating bacteria selected from the pathogens were used to detect antibacterial activity of sfc-2 cell-free  culture supernatant. the results showed that: sfc-2 community had stronger antibacterial activity than isolated strains from sfc-2 community or man-made communities against indicating bacteria. (3) antibacterial activities of seven different cell-free culture supernatants, which were extracted at intervals from  the culture of sfc-2 community during 14-48 hours, were no obvious difference, but the content of organic acids were obvious differences during 14-48 hours; the antibacterial substances were stable after heating and sensitive partly to protease k.

TI  == carbohydrate and ethane release with erwinia carotovora subspecies betavasculorum--induced necrosis.
AB  == erwinia carotovora subspecies betavasculorum, also known as e. betavasculorum and pectobacterium betavasculorum, is a soil bacterium that has the capacity to cause root rot necrosis of sugarbeets. the qualitatively different pathogenicity exhibited by the virulent e. carotovora strain and two avirulent strains, a citrobacter sp. and an enterobacter cloacae, was examined using digital analysis  of photographic evidence of necrosis as well as for carbohydrate, ethane, and ethylene release compared with uninoculated potato tuber slices. visual scoring of necrosis was superior to digital analysis of photographs. the release of carbohydrates and ethane from potato tuber slices inoculated with the soft rot necrosis-causing erwinia was significantly greater than that of potato tuber slices that had not been inoculated or that had been inoculated with the nonpathogenic e. cloacae and citrobacter sp. strains. interestingly, ethylene production from potato slices left uninoculated or inoculated with the nonpathogenic citrobacter strain was 5- to 10-fold higher than with potato slices inoculated with the pathogenic erwinia strain. these findings suggest that (1) carbohydrate release might be a useful measure of the degree of pathogenesis, or  relative virulence; and that (2) bacterial suppression of ethylene formation may  be a critical step in root rot disease formation.

TI  == predictors of in-hospital mortality for bloodstream infections caused by enterobacter species or citrobacter freundii.
AB  == study objective: to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality among patients with bacteremia caused by enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, or citrobacter freundii. design: retrospective cohort study. setting: 1300-bed tertiary academic medical center. patients: one hundred twenty-four patients who  had bloodstream infections caused by e. cloacae (3), e. aerogenes (71), or c. freundii (50) between 1998 and 2004. measurements and main results: data from patients with bloodstream infections caused by enterobacter sp or c. freundii were retrospectively segregated according to hospital survival (98 survivors, 26  nonsurvivors). multiple patient characteristics and processes of care were evaluated to identify factors contributing to in-hospital mortality. multiple logistic regression was performed based on univariate comparisons to determine independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality. among the 124 cases of bacteremia, the crude in-hospital mortality rate was 21% (26 cases). univariate analysis revealed that survivors were more likely to receive an aminoglycoside as part of their empiric antimicrobial regimen (40% [39/98]) compared with nonsurvivors (19% [5/26], p=0.05). other factors related to antimicrobial therapy including choice and number of agents used did not differ between survivors and nonsurvivors (p>0.05). vasopressor use (31% [30/98] vs 62% [16/26]), care in an intensive care unit (19% [19/98] vs 54% [14/26]), and acute renal failure (13% [13/98] vs 31% [8/26]) occurred more frequently in nonsurvivors (p<0.05). multiple logistic regression identified resistance to second- or third-generation cephalosporins (adjusted odds ratio [or] 5.16, 95% confidence interval [ci] 2.66-10.0, p=0.013), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance (adjusted or 5.44,  95% ci 2.53-11.7, p=0.027), and mechanical ventilation (adjusted or 12.2, 95% ci  5.99-24.5, p<0.001) as independent determinants of mortality. conclusion: among patients with enterobacter sp or c. freundii bloodstream infections, those with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-resistant or second or third-generation cephalosporin-resistant strains or those who required mechanical ventilation had  an increased risk of mortality.

TI  == confirmation of e. coli among other thermotolerant coliform bacteria in paper mill effluents, wood chips screening rejects and paper sludges.
AB  == paper sludges are solid wastes material generated from the paper production, which have been characterized for their chemical contents. some are rich in wood  fiber and are a good carbon source, for example the primary and de-inking paper sludges. others are made rich in nitrogen and phosphorus by pressing the activated sludge, resulting from the biological water treatments, with the primary sludge, yielding the combined paper sludge. still, in the absence of sanitary effluents very few studies have addressed the characterization of their  coliform microflora. therefore, this study investigated the thermotolerant coliform population of one paper mill effluent and two paper mill sludges and wood chips screening rejects using chromogenic media. for the first series of analyses, the medium used was colilert broth and positive tubes were selected to  isolate bacteria in pure culture on macconkey agar. in a second series of analyses, double selective media, based on ss-galactosidase and ss-glucuronidase  activities, were used to isolate bacteria. first, the presence of thermotolerant  coliforms was detected in low numbers in most water effluents, but showed that the entrance of the thermotolerant coliforms was early in the industrial process. also, large numbers of thermotolerant coliforms, i.e., 7,000,000 mpn/g sludge (dry weight; d.w.), were found in combined sludges. from this first series of isolations, bacteria were purified on macconkey medium and identified as citrobacter freundii, enterobacter sp, e. sakazakii, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, k. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis, k. pneumoniae subsp.  ozaenae, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, pantoea sp, raoultella terrigena, r. planticola. second, the presence of thermotolerant coliforms was measured at more than 3,700-6,000 mpn/g (d.w) sludge, whereas e. coli was detected from 730 to more than 3,300 mpn/g (d.w.) sludge. the presence of thermotolerant coliform bacteria and e. coli was sometimes detected from wood chips screening rejects in  large quantities. also, indigenous e. coli were able to multiply into the combined sludge, and inoculated e. coli isolates were often able to multiply in wood chips and combined sludge media. in this second series of isolations, api20e and biolog identified most isolates as e. coli, but others remained unidentified. the sequences of the 16s rdna confirmed that most isolates were likely e. coli, few burkholderia spp, but 10% of the isolates remained unidentified. this study points out that the coliform bacteria are introduced by the wood chips in the water effluents, where they can survive throught the primary clarifier and regrow in combined sludges.

TI  == mechanical transmission of pathogenic organisms: the role of cockroaches.
AB  == background & objectives: cockroaches (diploptera punctata) are basically tropical insects and will do their best to find a home that is both warm and moist. their  involvement in the transmission of tropical diseases is poorly investigated in africa. methods: a study on the bacterial, fungal and parasitic profile of cockroaches trapped in and around houses in ekpoma was carried out using standard microbiological techniques. results: of a total of 234 cockroaches trapped from different sites (toilets, parlours, kitchens and bedrooms) in houses with pit latrines and water system, the bacterial, fungal and parasitic isolates were identical irrespective of the site, these included: e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella sp, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serretia marcescens, s. aureus, s. feacalis, s. epidermidis, aeromonas sp, candida sp, rhizopus sp, aspergillus sp, mucor sp, cysts of e. hystolitica, oocysts of c. parvum, c. cayetenensis and isospora belli, cysts of balantidium coli, ova of ascaris lumbricoides, anchylostoma deodunalae, enterobius vermicularis, ova trichuris trichura, larva of strongyloides stercoralis. cockroaches trapped in the toilets  of houses with pit latrines had a mean bacterial and parasites count of 12.3 x 10(10) org/ml and 98 parasites/ml respectively, while those trapped in the houses with water system had a mean bacterial and parasitic count of 89.5 x 10(7) org/ml and 31 parasites/ml respectively. a bacterial count of 78.9 x 10(7) org/ml was recorded from cockroaches trapped from the kitchens of houses with pit latrines.  on the other hand a mean bacterial and parasitic count of 23.7 x 10(6) org/ml and 19 parasites/ml were recorded from kitchens of houses with water system. interpretation & conclusion: cockroaches represent an important reservoir for infectious pathogens, therefore, control of cockroaches will substantially minimise the spread of infectious diseases in our environment.

TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

TI  == enteric fever-like illness caused by infection with citrobacter amalonaticus.
AB  == 'enteric fever' is a potentially fatal, severe systemic disease, which is encountered worldwide. traditionally, enteric fever refers to a bacteremic illness caused by members of certain salmonella serotypes, notably: salmonella typhi, a gram-negative bacterium, and to a lesser extent, salmonella paratyphi a, b and c. in addition, other non-salmonella organisms may produce a syndrome clinically indistinguishable from "enteric fever". brucella sp., campylobacter sp., edwardsiella tarda, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, providencia alcalifaciens, pseudomonas sp., serratia marcescens, francisella sp. and yersinia pp have been identified in enteric fever this is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first case of citrobacter to be reported  presenting as enteric fever in a normal host in thailand.

TI  == but-1: a new member in the chromosomal inducible class c beta-lactamases family from a clinical isolate of buttiauxella sp.
AB  == an atypical enterobacteriaceae strain with a beta-lactam susceptibility pattern of inducible cephalosporinase was isolated in tenon hospital (paris, france) from a patient's skull wound infection. identifications by the api-50che biochemical system and 16s rrna gene sequencing concluded that it was a member of the buttiauxella genus. the bla gene was cloned and sequenced. the deduced translated product was a 383-amino acid protein (but-1) with 75-78% identity with the chromosomal ampc beta-lactamases of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and escherichia coli. the isoelectric point of 9.0 and the kinetic constants of but-1 were comparable with results described for other ambler class c enzymes. bla(but-1) and the associated ampr transcriptional regulator gene were divergently transcribed from a common intercistronic region,  a genetic organization already described for other inducible class c beta-lactamases. the deduced amino acid sequence of ampr shared 85% and 81% identity with ampr from e. cloacae and c. freundii respectively.

TI  == potential microbiological hazards in the production of refined paper products for food applications.
AB  == this study sought to investigate the significance of raw materials (starch-based  glues, raw material papers) at different microbiologically critical stages in the manufacturing process of refined paper products. the study examined the occurrence of microorganisms in the process and in end-product samples. microbiological surveys verified that the production and use of pasteurized starch-based glue was the most important factor threatening the process hygiene and product safety. subsequently, the production and use of starch-based glue was changed, and a follow-up programme targeting the microbiological quality of glue  was developed as part of a hygiene and safety management system. a total of 33 spore-forming bacterial and 15 enterobacterial isolates were ribotyped, and 22 and 10 different ribogroups (ribotypes), respectively, were generated. these isolates from starch-based glue, raw material paper and end products were atypical and, thus, in many cases physiological, chemotaxonomic (fame) and molecular (partial 16s rdna) results did not correspond. the most common spore-forming bacteria (55% of the isolates) were paenibacillus sp. and within this genus several new species were also proposed. the most common enterobacteria (87%) were enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii belonging to bacteria in hazard group 2, or species closely related to them. it was demonstrated that the  same spore-forming bacteria (ribotypes) were present in both the glue samples and the end products (45% of isolates). all riboprint patterns were saved at the vtt  identification library for future use.

TI  == characterization of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in rendered animal products.
AB  == antibiotics are used in food animal production to treat diseases and also to improve performance. antibiotics are not used on all farms, and antibiotic resistance is occasionally found on farms that do not use antibiotics. rendered animal protein products are often included in poultry feeds and could potentially serve as a source of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. one hundred sixty-five rendered animal protein products from cattle, poultry, and fish were aseptically  collected from poultry feed mills. fifty-five percent of the poultry meal samples had detectable levels of gram-negative bacteria ranging from 40 to 10,440 colony-forming units/g of sample. poultry meal and meat and bone meal had the greatest number of samples with bacteria resistant to five or more antibiotics. a high percentage of feed samples (85%) contained bacteria resistant to amoxicillin, ampicillin, clavulanic acid, or cephalothin, whereas few samples contained bacteria resistant to ciprofloxacin, kanamycin, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. acinetobacter calcoaceticus, citrobacter freundii, and enterobacter cloacae were the most commonly isolated antibiotic-resistant bacteria. isolation for salmonella was also performed, with 14% of the meat and bone meal samples containing salmonella sp. only one of the meat and bone meal isolates, salmonella livingstone, was resistant to five or more antibiotics. many of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria contained integrons, genetic elements that mediate multiple drug resistance.

TI  == cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of chromagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  == the algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on chromagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (ind), lysine decarboxylase (ldc), and ornithine decarboxylase (odc) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, ind positive (ind(+)), escherichia coli; metallic blue, ind(+), ldc(+), and odc negative (odc(-)), klebsiella oxytoca; ind(+), ldc(-), and odc(+), citrobacter diversus; ind(+) or ind(-), ldc(-), and odc(-), citrobacter freundii; ind(-), ldc(+), and odc(+), enterobacter aerogenes; ind(-), ldc(-), and odc(+), enterobacter cloacae; ind(-), ldc(+), and odc(-), klebsiella pneumoniae;  diffuse brown and ind(+), morganella morganii; ind(-), proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, serratia marcescens; bluish green and ind(+), proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. during an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. a total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on chromagar orientation medium. for 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. the cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. the results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. in addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == detection and distribution of insertion sequence 1 (is1)-containing bacteria in the freshwater environment(1).
AB  == the distribution of insertion sequence 1 (is1)-containing bacteria was investigated in windermere (cumbria, uk), a freshwater body impacted by treated sewage discharge and run-off from the surrounding catchment. culturable is1-containing bacteria were recovered from the water column at three depths in windermere north basin (wnb) and south basin (wsb), and from sediment at both sites (at the sediment surface in wsb and to a depth of 12-13 cm in wnb). polymerase chain reaction amplification of is1 and the escherichia coli/shigella  sp. specific gene uida, from community dna from shallow sediments, extended the detection limit beyond that of culture at both sites. this detection was extended further into deep sediment extracted from wnb as is1 and uida were detected in sub-samples to a depth of 4.7 and 2.3 m, respectively. analysis of a representative subset of 90 is1-carrying isolates recovered from water and sediment at both sites demonstrated 21 heterogeneous is1 profiles with estimated  copy numbers ranging from 1 to 16. identification of the host bacteria showed that the element was confined mainly to enterobacter spp. however, this study showed is1 to be present in citrobacter freundii for the first time. plasmids were carried by 75.3% of enterobacterial isolates and four plasmids (2.6%) carried is1. dna sequence analysis of five is1 clones demonstrated that is1 isoforms from this study were similar (>89% nucleotide identity) to known is1 isoforms. two isoforms of is1 from a single enterobacter cloacae isolate differed by 6.7% at the nucleotide level suggesting that they had been acquired independently.

TI  == cloning and expression in escherichia coli of an azoreductase gene from clostridium perfringens and comparison with azoreductase genes from other bacteria.
AB  == a genomic library of clostridium perfringens atcc 3626 was constructed in phage lambda gt11 and screened with an antibody against the c. perfringens azoreductase, which catalyzes the reduction of azo dyes to aromatic amines. a positive recombinant phage, containing a 3.8 kb dna fragment insert was selected  and purified. lytic and lysogenic escherichia coli cultures infected with the recombinant phage had higher azoreductase activity than cultures infected only with the vector lambda gt11. the 3.8 kb dna fragment was amplified by pcr and found to hybridize with one band from c. perfringens dna digested with ecor1, indicating the presence of a single copy of the azoreductase gene. the fragment also hybridized with dna from other azoreductase-producing clostridium species, a eubacterium sp., enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter amalonaticus and e. coli, but  not with dna from some other species of anaerobic bacteria capable of reducing azo dyes. the data indicate that the sequence of the azoreducatse gene of c. perfringens is conserved in some anaerobes and facultative anaerobes, but not in  others, and that different types of azoreductase genes must be found in other anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity to isolated bacteria in pediatric urinary tract infections].
AB  == of the childhood urinary tract infections, more than 50% are caused by escherichia coli (e coli), followed by proteus mirabilis (p mirabilis), klebsiella sp, other enterobacteria, enterococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci. of e coli isolates, 50 to 60% are resistant to ampicillin (ampi-r), 10% being susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (amc). for p mirabilis, ampi-r isolates are less frequent and more often susceptible to amc. klebsiella sp is resistant to ampicillin, 75% of isolates being susceptible to amc. in these three species, the susceptibility of isolates to third generation cephalosporins, aminogly-cosides, and ciprofloxacin is still high (> 90%), but 15 to 35% are resistant to cotrimoxazole. in the other enterobacteria (enterobacter  cloacae, morganella morganii, p vulgaris, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens) the resistance to cefalotin (hence to ampicillin and amc) is permanent, with an exception: the susceptibility of p vulgaris to amc. enterococci are mostly susceptible to ampicillin, and p aeruginosa to ceftazidime, but in both species, the percentage of resistant strains in hospitalised patients is greater than in outpatients. for staphylococcus aureus,  the community-acquired isolates are susceptible to oxacillin and other anti-staphylococcal agents. all the coagulase negative staphylococci isolates are susceptible to vancomycin, but 70% of those from hospitalised patients are resistant to oxacillin, aminoglycosides and cotrimoxazole.

AB  == background: in the last decade were in sr documented new problems in resistance to the newer antibiotics that with regard to their structure and antibacterial properties resisted to the known mechanism of bacterial resistance. the emergence of multiple drug resistance to the new betalactams is connected both with frequent application of these drugs in the hospitals and transfer of r plasmids.  methods and results: we studied composition and transferability of resistance to  newer betalactam antibiotics in strains of acinetobacter sp., enterobacter sp, and citrobacter sp. isolated during one month in patients from two teaching university hospitals. all strains studied were resistant to cefotaxime (ctx), ceftazidime (caz) and aztreonam (atm) but acinetobacter strains, although resistant also to caz and atm transferred the resistance to ctx only. thus, resistance to caz and atm has a chromosomal origin in these strains. a strain of  citrobacter sp., resistant to ctx, caz and atm, produced a esbl betalactamase detectable in a double-disk diffusion method (fig. 1). an enterobacter cloacae strain transfers directly the resistance to all new betalactams indicated. their  hydrolysis by these strains points to their production of new types of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases esbl). conclusions: we strongly recommend to be strictly rational in the use of new betalactams of ctx, cza or atm type because it is suspected that, especially in so-called empirical prophylaxis or treatment, they exert a strong selective pressure toward the prevalence of mutants with transferable esbl-producing nosocomial bacteria resistant to these drugs.

TI  == a comparative study of the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux api20e and api20ne identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  == the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter (crystal, becton dickinson microbiology systems) is a new multi-test identification system for gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. one hundred and three selected  gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate api20e or api20ne (biomerieux) reading after overnight incubation. the isolates included in the study, and the number tested,  were as follows: acinetobacter sp, 8; aeromonas hydrophila, 1; citrobacter diversus, 1; citrobacter freundii, 1; escherichia coli, 13; enterobacter aerogenes, 10; enterobacter agglomerans, 2; enterobacter cloacae, 6; klebsiella oxytoca, 6; klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; morganella morganii, 2; proteus mirabilis, 6; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; salmonella sp, 2; salmonella typhi, 1; serratia marcescens, 1; shigella sonnei, 2; shigella sp, 2; vibrio metschnikovii, 1; xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, yersinia enterocolitica, 2. the api20e and api20ne systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the api systems compared to 3 with the crystal. crystal is more convenient than api for routine clinical use because it  requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.

TI  == the danger of infections of the hospitalized patients with the microorganisms present in preparations and in the hospital environment.
AB  == two strains-s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, resistant to antibiotics, were isolated from previously non-opened preparations made by the hospital pharmacy and industrially produced. after application in the surgery ward, two enterobacter agglomerans strains, resistant to antibiotics were detected in oral mixtures. the resistant bacteria, b. cereus and 4 strains of ps. aeruginosa, were also found in the purified water. in hospital environment 9 strains of staphylococci, resistant to the tested antibiotics were found. only one of them was s. aureus (detected on the wall), the others being coagulase-negative staphylococci. most of them were isolated from the floor, but  also from the wall, table and from the air in surgical and ophthalmological wards and in the hospital pharmacy. the most dangerous were three gram-negative strains resistant to all tested antibiotics. they were isolated from the floor (enterobacter cloacae), from the wall (proteus mirabilis) and from the container  with oral mixture in infant ward (ps. malthophilia). many strains resistant to many antibiotics were detected on the floor of surgical, nephrological and infantile wards as well as from the pharmacies: enterobacter cloacae (7 strains), citrobacter freundi, ps. aeruginosa, ps. cepacia (2 strains), ps. maltophilia (2  strains) and moraxella. many resistant strains were also present on the walls (e. coli, ps. mirabilis, ps. cepacia, alcaligens, acinetobacter). the resistant strains were rarely observed on the table, medical equipment and on personnel hands. klebsiella oxytoca and ps. paucimobilis were found on the table, ps. maltophilia on the dropper and on the rim of the container with oral mixture. acinetobacter and pseudomonas sp. were isolated from the medicine glass, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas sp. from the personnel hands in the pharmacies.

TI  == evaluation of rapid one system for identification of 379 strains in the family enterobacteriaceae and oxidase-negative, gram-negative nonfermenters.
AB  == the ability of the rapid one system (innovative diagnostic systems, inc., norcross, ga.) to identify 364 strains in the family enterobacteriaceae and 15 oxidase-negative, gram-negative, nonfermentative rods was evaluated. kits were inoculated with no. 2 mcfarland standard suspensions, and reactions were interpreted after 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees c. overall, the method correctly identified (to the species level or to the genus level for salmonellas  and non-shigella sonnei shigella species) 363 strains (95.8%) without additional  tests. for four strains (1.0%), additional tests were required to delineate the correct identification from a range of two or more possibilities; these included  one serratia liquefaciens (serratia marcescens or serratia liquefaciens), one serratia rubidaea (serratia rubidaea or serratia odorifera), one salmonella typhi (leminorella richardii or salmonella sp.) and one yersinia enterocolitica (yersinia frederiksenii, yersinia intermedia, or yersinia enterocolitica). twelve strains (3.2%) were misidentified or yielded codes with no identification; these  comprised one citrobacter amalonaticus (no identification), three enterobacter hormaechei (not in the rapid one database; two enterobacter amnigenus, one enterobacter sp.), one serratia liquefaciens (enterobacter cloacae), one serratia rubidaea (no identification), four serratia fonticola (not in rapid one database; two enterobacter aerogenes, one serratia marcescens, one not identified), one proteus mirabilis (proteus penneri), and one proteus vulgaris (providencia rustigianii). if the seven strains not included in the database had been excluded, correct identification rates would have risen to 97.6% without additional tests and 98.7% with additional tests, with misidentification rates dropping to 1.3%. the rapid one system is easy to set up and the results are easy to read, and the system provides an accurate, nonautomated commercially available method for the same-day identification of members of the family enterobacteriaceae and oxidase-negative, gram-negative nonfermenters.

TI  == multipoint identification of enterobacteriaceae: report of the british society for microbial technology collaborative study.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of multipoint identification schemes in a multicentre trial. methods: forty two strains of enterobacteriaceae  were distributed to 22 laboratories for identification by routine multipoint methods. analysis of results enabled inter- and intralaboratory reproducibility of a variety of tests, and the ability of laboratories to identify individual organisms to be determined. results: interlaboratory reproducibility of most of the biochemical tests was acceptable. the least reproducible tests, both within and between laboratories, were citrate utilisation, production of urease and beta galactosidase, detection of motility, and decarboxylation of lysine and ornithine. inconsistent results for these tests were often associated with misidentified strains. most laboratories performed identifications satisfactorily. most isolates (72.1%) were identified correctly to species level; 9.6% were incorrectly identified, and 6.4% could not be identified at all. the most difficult organisms to identify were citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, hafnia alvei and aeromonas hydrophila. strains of enterobacter, serratia sp, and providencia sp were difficult to speciate. several laboratories could not identify organisms exhibiting at least one atypical biochemical reaction. conclusion: this study emphasises the need for quality control of media and reagents for multipoint identification of gram negative enteric bacilli.

TI  == resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in barbados.
AB  == resistance to third-generation, or extended-spectrum, cephalosporins caused by induction of class i beta-lactamases has been reported rarely from developing countries. seven isolates of cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative rods were recovered recently from urine, burns and ulcers in the queen elizabeth hospital,  barbados. the isolates were identified as acinetobacter calcoaceticus (2), citrobacter freundii (1), enterobacter cloacae (1), morganella morganii (1), providencia stuartii (1) and proteus sp. (1). induction of beta-lactamase by cefoxitin was demonstrated, and minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined by agar dilution. beta-lactamases were demonstrated by isoelectric focusing; the presence of chromosomal beta-lactamases was confirmed in at least three of the resistant isolates. the only antibiotics which were uniformly active against these resistant strains were imipenem and ciprofloxacin. these data confirm the existence of resistance to the third-generation cephalosporins in barbados, and emphasise the necessity for continuous surveillance of resistance patterns in the caribbean region.

TI  == analysis of polar lipids from some representative enterobacteria, plesiomonas and acinetobacter by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry.
AB  == fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (fab-ms) was used to analyse lipid extracts of bacteria to assess its usefulness for analysing anionic phospholipids of potential chemotaxonomic value. the following micro-organisms were tested: acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae (2 strains), escherichia coli (3 strains), hafnia alvei, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, plesiomonas shigelloides, proteus mirabilis (3 strains), serratia liquefaciens and serratia marcescens. negative-ion spectra provide data for twenty-seven major carboxylate  anions (m/z 209-325) and for thirty-seven major phospholipid anions (m/z 645-774). generally, the largest carboxylate peaks were due to 16:1, 16:0, cyc17  and 18:1 while the largest phospholipid anion peaks were due to pe(32:1), pe(33:1), pe(34:1), pe(34:2), pg(30:2), pg(31:2), pg(32:2), pg(34:1) and ps(33:0). however, quantitative differences were observed. for example, acinetobacter lacked pe (33:1) but had exceptionally high peaks at m/z 748, ps(33:0), and m/z 281, octadecanoate. unknown 'carboxylate' peaks were detected at m/z 254, 256, 261, 268, 282 and 301. in some cases, unknown peaks appeared to  constitute possible homologous series being separated by delta m/z of 14(identical to methylene). for chemotaxonomic purposes, the complexity of the data required numerical analysis. using the pearson coefficient of linear correlation, as a measure of association, it was possible to compare all strains  analysed. typical results for strain comparisons were as follows: ent. cloacae vs ent. cloacae, r = 0.90 (ent. cloacae vs ac. calcoaceticus, r = 0.46). thus fab-ms represents an excellent means of obtaining large quantities of data on polar lipids of a range of bacterial isolates, which may be suitable for chemotaxonomic purposes.

TI  == epidemiological role of arthropods detectable in health facilities.
AB  == a total of 161 arthropod specimens were collected from 55 sites in a health care  facility during july and september 1990. of the 116 bacterial isolates obtained from their body surfaces 6% were from parasites (mosquitoes), 59% from eusynanthropic arthropods (tenebrionid beetles, flies, german cockroaches, wasps), 16% from hemisynanthropic arthropods (ants, spiders) and 19% from occasionally encountered insects (non-biting midges, moths, beetles). most (88%)  of the isolated bacteria were gram-negative rods of the species e. coli, enterobacter, klebsiella, citrobacter, proteus, serratia, pseudomonas and acinetobacter. gram-positive cocci accounted for 13% of isolates and were primarily represented by coagulase-negative staphylococci. the highest isolation  rates were from body surfaces of flies, german cockroaches, non-biting midges (chironomids) and tenebrionid beetles. about one third of all isolates were resistant to more than three antimicrobials using a standard disc diffusion assay. the presence of multiple resistance to antibiotics was observed in two thirds of enterobacter isolates, namely those of enterobacter cloacae from the body surface of germany cockroaches, in 13% of citrobacter spp and in 8% of klebsiella spp as well as acinetobacter calcoaceticus strains. strains of morganella and hafnia species were very infrequent but all of them shared resistance to the antibiotics tested. in contrast, strains of serratia spp were relatively antibiotic-sensitive. the group of isolated gram-positive organisms was represented by two strains of staphylococcus hominis and one strain of enterococcus sp, all of them were multiply-resistant to antimicrobials.

AB  == we reviewed cases of gram-negative enteric bacillary meningitis in infants and children treated with cefotaxime at texas children's hospital from january, 1984, through june, 1989. seventeen of 20 children had an underlying condition predisposing to the development of meningitis. the etiologic organisms in these 20 children (2 days to 12 years old; median, 12 days old) were klebsiella sp, 9;  escherichia coli, 4; enterobacter cloacae, 3; citrobacter diversus, 2; other, 2.  with the exception of one isolate of acinetobacter, all isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime. in addition to cefotaxime 17 children received an aminoglycoside intravenously. children with meningitis caused by klebsiella sp. or non-klebsiella organisms received cefotaxime for 31 +/- 14 and 37 +/- 17 days, respectively. aminoglycosides were administered for 16 +/- 10 days in both groups. five children in each group also received intraventricular doses (1 to 25) of an aminoglycoside (9) or colistimethate (1). the mean durations of positive lumbar, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid or brain abscess cultures were 5.8 +/- 4.7 and 7.2 +/- 5.0 days after start of therapy in the klebsiella and non-klebsiella meningitis patients, respectively. only three children were normal at the time of discharge or follow-up. gram-negative enteric meningitis remains difficult to treat despite the excellent in vitro activity of cefotaxime against  gram-negative enterics, in part as a result of the predisposing conditions resulting in the development of this infection.

TI  == hemolysin as a marker for serratia.
AB  == all serratia marcescens strains (total of 33) of different sources were hemolytic including clinical strains previously classified as being nonhemolytic. dna fragments of the two hemolysin genes hybridized with the chromosomal dna of s. marcescens, s. liquefaciens, s. kiliensis, s. grimesii, s. proteamaculans, s. plymutica, s. rubridaea which were also hemolytic. the restriction pattern of the hemolysin locus differed in each strain. s. ficaria and s. marinorubra expressed  a different hemolysin which was much smaller than the s. marcescens hemolysin since it diffused through dialysis membranes. the dna of the latter strains did not hybridize with the s. marcescens hemolysin dna probes. some s. marcescens strains, s. kiliensis and s. liquefaciens also expressed in addition the small hemolysin. no hybridization was found with dna of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella arerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosus, listeria sp.,  aeromonas sp., legionella sp. and a meninococcus sp., indicating that the hemolysin dna probes are specific for serratia, or that the hemolysin genes occur rarely in genera other than serratia.

(415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == survival of coliforms and bacterial pathogens within protozoa during chlorination.
AB  == the susceptibility of coliform bacteria and bacterial pathogens to free chlorine  residuals was determined before and after incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa. viability of bacteria was quantified to determine their resistance to free chlorine residuals when ingested by laboratory strains of acanthamoeba castellanii and tetrahymena pyriformis. cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were  incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to free chlorine was also assessed. protozoa  were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free chlorine residuals that killed free-living bacteria. ingested coliforms escherichia coli,  citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella sonnei, legionella gormanii, and campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free chlorine residuals. bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99% inactivation of free-living cells. all bacterial pathogens were  greater than 50-fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by t. pyriformis. escherichia coli ingested by a cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. the mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within  protozoan cells. this study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. this bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free chlorine residuals which can lead to persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. we propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments.

TI  == lipid a precursor from pseudomonas aeruginosa is completely acylated prior to addition of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate.
AB  == inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (lps) synthesis in pseudomonas aeruginosa at the stage of incorporation of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate (kdo) caused accumulation  of a lipid a precursor which contained all of the fatty acids present on the lipid a of mature lps. the enzyme ctp:cmp-3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase (cmp-kdo synthetase) from p. aeruginosa is inhibited by the  kdo analog alpha-c-[1,5-anhydro-8-amino-2,7,8-trideoxy-d-manno-octopyranosyl] carboxylate (i), and i is effectively delivered to p. aeruginosa following attachment by amide linkage to the carboxyl terminus of alanylalanine. intracellular hydrolysis releases the free inhibitor (i) which then inhibits activation of kdo by cmp-kdo synthetase causing accumulation of lipid a precursor and subsequent growth stasis. the major lipid a precursor species accumulated was purified and found to contain glucosamine, phosphate, c12:o, 2oh-c12:o and 3oh-c10:0 (in ester linkage), and 3oh-c12:0 (in amide linkage) in molar ratios of 1:1:0.5:0.5:1:1. analysis of precursor by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy yielded a major ion (m - h)- of mass 1616 and fragments which were consistent with the structure of lipid a from p. aeruginosa. in contrast, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, citrobacter sp., serratia marcescens, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae all accumulated underacylated lipid a precursors which only contained 3-oh-c14:0, glucosamine, and phosphate. this difference and species-specific patterns of major and minor precursor species show that early steps in the assembly of lipid a are similar, but not identical in enteric and nonenteric gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == the in vitro activity of difloxacin (a-56619) and a-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. a-56620 inhibited 90% of enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, bacteroides sp. and clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. a-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than a-56620. both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive haemophilus influenzae (mic 0.015 micrograms/ml) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mk less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). both agents were more active against streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. they inhibited enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant s. aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa and s. aureus  at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. these agents show  overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.

TI  == in vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  == a total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. the strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of escherichia coli (314), enterobacter aerogenes (30), e. agglomerans (7), e. cloacae, (39), citrobacter diversus (9), c. freundii (13), hafnia alvei (3), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), klebsiella oxytoca (6), k. ozaenae (5), k. pneumoniae (107), morganella morganii (3), moraxella sp. (10), pasteurella multocida (1), proteus mirabilis (66), p. vulgaris (4), providencia rettgeri (12), p. stuartii (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), p. fluorescens (2),  p. maltophila (7), salmonella sp. (1) and serratia marcescens (17). in vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. over 99% of e. coli and enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. all the 118 strains of klebsiella, 87 strains of proteus-providencia and 17 strains of s. marcescens were also susceptible. aztreonam also showed good activity against p.  aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.

TI  == in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin compared with other agents against recent hospital isolates.
AB  == ciprofloxacin's in vitro activity was tested against 385 hospital isolates originating from three geographically distinct regions. of all strains tested, only three (1 acinetobacter sp. and 2 pseudomonas aeruginosa) were ciprofloxacin  resistant. ciprofloxacin was more active against escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, acinetobacter sp., proteus sp., shigella sp. than gentamicin, mezlocillin and cefotaxime. it was more active than azlocillin and cefsulodin against p. aeruginosa. it was more active than cloxacillin and cefamandole against staphylococci. it was as active as cefotaxime against klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens. ciprofloxacin demonstrated similar activity in broth and solid agar. the minimal  inhibitory concentrations (mic's) of all strains were similar to the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc's). ciprofloxacin's mic was not influenced by increase of the inoculum or addition of human serum and only slightly influenced  by anaerobic conditions. decrease of the medium ph increased the mic substantially. ciprofloxacin exhibited a rapid bactericidal effect and had only a minimal post-antibiotic effect. these favorable in vitro characteristics of ciprofloxacin warrant further studies.

TI  == [sensitivity to fosfomycin of bacteria isolated at the pitie-salpetriere hospital in 1982 and 1983].
AB  == susceptibility of 16 056 strains isolated in 1982 and 1983 to fosfomycin (fos) was tested with mueller-hinton medium and discs 50 micrograms fos + 25 micrograms glucose-6-phosphate (g6p) (cutoff diameter 14 mm). for 3 411 strains, inhibition  zone diameters were recorded. almost all e. coli, citrobacter, salmonella and s.  aureus were susceptible to fos as well as 70% of serratia, e. cloacae, p. mirabilis and 50% of klebsiella and enterobacter sp. only 27% of p. aeruginosa, 20% of indole positive proteus and 8% of acinetobacter were sensitive to fos. e.  coli, citrobacter and s. aureus seem to exhibit the highest susceptibilities to fos. sensitivity rates of e. cloacae, serratia, p. aeruginosa, and especially klebsiella seemed slightly underestimated by the disk diffusion method, but differentiation between susceptible and resistant strains was facilitated by rating as susceptible those strains with inhibition zone diameters between 12 and 14 mm. this method also seemed to underrate the sensitivity of susceptible enterobacteriaceae, probably because of inadequate g6p concentrations at this point of the disk.

TI  == antibacterial activity of aztreonam: a synthetic monobactam. a comparative study  with thirteen other antibiotics.
AB  == the in vitro activity of aztreoman (sq 26, 776), a new monocyclic beta-lactam antimicrobial agent, was determined against 1720 bacteria, all clinical isolates, and compared with that of thirteen beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics. aztreonam inhibited 90% of citrobacter diversus, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, proteus rettgeri, proteus vulgaris and salmonella sp. by less than or equal to 0.4 micrograms ml-1. this activity was superior to moxalactam, piperacillin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, ceftazidime and aminoglycoside antibiotics. aztreonam was as active as moxalactam against enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and shigella species. pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to moxalactam, piperacillin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin and ceftazidime were inhibited by aztreonam 50% by 6.3 micrograms ml-1 and 90% by 16 micrograms ml-1. aztreonam was as active as ceftazidime against serratia marcescens, all strains were inhibited  by 3.1 micrograms ml-1 and 90% by 1.6 micrograms ml-1. there was no major difference between mbc and mic values of aztreonam and the effect of inoculum size upon mic values was observed at 10(7) cfu.

TI  == direct dilution sampling, quantitation, and microbial assessment of open-system ventilation circuits in intensive care units.
AB  == in a systematic approach, 37 duplicate samples of open system circuits (bennett ma-1 ventilators) of patients in medical and surgical intensive care units were processed by direct and serial (apha guidelines) dilutions. the paired difference test on 15 of the in-use circuitry solution samples indicated no difference between the direct and serial dilution methods (p less than 0.001). seventy-seven additional respiratory therapy circuitry samples from similar intensive care patients were analyzed via a direct dilution method alone and processed microbiologically. the direct dilution procedure was a rapid and accurate means of evaluation of microbial contamination in the range of greater than or equal to 10 to less than or equal to 10(6) cfu/ml. high densities of organisms frequently  were found. sites of contamination included the proximal or patient end of the circuitry (heaviest), the nebulizer trap, and the distal or humidifier portions of the circuitry. the contaminants found were predominantly gram-negative nonfermenters: acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. antitratus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas maltophilia, and flavobacterium meningosepticum. fermenters were klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus sp., enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, and enterobacter agglomerans. infrequently, gram-positive streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp. were noted.

TI  == in vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  == norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. we examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including  anaerobic species. it inhibited 90% (mic90) of strains of escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, salmonella and shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. the mics of proteus mirabilis, morganella sp., proteus vulgaris, proteus rettgeri, and providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 of serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the mic50, the mic75, and the mic90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic50 of pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the mic90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. yersinia, arizona, and aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was campylobacter. the activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the mic90s of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. all listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. the activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, ph, or inoculum size. there was no major difference between mic and minimum bactericidal concentration values. norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.
