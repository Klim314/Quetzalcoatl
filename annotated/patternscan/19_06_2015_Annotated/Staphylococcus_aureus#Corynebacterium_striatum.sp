TI  == antimicrobial activity of chemokine cxcl10 for dermal and oral microorganisms.
AB  == cxcl10 (ip-10) is a small 10 kda chemokine with antimicrobial activity. it is induced by ifn-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of t cells. recently, we detected cxcl10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. in the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that cxcl10 inhibits the growth of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium jeikeium, corynebacterium striatum, and candida albicans hmv4c, but not corynebacterium bovis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, poryphromonas gingivalis, or c. albicans atcc 64124. the reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. however, antimicrobial activity of cxcl10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues,  7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pi of 9.93. modeling studies revealed that cxcl10 contains an alpha-helix at the n-terminal,  three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the c-terminal. thus, cxcl10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.

TI  == extracellular matrix assessment of infected chronic venous leg ulcers: role of metalloproteinases and inflammatory cytokines.
AB  == chronic venous ulcer (cvu) represents a dreaded complication of chronic venous disease (cvd). the onset of infection may further delay the already precarious healing process in such lesions. some evidences have shown that matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) are involved and play a central role in both cvus and infectious diseases. two groups of patients were enrolled to evaluate the expression of mmps in infected ulcers and the levels of inflammatory cytokines as well as their prevalence. group i comprised 63 patients (36 females and 27 males  with a median age of 68.7 years) with infected cvus, and group ii (control group) comprised 66 patients (38 females and 28 males with a median age of 61.2 years) with non-infected venous ulcers. mmp evaluation and dosage of inflammatory cytokines in plasma and wound fluid was performed by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test; protein extraction and immunoblot analysis were performed on biopsied wounds. the first three most common agents involved in cvus were staphylococcus aureus (38.09%), corynebacterium striatum (19.05%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.7%). in this study, we documented overall higher levels of mmp-1 and mmp-8 in patients with infected ulcers compared to those with uninfected ulcers that showed higher levels of mmp-2 and mmp-9. we also documented higher levels of interleukin (il)-1, il-6, il-8, vascular endothelial  growth factor and tumour necrosis factor-alpha in patients with infected ulcers with respect to those with uninfected ulcers, documenting a possible association  between infection, mmp activation, cytokine secretions and symptoms. the present  results could represent the basis for further studies on drug use that mimic the  action of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases in order to make infected cvu more manageable.

TI  == comparison of the staphylococcus quickfish bc test with the tube coagulase test performed on positive blood cultures for evaluation and application in a clinical routine setting.
AB  == many studies demonstrate that delayed proper therapy in bloodstream infections caused by staphylococcus aureus increases the mortality rate, emphasizing the need to shorten the turnaround time for positive blood cultures. different techniques are currently available, from phenotypic methods to more complex tests such as matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof), real-time pcr (rt-pcr), and fluorescence in situ hybridization using peptide nucleic acid probes (pna fish). this study evaluated  the performance of the staphylococcus quickfish bc test (qft), a novel fish methodology, compared with the direct tube coagulase test (dtct) on blood cultures exhibiting gram-positive cocci in clusters. a total of 173 blood cultures collected from 128 different patients were analyzed using the dtct, evaluated after both 4 and 24 h, and the qft. a total of 179 isolates were identified using the vitek2 system. thirty-five out of 35 staphylococcus aureus were correctly identified by the qft (sensitivity = 100%), with a specificity of  100% (no green fluorescence was detected for strains different from s. aureus). the dtct was positive after 4 h for 28 out of the 35 samples (sensitivity = 80%)  and after 24 h for 31 out of the 35 samples (sensitivity = 88.57%). among the remaining 144 isolates, one was then identified as corynebacterium striatum and two as micrococcus luteus. qft identified 139 out of the 141 coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (sensitivity = 98.58%), showing again a specificity of 100%  (no fluorescent red signals were detected for strains different from cons). we also discuss also the implementation process of this methodology in our setting,  with particular emphasis on the workflow and the cost-effectiveness.

TI  == [etiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia at the cardiovascular surgery clinic of iasi].
AB  == aim: we want to assess the etiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) and  emergence of resistant phenotypes for greater efficiency of the first-line antimicrobial treatment post-cardiac surgery. the study focuses on patients with  vap post-cardiac surgery at the institute of cardiovascular surgery between april 2nd 2002 and august 27th 2008, divided in two groups, before and after june 14th, 2005. material and methods: the tracheal aspirates were examined quantitatively (microscopy, culture). the isolates with clinical significance (> or = 106 cfu/ml) were identified by standard methods and tested by disk difussion or with  the breakpoints method for susceptibility to antibiotics. results: among the 1527 operated patients, 28 of them were diagnosed with vap through the clinical pulmonary infection score > or = 6. the 9 most common pathogens in vap etiology were pseudomonas aeruginosa 23.81%, acinetobacter baumannii 19.05%, stenotrophomonas maltophilia 11.91%, candida albicans 9.53%, while klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium striatum/amycolatum, pneumocystis jirovecii amounted 4.76% each. acinetobacter baumannii and s.maltophilia appear starting with june 15th, 2005. from that moment on we isolated with a higher frequency the gram-negative bacilli which produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases 15.62%, with multidrug resistance (mdr) 46.86%. the mdr phenotype was more frequent at a.baumannii (15.62%), s. maltophilia (15.62%) and p. aeruginosa (12.50%) compared to k .pneumoniae (3.12%) or e. coli (0%). methicillin-resistant s. aureus was isolated with a 6.25% frequency. conclusions: the most common etiologic agents of ventilator-associated pneumonia post-cardiac surgery are pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and candida albicans. the large use of antibiotics selects infectious agents with intrinsic resistance and multiresistant

TI  == native valve endocarditis caused by corynebacterium striatum with heterogeneous high-level daptomycin resistance: collateral damage from daptomycin therapy?
AB  == we describe a patient who developed corynebacterium striatum native valve endocarditis after receiving two 6-week courses of daptomycin for the treatment of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and osteomyelitis. the  organism exhibited in vitro heteroresistance to daptomycin, with two subpopulations showing daptomycin susceptibility (mic of </= 0.094 mug/ml) and high-level resistance to daptomycin (mic of >/= 256 mug/ml). the selection of daptomycin-resistant gram-positive skin flora with the potential of causing invasive disease may be a concern during prolonged courses of daptomycin.

TI  == antibacterial activity of sphingoid bases and fatty acids against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == there is growing evidence that the role of lipids in innate immunity is more important than previously realized. how lipids interact with bacteria to achieve  a level of protection, however, is still poorly understood. to begin to address the mechanisms of antibacterial activity, we determined mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of lipids common to the skin and oral cavity--the sphingoid bases d-sphingosine, phytosphingosine, and dihydrosphingosine and the fatty acids sapienic acid and lauric acid--against four gram-negative bacteria and seven gram-positive bacteria. exact kruskal-wallis tests of these values showed differences among lipid treatments (p < 0.0001) for each bacterial species except serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. d-sphingosine (mbc range, 0.3 to 19.6 mug/ml), dihydrosphingosine (mbc range, 0.6 to 39.1 mug/ml), and phytosphingosine (mbc range, 3.3 to 62.5 mug/ml) were active against all bacteria except s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). sapienic acid (mbc range, 31.3 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and fusobacterium nucleatum but not active against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, corynebacterium bovis, corynebacterium striatum, and corynebacterium  jeikeium (mbc > 500 mug/ml). lauric acid (mbc range, 6.8 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against all bacteria except e. coli, s. marcescens, and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). complete killing was achieved as early as 0.5 h for some lipids but took as long as 24 h for others. hence, sphingoid bases and fatty acids have  different antibacterial activities and may have potential for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention in infection.

TI  == [the characteristics of gram-positive bacteria isolated from skin lesions observed in ambulatory patients and the assessment of their susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs].
AB  == the bacterial skin and soft-tissue infections occur commonly and are characterized by more or less intensified changes within skin and subcutaneous tissue. the bacterial skin infections give rise to significant therapeutic problems associated with increasing resistance etiological agents of these infections to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. the aim of this study was to assess the distribution of various gram-positive microorganisms in skin lesion observed in ambulatory patients in a period from june 2005 to december 2006. there were 116 bacterial strains isolated and identified from clinical samples: staphylococcus aureus, coagulase - negative staphylococi (s.epidermidis, s. xylosus, s.capitis, s.saccharolyticus), propionobacterium acnes, streptococcus spp. (s.agalactiae, s.pyogenes) i corynebacterium spp. (c. striatum, c. amycolatum, c. aquaticum). in the further part of this study we analyzed a profile of their susceptibility to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics in relation  to drugs recommended for the empirical therapy. the resultant resistance patterns among the examined bacterial isolates are indicative of certain divergence between recommended empirical antibiotic therapy and actual antimicrobial susceptibility of many etiologic factors of skin and soft-tissue infections.

TI  == surface bacteriology of venous leg ulcers and healing outcome.
AB  == aim: bacteria can be cultured from all venous leg ulcers (vlus) regardless of healing status, and the significance of a positive swab result in non-clinically  infected ulcers is unknown. the aim of this study was to characterise the bacteriological flora of vlus by routine culture to determine whether the data generated had prognostic value. methods: the ulcers of 178 patients were sampled  weekly for 12 weeks and healing outcome monitored while the limb was treated with graduated compression. wound bacteriology was assessed using culture methodology  standardised to ensure data reproducibility. results: 153 individual bacterial species were identified. the species most frequently found were staphylococcus aureus (64.3% of assessments), corynebacterium striatum (60.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (32.6%), helcococcus kunzii (22.0%), finegoldia magna (21.4%) and proteus mirabilis (16.1%). no single species or the presence of anaerobes and increasing diversity of bacterial species, previously thought to be predictive of impaired healing, was shown to be associated with healing outcome. the presence of c striatum was associated with healing outcome but not after adjusting for the known prognostic factors of wound area and duration. conclusion: routine bacteriological culture analysis of the vlu wound surface may be used to identify diverse flora in all ulcers. however, the data generated are of no additional value as a prognostic indicator of healing outcome. the presence of c striatum may represent colonisation of non-healing vlu by normal skin flora.

TI  == nosocomial valve endocarditis due to corynebacterium striatum: a case report.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and enterococci sp. are  the usual pathogens involved in nosocomial bacterial endocarditis. corynebacterium species isolation in blood specimens is usually considered to be  a contaminant. we present an interesting case of native mitral valve endocarditis in a 73 year old african american female that was diagnosed days after she was discharged from our institution. the infection was cleared with medical therapy alone.

TI  == successful treatment of corynebacterium striatum endocarditis with daptomycin plus rifampin.
AB  == objective: to report a case of corynebacterium striatum endocarditis that was treated successfully with daptomycin plus rifampin following an unsuccessful attempt at vancomycin desensitization and failure of linezolid therapy. case summary: a 46-year-old woman with hemodialysis-dependent chronic renal failure was admitted for a graft-related infection. she presented with c. striatum endocarditis that was treated with daptomycin plus rifampin due to a history of allergies to vancomycin and beta-lactam antibiotics and failure of linezolid therapy. the patient received daptomycin and rifampin for a total of 6 weeks. three months after completion of treatment, no recurrence of endocarditis was evident. discussion: daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic, with rapid bactericidal activity. it has demonstrated efficacy in animal models of staphylococcal, streptococcal, and enterococcal endocarditis. case reports of its activity in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus endocarditis have also been documented. conclusions: daptomycin, which has shown in vitro activity against c. striatum, may be a viable treatment option for patients with c. striatum endocarditis who are either allergic or refractory to traditional antibiotics.

TI  == molecular evidence of person-to-person transmission of a pigmented strain of corynebacterium striatum in intensive care units.
AB  == during a 14-month period, a unique strain of corynebacterium striatum that produces a diffusible brown pigment was isolated from purulent sputa of nine patients and from nonrespiratory sites of two additional patients. seven nonpigmented clinical isolates from the same period and three reference strains of c. striatum were compared with the brown isolates. most patients had multiple  sputum cultures with no coryneforms before the brown strain emerged, suggesting that the organism was hospital acquired. dna restriction fragment patterns and southern hybridization with the att site probe of corynebacterium diphtheriae indicated that the brown isolates were a single strain which was distinct from the heterogeneous nonpigmented strains. a common source for the brown c. striatum was not recognized, although all of these patients were located in two adjoining  intensive care units. all of the brown isolates, three of the nonpigmented clinical isolates, and two reference strains had positive camp reactions with staphylococcus aureus, which has not been reported for c. striatum prior to this  study.
