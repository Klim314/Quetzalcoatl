TI  == active dry saccharomyces cerevisiae can alleviate the effect of subacute ruminal  acidosis in lactating dairy cows.
AB  == the objective of the study was to determine the effect of active dry saccharomyces cerevisiae (adsc) supplementation on dry matter intake, milk yield, milk components, ruminal ph, and microbial community during a dietary regimen that leads to subacute ruminal acidosis (sara). sixteen multiparous, rumen-cannulated lactating holstein cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dietary treatments that included adsc (biomate; ab vista, marlborough, uk; 8 x 10(10) cfu/head per day) or control. during wk 1 to 6, all cows received a high-forage (hf) diet (77:23, forage:concentrate). cows were then abruptly switched during wk 7 to a high-grain (hg) diet (49:51, forage:concentrate) and remained on the hg until the end of wk 10. feed intake and milk yields were recorded daily. ruminal  ph was recorded continuously using an indwelling system for 1 to 2 d per week during the pre-experimental phase, and wk 6, 7, and 10. ruminal digesta samples were collected at the end of the experiment and analyzed for relative change in microbial communities using real-time quantitative pcr. cows were considered to have sara if the duration below ph 5.6 was >/=300 min/d. ruminal ph during wk 6 (hf plateau) was not different across treatments (15 +/- 46 min/d at ph <5.6). the dietary regimen successfully induced sara during wk 7 (transition from hf to  hg diet), and ruminal ph (551 +/- 46 min/d at ph <5.6) was not different across treatments. however, cows receiving adsc had an improved ruminal ph (122 +/- 57 vs. 321 +/- 53 min/d at ph <5.6) during wk 10 (hg plateau) compared with control. additionally, cows receiving adsc had a better dry matter intake (23.3 +/- 0.66 vs. 21.6 +/- 0.61 kg/d) and 4% fat-corrected milk yield (29.6 +/- 1.2 vs. 26.5 +/- 1.2 kg/d) than control cows during the hg phase (wk 8 to 10). during hg feeding, cows receiving adsc had greater total volatile fatty acid and propionate concentrations (175 +/- 7.5 vs. 154 +/- 7.5 and 117 +/- 6.1 vs. 94 +/- 5.7 mm for adsc and control, respectively) and lower acetate:propionate ratio (0.26 +/- 0.5  vs. 0.36 +/- 0.05 for adsc and control, respectively). microbial analyses conducted on samples collected during wk 10 showed that cows supplemented with s. cerevisiae had a 9-fold, 2-fold, 6-fold, 1.3-fold, and 8-fold increase in s. cerevisiae, fibrobacter succinogenes, anaerovibrio lipolytica, ruminococcus albus, and anaerobic fungi, respectively, which suggested an increase in cellulolytic microbes within the rumen. cows supplemented with adsc had 2.2-fold  reduction in prevotella albensis, which is a gram-negative bacterium predominant  during sara. prevotella spp. are suggested to be an important source of lipopolysaccharide responsible for inflammation within the rumen. cows supplemented with adsc had a 2.3-fold increase in streptococcus bovis and a 12-fold reduction in megasphaera elsdenii. the reduction in m. elsdenii may reflect lower concentration of lactic acid within the rumen for adsc cows. in conclusion, adsc supplementation to dairy cows was demonstrated to alleviate the  condition of sara caused by abrupt dietary changes from hf to hg, and can potentially improve rumen function, as indicated by greater numbers of cellulolytic microorganisms within the rumen.

TI  == the effects of active dried and killed dried yeast on subacute ruminal acidosis,  ruminal fermentation, and nutrient digestibility in beef heifers.
AB  == the study addressed the importance of yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae) viability  for reducing the incidence of subacute ruminal acidosis (sara) and improving total tract nutrient digestibility in beef heifers. six ruminally cannulated beef heifers (680 +/- 50 kg bw) were used in a replicated 3 x 3 latin square design and were fed a diet consisting of 40% barley silage, 10% chopped grass hay, and 50% barley grain-based concentrate (dm basis). treatments were 1) no yeast (control), 2) active dried yeast (ady; 4 g providing 10(10) cfu/g; ab vista, marlborough, uk), and 3) killed dried yeast (kdy; 4 g autoclaved ady). the treatments were directly dosed via the ruminal cannula daily at the time of feeding. the periods consisted of 2 wk of adaptation (d 1 to 14) and 7 d of measurements (d 15 to 21). ruminal ph was continuously measured (d 15 to 21) using an indwelling system. ruminal contents were sampled on d 15 and 17 at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h after feeding. total tract nutrient digestibility was measured using an external marker (ybcl3) from d 15 to 19. no treatment difference was observed for dmi (p = 0.86). yeast supplementation (ady and kdy) tended to increase total tract digestibility of starch (p = 0.07) whereas no effects were observed on digestibility of other nutrients. both ady and kdy elevated minimum (p < 0.01) and mean ruminal ph (p = 0.02) whereas no effects were observed on maximum ph (p = 0.12). irrespective of its viability, yeast supplementation was effective in reducing time that ruminal ph was below 5.8 (p < 0.01) and 5.6 (p <  0.01). no treatment differences were observed for the ruminal vfa profile and lactate concentration. no treatment differences were observed on the relative population size of streptococcus bovis, fibrobacter succinogenes, and megasphaera elsdenii (p > 0.10); however, the proportion of ruminococcus flavefaciens in solid fraction of digesta was greater with kdy (p = 0.05). the study demonstrates the positive effects of yeast, irrespective of its viability, in reducing the severity of sara. however, further studies are required to evaluate the importance of yeast viability for other dietary conditions, particularly when the risk of acidosis is high.

TI  == fermentation of alfalfa wet-fractionation liquids to volatile fatty acids by streptococcus bovis and megasphaera elsdenii.
AB  == "green juice", obtained by squeezing fresh alfalfa leaves inoculated with lactic  acid bacteria, was fermented at room temperature for 7-21 d to obtain 12-47 g lactic acid l(-1). inoculation of green juice with streptococcus bovis and incubation at 39 degrees c reduced fermentation time to 8-12h. the resulting "brown juice" from either fermentation had a ph of approximately 4.5 and a protein precipitate. upon adjustment to ph 5.2-6.8 and inoculation with megasphaera elsdenii, brown juice was fermented within 48 h to up to 18 g of mixed volatile fatty acids (vfa) l(-1). single-stage fermentation of green juice  by both species in coculture typically resulted in overgrowth of s. bovis and acid inhibition of m. elsdenii, inhibiting vfa production. because the juice fermentations are conducted without sterilization or supplemental nutrients, they can potentially contribute to an integrated process featuring protein recovery and fermentation of fractionated solids to vfa and other products.

TI  == effects of an extract of plant flavonoids (bioflavex) on rumen fermentation and performance in heifers fed high-concentrate diets.
AB  == to study the effects of an extract of plant flavonoids [bioflavex (fl)] in cattle fed high-concentrate diets, 2 experiments were designed. in the first experiment, the effects of bioflavex on the development of rumen acidosis was evaluated in 8  holstein-friesian crossbreed heifers (451 kg; sem 14.3 kg of bw) using a crossover design. each experimental period lasted 22 d; from d 1 to 20, the animals were fed rye grass, on d 21 the animals were fasted, and on d 22, rumen acidosis was induced by applying 5 kg of wheat without [ control: (ctr) heifers who did not receive bioflavex] or with flavonoids [heifers who received fl; 300 mg/kg dm] through a rumen cannula. rumen ph was recorded continuously (from d 19  to d 22). on d 22, average rumen ph was significantly (p < 0.01) higher in the fl animals (6.29; sem = 0.031) than it was in the ctr heifers (5.98; sem = 0.029). after the wheat application, the rumen vfa concentration increased (p < 0.01), the proportion of acetic acid decreased (p < 0.01), and lactate concentration (mmol/l) increased, but the increase was not as great (p = 0.09) in the fl as it  was in the ctr heifers (0.41 to 1.35 mmol/l; sem = 0.24). on d 22, streptococcus  bovis and selenomonas ruminantium titers increased after the wheat application, but megasphaera elsdenii titers increased (p < 0.05) only in the fl heifers. in the second experiment, the effect of bioflavex on the performance and rumen fermentation in finishing heifers was evaluated. forty-eight fleckvieh heifers (initial bw = 317 kg; sem = 5.34) were used in a completely randomized design. heifers were assigned to 1 of 4 blocks based on their bw and, within each block,  assigned to 1 of 2 pens (6 heifers/pen). in addition, 16 heifers (2/pen) were rumen cannulated. individual bw and group consumption of concentrate and straw were recorded weekly until the animals reached the target slaughter weight. supplementation with fl did not affect adg, feed consumption, or feed conversion  ratio. rumen ph and molar proportions of propionate were greater (p < 0.01) and acetate proportion was less in the fl (p < 0.01) than they were in the ctr heifers. flavonoid supplementation might be effective in improving rumen fermentation and reducing the incidence of rumen acidosis. this effect of flavonoids may be partially explained by increasing the numbers of lactate-consuming microorganisms (e.g., m. elsdenii) in the rumen.

TI  == correlation between composition of the bacterial community and concentration of volatile fatty acids in the rumen during the transition period and ketosis in dairy cows.
AB  == the transition period is a severe challenge to dairy cows. glucose supply cannot  meet demand and body fat is mobilized, potentially leading to negative energy balance (neb), ketosis, or fatty liver. propionate produces glucose by gluconeogenesis, which depends heavily on the number and species of microbes. in  the present study, we analyzed the rumen microbiome composition of cows in the transition period, cows with ketosis, and nonperinatal cows by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (trflp) analysis of 16s rrna genes and quantitative pcr. trflp analysis indicated that the quantity of veillonellaceae organisms was reduced and that of streptococcaceae organisms was increased in rumen samples from the transition period and ketosis groups, with the number of lactobacillaceae organisms increased after calving. quantitative pcr data suggested that the numbers of the main propionate-producing microbes, megasphaera elsdenii and selenomonas ruminantium, were decreased, while numbers of the main lactate-producing bacterium, streptococcus bovis, were increased in the rumen of  cows from the transition period and ketosis groups, with the number of lactobacillus sp. organisms increased after calving. volatile fatty acid (vfa) and glucose concentrations were decreased, but the lactic acid concentration was  increased, in rumen samples from the transition period and ketosis groups. our results indicate that the vfa concentration is significantly related to the numbers of selenomonas ruminantium and megasphaera elsdenii organisms in the rumen.

TI  == effects of a combination of hinokitiol (beta-thujaplicin) and an organic acid mixture on ruminal fermentation in heifers fed a high-grain diet.
AB  == this study evaluated the effects of hinokitiol (a natural antibacterial compound  extracted from thujopsis dolabrata var. hondai) and an organic acid mixture (citrate content 50%) on ruminal fermentation. antibacterial properties were examined by measuring minimal inhibitory concentration. hinokitiol at 1.56microg/ml or an organic acid mixture at 1600microg/ml inhibited streptococcus bovis growth. the combination of 0.78microg/ml hinokitiol and 200microg/ml of an  organic acid mixture also inhibited s. bovis growth. both hinokitiol and the hinokitiol and an organic acid mixture combination showed strong antibacterial properties on gram-positive bacteria such as s. bovis, but relatively weak antibacterial activities on gram-negative bacteria such as megasphaera elsdenii.  three ruminally cannulated heifers were fed a bloat-producing diet containing barley, pelleted alfalfa meal, soybean meal and salt without long-cut roughage to investigate the ruminal characteristics in vivo. feeding to heifers a bloat-producing diet containing 7.8mg/kg hinokitiol and 0.2% of an organic acid mixture significantly decreased the increase in stable ingesta volume. hinokitiol or an organic acid mixture did not affect ruminal volatile fatty acids, protozoa  and bacteria. these results suggest that a combination of hinokitiol and an organic acid mixture might reduce frothy bloat in cattle fed high-grain diets.

TI  == rumen microbial population dynamics during adaptation to a high-grain diet.
AB  == high-grain adaptation programs are widely used with feedlot cattle to balance enhanced growth performance against the risk of acidosis. this adaptation to a high-grain diet from a high-forage diet is known to change the rumen microbial population structure and help establish a stable microbial population within the  rumen. therefore, to evaluate bacterial population dynamics during adaptation to  a high-grain diet, 4 ruminally cannulated beef steers were adapted to a high-grain diet using a step-up diet regimen containing grain and hay at ratios of 20:80, 40:60, 60:40, and 80:20. the rumen bacterial populations were evaluated at each stage of the step-up diet after 1 week of adaptation, before the steers were transitioned to the next stage of the diet, using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis, 16s rrna gene libraries, and quantitative real-time pcr. the t-rflp analysis displayed a shift in the rumen microbial population structure during the final two stages of the step-up diet. the 16s rrna gene libraries demonstrated two distinct rumen microbial populations in hay-fed and high-grain-fed animals and detected only 24 common operational taxonomic units out of 398 and 315, respectively. the 16s rrna gene libraries of  hay-fed animals contained a significantly higher number of bacteria belonging to  the phylum fibrobacteres, whereas the 16s rrna gene libraries of grain-fed animals contained a significantly higher number of bacteria belonging to the phylum bacteroidetes. real-time pcr analysis detected significant fold increases  in the megasphaera elsdenii, streptococcus bovis, selenomonas ruminantium, and prevotella bryantii populations during adaptation to the high-concentrate (high-grain) diet, whereas the butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and fibrobacter succinogenes populations gradually decreased as the animals were adapted to the high-concentrate diet. this study evaluates the rumen microbial population using  several molecular approaches and presents a broader picture of the rumen microbial population structure during adaptation to a high-grain diet from a forage diet.

TI  == effects of hops (humulus lupulus l.) extract on volatile fatty acid production by rumen bacteria.
AB  == aims: to determine the effects of hops extract on in vitro volatile fatty acid (vfa) production by bovine rumen micro-organisms. methods and results: when mixed rumen microbes were suspended in media containing carbohydrates, the initial rates of vfa production were suppressed by beta-acid-rich hops extract. the rates of vfa production increased over extended incubations (24 h), and hops extract caused an increase in the propionate to acetate ratio. hops extract inhibited the growth and metabolism of streptococcus bovis, but selenomonas ruminantium and megasphaera elsdenii were not affected. likewise, the propionate production of m. elsdenii/s. bovis co-cultures, but not m. elsdenii/s. ruminantium co-cultures, was decreased in the presence of hops extract. conclusions: these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the hops inhibit gram-positive lactic acid bacteria (s. bovis), and the rumen microbial community requires a period of adaptation before normal vfa production resumes. selenomonas bovis and s. ruminantium both produce lactate, which is the substrate for propionate production by m. elsdenii. however, s. ruminantium has an outer membrane, while s. bovis does not. significance and impact of study: the enhanced production of the gluconeogenesis precursor, propionic acid, provides further evidence that plant secondary metabolites from hops could be used to improve rumen fermentation.

TI  == utilization of amino acids by bacteria from the pig small intestine.
AB  == this study determined the utilization of amino acids (aa) by bacteria from the lumen of the pig small intestine. digesta samples from different segments of the  small intestine were inoculated into media containing 10 mmol/l each of select aa (l-lysine, l-threonine, l-arginine, l-glutamate, l-histidine, l-leucine, l-isoleucine, l-valine, l-proline, l-methionine, l-phenylalanine or l-tryptophan) and incubated for 24 h. the previous 24-h culture served as an inoculum for a subsequent 24-h subculture during each of 30 subcultures. results of the in vitro cultivation experiment indicated that the 24-h disappearance rates for lysine, arginine, threonine, glutamate, leucine, isoleucine, valine or histidine were 50-90% in the duodenum, jejunum or ileum groups. after 30 subcultures, the 24-h disappearance rates for lysine, threonine, arginine or glutamate remained greater than 50%. the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis showed that streptococcus sp., mitsuokella sp., and megasphaera elsdenii-like bacteria were predominant in subcultures for utilizing lysine, threonine, arginine and glutamate. in contrast, klebsiella sp. was not a major user of arginine or glutamate. furthermore, analysis of aa composition and the incorporation of aa into polypeptides indicated that protein synthesis was a major pathway for aa metabolism in all the bacteria studied. the current work identified the possible  predominant bacterial species responsible for aa metabolism in the pig small intestine. the findings provide a new framework for future studies to characterize the metabolic fate of aa in intestinal microbes and define their nutritional significance for both animals and humans.

TI  == ph dynamics and bacterial community composition in the rumen of lactating dairy cows.
AB  == the influence of ph dynamics on ruminal bacterial community composition was studied in 8 ruminally cannulated holstein cows fitted with indwelling electrodes that recorded ph at 10-min intervals over a 54-h period. cows were fed a silage-based total mixed ration supplemented with monensin. ruminal samples were  collected each day just before feeding and at 3 and 6h after feeding. solid and liquid phases were separated at collection, and extracted dna was subjected to pcr amplification followed by automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (arisa). although cows displayed widely different ph profiles (mean ph=6.11 to 6.51, diurnal ph range=0.45 to 1.39), correspondence analysis of the arisa profiles revealed that 6 of the 8 cows showed very similar bacterial community compositions. the 2 cows having substantially different community compositions had intermediate mean ph values (6.30 and 6.33) and intermediate diurnal ph ranges (averaging 0.89 and 0.81 ph units). fortuitously, these 2 cows alone also  displayed milk fat depression, along with markedly higher ruminal populations of  1 bacterial operational taxonomic unit (otu) and reduced populations of another arisa amplicon. cloning and sequencing of the elevated otu revealed phylogenetic  similarity to megasphaera elsdenii, a species reportedly associated with milk fat depression. the higher populations of both m. elsdenii and otu246 in these 2 cows were confirmed using quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) with species-specific primers, and the fraction of total bacterial rdna copies contributed by these 2 taxa were very highly correlated within individual cows. by contrast, the fraction of total bacterial rdna copies contributed by streptococcus bovis and genus ruminococcus, 2 taxa expected to respond to ruminal ph, did not differ among cows (mean= <0.01 and 10.6%, respectively, of rrna gene copies, determined  by qpcr). the data indicate that cows with widely differing ph profiles can have  similar ruminal bacterial community compositions, and that milk fat depression can occur at intermediate ruminal ph. the results support recent reports that milk fat depression is associated with shifts in bacterial community composition  in rumine and is specifically related to the relative abundance of megasphaera elsdenii.

TI  == effects of acarbose on ruminal fermentation, blood metabolites and microbial profile involved in ruminal acidosis in lactating cows fed a high-carbohydrate ration.
AB  == the objective was to evaluate the effects of an inhibitor of alpha-amylase and glucosidase (acarbose, pfizer limited, corby, uk) on ruminal fermentation, blood  metabolism and microbial profile in dairy cows in a 2x2 cross-over experiment. eight holstein cows fitted with rumen cannulas (milk yield, 24.3+/-2.35 kg/d, body weight, 622+/-54 kg, days in milk, 183+/-67, 5 multiparous and 3 primiparous) were used. treatments were: control (no additive, ctr) and alpha-amylase and glucosidase inhibitor (0.75 g acarbose-premix/cow per d, ami).  animals were given ad-libitum access to a high non-fibre carbohydrate (nfc) partial mixed ration (pmr) containing 17.6% crude protein, 28.3% neutral detergent fibre, and 46.5% nfc in the dry matter and supplementary concentrate during milking. blood samples were taken to determine blood glucose, insulin and  urea within the first hour after the morning feeding on two separate days in each period. samples of ruminal contents were collected during 3 d in each period at 0, 4 and 8 h after feeding to determine volatile fatty acid and ammonia-n concentrations and to quantify protozoa, streptococcus bovis and megasphaera elsdenii. rumen ph was recorded electronically at 22-min intervals during 6 d in  each period. results were analysed using a mixed-effects model. cows on ami treatment spent less time with ruminal ph <5.6 compared with cows in the ctr group (3.74 and 6.52+/-0.704 h/d, respectively). cows in the ami group had greater daily average ph compared with those in the ctr group (6.05 and 5.92+/-0.042, respectively). ami animals tended (p=0.09) to have lower str. bovis to meg. elsdenii ratio than ctr (4.09 and 26.8+/-12.0, respectively). these results indicate that dietary supplementation with acarbose in dairy cattle fed high-production rations may be effective in reducing the time for which rumen ph  is suboptimal, with no negative effects on ruminal fermentation and blood metabolites.

TI  == rumen microbiome composition determined using two nutritional models of subacute  ruminal acidosis.
AB  == subacute ruminal acidosis (sara) is a metabolic disease in dairy cattle that occurs during early and mid-lactation and has traditionally been characterized by low rumen ph, but lactic acid does not accumulate as in acute lactic acid acidosis. it is hypothesized that factors such as increased gut permeability, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, and inflammatory responses may have a role in the  etiology of sara. however, little is known about the nature of the rumen microbiome during sara. in this study, we analyzed the microbiome of 64 rumen samples taken from eight lactating holstein dairy cattle using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (trflp) of 16s rrna genes and real-time pcr. we used rumen samples from two published experiments in which sara had been  induced with either grain or alfalfa pellets. the results of trflp analysis indicated that the most predominant shift during sara was a decline in gram-negative bacteroidetes organisms. however, the proportion of bacteroidetes organisms was greater in alfalfa pellet-induced sara than in mild or severe grain-induced sara (35.4% versus 26.0% and 16.6%, respectively). this shift was also evident from the real-time pcr data for prevotella albensis, prevotella brevis, and prevotella ruminicola, which are members of the bacteroidetes. the real-time pcr data also indicated that severe grain-induced sara was dominated by streptococcus bovis and escherichia coli, whereas mild grain-induced sara was dominated by megasphaera elsdenii and alfalfa pellet-induced sara was dominated by p. albensis. using discriminant analysis, the severity of sara and degree of inflammation were highly correlated with the abundance of e. coli and not with lipopolysaccharide in the rumen. we thus suspect that e. coli may be a contributing factor in disease onset.

TI  == effects of dietary changes and yeast culture (saccharomyces cerevisiae) on rumen  microbial fermentation of holstein heifers.
AB  == the effects of a dietary challenge to induce digestive upsets and supplementation with yeast culture on rumen microbial fermentation were studied using 12 holstein heifers (277 +/- 28 kg of bw) fitted with a ruminal cannula, in a crossover design with 2 periods of 5 wk. in each period, after 3 wk of adaptation to a 100% forage diet, the dietary challenge consisted of increasing the amount of grain at a rate of 2.5 kg/d (as-fed basis) over a period of 4 d, until a 10:90 forage:concentrate diet was reached, and then it was maintained for 10 d. between periods, animals were fed again the 100% forage diet without any treatment for 1  wk as a wash-out period. treatments started the first day of each period, and they were a control diet (cl) or the same diet with addition of yeast culture (yc, diamond v xpcls). digestive upsets were determined by visual observation of  bloat or by a reduction in feed intake (as-fed basis) of 50% or more compared with intake on the previous day. feed intake was determined daily at 24-h intervals during the adaptation period and daily at 2, 6, and 12 h postfeeding during the dietary challenge. ruminal liquid samples were collected daily during  the dietary challenge to determine ruminal ph at 0, 3, 6, and 12 h postfeeding, and total and individual vfa, lactic acid, ammonia-n, and rumen fluid viscosity at 0 and 6 h postfeeding. the 16s rrna gene copies of streptococcus bovis and megasphaera elsdenii were determined by quantitative pcr. foam height and strength of the rumen fluid were also determined the day after the digestive upset to evaluate potential foam production. a total of 20 cases (83.3%) of digestive upsets were recorded in both periods during the dietary challenge, all  diagnosed due to a reduction in feed intake. rumen fermentation profile at 0 h on the digestive upset day was characterized by low ruminal ph, which remained under 6.0 for 18 h, accompanied by elevated total vfa concentration and, in some cases, by elevated lactate concentration. addition of yc during the dietary challenge did not affect the incidence (10 cases per treatment) or time (7.00 +/- 0.62 d) to digestive upset. however, yc reduced (p < 0.05) the foam strength on the day after digestive upset, suggesting potential benefits of reducing the risk of developing bloat. the proposed dietary challenge model was successful in causing  a digestive upset as indicated by reduced feed intake, but the yc addition had no significant impact on rumen fermentation.

TI  == physiological changes in rumen fermentation during acidosis induction and its control using a multivalent polyclonal antibody preparation in heifers.
AB  == physiological changes in rumen fermentation during acidosis induction and its control using a multivalent polyclonal antibody preparation (pap) were studied in a completely randomized experiment using 12 crossbred heifers (452 +/- 20 kg of bw). treatments were control (ctr) or pap. the acidosis induction protocol consisted of 3 periods: 3 mo of 100% fescue hay fed for ad libitum intake, 10 d (from d 1 to 10 of the experiment) of adaptation to the treatment (100% forage feeding + 10 ml/d of pap top-dressed to the treatment group), and 5 d (from d 11  to 15 of the experiment) of transition, which consisted of increasing the concentrate (16.5% cp) 2.5 kg/d up to 12.5 kg/d while maintaining ad libitum intake of fescue and providing 10 ml/d of pap to the treated heifers. concentrate feeding of 12.5 kg/d was maintained until heifers developed acidosis (from d 16 to 22 of the experiment). when an animal was considered acidotic, it was changed  to a 50:50 forage:concentrate diet, monitored for 4 d, and removed from the experiment. samples of ruminal fluid were collected before and 6 h after feeding  to determine ph, vfa, lactate, protozoa counts, and dna extraction for quantitative real-time pcr and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analyses.  only samples collected during adaptation to the treatment, at 3 and 1 d before acidosis, on the acidosis day, and at 1 and 4 d after acidosis were analyzed. differences were declared at p < 0.05. heifers (83% for ctr, and 50% for pap) entered into acidosis 5.25 +/- 0.17 d after the beginning of the transition. the  fermentation profile of animals with acidosis was similar between treatments. from 3 d before acidosis to acidosis day, decreases in ph and in acetate-to-propionate ratio and increases in total vfa, butyrate, and entodiniomorph counts were observed. however, the greatest concentrations of streptococcus bovis and megasphaera elsdenii (79 +/- 54 and 104 +/- 73 ng of dna/ml of ruminal fluid, respectively) and a decrease in dmi (10.6 vs. 6.46 kg, respectively) were recorded 1 d after acidosis. compared with ctr heifers, heifers fed pap had greater ph before feeding on d 6 (6.70 vs. 6.11), 8 (6.54 vs. 5.95), and 9 (7.26 vs. 6.59) after the beginning of the feeding challenge. heifers fed pap tended to have greater total vfa concentrations than ctr (124 and 114 +/- 4.0 mm, respectively). these results indicate that pap may be effective in controlling acidosis of heifers during a rapid transition to a high-concentrate diet.

TI  == biotransformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by pure culture ruminal bacteria.
AB  == twenty-one ruminal bacteria species were tested for their ability to degrade 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt) within 24 h. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, fibrobacter succinogenes, lactobacillus vitulinus, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus caprinus, and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with <5% of the original tnt recovered as diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. eubacterium ruminantium, lactobacillus ruminis, ruminobacter amylophilus, streptococcus bovis, and wolinella succinogenes were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with 23-60% of the tnt recovered as aminodinitrotoluene and/or diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. clostridium polysaccharolyticum, megasphaera elsdenii, prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens were able to degrade 80-90% of 100 mg/l tnt. desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans, prevotella albensis, and treponema bryantii degraded 50-80% of the tnt. anaerovibrio lipolytica was completely inhibited by 100 mg/l tnt. these results indicate that a variety of rumen bacteria is capable of transforming tnt.

AB  == relative quantification real-time pcr was used to quantify several bacterial species in ruminal samples from two lactating cows, each sampled 3 h after feeding on two successive days. abundance of each target taxon was calculated as  a fraction of the total 16s rrna gene copies in the samples, using taxon-specific and eubacterial domain-level primers. bacterial populations showed a clear predominance of members of the genus prevotella, which comprised 42% to 60% of the bacterial rrna gene copies in the samples. however, only 2% to 4% of the bacterial rrna gene copies were represented by the classical ruminal prevotella species prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola and prevotella brevis. the proportion of rrna gene copies attributable to fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus flavefaciens, selenomonas ruminantium and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were each generally in the 0.5% to 1% range. proportions for ruminobacter amylophilus and eubacterium ruminantium were lower (0.1% to 0.2%), while butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, streptococcus bovis, ruminococcus albus and megasphaera elsdenii were even less abundant, each comprising <0.03% of the bacterial rrna gene copies. the data suggest that the aggregate abundance of the  most intensively studied ruminal bacterial species is relatively low and that a large fraction of the uncultured population represents a single bacterial genus.

TI  == protozoa involved in butyric rather than lactic fermentative pattern during latent acidosis in sheep.
AB  == we used six ruminally cannulated texel wethers to study the relative role of protozoa and lactate-metabolizing bacteria in ruminal fermentative patterns during an induced latent acidosis. the sheep were fed an alfalfa hay diet (h) and latent acidosis was induced, following a short transition period of one week, with a grain-rich acidotic diet (w, 60% wheat + 40% alfalfa hay). ruminal ph, ruminal volatile fatty acids (vfa), lactate and nh3 concentrations, protozoa and  lactate-utilizing bacterial counts, the relative proportions of three main bacteria implicated in lactate metabolism (a lactate-producing species, streptococcus bovis, and two lactate-utilizing species, selenomonas ruminantium,  and megasphaera elsdenii) using specific 16s-rrna-targeting oligonucleotide probes, and lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) activity were determined for both diets.  the ph parameters (mean, minimum, maximum, time and area under ph 6.0 and 5.5) measured with the w diet were indicative of a latent (i.e., subacute and maintained) acidosis. however, a butyric rather than lactic latent acidosis was observed in this study. total ruminal lactate concentration remained at low levels with the acidotic diet (< 4 mmol x l(-1)), but changes were observed in vfa composition, which was oriented towards butyrate at the expense of acetate (p < 0.05), while propionate remained constant. in agreement with the low ruminal lactate concentration, no changes in the proportion of s. bovis 16s-rrna were observed. the lactate-metabolizing bacterial population also remained fairly constant in number, proportion and activity. the increase in butyrate concentration was accompanied by a proliferation of entodiniomorphs (p < 0.01). these results suggest that the protozoa limited lactate accumulation and possibly also the decrease in ph during latent acidosis. experiments with defaunated and faunated sheep could provide further evidence of the role of protozoa in the development of rumen latent acidosis.

TI  == influence of dipeptidyl peptidase inhibitors on growth, peptidase activity, and ammonia production by ruminal microorganisms.
AB  == the aim was to investigate known and potential new inhibitiors of dipeptidyl peptidases (dpp) for their effects on ruminal microorganisms. gly-phe diazomethylketone (gpd), ala-ala chloromethylketone (aac), benserazide (dl-serine 2-(2,3,4- trihydroxybenzyl) hydrazide), and diprotin a (ile-pro-ile) inhibited dpp activities of prevotella albensis, p. ruminicola, p. bryantii, p. brevis, and mixed ruminal microorganisms, though incompletely and, except for diprotin a, without absolute specificity for any of the peptidases. leucine aminopeptidase activity of streptococcus bovis was also inhibited by gpd and benserazide. the inhibitors had no effect on the growth of the bacteria, except for gpd, which inhibited growth of p. albensis when only peptides were available for growth. benserazide had some inhibitory effects on the growth of megasphaera elsdenii and prevotella spp., even in the absence of peptides. the predatory activity of ciliate protozoa on bacteria was unaffected by dpp inhibitors. ammonia production from casein by mixed ruminal microorganisms was inhibited significantly (p < 0.05) by aac (29% inhibition) and benserazide (33%). it was concluded that dpp inhibitors can influence the rate of nh3 production in the rumen and may form the basis for developing protein-sparing feed additives for ruminants.

TI  == [metabolism of rumen microbial populations formed on biosubstrates with different assimilation under the effect of pentachlorophenol].
AB  == it has been established that metabolism of mixed microbial population formed on easy assimilated sources of energy and nitrogen (concentrate diet) progressed on  higher level. there is increase of amilolytic activity, formation of lactate, ammonia, low molecular carbonic acids with predomination of propionate molar fraction. the increased resistance to effect of pentachlorophenol (pcp) is characteristic nature of the latter. the role of the most resistant synthrophic bacteria to pcp increases. the pure strains of streptococcus bovis and megasphaera elsdenii do not stop metabolism at 100 microm of pcp. mixed population of microorganisms formed on hard accessible biosubstrates (cellulose)  and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens have the increased cellulosolytic activity and while the high sensibility even to low doses of pcp (10-40 microm) is observed. it has been supposed that mechanism of pcp effect is ambiguous for various species of microbial complex of rumen. it's effect strength on all main chains of metabolism (membrane transport, energetic exchange, protein biosynthesis, etc.) significantly depends on capacity of pool of metabolic intermediates formed as a  result of definite program of biotechnology of nurture, but significantly decreases the harmful effect of biocides.

TI  == establishing populations of megasphaera elsdenii ye 34 and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens ye 44 in the rumen of cattle fed high grain diets.
AB  == aim: to determine whether megasphaera elsdenii ye34 (lactic acid degrader) and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens ye44 (alternative starch utilizer to streptococcus bovis) establish viable populations in the rumen of beef cattle rapidly changed from a forage-based to a grain-based diet. methods and results: five steers were  inoculated with the two bacterial strains (ye34 and ye44) and five served as uninoculated controls. with the exception of one animal in the control group, which developed acidosis, all steers rapidly adapted to the grain-based diet without signs of acidosis (ph decline and accumulation of lactic acid). bacterial populations of s. bovis, b. fibrisolvens and m. elsdenii were enumerated using real-time taq nuclease assays. populations of s. bovis remained constant (except  in the acidotic animal) at ca 10(7) cell equivalents (ce) ml-1 throughout the study. megasphaera elsdenii ye34, was not detectable in animals without grain in  the diet, but immediately established in inoculated animals, at 10(6) ce ml-1, and increased 100-fold in the first 4 days following inoculation. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, initially present at 10(8) ce ml-1, declined rapidly with the introduction of grain into the diet and was not detectable 8 days after grain introduction. conclusion: megasphaera elsdenii rapidly establishes a lactic acid-utilizing bacterial population in the rumen of grain-fed cattle 7-10 days earlier than in uninoculated cattle. significance and impact of the study: the study has demonstrated that rumen bacterial populations, and in particular the establishment of bacteria inoculated into the rumen for probiotic use, can be monitored by real-time pcr.

TI  == diet influences the ecology of lactic acid bacteria and escherichia coli along the digestive tract of cattle: neural networks and 16s rdna.
AB  == in this manuscript, the authors have sought to gain a better understanding of the interactions between escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from rogossa mrs agar along the digestive tract of grain- and forage-fed cattle.  e. coli from cattle receiving a high-grain diet were more numerous (p<0.05) than  from the high-forage diet and the highest numbers were in the faeces. isolates on rogossa mrs agar were always greater in the high-grain diet (p<0.05) and contained a significant number of lab. a random set of rogossa mrs agar colonies  was selected and artificial neural networks were used to develop a relationship between colony description and species which was validated using sequence analysis (16s rdna). the neural networks correctly predicted species in more than 80 % of cases and was composed, primarily, of lactobacillus vitulinus, lactobacillus ruminis, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus bovis, acidaminococcus fermentans and megasphaera elsdenii. in conjunction with statistical diversity indices, it was demonstrated that diversity in the high-fibre diet was always lower and was a consequence of the dominance of str. bovis. in contrast, the diversity in the high-grain diet was greater (p<0.05) and was a consequence of the decline in str. bovis. these data demonstrate that there is a positive relationship between coliform and lab isolates throughout the digestive tract of cattle, and diet is the major factor regulating bacterial composition.

TI  == restriction and modification systems of ruminal bacteria.
AB  == a high frequency of type ii restriction endonuclease activities was detected in selenomonas ruminantium but not in other rumen bacteria tested. eight different restriction endonucleases were characterized in 17 strains coming from genetically homogeneous local population. chromosomal dna isolated from s. ruminantium strains was found to be refractory to cleavage by various restriction enzymes, implying the presence of methylase activities additional to those required for protection against the cellular endonucleases. the presence of dam methylation was detected in s. ruminantium strains as well as in several other species belonging to the sporomusa subbranch of low g + c gram-positive bacteria  (megasphaera elsdenii, mitsuokella multiacidus).

TI  == the ability of "low g + c gram-positive" ruminal bacteria to resist monensin and  counteract potassium depletion.
AB  == gram-negative ruminal bacteria with an outer membrane are generally more resistant to the feed additive, monensin, than gram-positive species, but some bacteria can adapt and increase their resistance. 16s rrna sequencing indicates that a variety of ruminal bacteria are found in the "low g + c gram-positive group," but some of these bacteria are monensin resistant and were previously described as gram-negative species (e.g., selenomonas ruminantium and megasphaera elsdenii). the activity of monensin can be assayed by its ability to cause potassium loss, and results indicated that the amount of monensin needed to catalyze half maximal potassium depletion (k(d)) from low g + c gram-positive ruminal bacteria varied by as much as 130-fold. the k(d) values for butyrivibrio  fibrisolvens 49, streptococcus bovis jb1, clostridium aminophilum f, s. ruminantium hd4, and m. elsdenii b159 were 10, 65, 100, 1020, and 1330 nm monensin, respectively. b. fibrisolvens was very sensitive to monensin, and it did not adapt. s. bovis and c. aminophilum cultures that were transferred repeatedly with sub-lethal doses of monensin had higher k(d) values than unadapted cultures, but the k(d) was always less than 800 nm. s. ruminantium and  m. elsdenii cells were highly resistant (k(d) > 1000 nm), and this resistance could be explained by the ability of these low g + c gram-positive bacteria to synthesize outer membranes.

TI  == activity of h(+)-atpase in ruminal bacteria with special reference to acid tolerance.
AB  == batch culture experiments showed that permeabilized cells and membranes of ruminococcus albus and fibrobacter succinogenes, acid-intolerant celluloytic bacteria, have only one-fourth to one-fifth as much h(+)-atpase as megasphaera elsdenii and streptococcus bovis, which are relatively acid tolerant. even in the cells grown in continuous culture at ph 7.0, the acid-intolerant bacteria contained less than half as much h(+)-atpase as the acid-tolerant bacteria. the amounts of h(+)-atpase in the acid-tolerant bacteria were increased by more than  twofold when the cells were grown at the lowest ph permitting growth, whereas little increase was observed in the case of the acid-intolerant bacteria. these results indicate that the acid-intolerant bacteria not only contain smaller amounts of h(+)-atpase at neutral ph but also have a lower capacity to enhance the level of h(+)-atpase in response to low ph than the acid-tolerant bacteria. in addition, the h(+)-atpases of the acid-intolerant bacteria were more sensitive to low ph than those of the acid-tolerant bacteria, although the optimal phs were similar.

TI  == effects of a strain of saccharomyces cerevisiae (levucell sc1), a microbial additive for ruminants, on lactate metabolism in vitro.
AB  == the effect of levucell sc, a strain of saccharomyces cerevisiae marked as a feed  additive for ruminants, was investigated in vitro on lactate metabolism by the ruminal bacteria streptococcus bovis and megasphaera elsdenii. the coculture between 10(7) live cells x ml(-1) of sc and a streptococcus bovis strain in the presence of glucose reduced lactate production by the bacterial strain. live yeast cells were able to compete with streptococcus bovis for glucose utilization in strictly anaerobic conditions, so less glucose was available for the bacterium. sc also stimulated l-lactate utilization by a strain of m. elsdenii. the effect depended on the concentration of yeast cells added. bacterial growth and fermentation end-product concentrations were also increased in the presence of sc. some amino acids and vitamins, but not dicarboxylic acids, stimulated the  bacterial specific activity of l-lactate uptake. sc was able to provide amino acids to m. elsdenii. in a coculture of streptococcus bovis and m. elsdenii on glucose, the reduction of lactate concentration was improved by sc, the same trend being observed when maltose or soluble starch were used as carbon and energy source. these results indicate that sc can be a very useful tool to reduce lactate accumulation in vitro during fermentation of soluble sugars.

TI  == cyclic amp in ruminal and other anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == an examination of camp levels in predominant species of ruminal bacteria and other anaerobic bacteria was conducted. cellular camp concentrations of glucose-grown cultures of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, prevotella ruminicola d31d, selenomonas ruminantium hd4 and d, megasphaera elsdenii b159, streptococcus bovis jb1, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 5482, and clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 were determined at various times during growth by a competitive binding radioimmunoassay procedure. the results were compared to those for escherichia coli nrrl b3704. the levels of camp ranged from undetectable for b. thetaiotaomicron to approximately 15 pmol/mg cell protein for p. ruminicola d31d. varying the growth substrate in a manner previously shown to elicit regulatory response did not alter the level of camp in these organisms. in general, camp concentrations present in these organisms were much lower than the 6-25 pmol/mg cell protein observed for e. coli. the levels of camp in p. ruminicola were consistently higher than levels in other anaerobes, particularly during the early exponential and stationary phases of growth. based on these data it seems unlikely that camp is involved in regulation of substrate catabolism in the anaerobic bacteria examined except in p. ruminicola where it may have an unknown  regulatory function.

TI  == nutrient transport by ruminal bacteria: a review.
AB  == fermentation pathways have been elucidated for predominant ruminal bacteria, but  information is limited concerning the specific transport mechanisms used by these microorganisms for c, energy, and n sources. in addition, it is possible that changes in ruminal environmental conditions could affect transport activity. five carrier-mediated soluble nutrient transport mechanisms have been identified in bacteria: 1) facilitated diffusion, 2) shock sensitive systems, 3) proton symport, 4) na+ symport, and the 5) phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (pep-pts). several regulatory mechanisms are also involved at the cell membrane to coordinate utilization of different sugars. recent research has shown that predominant ruminal bacteria are capable of transporting soluble nutrients by several of the mechanisms outlined above. megasphaera elsdenii, selenomonas ruminantium, and streptococcus bovis transport glucose by the pep-pts, and s. ruminantium and s. bovis also possess pep-pts activity for disaccharides. glucose pts activity in s. bovis was highest at a growth ph of 5.0, low glucose concentrations, and a dilution rate of .10 h-1. the cellulolytic ruminal bacterium fibrobacter succinogenes uses a na+ symport mechanism for glucose transport that is sensitive to low extracellular ph and ionophores. sodium also stimulated cellobiose transport by f. succinogenes, and there is evidence for a proton symport in the transport of both arabinose and xylose by s. ruminantium. a chemical gradient of na+ seems to play an important role in aa transport in several ruminal bacteria. studying nutrient transport mechanisms in ruminal bacteria will lead to a better understanding of the ruminal fermentation.

TI  == substrate preference in a strain of megasphaera elsdenii, a ruminal bacterium, and its implications in propionate production and growth competition.
AB  == the niah 1102 strain of megasphaera elsdenii utilized lactate in preference to glucose when the two substrates were present. even when lactate was supplied to cells fermenting glucose, the cells switched substrate utilization from glucose to lactate and did not utilize glucose until lactate decreased to a low concentration (1 to 2 mm). since substrate utilization was shifted gradually without intermittence, typical diauxic growth was not seen. the cyclic amp content did not rise markedly with the shift in substrate utilization, suggesting that this nucleotide is not involved in the regulation of the shift. it was unlikely that propionate was produced from glucose, which was explicable by the fact that lactate racemase activity dropped rapidly with the exhaustion of lactate and cells actively fermenting glucose did not possess this enzyme. a coculture experiment indicated that m. elsdenii niah 1102 is overcome by streptococcus bovis jb1 in the competition for glucose, mainly because m. elsdenii niah 1102 is obliged to utilize lactate produced by s. bovis jb1; i.e.,  glucose utilization by m. elsdenii niah 1102 is suppressed by the coexistence of  s. bovis jb1.

TI  == [rumen bacterial metabolism as affected by extracellular redox potential].
AB  == the redox potential (eh) in the digestive tract of ruminants varies mostly within the ranges from -300 to +200 mv, in the rumen medium: from -130 to -200 mv. eh and ph changes are of a linear character. enhanced fermentation moves eh towards  negative values and improves growth of microorganisms. eh values become even more negative as affected by na2s, naoh, cysteine and nahso3. addition of picrate, sodium nitrate, hydrochloric acid, copper sulphate, gaseous oxygen and particularly heavy metals (silver and mercury) promotes positive eh values and inhibits metabolism. optimum eh values for megasphaera elsdenii are more negative, than those for streptococcus bovis. in the process of s. bovis growth,  the production of lactate, vfa, ch2o2 and nh3 increases, eh and ph values decrease. more positive eh values inhibit metabolism and growth rates of selenomonas ruminantium, bacteroides amylophilus, bacteroides succinogenes and streptococcus bovis to different degrees.

TI  == a survey of peptidase activity in rumen bacteria.
AB  == twenty-nine strains of 14 species of rumen bacteria were screened for their ability to hydrolyse ala2, ala5, glyarg-4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide (glyarg-mna) and leu-mna. several species, notably megasphaera elsdenii, were active against ala2, and a smaller number, including bacteroides ruminicola, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, ruminococcus flavefaciens, lachnospira multipara and ruminobacter amylophilus, broke down ala5. streptococcus bovis had an exceptionally high leucine arylamidase activity. however, only ba. ruminicola hydrolysed glyarg-mna. further investigation revealed that only ba. ruminicola and bu. fibrisolvens hydrolysed ala5 to ala3 and ala2, with little ala4 being produced, in a manner similar to rumen fluid. the activity of ba. ruminicola against synthetic peptidase substrates, including glyarg-mna, lysala-mna, argarg-mna, glypro-mna, leuval-mna, and ala3-p-nitroanilide, was similar to that of rumen fluid, whereas  the activity of bu. fibrisolvens was quite different. since the main mechanism by which peptides are broken down in the rumen is similar to dipeptidyl aminopeptidase type i, for which glyarg-mna is a diagnostic substrate, it was concluded that ba. ruminicola was the most important single species in peptide breakdown in the rumen.

TI  == effects of the ionophores monensin and tetronasin on simulated development of ruminal lactic acidosis in vitro.
AB  == a continuous coculture of four ruminal bacteria, megasphaera elsdenii, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus bovis, and lactobacillus sp. strain lb17,  was used to study the effects of the ionophores monensin and tetronasin on the changes in ruminal microbial ecology that occur during the onset of lactic acidosis. in control incubations, the system simulated the development of lactic  acidosis in vivo, with an initial overgrowth of s. bovis when an excess of glucose was added to the fermentor. lactobacillus sp. strain lb17 subsequently became dominant as ph fell and lactate concentration rose. both ionophores were able to prevent the accumulation of lactic acid and maintain a healthy non-lactate-producing bacterial population when added at the same time as an excess of glucose. tetronasin was more potent in this respect than monensin. when tetronasin was added to the culture 24 h after glucose, the proliferation of lactobacilli was reversed and a non-lactate-producing bacterial population developed, with an associated drop in lactate concentration in the fermentor. rises in culture ph and volatile fatty acid concentrations accompanied these changes. monensin was unable to suppress the growth of lactobacilli; therefore, in contrast to tetronasin, monensin added 24 h after the addition of glucose failed to reverse the acidosis. numbers of lactobacilli and lactate concentrations remained high, whereas ph and volatile fatty acid concentrations were low.

AB  == 1. the cellular proteins of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, lactobacillus casei, megasphaera elsdenii, selenomonas ruminantium and streptococcus bovis were labelled by growth in the presence of l-[14c]leucine, and the breakdown of labelled protein was measured in incubations of these bacteria with rumen fluid to which unlabelled 5 mm-l-leucine was added. the rate of protein breakdown was estimated from the rate of release of radioactivity into acid-soluble material. 2. protein breakdown occurred at different rates in different species. the mean rates for b. fibrisolvens, l. casei, m. elsdenii, sel. ruminantium and str. bovis were 28.6, 18.1, 17.7, 10.5 and 5.3%/h respectively in samples of strained rumen  fluid (srf) with different protozoal populations. rates of 3%/h or less were found in srf from ciliate-free sheep or in faunated srf from which protozoa had been removed by centrifugation. further removal of mixed rumen bacteria had little effect. suspensions of washed protozoa degraded bacterial protein at rates which were of the same order as those found in srf. 3. the rate of breakdown of bacterial protein in different samples of srf tended to increase as the numbers of small entodiniomorphid protozoa increased. the numbers of larger entodiniomorphs and holotrichs had no obvious influence on this rate. 4. autoclaved and u.v.-treated bacteria were generally no different from live bacteria in their susceptibility to breakdown in srf from faunated sheep, indicating that endogenous protein turnover was not a significant cause of bacterial protein catabolism. 5. the rate of bacterial protein breakdown was unrelated to the proteolytic activity of srf. 6. it was concluded that predation  by small protozoa is by far the most important cause of bacterial protein turnover in the rumen, with autolysis, other lytic factors and endogenous proteolysis being of minor importance.

TI  == phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of hexoses by ruminal bacteria: evidence for the phosphotransferase transport system.
AB  == six species of ruminal bacteria were surveyed for the phosphoenolpyruvate (pep)-dependent phosphorylation of glucose. selenomonas ruminantium hd4, streptococcus bovis jb1, and megasphaera elsdenii b159 all showed significant activity, but butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, bacteroides succinogenes s85, and bacteroides ruminicola b1(4) showed low rates of pep-dependent phosphorylation and much higher rates in the presence of atp. s. ruminantium hd4, s. bovis jb1, and m. elsdenii b159 also used pep to phosphorylate the nonmetabolizable glucose  analog 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-dg). rates of 2-dg phosphorylation with atp were negligible for s. bovis jb1 and m. elsdenii b159, but toluene-treated cells of s. ruminantium hd4 phosphorylated 2-dg in the presence of atp as well as pep. cell-free extracts of s. ruminantium hd4 used atp but not pep to phosphorylate glucose and 2-dg. since pep could serve as a phosphoryl donor in toluene-treated  cells but not in cell-free extracts, there was evidence for membrane and hence phosphotransferase system involvement in the pep-dependent activity. the atp-dependent phosphorylating enzymes from s. ruminantium hd4 and s. bovis jb1 had molecular weights of approximately 48,000 and were not inhibited by glucose 6-phosphate. based on these criteria, they were glucokinases rather than hexokinases. the s. ruminantium hd4 glucokinase was competitively inhibited by 2-dg and mannose, sugars that differ from glucose in the c-2 position. since 2-dg was a competitive inhibitor of glucose, the same enzyme probably phosphorylates both sugars. the s. bovis jb1 glucokinase was not inhibited by either 2-dg or mannose and had a higher km and vmax for glucose.

AB  == streptococcus bovis and megasphaera elsdenii were grown in continuous culture with maltose as the limiting substrate at dilution rates of 0.36, 0.22, and 0.12  h. after each steady-state turnover, the ph was decreased by adding concentrated  hcl to the medium reservoir. relative counts of the two species at each dilution  rate indicated that when the ph was high (6.6 to 6.0), higher dilution rates selected for a higher ratio of s. bovis to m. elsdenii. at intermediate ph (6.0 to 5.4), higher dilution rates once again selected for greater numbers of s. bovis in relation to m. elsdenii, but the increase in s. bovis numbers was much less at the 0.36-h dilution rate. decreasing the ph below 5.4 caused the ratio of s. bovis to m. elsdenii to increase greatly, and no m. elsdenii cells were seen below ph 5.1. the ratio of the two species could be explained by their relative affinities for maltose if ph was greater than 6.0, but the lower relative numbers of s. bovis in the 0.36-h, intermediate-ph (6.0 to 5.4) incubations could not. analysis of lactate production by s. bovis in pure culture showed that l-lactate  was produced only if the ph was less than 5.2 at dilution rates of 0.22 and 0.12  h and less than 6.0 at a rate of 0.36 h. the lower numbers of s. bovis relative to m. elsdenii in the incubations with a dilution rate of 0.36 h and intermediate ph thus could be explained by utilization of l-lactate by m. elsdenii. the very high numbers of s. bovis at ph less than 5.4 were consistent with the greater tolerance of this organism to low ph.

TI  == effect of ph on the efficiency of growth by pure cultures of rumen bacteria in continuous culture.
AB  == a total of 10 strains of rumen bacteria, selenomonas ruminantium hd4, megasphaera elsdenii b159, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens a38, streptococcus bovis jb1, lactobacillus vitulinus ga1, bacteroides ruminicola b14, b. ruminicola ga33, ruminococcus albus 7, ruminococcus flavefaciens c94, and bacteroides succinogenes s85, were grown in energy-limiteh of the medium reservoir was lowered approximately 0.3 ph units, and the energy source concentration remaining in the  culture vessel, optical density, cell mass, and ph were determined. a low ph appeared to have a detrimental effect on cell yields. large variations were seen  among strains in both the magnitude of yield depressions at lower ph values and in the ph at which the culture washed out. lactate analysis indicated ta are discussed in relation to the effect of ph on the efficiency of protein synthesis  in the rumen and rumen microbial ecology.

TI  == the constitutive nature of alkaline phosphatase in rumen bacteria.
AB  == alkaline phosphatase (apase) activity of megasphaera elsdenii was enhanced by po4 2- limitation in batch culture; however, six other species of rumen bacteria tested showed no increase in apase activity under these conditions. alkaline phosphatase was produced by the mixed rumen microflora even though the inorganic  phosphorus concentration was as high as 10mm. the apase activity of the bacterial fraction from rumen fluid was not increased during incubation in a phosphorus-free culture medium. since bacteria may account for greater than 80% of the apase activity in the rumen, this would suggest that the bulk of the apase activity in the rumen is synthesized constitutively. the bacterium responsible for most of the apase activity probably is bacteroides ruminicola.

TI  == effects of combinations of substrates on maximum growth rates of several rumen bacteria.
AB  == five rumen bacteria, selenomonas ruminantium, bacteroides ruminicola, megasphaera elsdenii, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and streptococcus bovis were grown in media  containing nonlimiting concentrations of glucose, sucrose, maltose, cellobiose, xylose and/or lactate. each bacterium was grown with every substrate that it could ferment in every possible two-way combination. only once did a combination  of substrates result in a higher maximum growth rate than that observed with either substrate alone. such stimulations of growth rate would be expected if specific factors unique to individual substrates (transport proteins and/or enzymes) were limiting. since such synergisms were rare, it was concluded that more general factors limit maximum growth rates in these five bacteria.

TI  == comparison of maintenance energy expenditures and growth yields among several rumen bacteria grown on continuous culture.
AB  == maintenance energy expenditures were mesured for five rumen bacteria, selenomonas ruminantium, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, bacteroides ruminicola, megasphaera elsdenii, and streptococcus bovis, by using a complex medium with glucose as the  carbon source. large differences (as high as 8.5-fold) in maintenance energy expenditures were seen among these bacteria. the suggestion is made that maintenance requirements could be a significant determinant of bacterial competition in the rumen. theoretical maximum growth yields, calculated from double reciprocal plots of yield versus dilution rate, were compared to theoretical y(atp) values in order to estimate minimum molar adenosine 5'-triphosphate yields from glucose for each bacterium. results showed that relative yield among the bacteria was growth rate dependent. at high dilution rates, both s. ruminantium and s. bovis produced lactate as their principal fermentation product. at lower dilution rates very little lactate was formed and  growth yields increased. acetate and ethanol were the predominant fermentation products of s. bovis at low dilution rates. other workers have shown that s. ruminantium produces acetate and propionate at low growth rates.

TI  == comparison of substrate affinities among several rumen bacteria: a possible determinant of rumen bacterial competition.
AB  == five rumen bacteria, selenomonas ruminantium, bacteroides ruminicola, megasphaera elsdenii, streptococcus bovis, and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens were grown in continuous culture. estimates of substrate affinities were derived from lineweaver-burk plots of dilution rate versus substrate concentration. each bacterium was grown on at least four of the six substrates: glucose, maltose, sucrose, cellobiose, xylose, and lactate. wide variations in substrate affinities were seen among the substrates utilized by a species and among species for the same substrate. these wide differences indicate that substrate affinity may be a  significant determinant of bacterial competition in the rumen where soluble substrate concentrations are often low. growth of these bacteria in continuous culture did not always follow typical michaelis-menten kinetics. inflated theoretical maximum growth rates and non-linear lineweaver-burk plots were sometimes seen. maintenance energy expenditures and limitation of growth rate by  factors other than substrate concentration (i.e., protein synthesis) are discussed as possible determinants of these deviations.

TI  == production of branched-chain volatile fatty acids by certain anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == net production of isobutyric acid, isovaleric acid, and 2-methylbutyric acid by cultures of bacteroides ruminicola and megasphaera elsdenii on media that contained trypticase or casein hydrolysate continued (up to 5 days) after growth  had ceased. only trace quantities of these acids were produced in a medium that contained a mixture of amino acids that did not include the branched-chain amino  acids. m. elsdenii produced increased quantities of the branched-chain fatty acids in a medium that contained trypticase when glucose was reduced or eliminated from the culture medium. however, b. ruminicola produced increased quantities of branched-chain fatty acids and of phenylacetic acid from trypticase when glucose was supplied at 3 mg/ml rather than at 1 mg/ml. single strains of streptococcus bovis, selenomonas ruminantium, bacteroides amylophilus, and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens did not produce branched-chain fatty acids.
