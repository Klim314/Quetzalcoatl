TI  - [The monosaccharide composition of the glycocalyx in Mollicutes and phylogenetically related bacteria in the genus Bacillus].
AB  - A number of monosaccharides composing the glycocalix carbohydrates of some Mollicutes (Mycoplasma pneumoniae FH, M. hominis PG21, M. fermentans PG18, Acholeplasma laidlawii PG8, A. laidlawii var. granulum st. 118) and phylogenetically related bacteria from the genus Bacillus (Bacillus cereus 89, B. cereus DM423, B. subtilis 1/2, B. licheniformis 31, B. licheniformis 49) were detected using plant lectins of definite carbohydrate specificity labelled by colloid gold. The structure of extracellular glycopolymers of microorganisms was discussed concerning their role in the adhesion process and their specializations in colonization of the appropriate organs and tissues of macroorganisms as well as the action of probiotics on the basis of bacteria from the genus Bacillus. It was marked, that the mollicute cells typically interacted with all vegetable lectins tested while bacilli studied bind certain lectins only. The surface carbohydrates prevailing in monosaccharides from tested one for superficial structures of Bacillus pathogenic strains were: sialic acid, beta-D-galactose and alpha-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, while L-fucose and alpha-D-glucose were observed in insignificant quantity or were absent. The nonpathogenic Bacillus strains being a basis of biopreparations were distinguished by the insignificant amount of sialic acid and other monosaccharides in the composition of carbohydrates of their glycocalix. Thus, as a result of research it was confirmed, that the superficial glycopolymers of Mollicutes and some related bacilli were alike as to presence of some monosaccharides that depended on taxonomic position of microorganisms and their biological activity.

TI  - Alteration by cereolysin of the structure of cholesterol-containing membranes.
AB  - When erythrocyte membranes were treated with cereolysin, negatively stained and examined by electron microscopy, ring and arc-shaped structures were observed in the membrane. The outside diameter of the rings varied from 33 to 50 nm with a border thickness of 6.7 to 8.3 nm. The arcs varied in length from 33 to 170 nm with a border thickness of also 6.7 to 8.3 min. When right-side-out erythrocyte ghosts which had been treated with cereolysin were examined by electron microscopy after freeze-fracture, structures with a diameter of 31 to 63 nm were seen in the fracture face of the exoplasmic half of the membrane, but no alterations were visible in the fracture face of the protoplasmic half of the membrane bilayer. Thus the ring structures did not appear to form holes through the membrane. At cereolysin concentrations above 6 microgram/ml rings and arcs were seen when purified toxin alone was examined. At or below 6 microgram/ml toxin rings and arcs were seen only if toxin was incubated with free or membrane-bound cholesterol. Our interpretation is that cereolysin tends to aggregate into ring and arc-shaped structures, and that the tendency to aggregate is increased by cholesterol. Rings and arcs were not seen when erythrocyte ghosts were treated with low, but lytic amounts of cereolysin that significantly altered the premeability of the ghosts.
