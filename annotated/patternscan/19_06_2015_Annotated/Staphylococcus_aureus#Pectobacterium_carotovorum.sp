TI  == characterization of films based on chitosan lactate and its blends with oxidized  starch and gelatin.
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of chitosan lactate (chl) was tested against bacteria and phytopathogenic fungi. then, the structural, physicochemical and antimicrobial properties of films based on chl, oxidized potato starch (ops), and gelatin (gel) were investigated. with the exception of rhizopus nigricans, chl was effective against the target organisms. gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus) were more sensitive to chl than gram-negative bacteria (pectobacterium carotovorum and escherichia coli). cryo-sem images showed total miscibility between the polymers in the blends and the atr-ftir spectra revealed that there was an interaction among the polymeric components. pure chl films displayed the highest moisture content (25.51%), water vapor permeability (48.78gmmm(-2)d(-1)kpa(-1)), and the lowest tensile and puncture strength (2.00 and 1.45mpa, respectively) among the studied films. chl50/gel50 films had lower permeability, higher mechanical strength, and lower elongation compared to chl50/ops50 films. films obtained from chl and chl50/gel50 were completely water-soluble and did not show sorbitol recrystallization. the incorporation of chl into ops and gel films did not affect their transparency and improved uv-blocking capacity. chl films were the only ones that exhibited antibacterial efficiency. antifungal activities against alternaria alternata and  monilinia fructigena were detected for chl and chl50/gel50 films.

TI  == ultrastructural observation on sterilization of melittin.
AB  == abstact: the effects of melittin on growth and bacteriostasis of four pathogens were extensively investigated using scanning electron microscopy (sem) and transmission electron microscopy (tem). the results indicated that the melittin had a marked bacteriostatic effect on the four pathogenic bacteria. among these,  e. cacotowora was influenced most powerfully and quickly, the yeast and f. fulva  were the second, and the s. aureus was inhibited by a low concentration but was killed by a high concentration. it was observed in the experiments that melittin  killed pathogenic bacteria in three ways. one was by pore formation. after integrating melittin into the plasma membrane, a vacuole was formed then penetrated, resulting in bacterial content leakage. the vacuole also experienced  plasmolysis and the growing cavity destroyed the membrane. a third effect was the formation of vacuoles in the cells which induced the pycnosis of the cytoplasm resulting in a cell death. the mechanism of melittin bacteriostasis was the result of integrating melittin with phospholipid double layers of the plasmalemma and the endomembranes.

TI  == low-abundance kutznerides from kutzneria sp. 744.
AB  == five new (5-9) and four known (1-4) kutznerides were isolated from the actinomycete kutzneria sp. 744. compounds 1-9 all consisted of a cyclohexadepsipeptide core with the general structure 2-(1-methylcyclopropyl)-d-glycine-(2s,3ar,8as)-6,7-dichloro-3a-hydroxy-1,2,3,3a,8 ,8a-hexahydropyrrolo[2,3-b]indole-2-carboxylic acid-3-hydroxy-d-glutamic acid-o-methyl-l-serine-l-piperazic acid-(s)-2-hydroxy-3,3-dimethylbutyric acid. compounds 5, 6, and 8 contained erythro-3-hydroxy-d-glutamic acid, whereas 7 and  9 contained the threo isomer and the hydroxy acid was present as (s)-2-hydroxy-3-methylbutyric acid in 5 and 7. the piperazic acid was c-5-n unsaturated and 4-hydroxylated in 6, 4-chlorinated in 8, and c-5-n unsaturated in 9. minimal inhibitory concentrations for bacteria were found down to 6 microm (staphylococcus aureus and erwinia carotovora) and for fungi down to 70 microm (fusarium culmorum). the trichlorinated 2 and 8 showed the highest antimicrobial  activity, whereas 6, with a hydroxylated piperazic acid unit, did not show any inhibition of the pathogens at 230 microm.
