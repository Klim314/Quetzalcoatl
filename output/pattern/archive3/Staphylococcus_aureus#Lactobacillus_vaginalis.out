vaginal lactobacilli inhibiting growth of gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus and other bacterial species cultured from vaginal content of women with bacterial vaginosis.
on a solid agar medium the growth-inhibitory effect of 9 lactobacillus strains cultured from vaginal content was tested on bacteria cultured from vaginal content of women with bacterial vaginosis: mobiluncus, gardnerella vaginalis, bacteroides and anaerobic cocci. inhibition zones were observed in the growth of all of the strains isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis around all lactobacilli. the inhibitory effect of the lactobacilli was further tested on various anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic species, both type strains and fresh extragenitally cultured strains. four bacteroides fragilis strains as well as 2 out of 4 staphylococcus aureus strains were clearly inhibited by the lactobacilli. the inhibition zones were generally wider at ph 5.5 than at 6.0. for all inhibited strains, (the s. aureus excepted) a low ph on the agar around the lactobacilli correlated to wider growth-inhibition zones.
