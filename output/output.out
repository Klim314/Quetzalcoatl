in vitro antianaerobic activity of dx-619, a new des-fluoro(6) quinolone.
the in vitro activity of dx-619, a new des-f(6) quinolone, against anaerobic bacteria was evaluated. dx-619 showed potent activity against bacteroides, prevotella, fusobacterium, micromonas, actinomyces, and clostridium spp., with mic(50)s/mic(90)s of </=0.03 to 0.25/</=0.03 to 1 microg/ml, respectively. dx-619 was also active against imipenem-resistant bacteroides spp., with mic(50)s/mic(90)s of 0.25/1 microg/ml, respectively.
in vivo evaluation of the effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on salivary bacteria using the checkerboard method.
objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on different species of the oral microbiota. methodology: saliva samples were collected from 20 subjects with good oral health, diluted and plated onto blood agar medium. the subjects were asked to place the strip (listerine pocketpaks) on the tongue allowing it to dissolve. after 30 minutes, new saliva samples were collected again and the plates with the samples were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees c for seven days. colony counts (cfu/ml) were determined for each sample. the colonies on the plates were washed with 1 ml of te buffer, and the bacterial suspensions were processed for the identification of 24 species by dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. differences in total counts, prevalence, and levels of the species evaluated before and after placement of the strips were determined by wilcoxon sign rank and chi-square tests. results: a modest increase in the total bacterial number in saliva from 1.4 x 10(8) to 1.7 x 10(8) bacterial cells was observed 30 minutes after the strip placement, although this change was not significant (p = 0.632). most of the species reduced in frequency and/or levels, including the pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium spp., p. intermedia, and s. noxia, as well as the beneficial species a. meyeri, a. georgia, a. gerencseriae, a. odontolyticus, and p. acnes after strip placement. in contrast, a. viscosus, p. melaninogenica, p. gingivalis, p. micros, streptococcus spp., t. forsythensis, and v. parvula presented an increase in prevalence and/or levels. these changes were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (p > 0.0022). conclusion: the use of the essential oil-containing oral strips resulted in a short-term small increase in the total number of salivary microorganisms. in addition, a not significant decrease of certain periodontopathogens, and an increase in species compatible with oral health were observed.
scaling and root planing, systemic metronidazole and professional plaque removal  in the treatment of chronic periodontitis in a brazilian population ii--microbiological results.
objective: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions  of 39 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples after scaling and root planing (srp) alone or in combination with systemic metronidazole and/or professional cleaning in subjects with chronic periodontitis. methods: forty-four adult subjects (mean age 45+/-6 years) with periodontitis were randomly assigned in four treatment groups, a control (c, n=10) that received srp and placebo and three test groups treated as follows: t1 (n=12): srp and metronidazole (m, 400 mg tid) for 10 days; t2 (n=12): srp, weekly professional supragingival plaque removal for 3 months (pc) and placebo; and t3 (n=10): srp, m and pc. subgingival plaque samples were taken from seven sites per subject at baseline and 90 days post-therapy. counts of 39 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and among groups using ancova. results: the mean counts of the majority of the species were reduced post-therapy in the 4 treatment groups. counts (x 10(5)+/-sem) of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola were significantly reduced in groups t2 and t3. levels of beneficial species, such as some actinomyces species, veillonella parvula, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus gordonii were minimally affected in levels when the combined therapy was applied (t3). mean proportions of red complex species decreased from 18.4% at baseline to 3% at 90 days post-therapy in group t3 (p<0.01), from 25.8% to 2.3% in group t2 (p<0.01), from 17.7% to 5.6% in group t1 (p<0.05) and from 19.4% to 8.8% in group c (ns). proportions of the suspected periodontal pathogens from the orange complex were also markedly reduced in groups t2 and t3. conclusions: all treatments reduced counts and proportions of red complex species. adjunctive therapy appeared to have a greater effect and also affected members of the orange complex.
characterization of a bacteriocin produced by prevotella nigrescens atcc 25261.
aims: to characterize the antimicrobial activity produced by prevotella nigrescens atcc 25261, and to evaluate its safety on cultured gingival fibroblasts. methods and results: an antimicrobial activity was obtained from purifying the culture supernatant of pr. nigrescens atcc 25261. purification of the active compound was achieved with ammonium sulphate precipitation followed by anion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. as revealed by sds-page, the active fraction was relatively homogeneous, showing a protein with an approximate molecular weight of 41 kda. the antimicrobial compound, named nigrescin, exhibited a bactericidal mode of action against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and actinomyces spp. nigrescin was stable in a ph range between 6.5 and 9.5, at 100 degrees c for 10 min, and resistant to lyophilization. but its activity was lost after proteinase k treatment. despite at very high concentrations beyond the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), nigrescin was not toxic to the gingival fibroblasts. conclusion: nigrescin is a novel bacteriocin produced by pr. nigrescens atcc 25261. it exhibits antimicrobial activity against species that are implicated in periodontal diseases. the absence of toxicity on the gingival fibroblasts suggests the possibility in using of nigrescin for an application in periodontal treatment. significance and impact of the study: novel evidence on nigrescin would make pr. nigrescens atcc 25261 attractive in biotechnological applications as an antimicrobial agent in clinical dentistry.
molecular cloning and expression in escherichia coli of an exo-levanase gene from the endophytic bacterium gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus srt4.
gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus produces levan from sucrose by a secreted levansucrase (lsda). a levanase-encoding gene ( lsdb), starting 51 bp downstream of the lsda gene, was cloned from strain srt4. the lsdb gene (1605 bp) encodes a protein (calculated molecular mass 58.4 kda) containing a putative 36-amino-acid signal peptide at the n-terminus. the deduced amino acid sequence shares 34%, 33%, 32%, and 29% identities with levanases from actinomyces naeslundii, bacillus subtilis, paenibacillus polymyxa, and bacteroides fragilis, respectively. the lsdb expression in escherichia coli under the control of the t7 rna polymerase promoter resulted in an active enzyme which hydrolyzed levan, inulin, 1-kestose, raffinose, and sucrose, but not melezitose. levanase activity was maximal at ph 6.0 and 30 degrees c, and it was not inhibited by the metal ion chelator edta or the denaturing agents dithiothreitol and beta-mercaptoethanol. the recombinant lsdb showed a fourfold higher rate of hydrolysis on levan compared to inulin, and the reaction on both substrates resulted in the successive liberation of the terminal fructosyl residues without formation of intermediate oligofructans, indicating a non-specific exo-levanase activity.
analysis of bacterial detachment from substratum surfaces by the passage of air-liquid interfaces.
a theoretical analysis of the detachment of bacteria adhering to substratum surfaces upon the passage of an air-liquid interface is given, together with experimental results for bacterial detachment in the absence and presence of a conditioning film on different substratum surfaces. bacteria (streptococcus sobrinus hg1025, streptococcus oralis j22, actinomyces naeslundii t14v-j1, bacteroides fragilis 793e, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 974k) were first allowed to adhere to hydrophilic glass and hydrophobic dimethyldichlorosilane (dds)-coated glass in a parallel-plate flow chamber until a density of 4 x 10(6) cells cm(-2) was reached. for s. sobrinus hg1025, s. oralis j22, and a. naeslundii t14v-j1, the conditioning film consisted of adsorbed salivary components, while for b. fragilis 793e and p. aeruginosa 974k, the film consisted of adsorbed human plasma components. subsequently, air bubbles were passed through the flow chamber and the bacterial detachment percentages were measured. for some experimental conditions, like with p. aeruginosa 974k adhering to dds-coated glass and an air bubble moving at high velocity (i.e., 13.6 mm s(-1)), no bacteria detached upon passage of an air-liquid interface, while for others, detachment percentages between 80 and 90% were observed. the detachment percentage increased when the velocity of the passing air bubble decreased, regardless of the bacterial strain and substratum surface hydrophobicity involved. however, the variation in percentages of detachment by a passing air bubble depended greatly upon the strain and substratum surface involved. at low air bubble velocities the hydrophobicity of the substratum had no influence on the detachment, but at high air bubble velocities all bacterial strains were more efficiently detached from hydrophilic glass substrata. furthermore, the presence of a conditioning film could either inhibit or stimulate detachment. the shape of the bacterial cell played a major role in detachment at high air bubble velocities, and spherical strains (i.e., streptococci) detached more efficiently than rod-shaped organisms. the present results demonstrate that methodologies to study bacterial adhesion which include contact with a moving air-liquid interface (i.e., rinsing and dipping) yield detachment of an unpredictable number of adhering microorganisms. hence, results of studies based on such methodologies should be referred as "bacterial retention" rather than "bacterial adhesion".
comparative in vitro activities of abt-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
the activity of abt-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. mics at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for actinomyces spp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium spp., and porphyromonas spp. the mic(50)s and mic(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for eubacterium spp., lactobacillus spp., clostridium difficile, and clostridium ramosum. the mic(90) for bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides ureolyticus, and campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for prevotella bivia and other prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. the mic(90) for fusobacterium nucleatum was 8 microg/ml, and that for fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. the mic(90)s for the bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for b. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides distasonis, and bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. telithromycin mics for the b. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than abt-773 mics. for all strains, abt-773 was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.
the short-term effect of apically repositioned flap surgery on the composition of the subgingival microbiota.
the purpose of this investigation was to examine the short-term effect of apically repositioned flap surgery on clinical and microbiologic parameters in patients with adult periodontitis. a total of 11 patients with moderate to advanced periodontitis received apically repositioned flap surgery. subjects were monitored during a 3-month pretreatment phase, the baseline surgical phase, and for 3 months post-surgery. clinical assessments including plaque accumulation, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth, and attachment level were made at 6 sites per tooth. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 29 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the mean levels and percentage of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) were computed for each subject at each visit. after surgery, there was a significant decrease in mean pocket depth and percentage of sites exhibiting gingival redness. significant decreases were seen in the percentage of sites that had attachment levels < 4 mm, with a significant increase in the percentage of sites with attachment levels of 4 to 6 mm after therapy. the mean total dna probe count for all bacterial species was significantly decreased by both scaling and root planing and surgical therapy. p gingivalis and b forsythus, 2 bacteria previously shown to be susceptible to mechanical therapy, exhibited statistically significant decreases in mean total dna probe count. because surgical therapy decreased levels of the suspected periodontal pathogens c rectus, p nigrescens, and c gracilis, it may be speculated that there was a potential added beneficial effect of surgery on the periodontal microbiota.
effects of ascorbic acid depletion and supplementation on periodontal health and  subgingival microflora in humans.
this study describes the relationship between varying ascorbate intake, periodontal status, and subgingival microflora as part of a multidisciplinary investigation of ascorbic acid (aa) metabolism in young men housed for 13 weeks in a nutrition suite that provided controlled periods of ascorbic acid depletion and repletion. twelve medically healthy non-smoking men, aged 25 to 43 years, ate a rotating four-day diet adequate in all nutrients except ascorbic acid. following an initial baseline period during which the subjects received 250 mg aa/day, the subjects received 5 mg aa/day for a 32-day depletion period. eight of the 12 subjects participated in a subsequent 56-day repletion period designed to replace the reduced body aa pool slowly. plasma and leukocyte ascorbate levels, plaque index, gingival index, probing depths, and attachment level were monitored at the beginning and end of the depletion and repletion periods. subgingival plaque samples were obtained and examined for selected organisms by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. a uniform oral hygiene program was reinforced after each examination. ascorbate concentrations in plasma and leukocytes responded rapidly to changes in vitamin c intake. there were no significant changes in plaque accumulation, probing pocket depth, or attachment level during the study. in contrast, gingival bleeding increased significantly after the period of aa depletion and returned to baseline values after the period of aa repletion. however, no relationship could be demonstrated between either the presence or proportion of target periodontal micro-organisms and measures of bleeding or ascorbate levels.
evidence that porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis fimbriae function in adhesion to actinomyces viscosus.
porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis adheres to gram-positive bacteria, such as actinomyces viscosus, when colonizing the tooth surface. however, little is known of the adhesins responsible for this interaction. a series of experiments were performed to determine whether p. gingivalis fimbriae function in its coadhesion with a. viscosus. fimbriae typical of p. gingivalis were isolated from strain 2561 (atcc 33277) by the method of yoshimura et al. (f. yoshimura, k. takahashi, y. nodasaka, and t. suzuki, j. bacteriol. 160:949-957, 1984) in fractions enriched with a 40-kda subunit, the fimbrillin monomer, p. gingivalis-a. viscosus coaggregation was inhibited by purified rabbit antifimbrial immunoglobulin g (igg) at dilutions eightfold higher than those of preimmune igg, providing indirect evidence implicating p. gingivalis fimbriae in coadhesion. three types of direct binding assays further supported this observation. (i) mixtures of isolated p. gingivalis fimbriae and a. viscosus wvu627 cells were incubated for 1 h, washed vigorously with phosphate-buffered saline (ph 7.2), and subjected to electrophoresis. transblots onto nitrocellulose were probed with antifimbrial antiserum. fimbrillin labeled positively on these blots. no reaction occurred with the control protein, porcine serum albumin, when blots were exposed to anti-porcine serum albumin, (ii) a. viscosus cells incubated with p. gingivalis fimbriae were agglutinated only after the addition of antifimbrial antibodies. (iii) binding curves generated from an enzyme immunoassay demonstrated concentration-dependent binding of p. gingivalis fimbriae to a. viscosus cells. from these lines of evidence, p. gingivalis fimbriae appear to be capable of binding to a. viscosus and mediating the coadhesion of these species.
inhibitory effect of stannous fluoride and other commonly used antimicrobial agents on oral bacteria.
the purposes of this investigation were to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial effect of stannous fluoride (snf2) gel and other commonly used oral antimicrobial agents/products. the antibacterial inhibitory effect of the various agents was evaluated by their effect against oral plaque bacteria including strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus sobrinus, actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius. a lawn of the specific bacteria to be tested was placed onto blood agar plates. wells were then punched into the agar and each well was filled with 75 microliters of one of the antimicrobial products or control solutions. a positive control was a 0.12% chlorhexidine solution and a negative control was physiological saline. agar plates were incubated in an anaerobic chamber at 37 degrees c for 5-7 days. zones of inhibition in the lawn of bacteria were measured by a boley gauge. each experiment was performed in duplicate and mean zones of bacterial inhibition were determined. only 0.4% snf2 and 0.12% chlorhexidine were consistently more effective in inhibiting oral bacteria when compared with other commercial mouth rinses/agents which had any one of a variety of antimicrobial agents as ingredients (alpha = 0.05). this in vitro study demonstrates that stannous fluoride gel is as effective as chlorhexidine in inhibiting the growth of bacteria often found in dental plaque.
association of proteases of porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis with its adhesion to actinomyces viscosus.
p. gingivalis adheres to a. viscosus on mineral surfaces mimicking teeth. to study whether p. gingivalis proteases contribute to its binding, mutants of p. gingivalis deficient in proteases were compared with their parent strain and a p. gingivalis-type strain for their adherence to a. viscosus on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite by manipulating a radio-isotope binding assay. adherence of p. gingivalis 2561 to a. viscosus was studied by tests of the effects of incubation temperature and known inhibitors or promoters of proteases. controls were handled by the assay run in pbs buffer at 22 degrees c. two mutants deficient in trypsin-like protease were found to be deficient in adherence (% attachment relative to control: 3.2 +/- 0.1% and 11.2 +/- 0.4%), while a collagenase-deficient mutant had an adherence score (51.6 +/- 8.4) closer to that of the parent strain (75.6 +/- 7.2%). heating p. gingivalis at 70 degrees c decreased its subsequent adherence at 22 degrees c by 80%. adherence decreased by 60% when the assay was run at 4 degrees c, but increased by 70% at 37 degrees c. reducing agents (dithiothreitol, cysteine, and mercaptoethanol) enhanced p. gingivalis adherence by 50 to 60%. protease inhibitors (bzmd, sbti, tpck, tlck, cmps, pmsf) decreased adherence by 10 to 50%. also, hg2+ and zn2+ decreased adherence by 30 to 50%, and arginine decreased it by 50%. most of these effects on p. gingivalis adherence were statistically significant (p less than 0.05). analysis of these data suggests that p. gingivalis proteases may contribute to the cohesion of p. gingivalis and a. viscosus.
antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine in a controlled release delivery system.
chlorhexidine is widely used as a mouth rinse in the prevention and treatment of  periodontal diseases and dental caries. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine in a controlled release delivery system. the controlled release dispenser comprised a polymeric inner core matrix containing the medicament with an outer vinyl membrane controlling the drug release. the effect on the following bacteria was studied: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mutans, wolinella recta, bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, eikenella corrodens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. chlorhexidine-containing vinyl patches with a diameter of 5.5 mm were placed on blood agar plates containing the various bacteria. the plates were incubated aerobically or anaerobically at 37 degrees c for 24 h or longer, when appropriate, and examined for inhibition of bacterial growth. distinct zones of inhibition were seen surrounding all vinyl patches on all plates with all bacteria. thus, the vinyl dispenser appeared to be an effective vehicle for releasing chlorhexidine to a localized area such as the surface of a tooth, a periodontal pocket, or a root canal.
increased periodontal bone loss in temporarily b lymphocyte-deficient rats.
in order to study the role of t lymphocytes and b lymphocytes in the development  of marginal periodontitis, experiments were performed on specific-pathogen-free (spf) rats with various immunologic profiles. the study comprised nude (congenitally t lymphocyte-deficient), thymus-grafted nude (t-lymphocyte reconstituted), anti-mu treated (temporarily b lymphocyte-deficient), and normal rats. when they were 5 to 9 weeks old, some of the rats were inoculated with actinomyces viscosus. bacteroides gingivalis and a strain of oral spirochetes; 90 days later they were killed. a. viscosus and b. gingivalis colonized readily, but the spirochete strain could not be established permanently in the oral cavity of the rats, 95% of the inoculated rats raised serum igg or igm antibody against one or more of the microorganisms; nude rats tended to raise less antibody than the three other experimental groups. inoculated rats had significantly less periodontal bone support than controls. anti-mu treated inoculated rats had significantly less periodontal bone support than nude and normal rats, whereas no difference was found between normal, nude, and thymus-grafted rats. it is concluded that permanent t-lymphocyte deficiency did not interfere with the development of periodontal disease in this model, whereas a temporary and moderate reduction in b-lymphocyte numbers seemed to predispose for aggravation of periodontal bone loss.
fimbria-associated proteins of bacteroides loescheii pk1295 mediate intergeneric  coaggregations.
bacteroides loescheii pk1295 serves as a coaggregation bridge between streptococcus sanguis 34 and actinomyces israelii pk14, two gram-positive oral bacteria that are otherwise unable to coaggregate. whereas coaggregation with s. sanguis 34 is inhibited by lactose, no simple sugar was found that inhibited coaggregation with a. israelii pk14. coaggregation-defective (cog-) mutants of b. loescheii pk1295 were isolated for the purpose of identifying the surface components responsible for the interaction with each coaggregation partner. selection for spontaneously occurring cog- mutants gave rise to two phenotypic classes of mutants. type i lost the ability to coaggregate with s. sanguis 34, whereas type ii failed to coaggregate with either s. sanguis 34 or a. israelii pk14. purified fimbriae from the parent agglutinated cells of both partners, and agglutination with s. sanguis 34 was inhibited by lactose. denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis demonstrated the presence of both a 75- and a 43-kilodalton (kda) protein associated with parental fimbriae, but only a 43-kda protein was seen with fimbriae prepared from the type i mutant. neither polypeptide was found in similar preparations from the type ii mutants. our data suggest that coaggregation of b. loescheii pk1295 with both gram-positive partners is mediated by fimbria-associated proteins present on the surface of the gram-negative organism and that the 75- and 43-kda polypeptides are responsible for the recognition of s. sanguis 34 and a. israelii pk14 cells, respectively.
human neutrophil migration under agarose to bacteria associated with the development of gingivitis.
in clinically healthy gingiva and increasingly with the development of inflammation, neutrophils are found in the gingival tissues and sulcus. this study evaluated the relative ability of bacteria associated with gingival health and developing inflammation to stimulate this increase in neutrophil accumulation. dialyzed bacterial sonic extracts (be) in buffer and pooled human serum (phs) from pure cultures of streptococcus sanguis. actinomyces viscosus, a naeslundii, bacteroides intermedius, fusobacterium sp and veillonella sp were tested for stimulation of human neutrophil migration under agarose. in addition, fractions of s sanguis culture fluids (cfs) from sephadex g-10 chromatography were evaluated. all be solutions were incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees c and heat-inactivated prior to testing. all bes in buffer attracted neutrophils, with the greatest responses seen to s sanguis and b intermedius followed by a viscosus. migration to all bes in phs was greater than in buffer, suggesting that all bes are capable of generating serum chemoattractants. a viscosus be activated serum attractants to the greatest degree. cfs of s sanguis, a viscosus, and to a lesser degree, fusobacterium sp, also attracted neutrophils. evidence from [3h]fmlp competitive ligand-binding assays indicated that s sanguis cfs contained low molecular weight (less than 700) chemoattractants, which were probably formylmethionyl oligopeptide-like materials. of the bacteria associated with health, s sanguis and a viscosus appeared at least as able to generate chemoattractants during growth or with exposure to serum as bacteria associated with gingivitis. this observation suggests that these "healthy" bacteria, which are found in greater numbers with developing inflammation, may mediate increased neutrophil transmigration in early disease.
identification of bacteria in immunopathologic mechanisms of human dental pulp.
serial frozen sections from human dental pulp were used for the identification of oral bacteria in immunopathologic mechanisms. sera raised against actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, bacteroides gingivalis, and b. melaninogenicus ss. intermedius, commercial sera against human immunoglobulins, complement, and monoclonal antibodies against human t cells were used in a double-staining immunofluorescence technique. sections of dental pulp from normal teeth showed no penetration of bacteria or bacterial antigens and no signs of inflammation. a unique aspect of the present study was the demonstration that penetrating bacteria and bacterial antigens in the pulp of involved teeth were always associated with antibodies and frequently also with complement. a. viscosus has been found most frequently in complement-fixing immune complexes followed by b. gingivalis. a. naeslundii and b. melaninogenicus ss. intermedius were found only in complexes with antibodies. the involvement of plasma cells and t cells was also demonstrated. in the dental pulps of diseased teeth, cytotoxic and arthus type immunopathologic reactions occurred.
the maintenance of b-cell and t-cell function in frozen and stored human lymphocytes.
the objective of this study was to identify and test a convenient means for long-term storage of lymphocytes taken from clinically characterized patients without losing b- or t-cell function. accordingly, peripheral blood lymphocytes were frozen and stored, and portions of each sample were subsequently assayed for t-cell blastogenic response and b-cell jerne plaquing at various time intervals after freezing. a comparison of the cell counts of fresh and frozen cultures indicated that cell were recovered after freezing. furthermore, these cells showed no significant differences in (i) cell viability; (ii) blastogenic response to antigens of actinomyces maeslandii, bacteroides melaninogenicus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and tetanus toxoid; (iii) blastogenic response to phytohemagglutinin and pokeweed mitogen; and (iv) polyclonal b-cell response to pokeweed mitogen as measured by the direct jerne plaque assay. the retained blastogenic and plaquing responses seen in frozen cultures indicated the maintenance of both t-cell and b-cell function, respectively. this is the first reported demonstration of jerne plaquing of normal human lymphocytes after freezing. it appears that freezing techniques provide a means for repeating and extending both t- and b-cell assays using frozen stored portions of the same cell samples.
