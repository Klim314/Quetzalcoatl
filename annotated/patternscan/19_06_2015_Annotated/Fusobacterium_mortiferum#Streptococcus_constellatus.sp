TI  == multibacterial sepsis in an alcohol abuser with hepatic cirrhosis.
AB  == an alcohol abuser with hepatitis c developed multibacterial sepsis. his mean 100% alcohol intake reached 400 ml/day. in january 2001, he suddenly experienced fever (39 degrees c) with no other symptoms. one week later, he was admitted to our hospital and was subsequently diagnosed with sepsis associated with four species  of bacteria (streptococcus constellatus, fusobacterium mortiferum, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and non-spore-forming anaerobic gram-positive bacillus). a drip infusion of imipenem/cilastatin was administrated, resulting in a successful therapeutic outcome. no underlying disorder was found except for gastric ulcers and hepatic cirrhosis. damaged gastric mucosa was assumed to be the possible cause and route for the bacterial invasion.
