study of lactic acid bacteria community from raw milk of iranian one humped camel and evaluation of their probiotic properties.
background: camel milk is amongst valuable food sources in iran. on the other hand, due to the presence of probiotic bacteria and bacteriocin producers in camel milk, probiotic bacteria can be isolated and identified from this food product. objectives: the objectives of the present research were the isolation and molecular identification of lactic acid bacteria from camel milk and evaluation of their probiotic properties. materials and methods: a total of ten samples of camel milk were collected from the golestan province of iran under aseptic conditions. bacteria were isolated by culturing the samples on selective medium. isolates were identified by amplification of the 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer (its) region between the 16s and 23s rrna genes by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and were then screened and grouped by the amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra) method. to evaluate probiotic properties, representative isolates of different ardra profiles were analyzed. the antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) against pediococcus pentosaceus, escherichia coli and bacillus cereus was examined by the agar diffusion assay. acid and bile tolerance of isolates were evaluated. results: a total of 64 isolates were analyzed based on biochemical tests and morphological characteristics. the most frequently isolated lab was enterococci. weissella, leuconostoc, lactobacilli and pediococci were less frequently found. based on restriction analysis of the its, the isolates were grouped into nine different ardra patterns that were identified by ribosomal dna sequencing as p. pentosaceus, enterococcus faecium strain y-2, e. faecium strain jz1-1, e. faecium strain e6, e. durans, e. lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus casei and weissella cibaria. the results showed that antimicrobial activity of the tested isolates was remarkable and p. pentosaceus showed the most antibacterial activity. in addition, e. durans, e. lactis, l. casei and p. pentosaceus were selected as probiotic bacteria. conclusions: this study revealed the presence of bacteriocin-producing bacteria and probiotic bacteria in camel milk from the golestan province of iran.
lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria-inhibited staphylococcus epidermidis.
introduction: lactic acid bacteria (lab) and bifidobacteria are able to produce antimicrobial compounds to inhibit opportunisticwounding skin pathogen. the antimicrobial compounds produced are organic acids, putative bacteriocin, hydrogen peroxide, and diacetyl. staphylococcus epidermidis is well-known as an opportunistic wounding skin pathogen in wound infections related to implanted medical devices. objective: to screen 87 strains of lab and 3 strains of bifidobacteria for antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus epidermidis.additionally, this study sought to determine and quantify types of antimicrobial compounds produced by lab. materials and methods: inhibitory activity of lab and bifidobacteria on s. epidermidis was assessed with the spectrophotometric method using a 96-well microplate reader. characterization of cell-free supernatant (cfs) was done using analytical methods. lactobacillus fermentum (collected by the bioprocess department at the universiti sains malaysia [bd]) 1912d, lactobacillus casei bd 1415b, lactobacillus fermentum bd 8313a, pediococcus pentosaceus bd 1913b, and weissella cibaria (collected by the food technology department at the universiti sains malaysia [ftdc]) 8643 with high percentage of inhibition (p < 0.05), ranging from 73.7% to 88.2%, as compared to the control, were selected for subsequent analyses. upon neutralization, the antimicrobial activity showed a drastic drop (p < 0.05) in the percentage of inhibition. concentrations of the inhibitive metabolites were produced in varying amounts and were strain dependent. results: results demonstrated that lactic acid in all strains was produced in a more predominant amount than acetic acid. protein concentration production ranged from 0.081-0.215 mg/ml. l. fermentum bd 1912d yielded as much as 0.014 mg/ml hydrogen peroxide, which was significantly higher than other strains studied. diacetyl was produced in a higher concentration by weissella cibaria ftdc 8643 at 2.884 ng/ml; the lowest concentration of 0.465 ng/ml was produced by ped. pentosaceus bd 1913b. conclusion: antimicrobial metabolites from cfs of lactic acid bacteria were effective in repressing the growth of opportunistic wounding dermal pathogen staphylococcus epidermidis.
