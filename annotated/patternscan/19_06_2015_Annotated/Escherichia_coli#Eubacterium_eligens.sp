TI  == mutagenic activation of biliary metabolites of 1-nitropyrene by intestinal microflora.
AB  == to investigate the modifying role of intestinal microflora in the metabolism of chemical carcinogens in vivo, we subjected bile from fischer rats treated per os  with chemical carcinogens and related compounds to a mutagenicity assay in the presence and absence of a cell-free extract from human feces. a mixture of the bile sample and potassium phosphate buffer was incubated in the presence or absence of human cell-free fecal extract and then further incubated with a bacterial suspension of salmonella typhimurium tester strains ta98 or ta100. bile from rats treated with 1-nitropyrene (1-np) produced about 2700 and 400 revertants per plate in strain ta98 in the presence and absence of the fecal extract, respectively. there was a drug dose- and bile volume-related response. treatment of 1-np-bile with beta-glucuronidase, but not aryl sulfatase, enhanced  its mutagenicity. cell-free extracts of some strains of intestinal bacteria (bacteroides fragilis atcc 12044, b. vulgatus atcc 8482, b. thetaiotaomicron atcc 12290, bacteroides sp. strain 524, eubacterium eligens vpi c15-48, peptostreptococcus sp. strain 204 and escherichia coli a-5-18) also enhanced the  mutagenicity of 1-np-bile. these bacterial cell-free extracts hydrolyzed the synthetic beta-d-glucuronides of phenolphthalein and/or p-nitrophenol. these data indicate that the glucuronide(s) of 1-np-metabolite(s) secreted into bile can be  hydrolyzed in the intestine by bacterial beta-glucuronidases to potent mutagenic  aglycone(s).
