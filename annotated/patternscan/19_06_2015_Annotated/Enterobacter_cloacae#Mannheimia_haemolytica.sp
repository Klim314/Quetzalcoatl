TI  == enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonadaceae on the dorsum of the human tongue.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to correlate the presence of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonadaceae, moraxellaceae and xanthomonadaceae on the posterior dorsum of the human tongue with the presence of tongue coating, gender, age, smoking habit and denture use. material and methods: bacteria were isolated  from the posterior tongue dorsum of 100 individuals in macconkey agar medium and  were identified by the api 20e system (biolab-merieux). results: 43% of the individuals, presented the target microorganisms on the tongue dorsum, with greater prevalence among individuals between 40 and 50 years of age (p = 0.001) and non-smokers (p=0.0485). conclusions: a higher prevalence of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonadaceae was observed on the tongue dorsum of the  individuals evaluated. there was no correlation between these species and the presence and thickness of tongue coating, gender and presence of dentures.

TI  == susceptibility of phagocytes from elk, deer, bighorn sheep, and domestic sheep to pasteurella haemolytica cytotoxins.
AB  == alveolar macrophages and peripheral blood neutrophils from elk (cervus elaphus),  bighorn sheep (ovis canadensis canadensis), and domestic sheep were exposed to culture supernatants from pasteurella haemolytica isolated from bighorn sheep and domestic sheep. in a second experiment, peripheral blood neutrophils from mule deer (odocoileus hemionus), elk, and bighorn sheep were exposed to culture supernatants from p. haemolytica isolated from elk, bighorn sheep and domestic sheep. alveolar macrophages from elk, bighorn sheep and domestic sheep were resistant to killing by p. haemolytica supernatants from bighorn sheep and domestic sheep; susceptibility of neutrophils to cell death, as measured by release of lactate dehydrogenase, differed significantly (p < 0.05) between the four species tested. bighorn sheep and domestic sheep neutrophils were susceptible to cytotoxin damage by the p. haemolytica isolates used; bighorn sheep neutrophils were four- to eight-fold more susceptible to cytotoxin damage than domestic sheep neutrophils. neutrophils from deer and elk were resistant to  killing by p. haemolytica cytotoxins from any species tested.
