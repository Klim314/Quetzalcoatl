TI  - Gemella parahaemolysans sp. nov. and Gemella taiwanensis sp. nov., isolated from  human clinical specimens.
AB  - Four Gram-staining-positive, catalase-negative, coccoid isolates, designated NTUH_1465(T), NTUH_2196, NTUH_4957 and NTUH_5572(T), were isolated from human specimens. The four isolates displayed more than 99.6% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Gemella haemolysans ATCC 10379(T), and 96.7 to 98.6% similarity with Gemella sanguinis ATCC 700632(T), Gemella morbillorum ATCC 27824(T) or Gemella cuniculi CCUG 42726(T). However, phylogenetic analysis of concatenated sequences of three housekeeping genes, groEL, rpoB and recA, suggested that the four isolates were distinct from G. haemolysans ATCC 10379(T) and other species. Isolates NTUH_2196, NTUH_4957 and NTUH_5572(T) clustered together and formed a stable monophyletic clade. DNA-DNA hybridization values among strains NTUH_1465(T) and NTUH_5572(T) and their phylogenetically related neighbours were all lower than 49%. The four isolates could be distinguished from G. haemolysans and other species by phenotypic characteristics. Based on the phylogenetic and phenotypic results, two novel species Gemella parahaemolysans sp. nov. (type strain NTUH_1465(T) = BCRC 80365(T) = JCM 18067(T)) and Gemella taiwanensis sp. nov. (type strain NTUH_5572(T) = BCRC 80366(T) = JCM 18066(T)) are proposed.
TI  - [Pleural empyema due to Gemella spp: report of 12 cases].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gemella genus bacteria can produce localized or generalized severe infections, but very rarely they have been described as causing pulmonary infections or pleural empyemas. AIM: To characterize patients with empyema caused by Gemella genus bacteria. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The database of a Microbiology laboratory of a Spanish hospital was reviewed, searching for Gemella positive cultures of pleural effusions in a period of five years. RESULTS: We identified 12 patients (11 males) with Gemella spp pleural empyema. Eight were infected with G. haemolysans and four with G. morbillorum. All patients had predisposing factors such as poor oral hygiene, smoking, chronic cardiovascular or respiratory disease, alcoholism or malignancies. In ten cases, a thoracic drainage tube was placed with fibrinolysis in seven. One patient needed surgery because of a relapse of the empyema. Two patients died because of an advanced neoplasm, and the empyema was resolved in the rest. CONCLUSIONS: Gemella pleural empyema can occur and its isolation must not be seen as a contamination.
TI  - Comparison of oral microbiota in tumor and non-tumor tissues of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections have been linked to malignancies due to their ability to induce chronic inflammation. We investigated the association of oral bacteria in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC/tumor) tissues and compared with adjacent non-tumor mucosa sampled 5 cm distant from the same patient (n = 10). By using culture-independent 16S rRNA approaches, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and cloning and sequencing, we assessed the total bacterial diversity in these clinical samples. RESULTS: DGGE fingerprints showed variations in the band intensity profiles within non-tumor and tumor tissues of the same patient and among the two groups. The clonal analysis indicated that from a total of 1200 sequences characterized, 80 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected representing six phyla, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Actinobacteria and uncultivated TM7 in non-tumor and tumor libraries. In combined library, 12 classes, 16 order, 26 families and 40 genera were observed. Bacterial species, Streptococcus sp. oral taxon 058, Peptostreptococcus stomatis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus gordonii, Gemella haemolysans, Gemella morbillorum, Johnsonella ignava and Streptococcus parasanguinis I were highly associated with tumor site where as Granulicatella adiacens was prevalent at non-tumor site. Streptococcus intermedius was present in 70% of both non-tumor and tumor sites. CONCLUSIONS: The underlying changes in the bacterial diversity in the oral mucosal tissues from non-tumor and tumor sites of OSCC subjects indicated a shift in bacterial colonization. These most prevalent or unique bacterial species/phylotypes present in tumor tissues may be associated with OSCC and needs to be further investigated with a larger sample size.
TI  - The subgingival microbiota of Papillon-Lefevre syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is little information about the microbiologic profiles of periodontal lesions in Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS) and the significance of bacteria in the pathogenesis of periodontitis in these patients. This comprehensive analysis of the subgingival microbiota in patients with PLS used 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) clonal analysis and the 16S rRNA-based Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: Thirteen patients with PLS from seven unrelated families volunteered for this microbiologic study. Subgingival plaque was collected with sterile paper points from multiple sites with >/=5 mm probing depth, and whole genomic DNA was extracted. The 16S rRNA genes were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. The samples were then probed for approximately 300 predominant oral bacterial species using the HOMIM. RESULTS: The most commonly detected phylotypes in the clonal analysis were Gemella morbillorum, Gemella haemolysans, Granulicatella adiacens, Lachnospiraceae OT 100 (EI074), Parvimonas micra, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. As a group, streptococci were commonly detected in these individuals. In the HOMIM analysis, a total of 170 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected, with a range of 40 to 80 species per patient with PLS. Of these, 12 bacterial species were detected in medium to high levels in >/=50% of the individuals. The high-frequency strains were clustered into eight groups: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter spp., Capnocytophaga granulosa, G. morbillorum, P. micra, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Streptococcus spp., and Tannerella forsythia. CONCLUSIONS: The subgingival microbiota in PLS is diverse. Periodontal pathogens commonly associated with chronic and aggressive periodontitis and opportunistic pathogens may be associated with the development of severe periodontitis in patients with PLS.
TI  - Use of groESL as a target for identification of Abiotrophia, Granulicatella, and  Gemella species.
AB  - We determined the groESL sequences of three species of nutritionally variant streptococci (Abiotrophia defectiva, Granulicatella adiacens, and Granulicatella elegans) and three Gemella species (Gemella morbillorum, Gemella haemolysans, and Gemella sanguinis). The nucleotide sequence similarities between the groES and groEL genes of the above genera were 41.7 to 85.9% and 63.7 to 84.3%, respectively. The intraspecies similarities of groESL sequences for the isolates of Abiotrophia and Granulicatella species were 94.4 to 97.8% for groES and 94.0 to 98.2% for groEL. For Ge. morbillorum and Ge. sanguinis, all strains showed the same groESL spacer length (8 bp), and sequence identities within species were >97.8% for groES and >96.1% for groEL. However, higher intraspecies heterogeneity was observed in Ge. haemolysans. Phylogenetic analysis of groEL sequences separated the 6 isolates of Ge. haemolysans into two subgroups. Among these isolates, three isolates with the same groESL spacer region length (45 bp) clustered together but were distant from the ATCC reference strain (with a spacer length of 8 bp). The remaining three isolates, with a spacer length of 50 or 8 bp, clustered together. Although 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis did not provide enough discrimination for the 6 Ge. haemolysans isolates, rpoB gene sequence analysis supported the subgrouping. Based on the obtained groESL sequences, we developed a multiplex PCR that enables simple, rapid, and accurate identification of Abiotrophia, Granulicatella, and Gemella at the genus level. This assay would be helpful for identifying these fastidious and slow-growing organisms in clinical laboratories.
TI  - Gemella species-associated late-onset endophthalmitis after trabeculectomy with adjunctive mitomycin C.
AB  - PURPOSE: To report 2 cases of delayed-onset, bleb-related endophthalmitis induced by Gemella species. METHODS: Interventional case report. RESULTS: Two patients developed bleb-related ocular infection attributable to Gemella haemolysans and Gemella morbillorum after trabeculectomy with adjunctive mitomycin C. Both patients had thin-walled cystic filtering blebs before ocular infection. One patient underwent urgent vitrectomy with intravitreal injection of ceftazidime and vancomycin. The other received an intraocular injection of vancomycin and ceftazidime. After surgical intervention, 2 cases were administered topical levofloxacin and sulfobenzylpenicillin, and intravenous cefpirome. The DNA from the microorganism was sequenced and identified as G. haemolysans and G. morbillorum. CONCLUSIONS: Gemella species should be added to the long list of organisms that may rarely cause bleb-associated endophthalmitis.
TI  - Pulmonary nodules associated with Gemella bacteremia: CT findings in two children with osteosarcoma.
AB  - Gemella morbillorum and Gemella haemolysans are normal oral flora that can also be pathogenic. We report 2 cases of adolescents with osteosarcoma who developed multiple pulmonary nodules associated with Gemella bacteremia. These nodules mimicked metastatic disease. To our knowledge, this manifestation of Gemella infection has not been previously reported. In the setting of malignancy, infectious pulmonary nodules must be distinguished from metastatic nodules in order to treat appropriately.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of macrolide and tetracycline resistances in commensal Gemella sp. isolates.
AB  - The epidemiologic relatedness of 29 erythromycin-resistant Gemella sp. strains from normal flora, characterized previously, were evaluated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Three isolates carried the tet(O) gene and the tet(M) gene. The msr(A) gene was found in two Gemella morbillorum strains in combination with the erm(B) or mef(E) gene. The sequences of the mef(A/E), erm(B), and msr(A) genes showed a high similarity to the corresponding sequences of other gram-positive cocci. All the strains harboring the mef(A/E) gene and the msr(D) gene possessed open reading frame 3 (ORF3)/ORF6. The 16 G. morbillorum isolates represented 15 distinct DNA profiles. Four clusters were identified (>or=80% genetic relatedness). The 12 Gemella haemolysans strains belonged to different PFGE types. The clonal diversity found suggests that horizontal transfer may be the main route through which erythromycin resistance is acquired.
TI  - Gemella bacteraemia characterised by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.
AB  - AIMS: To define epidemiology, clinical disease, and outcome of gemella bacteraemia by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. To examine the usefulness of the Vitek, API, and ATB systems in identifying two gemella species. METHODS: All alpha haemolytic streptococci other than Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from blood cultures during a six year period were identified by conventional biochemical methods, the Vitek system, and the API system. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on all isolates identified by both kits as gemella with >or= 95% confidence or by either kit as any bacterial species with < 95% confidence. The ATB expression system was used to identify the two isolates that were defined as gemella species by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. RESULTS: Of the 302 alpha haemolytic streptococci other than S pneumoniae isolated, one was identified as Gemella morbillorum, and another as Gemella haemolysans by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The patient with monomicrobial G morbillorum bacteraemia was a 66 year old man with community acquired infective endocarditis with septic thromboemboli. The patient with G haemolysans bacteraemia was a 41 year old woman with hospital acquired polymicrobial bacteraemia during the neutropenic period of an autologous bone marrow transplant for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the first case of its kind in the English literature. The API and ATB expression systems only identified the second strain as G haemolysans at 94% and 99% confidence, respectively, whereas the Vitek system identified none of the two strains correctly at > 70% confidence. CONCLUSIONS: Gemella bacteraemia is uncommon. 16S rRNA gene sequencing is the method of choice for identification of gemella and gemella-like isolates.
TI  - Characterization of a Gemella-like organism isolated from an abscess of a rabbit: description of Gemella cunicula sp. nov.
AB  - An unknown Gram-positive, catalase-negative, ovoid-shaped bacterium isolated from the submandibular abscess of a rabbit was subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic analysis. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated the unknown coccus represents a new subline within the genus Gemella. The unknown isolate was readily distinguished from other recognized members of the genus Gemella, namely Gemella haemolysans, Gemella bergeri, Gemella morbillorum, Gemella palaticanis and Gemella sanguinis, by biochemical tests and electrophoretic analysis of whole-cell proteins. Based on both phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium is classified in the genus Gemella as Gemella cuniculi sp. nov. The type strain is CCUG 42726T.
TI  - Immunoglobulin A1 protease activity in Gemella haemolysans.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the occurrence and nature of immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) protease activity in members of the genus Gemella and related taxa. Among a total of 22 Gemella strains belonging to the four species Gemella haemolysans, Gemella morbillorum, Gemella sanguinis, and Gemella bergeriae and four reference strains of the species Helcococcus kunzii, Facklamia hominis, and Globicatella sanguinis, IgA1 protease activity was an exclusive character of all nine isolates of G. haemolysans. The IgA1 protease of G. haemolysans appears to be a metallo-type IgA1 protease that cleaves the Pro(227)-Thr(228) peptide bond in the hinge region of the alpha1 chain like that of several Streptococcus species. Phenotypic characterization of the isolates demonstrates that screening for IgA1 protease activity provides a valuable means for species differentiation in this group of bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of a Gemella-like organism from the oral cavity of a dog: description of Gemella palaticanis sp. nov.
AB  - A hitherto unknown Gram-positive, catalase-negative, facultatively anaerobic coccus isolated from a vesicle on the gum of a dog was characterized by phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies demonstrated that the isolate represents a new subline within the genus Gemella. The unknown bacterium was readily distinguished from all currently described members of this genus, Gemella haemolysans, Gemella bergeri, Gemella morbillorum and Gemella sanguinis, by biochemical tests and electrophoretic analysis of whole-cell proteins. On the basis of phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium be classified as Gemella palaticanis sp. nov. The type strain of Gemella palaticanis is CCUG 39489T.
TI  - Description of Gemella sanguinis sp. nov., isolated from human clinical specimens.
AB  - Six strains of a hitherto undescribed gram-positive, catalase-negative, facultatively anaerobic coccus isolated from human sources were characterized by phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies demonstrated that the unknown strains were genealogically identical and constitute a new subline within the genus Gemella. The unknown bacterium was readily distinguished from Gemella haemolysans, Gemella bergeriae, and Gemella morbillorum by biochemical tests and electrophoretic analysis of whole-cell proteins. Based on phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium be classified as Gemella sanguinis sp. nov. The type strain is CCUG 37820(T).
TI  - Molecular identification of Gemella species from three patients with endocarditis.
AB  - Gemella morbillorum and Gemella haemolysans are opportunistic pathogens which cause endocarditis and other severe infections. We report on three patients with endocarditis, one with endocarditis caused by G. haemolysans and two with endocarditis caused by G. morbillorum. The paucity of reports concerning these bacteria is probably related to the difficulties associated with their identification. For example, one of the strains reported in this study was originally sent to our laboratory with a preliminary characterization as a short "gram-negative" coccobacillus, highlighting the specific problem associated with Gram staining of these bacteria. The usefulness of 16S rRNA gene amplification, partial sequencing, and comparison of the nucleotide sequence to those in databases when standard phenotypic identification schemes are not helpful is emphasized. We also suggest that the use of simple tests, such as testing susceptibility to vancomycin for gram-negative bacteria and colistin for gram-positive bacteria, could prevent misinterpretation of Gram staining in gram-variable bacteria such as Gemella spp.
TI  - Gemella bergeriae sp. nov., isolated from human clinical specimens.
AB  - Six strains of a hitherto-undescribed gram-positive, catalase-negative, facultatively anaerobic coccus from human sources were characterized by phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies demonstrated that the unknown strains are genealogically homogeneous and constitute a new subline within the genus Gemella. The unknown bacterium was readily distinguished from Gemella haemolysans, the type species of the genus Gemella, and from Gemella morbillorum by biochemical tests and electrophoretic analysis of whole-cell proteins. On the basis of phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium from clinical specimens be classified as Gemella bergeriae sp. nov. The type strain of G. bergeriae is CCUG 37817 (= strain 617-93).
TI  - Atmospheric growth requirements for Alloiococcus species and related gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The growth of Alloiococcus otitis under different atmospheres and nutritional conditions was studied. The growth rates of 25 strains of gram-positive cocci representing five genera on heart infusion agar plates containing 5% rabbit blood and on brucella agar plates with and without sheep blood under aerobic, increased CO2, and anaerobic atmospheres were compared. Eight strains of alloiococci plated on heart infusion agar with rabbit blood and on brucella sheep blood agar grew under aerobic and candle jar atmospheres. Two of these strains showed poor anaerobic growth after 7 days. Strains of Aerococcus viridans, Aerococcus urinae, Helcococci kunzi, Dolosigranulum pigrum, Gemella haemolysans, and Gemella morbillorum grew well under all three atmospheres and on the three types of media and in thioglycolate broth. These results confirm all the aerobic atmospheric requirements for Alloiococcus strains and show that aerobic growth characteristics help distinguish the alloiococci from the other gram-positive cocci that are facultatively anaerobic.
TI  - Gram-positive cocci isolated from slaughtered poultry.
AB  - Gram-positive cocci were found in all meat samples of poultry slaughtered and processed for retail sale, at incidence rates ranging from 10(2) CFU/ml to 1.35 x 10(6) CFU/ml and a mode between 8 x 10(5) and 9 x 10(5) CFU/ml for 75% of the samples. The 93 isolated strains were identified as belonging to the following species: Enterococcus faecalis (48 strains), E. faecium (16), E. avium (7), E. durans (4), Aerococcus viridans (10), Streptococcus morbillorum (2), S. salivarius (1), S. sanguis (1), S. "milleri" (1), S. pneumoniae (1), S. acidominimus (1), and Gemella haemolysans (1). These species, which mainly colonize the intestinal tract, but may also be found in other parts of both the human and animal body, are pathogens or potentially such. Their presence is an indication of the fecal contamination of meat processed following gutting of slaughtered chickens (endogenous contamination). A count of the Gram-positive cocci and enterobacteria detected showed that enterococci were present in a far greater number than coliform bacteria.
TI  - Phylogenetic relationship of Gemella morbillorum to Gemella haemolysans.
AB  - Partial 16S rRNA gene sequences (16S rDNA) of Gemella morbillorum and Gemella haemolysans were determined by sequencing polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA. A phylogenetic analysis of 53 eubacterial 16S rRNA sequences grouped the gemellae on a distinct branch separate from the 18 members of the genus Streptococcus. DNA-DNA hybridization results indicate that the two gemellae are related at the genus level but are not a single species.
TI  - Endovascular infection and septic arthritis caused by Gemella morbillorum.
AB  - Streptococcus morbillorum was transferred to the genus Gemella in 1988. Infections caused by G. morbillorum are unusual. We report a case of endovascular infection and presumptive septic arthritis caused by G. morbillorum. Previous cases of infection caused by G. morbillorum and G. haemolysans are reviewed.
TI  - Endocarditis caused by Gemella haemolysans.
AB  - Gemella haemolysans, a coccus related to the "Streptococcaceae", was isolated from the blood of a patient with endocarditis. The patient was successfully treated with a combination of penicillin G and tobramycin, followed by clindamycin. The taxonomy of this organism, especially its relationship to "Streptococcus morbillorum" is discussed and previously reported cases of Gemella infections are reviewed.
TI  - Differentiation of Gemella haemolysans (Thjotta and Boe 1938) Berger 1960, from Streptococcus morbillorum (Prevot 1933) Holdeman and Moore 1974.
AB  - Recently, G. haemolysans and S. morbillorum were postulated to be identical organisms, so that consequently their names were synonyms. In the present paper it was demonstrated, that, in spite of many similarities, both species can be differentiated by nitrite reduction, lacking in S. morbillorum, and some further enzymatic activities as well as by antigenic specificity and certain dissimilarities in morphology, growth conditions and their ability to induce beta-hemolysis. S. morbillorum apparently represents a group of strains with divergent properties and might be assigned to the genus Gemella rather than to Streptococcus.
TI  - Effects of dietary chlortetracycline on the antimicrobial resistance of porcine faecal streptococcaceae.
AB  - Breeding pigs and one-half of their progeny were fed antimicrobial-free rations;  the other half of the progeny received rations supplemented with 100 g of chlortetracycline (Ctc)/ton. Effects of dietary Ctc with respect to the distribution of species and biotypes of faecal Gram-positive cocci and their relative resistance to 12 antimicrobial agents were studied. Diversity of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns and modal AMR patterns were determined for bacterial species common to all three groups. Numerical taxonomic analysis placed 1140 of 1150 isolates (99%) into 10 groups. Three of these were biotypes of Streptococcus faecium and contained the largest number of isolates (n = 934, 81%). Streptococcus faecalis, Strep. morbillorum, Pediococcus halophilus and Gemella haemolysans also were isolated. Generally, the proportion of tetracycline-resistant strains for a species or biotype was greater from pigs fed Ctc, although differences were not significant (P greater than 0.05). There was a significant difference (P less than 0.05) among all the groups for the percentage of penicillin-resistant strains in a biotype of Strep. faecium. Overall, 57 and 43 different AMR patterns, including 2 to 11 and 1 to 11 resistance determinants, were demonstrated in isolates from control pigs and pigs fed Ctc, respectively. Modal AMR patterns in species and biotypes were the same from both progeny groups, except for Strep. faecium. AMR pattern diversity was decreased for strains from pigs fed Ctc. Similar proportions of resistant strains from each group of progeny pigs were accompanied by decreased AMR pattern diversity in strains from pigs fed Ctc. These results indicated a change in distribution of AMR phenotypical patterns, rather than a change in overall frequency of individual resistant phenotypes.
