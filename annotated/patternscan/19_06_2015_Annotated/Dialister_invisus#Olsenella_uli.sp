TI  == the microbiota of acute apical abscesses.
AB  == as the breadth of bacterial diversity in the oral cavity has been deciphered by molecular studies, several newly identified species/phylotypes have emerged as potential pathogens. we hypothesized that many of these species/phylotypes could  also be involved with the etiology of endodontic abscesses. abscess aspirates from 42 persons were analyzed for the presence of 81 species/phylotypes by means  of a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. associations between the most frequently detected taxa were calculated. the most prevalent taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, and porphyromonas endodontalis. other  frequently found taxa included olsenella uli, streptococci, eikenella corrodens,  some as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes (bacteroidetes clone x083 and synergistes clone ba121), and newly named species (prevotella baroniae and dialister invisus). several positive bacterial associations were disclosed. findings not only strengthen the association of many cultivable species with abscesses, but also include some newly named species and uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with this disease.

TI  == detection of novel oral species and phylotypes in symptomatic endodontic infections including abscesses.
AB  == this study was undertaken to investigate the occurrence of several uncultivated phylotypes and newly named bacterial species in symptomatic endodontic infections. samples taken from cases clinically diagnosed as acute periradicular  abscesses or acute periradicular periodontitis were surveyed for the presence of  12 taxa by means of a 16s rrna-gene-based nested or hemi-nested pcr assay. the most prevalent of the target taxa were dialister invisus, olsenella uli, granulicatella adiacens, and synergistes clones ba121 and e3_33. findings revealed that novel phylotypes and newly named species can take part in the microbiota associated with symptomatic endodontic infections and a pathogenetic role is suspected.

TI  == uncultivated phylotypes and newly named species associated with primary and persistent endodontic infections.
AB  == endodontic infections have been traditionally studied by culture methods, but recent reports showing that over 50% of the oral microbiota is still uncultivable (b. j. paster et al., j. bacteriol. 183:3770-3783, 2001) raise the possibility that many endodontic pathogens remain unknown. this study intended to investigate the prevalence of several uncultivated oral phylotypes, as well as newly named species in primary or persistent endodontic infections associated with chronic periradicular diseases. samples were taken from the root canals of 21 untreated teeth and 22 root-filled teeth, all of them with radiographic evidence of periradicular bone destruction. genomic dna was isolated directly from each sample, and 16s rrna gene-based nested or heminested pcr assays were used to determine the presence of 13 species or phylotypes of bacteria. species-specific  primers had already been validated in the literature or were developed by aligning closely related 16s rrna gene sequences. species specificity for each primer pair was confirmed by running pcrs against a panel of several oral bacteria and by sequencing dna from representative positive samples. all species  or phylotypes were detected in at least one case of primary infections. the most  prevalent species or phylotypes found in primary infections were dialister invisus (81%), synergistes oral clone ba121 (33%), and olsenella uli (33%). of the target bacteria, only these three species were detected in persistent infections. detection of uncultivated phylotypes and newly named species in infected root canals suggests that there are previously unrecognized bacteria that may play a role in the pathogenesis of periradicular diseases.
