TI  == prevalence, species distribution and antimicrobial resistance patterns of methicillin-resistant staphylococci in lithuanian pet animals.
AB  == background: the bacterial genus staphylococcus consists of many species that causes infections in pet animals. antimicrobial resistant staphylococci cause infections that are difficult to treat and they are important from the point of one health perspective. the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus (mrs) species, including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) in diseased pet animals (group a) and kennel dogs (group b) in lithuania and to characterize the isolates according to  their antimicrobial resistance. results: twenty-one mrs isolates were obtained from 395 clinical samples (5.3 %; ci 95 % 3.5-8.0) of group a animals. sixteen, four and one isolates were from dogs, cats and a pet rabbit, respectively. the meca gene was present in 20 isolates, whereas one isolate was positive for the mecc gene. twenty-one mrs isolates (20.0 %; ci 95 % 13.5-28.6) were obtained from the vagina of female dogs (n = 105) (group b). all isolates carried the meca gene. twelve mrs species were isolated of which s. pseudintermedius was the most  common (18/42) followed by s. haemolyticus (8/42) and s. lentus (4/42). mrsa was  not found. all mrs strains were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin  and quinupristin/dalfopristin. resistance to tetracycline (16/21), clindamycin (15/21) and erythromycin (14/21) was the most common types of resistance in group a animals. three isolates also demonstrated resistance to rifampin. resistance toward gentamicin (16/21), ciprofloxacin (15/21), macrolides (15/21) and tetracycline (12/21) was the most common in kennel dogs (group b). the most common genes encoding resistance to antimicrobials (excluding beta-lactams) in isolates from group a pets were tetk (21/42), aph(3')-iiia (11/42) and aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia (9/42). conclusions: a wide range of mrs species were found in pet animals in lithuania. mrsa was not found.

TI  == diversity and evolution of oligopeptide permease systems in staphylococcal species.
AB  == several oligopeptide permease (opp) systems have been found in staphylococcal species, including opp1-4, opp3' and the arginine catabolic mobile element (acme)-encoded opp system (acme-opp). they confer upon bacteria the increasing fitness, but their evolutionary histories remain unclear. in this work, we performed a genome-wide identification of opp systems in staphylococcal species.  novel opp systems were identified, including the duplicate of opp4 in staphylococcus pseudintermedius and the acme-opp-like systems in coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons). phylogenetic analysis revealed that all  of the identified opp systems were derived from opp3 system by operon duplication during species divergence, while lateral gene transfer might also confer to the dissemination of opp in staphylococci. in addition, we proposed an improved theory on evolution of acme: the opp and arginine-deiminase systems were firstly  transferred from staphylococcus haemolyticus to staphylococcus epidermidis independently; in s. epidermidis they were assembled together and then transferred to staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == rapid microarray-based identification of different meca alleles in staphylococci.
AB  == to screen isolates and to identify meca alleles, published meca sequences were analyzed, and a microarray for the rapid discrimination of meca alleles was designed. a genbank analysis yielded 135 full-length gene sequences annotated as  meca. these sequences clustered into 32 different alleles corresponding to 28 unique amino acid sequences and to 15 distinct hybridization patterns on this microarray. a collection of 78 clinical and veterinary isolates of staphylococcus spp. was characterized using this assay. nine of the 15 expected patterns, as well as one as-yet-unknown pattern, were identified. these patterns were detected in various epidemic methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains, in s. pseudintermedius, and in coagulase-negative species such as s. epidermidis, s. fleurettii, or s. haemolyticus. there was no correlation between the different meca hybridization patterns and the sccmec type. determination of mics showed that meca alleles corresponding to only four of these nine patterns were associated with beta-lactam resistance. the meca alleles that did not confer beta-lactam resistance were largely restricted to coagulase-negative staphylococci of animal origin, such as s. sciuri and s. vitulinus. because of the diversity of sequences and the different impact on beta-lactam susceptibility, the existence of different meca alleles needs to be taken into account when designing diagnostic assays for the detection of meca.

TI  == characterization of a new sccmec element in staphylococcus cohnii.
AB  == background: many sccmec elements of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) could not be typed using multiplex pcr. such a 'non-typable' sccmec was encountered in  a staphylococcus cohnii isolate. methodology/principal findings: the sccmec type  of methicillin-resistant s. cohnii clinical isolate wc28 could not be assigned using multiplex pcr. newly-designed primers were used to amplify ccra and ccrb genes. the whole sccmec was obtained by three overlapping long-range pcr, targeting regions from left-hand inverted repeat (irl) to ccra/b, from ccra/b to  meca and from meca to orfx. the region abutting irl was identified using inverse  pcr with self-ligated enzyme-restricted wc28 fragments as the template. wc28 sccmec had a class a mec gene complex (meci-mecr1-meca). the ccra and ccrb genes  were closest (89.7% identity) to ccra(shp) of staphylococcus haemolyticus strain  h9 and to ccrb3 (90% identity) of staphylococcus pseudintermedius strain km241, respectively. two new genes potentially encoding aaa-type atpase were found in j1 region and a psitn554 transposon was present in j2 region, while j3 region was the same as many sccmec of staphylococcus aureus. wc28 sccmec abutted an incomplete scc element with a novel allotype of ccrc, which was closest (82% identity) to ccrc1 allele 9 in staphylococcus saprophyticus strain atcc 15305. only two direct target repeat sequences, one close to the 3'-end of orfx and the  other abutting the left end of wc28 sccmec, could be detected. conclusions/significance: a new 35-kb sccmec was characterized in a s. cohnii isolate, carrying a class a mec gene complex, new variants of ccra5 and ccrb3 and two novel genes in the j1 region. this element is flanked by 8-bp perfect inverted repeats and is similar to type iii sccmec in s. aureus and a sccmec in s. pseudintermedius but with different j1 and j3 regions. wc28 sccmec was arranged in tandem with an additional scc element with ccrc, scc(wc28), but the two elements might have integrated independently rather than constituted a composite. this study adds new evidence of the diversity of sccmec in cons and highlights the need for characterizing the 'non-typable' sccmec to reveal the gene pool associated with meca.

TI  == aerobic bacteria from mucous membranes, ear canals, and skin wounds of feral cats in grenada, and the antimicrobial drug susceptibility of major isolates.
AB  == in a 2-year period 54 feral cats were captured in grenada, west indies, and a total of 383 samples consisting of swabs from rectum, vagina, ears, eyes, mouth,  nose and wounds/abscesses, were cultured for aerobic bacteria and campylobacters. a total of 251 bacterial isolates were obtained, of which 205 were identified to  species level and 46 to genus level. a commercial bacterial identification system (api/biomerieux), was used for this purpose. the most common species was escherichia coli (n=60), followed by staphylococcus felis/simulans (40), s. hominis (16), s. haemolyticus (12), streptococcus canis (9), proteus mirabilis (8), pasteurella multocida (7), streptococcus mitis (7), staphylococcus xylosus (7), s. capitis (6), s. chromogenes (4), s. sciuri (3), s. auricularis (2), s. lentus (2), s. hyicus (2), streptococcus suis (2) and pseudomonas argentinensis (2). sixteen other isolates were identified to species level. a molecular method  using 16s rrna sequencing was used to confirm/identify 22 isolates. salmonella or campylobacters were not isolated from rectal swabs. e. coli and s. felis/simulans together constituted 50% of isolates from vagina. s. felis/simulans was the most  common species from culture positive ear and eye samples. p. multocida was isolated from 15% of mouth samples. coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates from nose and wound swabs. staphylococcus aureus, or s. intemedius/s. pseudintermedius were not isolated from any sample. antimicrobial drug resistance was minimal, most isolates being susceptible to all drugs tested  against, including tetracycline.
