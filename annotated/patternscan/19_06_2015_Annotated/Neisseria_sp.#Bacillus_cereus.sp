TI  == differential identification of bacillus anthracis from environmental bacillus species using microarray analysis.
AB  == aims: to determine whether microarray analysis could be employed for the differential identification of a range of environmental bacillus sp. from four strains of bacillus anthracis. methods and results: oligonucleotide probes were designed that were specific to virulence factor genes of b. anthracis (pag, lef and cap), the variable number tandem repeat region of the b. anthracis vrra gene  and to the 16s-23s rrna intergenic transcribed spacer region (its) and pleiotropic regulator (plcr) regions of the bacillus cereus subgroup species. generic probes were also designed to hybridize with conserved regions of the 16s  rrna genes of bacillus (as a positive control), neisseria sp., pseudomonas sp., streptococcus sp., mycobacterium sp. and to all members of the enterobacteriaceae to allow simultaneous detection of these bacteria. identification of b. anthracis was found to rely entirely on hybridization of dna specific to regions of the pag, lef and cap genes. cross-reaction was observed between b. anthracis and other bacillus species with all the other bacillus probes tested. results obtained using microarray hybridizations were confirmed using conventional microbiological techniques and found to have very high comparability. conclusions: microarray-based assays are an effective method for the identification of b. anthracis from mixed-culture environmental samples without problems of false-positivity that have been observed with conventional pcr assays. significance and impact of the study: identification of environmental bacillus sp. by conventional pcr is prone to potential for reporting false-positives. this study provides a method for the exclusion of such isolates.

TI  == detection of bacterial dna in latin american patients with reactive arthritis by  polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis.
AB  == objective: bacteria and/or their antigens are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis (rea). polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using the 16s ribosomal rna-pcr method was used to identify bacterial dna in synovial fluid (sf) and tissue (st) in a well defined group of patients with chronic rea.  in addition, species found were identified by means of sequence analysis. methods: we examined 15 st and 5 sf samples of 15 patients with rea, 5 st samples of 5 patients with osteoarthritis (oa), and 8 sf from 8 patients with closed traumatic knee injuries using a nested pcr with universal 16s rrna primers. in addition, a nested pcr was developed to detect dna sequences of salmonella sp. and mycoplasma sp. automated sequencing and comparative data analysis (genbank) were also performed to identify the species. results: bacterial dna was identified in 8 cases, 5 st and 3 sf; chlamydia trachomatis (n = 2), pseudomonas  sp. (n = 3), and bacillus cereus (n = 2) were the most common microorganisms identified. a variety of microorganisms including clostridium sp., lactobacillus  sp., pseudomonas migulae, p. fluorescens, and p. putida, and neisseria meningitidis serogroup b were also identified. in half of the cases (4/8) 2 to 3  bacterial antigens were identified simultaneously. conclusion: bacterial dna is present in the joints in patients with chronic rea. a wide spectrum of bacteria including some not previously associated with rea were identified. further studies are needed to establish their exact role in the pathogenesis of rea and related arthritides.
