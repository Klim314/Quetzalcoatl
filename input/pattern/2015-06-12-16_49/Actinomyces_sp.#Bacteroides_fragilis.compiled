TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria in Ontario, 2010-2011.
AB  - The local epidemiology of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in anaerobic bacteria is important in guiding the empiric treatment of infections. However, susceptibility data are very limited on anaerobic organisms, particularly among non-Bacteroides organisms. To determine susceptibility profiles of clinically-significant anaerobic bacteria in Ontario Canada, anaerobic isolates from sterile sites submitted to Public Health Ontario Laboratory (PHOL) for identification and susceptibility testing were included in this study. Using the E-test method, isolates were tested for various antimicrobials including, penicillin, cefoxitin, clindamycin, meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and metronidazole. The MIC results were interpreted based on guidelines published by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Of 2527 anaerobic isolates submitted to PHOL, 1412 were either from sterile sites or bronchial lavage, and underwent susceptibility testing. Among Bacteroides fragilis, 98.2%, 24.7%, 1.6%, and 1.2% were resistant to penicillin, clindamycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and metronidazole, respectively. Clostridium perfringens was universally susceptible to penicillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and meropenem, whereas 14.2% of other Clostridium spp. were resistant to penicillin. Among Gram-positive anaerobes, Actinomyces spp., Parvimonas micra and Propionibacterium spp. were universally susceptible to beta-lactams. Eggerthella spp., Collinsella spp., and Eubacterium spp. showed variable resistance to penicillin. Among Gram-negative anaerobes, Fusobacterium spp., Prevotella spp., and Veillonella spp. showed high resistance to penicillin but were universally susceptible to meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam. The detection of metronidazole resistant B. fragilis is concerning as occurrence of these isolates is extremely rare. These data highlight the importance of ongoing surveillance to provide clinically relevant information to clinicians for empiric management of infections caused by anaerobic organisms.
TI  - Microbiologic profile of endodontic infections from HIV- and HIV+ patients using  multiple-displacement amplification and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the microbiota of endodontic infections in necrotic pulp from HIV-negative and HIV-positive subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Root canal samples from necrotic pulp were collected from 40 HIV- and 20 HIV+ subjects. Pulps were amplified using multiple displacement amplification (MDA). Then, checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization was employed to assess the levels of 107 microbial taxa. The percentage of DNA probe count and the percentage of teeth colonized by each test species were investigated. Significant differences between groups regarding proportions of taxa and prevalence of the test species were sought using the Mann-Whitney test and the Chi-square analysis, respectively. RESULTS: The most prevalent taxa detected were Dialister pneumosintes, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus sobrinus, Corynebacterium diphteriae, and Helicobacter pylori among HIV- subjects and D. pneumosintes, Prevotella tannerae, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella nigrescens, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae among HIV+ individuals. D. pneumosintes, C. diphtheria, and C. albicans were the most abundant species in the HIV- group, whereas the predominant taxa in HIV+ samples were P. tannerae, D. pneumosintes and Olsenella uli. P. tannerae, O. uli, Veilonella dispar, Bacteroides fragilis, and Actinomyces meyeri were significantly more abundant in HIV+ samples. CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences in the prevalence and proportions of specific microbial taxa between HIV- and HIV+ individuals. The root canal microbiota may represent a reservoir of important oral and medical pathogens, mainly in HIV+ individuals.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from Viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  - Six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from Viguiera arenaria Baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. The microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Enterococcus faecalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. The compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying MIC values ranging from 1 to 10 mug mL-1. The results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.
TI  - Distribution of secretory inhibitor of platelet microbicidal protein among anaerobic bacteria isolated from stool of children with diarrhea.
AB  - AIM: To study the secretory inhibitor of platelet microbicidal protein (SIPMP) phenotypes of faecal anaerobic isolates from patients with diarrhea. METHODS: Faecal isolates of anaerobic bacteria (B. fragilis, n = 42; B. longum, n = 70; A. israelii, n = 21; E. lentum, n = 12) from children with diarrhea were tested. SIPMP production was tested by inhibition of platelet microbicidal protein (PMP) bioactivity against B. subtilis and was expressed as percentage of inhibition of PMP bactericidal activity. RESULTS: Among anaerobic isolates 80% of B. longum strains, 85.7% of A. israelii strains, 50% of E. lentum strains and 92.86% of B. fragilis strains were SIPMP-positive. The isolated anaerobic organisms demonstrated SIPMP production at a mean level of 13.8% +/- 0.7%, 14.7% +/- 1.8%, 3.9% +/- 0.9% (P < 0.05) and 26.8% +/- 7.5% (P < 0.05) for bifidobacteria, A. israelii, E. lentum and B. fragilis, respectively. CONCLUSION: Data from the present study may have significant implications in understanding the pathogenesis of microecological disorders in the intestine, as well as for future improvement in the prevention and therapy of anaerobe-associated infections.
TI  - Pericarditis caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of pericarditis  due to anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes isolated from patients with pericarditis are Gram-negative bacilli (mostly Bacteroides fragilis group) as well as Peptostreptococcus, Clostridium, Fusobacterium, Bifidobacterium and Actinomyces spp. Anaerobic bacteria can be recovered from pericarditis resulting from the following mechanisms: (i) spread from a contiguous site of infection, either de novo or following surgery or trauma (pleuropulmonary, oesophageal fistula or perforation, and odontogenic); (ii) spread from a site of infection within the heart, most commonly from endocarditis; (iii) haematogenous infection; and (iv) direct inoculation resulting from a penetrating injury or cardiothoracic surgery. Anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli have increased their resistance to penicillins and other antimicrobial agents in the last two decades. Identification of pathogens and determination of their antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase production are essential for adequate selection of antibiotic therapy effective against these organisms.
TI  - Coaggregation between and among human intestinal and oral bacteria.
AB  - Coaggregation is believed to facilitate the integration of new bacterial species  into polymicrobial communities. The aim of this study was to investigate coaggregation between and among human oral and enteric bacteria. Stationary phase cultures of 10 oral and 10 enteric species, chosen on the basis of numerical and ecological significance in their respective environments together with their ease of cultivation, were tested using a quantitative spectrophotometric coaggregation assay in all possible pairwise combinations to provide quantitative coaggregation scores. While 40% of possible partnerships coaggregated strongly for oral strains, strong interactions between oral and gut strains were considerably less common (4% incidence). Coaggregation scores were also weak between members of the intestinal microbiota (7% incidence), apart from Bacteroides fragilis with Clostridium perfringens, and Bifidobacterium adolescentis with C. perfringens. Oral and intestinal bacteria did not strongly interact, apart from B. adolescentis with Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces naeslundii with C. perfringens and F. nucleatum with Lactobacillus paracasei. Heating and sugar-addition experiments indicated that similar to oral microorganisms, interactions within intestinal bacteria and between intestinal and oral strains were mediated by lectin-carbohydrate interactions.
TI  - [Psoas abscess of the adult: study of 38 cases].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to report the clinical aspects, the etiologies, the treatment and the evolution of the psoas abscess in the adult. METHODS: Our retrospective study concerns 38 cases of psoas abscesses collected in the Department of Infectious Diseases of Sfax (Tunisia), over a period of 16 years (January 1990 - December 2005). RESULTS: The average age is 44 years (extremes: 16-76 years). The sex-ratio is 1.4. Six patients were diabetics and one had a chronic renal injury at the stage of hemodialysis. The clinical manifestations were: a fever (76.4%), an abdomino-pelvic ache (84.2%) and a psoitis (34.2%). All patients had a biologic inflammatory syndrome with a hyperleucocytosis in 28 cases. The abscess was one-sided in 29 cases and bilateral in 9 cases. After microbiological study and/or histological study, pathogens were identified in 31 patients, they were Staphylococcus aureus (10 cases), Staphylococcus lugdunensis (1 case), Streptococci (3 cases), Escherichia coli (2 cases), Bacteroides fragilis (1 case), Actinomyces (2 cases), Brucella (3 cases), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (8 cases) and Candida glabrata (1 case). The psoas abscess was primary in 10 cases and secondary in 28 cases. All the patients received an antibiotherapy or an antifungal therapy adapted to the micro-organism in cause, with a drainage of the abscess in 25 cases (surgical in 9 cases and percutaneous in 16 cases). The evolution was favourable in 36 cases. One patient presented recurrences and one patient died. CONCLUSION: The psoas abscess of the adult is characterized by a polymorphe clinical presentation. Germs in cause are very variable.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria in 118 patients with deep-space head and neck infections from  the University Hospital of Maxillofacial Surgery, Sofia, Bulgaria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the incidence and susceptibility to antibacterial agents of anaerobic strains in 118 patients with head and neck abscesses (31) and cellulitis (87). Odontogenic infection was the most common identified source, occurring in 73 (77.7%) of 94 patients. The incidence of anaerobes in abscesses and cellulitis was 71 and 75.9%, respectively, and that in patients before (31 patients) and after (87) the start of empirical treatment was 80.6 and 72.4%, respectively. The detection rates of anaerobes in patients with odontogenic and other sources of infection were 82.2 and 71.4%, respectively. In total, 174 anaerobic strains were found. The predominant bacteria were Prevotella (49 strains), Fusobacterium species (22), Actinomyces spp. (21), anaerobic cocci (20) and Eubacterium spp. (18). Bacteroides fragilis strains were isolated from 7 (5.9%) specimens. The detection rate of Fusobacterium strains from non-treated patients (32.2%) was higher than that from treated patients (13.8%). Resistance rates to clindamycin and metronidazole of Gram-negative anaerobes were 5.4 and 2.5%, respectively, and those of Gram-positive species were 4.5 and 58.3%, respectively. One Prevotella strain was intermediately susceptible to ampicillin/sulbactam. In conclusion, the start of empirical treatment could influence the frequency or rate of isolation of Fusobacterium species. The involvement of the Bacteroides fragilis group in some head and neck infections should be considered.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial efficacy of a new chlorhexidine slow-release device.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide slow-release devices on oral bacteria. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The agar diffusion test was used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of the slow-release devices Activ Point (chlorhexidine; Roeko) and Calcium Hydroxide Plus Point (Roeko) on 8 anaerobic and 2 facultative oral bacterial strains, as well as 2 bacterial cultures randomly sampled from necrotic root canals and incubated in anaerobic and aerobic broth for 48 hours. The efficiency of the medicaments against the various strains was evaluated using a nonparametric test (Friedman type) and a second nonparametric test (Wilcoxon's signed rank test). RESULTS: Activ Point produced significantly larger inhibition zones (P < .001) than the calcium hydroxide slow-release device around all tested bacterial strains. CONCLUSION: The chlorhexidine slow-release device (Activ Point) exhibited significant antibacterial activity in the agar diffusion test and merits study as an intracanal medicament.
TI  - Urinary tract and genito-urinary suppurative infections due to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Anaerobes have been involved in many different types of urinary tract infection.  This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of urinary tract and genito-urinary suppurative infections caused by anaerobic bacteria. The types of infections of the urinary tract in which anaerobes have been involved include para- or periurethral cellulitis or abscess, acute and chronic urethritis, cystitis, acute and chronic prostatitis, prostatic and scrotal abscesses, periprostatic phlegmon, ureteritis, periureteritis, pyelitis, pyelonephritis, renal abscess, scrotal gangrene, metastatic renal infection pyonephrosis, perinephric abscess, retroperitoneal abscess and other infections. The anaerobes recovered in these studies were Gram-negative bacilli (including Bacteroides fragilis and pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas sp.), Clostridium sp., anaerobic Gram-positive cocci and Actinomyces sp. In many cases, they were recovered mixed with coliforms or streptococci. The recovery of anaerobes requires the administration of antimicrobial therapy that is effective against these organisms. These antimicrobials include metronidazole, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, a carbapenem, cefoxitin and the combination of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor. Percutaneous drainage, open surgical drainage or nephectomy might be indicated for abscesses.
TI  - In vitro activities of ramoplanin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid, bacitracin, and four other antimicrobials against intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - By using an agar dilution method, the in vitro activities of ramoplanin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid, and five other agents were determined against 300 gram-positive and 54 gram-negative strains of intestinal anaerobes. Ramoplanin was active at <or=2 microg/ml against 287 of 300 (95.7%) gram-positive organisms, including 18 strains of Clostridium difficile for which MICs of ramoplanin were 0.25 to 0.5 microg/ml; for 3 of these, linezolid MICs were 8 to 16 micro g/ml. Nineteen Clostridium innocuum strains for which the vancomycin MIC at which 90% of strains were inhibited was 16 microg/ml were susceptible to ramoplanin at 0.06 to 0.25 microg/ml and to teicoplanin at 0.125 to 1.0 microg/ml. All strains of Eubacterium, Actinomyces, Propionibacterium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited by <or=0.25 microg of ramoplanin per ml and <or=1 microg of vancomycin per ml. Ramoplanin was also active at <or=4 microg/ml against 15 of 22 of the Prevotella and Porphyromonas strains tested, but ramoplanin MICs for all 31 strains of the Bacteroides fragilis group, the Fusobacterium mortiferum-Fusobacterium varium group, and Veillonella spp. were >or=256 microg/ml. Ramoplanin displays excellent activity against C. difficile and other gram-positive enteric anaerobes, including vancomycin-resistant strains; however, it has poor activity against most gram-negative anaerobes and thus potentially has a lesser effect on the ecological balance of normal fecal flora.
TI  - Molecular cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of an exo-levanase gene from the endophytic bacterium Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus SRT4.
AB  - Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus produces levan from sucrose by a secreted levansucrase (LsdA). A levanase-encoding gene ( lsdB), starting 51 bp downstream of the lsdA gene, was cloned from strain SRT4. The lsdB gene (1605 bp) encodes a protein (calculated molecular mass 58.4 kDa) containing a putative 36-amino-acid signal peptide at the N-terminus. The deduced amino acid sequence shares 34%, 33%, 32%, and 29% identities with levanases from Actinomyces naeslundii, Bacillus subtilis, Paenibacillus polymyxa, and Bacteroides fragilis, respectively. The lsdB expression in Escherichia coli under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter resulted in an active enzyme which hydrolyzed levan, inulin, 1-kestose, raffinose, and sucrose, but not melezitose. Levanase activity was maximal at pH 6.0 and 30 degrees C, and it was not inhibited by the metal ion chelator EDTA or the denaturing agents dithiothreitol and beta-mercaptoethanol. The recombinant LsdB showed a fourfold higher rate of hydrolysis on levan compared to inulin, and the reaction on both substrates resulted in the successive liberation of the terminal fructosyl residues without formation of intermediate oligofructans, indicating a non-specific exo-levanase activity.
TI  - BAL 9141, a new broad-spectrum pyrrolidinone cephalosporin: activity against clinically significant anaerobes in comparison with 10 other antimicrobials.
AB  - The in vitro potency of BAL 9141, a new pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, was tested against non-duplicate strains of anaerobic bacteria. The MIC(50) was 1 mg/L against Actinomyces species, Clostridium species, Gram-positive anaerobic cocci, Porphyromonas species, Fusobacterium species, Lactobacillus species, Prevotella species and Veillonella species. The MIC(50) was 16 mg/L for Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides species. BAL 9141 was not active against cefoxitin-resistant Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - [Use of the Etest method for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of obligate anaerobes].
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate Etest usefulness for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of obligate anaerobes and to compare the activity of five antibacterial drugs against clinical strains of anaerobes. One hundred strains of obligate anaerobes were tested: 2 reference strains (B. fragilis ATCC 25285 and B. thetaiotaomicron ATCC 29741) and 98 clinical strains isolated from patients of the Infant Jesus Clinical Hospital--Center for Trauma Treatment in Warsaw during the last three years (1997-1999). Strains of seven genera of obligate nonsporeforming anaerobes (Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Propionibacterium and Actinomyces) and strains of two sporeforming species (C. perfringens and C. difficile) were examined. The MIC values were determined by the gradient diffusion method Etest (AB BIODISK, Sweden). Wilkins-Chalgren solid medium supplemented with 5% of sheep blood was used. Test plates were incubated at 35 degrees C for 48 hours in glove-box (85% N2, 10% H2, 5% CO2). The MIC values for each strain and antimicrobial agent, and the MIC ranges for bacteria of the same species were established. Ten strains resistant to clindamycin, ten resistant to piperacillin, and ten resistant to imipenem were detected. Seven strains were resistant to metronidazole and two strains to piperacillin combined with tazobactam. Tazobactam restored the susceptibility of eight strains to piperacillin. Obtained results confirm that Etest method is useful for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of obligate anaerobes. Older (clindamycin and metronidazole) and newer (piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem) antimicrobial agents revealed high and comparable activity against clinical strains of obligate anaerobes. The percentage of strains susceptible to tested antimicrobials was > or = 90. These antimicrobials may be still useful in the empiric treatment of infections caused by medically important anaerobes.
TI  - Analysis of bacterial detachment from substratum surfaces by the passage of air-liquid interfaces.
AB  - A theoretical analysis of the detachment of bacteria adhering to substratum surfaces upon the passage of an air-liquid interface is given, together with experimental results for bacterial detachment in the absence and presence of a conditioning film on different substratum surfaces. Bacteria (Streptococcus sobrinus HG1025, Streptococcus oralis J22, Actinomyces naeslundii T14V-J1, Bacteroides fragilis 793E, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 974K) were first allowed to adhere to hydrophilic glass and hydrophobic dimethyldichlorosilane (DDS)-coated glass in a parallel-plate flow chamber until a density of 4 x 10(6) cells cm(-2) was reached. For S. sobrinus HG1025, S. oralis J22, and A. naeslundii T14V-J1, the conditioning film consisted of adsorbed salivary components, while for B. fragilis 793E and P. aeruginosa 974K, the film consisted of adsorbed human plasma components. Subsequently, air bubbles were passed through the flow chamber and the bacterial detachment percentages were measured. For some experimental conditions, like with P. aeruginosa 974K adhering to DDS-coated glass and an air bubble moving at high velocity (i.e., 13.6 mm s(-1)), no bacteria detached upon passage of an air-liquid interface, while for others, detachment percentages between 80 and 90% were observed. The detachment percentage increased when the velocity of the passing air bubble decreased, regardless of the bacterial strain and substratum surface hydrophobicity involved. However, the variation in percentages of detachment by a passing air bubble depended greatly upon the strain and substratum surface involved. At low air bubble velocities the hydrophobicity of the substratum had no influence on the detachment, but at high air bubble velocities all bacterial strains were more efficiently detached from hydrophilic glass substrata. Furthermore, the presence of a conditioning film could either inhibit or stimulate detachment. The shape of the bacterial cell played a major role in detachment at high air bubble velocities, and spherical strains (i.e., streptococci) detached more efficiently than rod-shaped organisms. The present results demonstrate that methodologies to study bacterial adhesion which include contact with a moving air-liquid interface (i.e., rinsing and dipping) yield detachment of an unpredictable number of adhering microorganisms. Hence, results of studies based on such methodologies should be referred as "bacterial retention" rather than "bacterial adhesion".
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of ABT-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of ABT-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. MICs at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for Actinomyces spp., Clostridium perfringens, Peptostreptococcus spp., Propionibacterium spp., and Porphyromonas spp. The MIC(50)s and MIC(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for Eubacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Clostridium difficile, and Clostridium ramosum. The MIC(90) for Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides ureolyticus, and Campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for Prevotella bivia and other Prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. The MIC(90) for Fusobacterium nucleatum was 8 microg/ml, and that for Fusobacterium mortiferum and Fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. The MIC(90)s for the Bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for B. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides distasonis, and Bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for Bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. Telithromycin MICs for the B. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than ABT-773 MICs. For all strains, ABT-773 was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.
TI  - Susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria in Auckland: 1991-1996.
AB  - AIM: To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of local anaerobic bacteria. METHOD: The antimicrobial susceptibility of 357 obligate anaerobes collected between 1991 and 1997 was determined by a standard agar dilution method. Isolates tested included Bacteroides spp. 131, Fusobacterium spp. 12, Prevotella spp. 13, Veillonella spp. 5, Clostridium perfringens 27, other Clostridium spp. 29, Propionibacterium spp. 57, Actinomyces spp. 7, other non-sporing gram-positive bacilli 28 and Peptostreptococcus spp. 48. Ten antimicrobials were tested: penicillin, amoxycillin/ clavulanic acid, pipercillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, cefoxitin, cefotetan, imipenem, meropenem, clindamycin and metronidazole. RESULTS: Imipenem, pipercillin/tazobactam, meropenem and amoxycillin/clavulanic acid were active against virtually all anaerobes tested. Metronidazole was active against all anaerobic gram-negative bacteria and Clostridium spp., but had variable activity against other anaerobes. Cefoxitin was the most active cephalosporin against Bacteroides spp., with 76%, 64% and 15% of Bacteroides spp. being susceptible to cefoxitin, cefotetan and ceftriaxone, respectively. Penicillin had poor activity against anaerobic gram negative bacilli. Actinomyces and Propionibacterium spp. were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested except metronidazole. Variable results were obtained with other antimicrobial-organism combinations. Comparison of results with data from a previously published survey showed little change in susceptibility except for increased resistance of Bacteroides fragilis to ceftriaxone and Clostridium species (not C perfringens) to clindamycin. CONCLUSION: Our results update the local susceptibility profile of anaerobic bacteria and may be considered when choosing an antimicrobial agent for prophylaxis or treatment of anaerobic infections.
TI  - Prevalence of nim genes in anaerobic/facultative anaerobic bacteria isolated in South Africa.
AB  - This study investigated the prevalence of nim genes (proposed to encode a 5-nitroimidazole resistance product) in 64 anaerobic/facultative anaerobic bacteria. Employing universal nim gene primers, 458-bp amplified fragments were recorded as presumptive positives in 22/64 strains at an annealing temperature of 52 degrees C and 15/64 strains at 62 degrees C, of which seven were propionibacteria. DNA sequencing confirmed the presence of nimA genes in Propionibacterium spp. (five strains), Actinomyces odontolyticus (one strain), Prevotella bivia (one strain) and Clostridium bifermentans (one strain) and nimB genes from five strains of Bacteroides fragilis. nimA genes were predominant in propionibacteria indicating a potential nimA gene source in anaerobic environments.
TI  - Evaluation of the BBL Crystal Anaerobe identification system.
AB  - The BBL Crystal Anaerobe (ANR) identification system was evaluated, and the results were compared with those from conventional anaerobic methods. We tested 322 clinically significant anaerobic bacteria according to the manufacturer's instructions. The system identified correctly 286 of 322 (88.8%) of the anaerobic bacteria tested. Of these, 263 of 322 (81.7%) were identified correctly on initial testing and 49 were identified correctly only to the genus level; on repeat testing, 23 of 49 (46.9%) were identified correctly to both the genus and the species levels. A total of 26 (8.5%) were misidentified at the species level, and 10 (3.1%) were not identified. Performance characteristics for individual strains varied. The system correctly identified all tested strains of Campylobacter, Desulfomonas, Desulfovibrio, Leptotrichia, Mobiluncus, Peptostreptococcus, Porphyromonas, Provetella, Propionibacterium, Tisierella, and Veillonella and 36 of 37 (97.3%) Actinomyces strains, 42 of 46 (91.3%) B. fragilis group strains, 79 of 103 (76.7%) Clostridium strains, (however, the system failed to identify any of the 7 C. innocuum and 9 C. tetani strains tested), and 8 of 15 (53.3%) Bacteroides strains. This system was easy to use, did not involve the addition of reagents, and was faster than conventional anaerobic procedures. It would be a useful addition to the anaerobe laboratory of most hospitals.
TI  - Evidence for serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses in Macaca fascicularis identified by monoclonal antibodies to human IgG subclasses.
AB  - This investigation determined the capacity of murine monoclonal antibodies directed to human immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses to identify molecules with conserved epitopes in the serum of the nonhuman primate, Macaca fascicularis. We subsequently utilized this cross-reactivity to document the characteristics of IgG subclass antibody responses in M. fascicularis to parenteral immunization with intact oral microorganisms, antigens from oral microorganisms, and finally a defined protein toxin, tetanus toxoid. The IgG response in nonhuman primates immunized with tetanus toxoid showed a 40-fold and 110-fold increase after primary and secondary immunizations, respectively. The major IgG subclass responses were IgG1 and IgG3, with little, though significant, responses in the IgG4 and IgG2 subclasses. Seventy-five to 94% of the natural IgG antibody in nonhuman primate sera to Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Campylobacter rectus was IgG1. IgG2 and IgG3 predominated to Bacteroides fragilis, IgG4 to Actinomyces viscosus and an equal distribution among the subclasses was noted in response to Fusobacterium nucleatum. Parenteral immunization of nonhuman primates with intact P. gingivalis elicited primarily IgG3 and IgG4, while the post-immunization IgG response to P. intermedia was largely IgG1. Nonhuman primates were also parenterally immunized with cell envelope antigens of P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, or a combination of cell envelope antigen from C. rectus and F. nucleatum and cell wall antigens of A. viscosus. The greatest IgG antibody response seen post-immunization was reactive with anti-human IgG1 for all of these antigens except to C. rectus which bound nonhuman primate antibody reactive with anti-human IgG2. It appears that the bacteria and their products exhibit unique differences in their induction of serum IgG subclass antibody responses. The characteristics of their immunogenicity as detected by the nonhuman primate may contribute to the ability of the immune responses to effectively interact with these pathogens.
TI  - Susceptibilities of bovine summer mastitis bacteria to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The susceptibility to 9 antimicrobial agents of 32 aerobic bacterial isolates and to 10 antimicrobial agents of 37 anaerobic bacterial isolates from 23 cases of bovine summer mastitis (16 Actinomyces pyogenes isolates, 8 Streptococcus dysgalactiae isolates, 3 S. uberis isolates, 3 S. acidominimus isolates, 2 Streptococcus spp., 15 Peptostreptococcus indolicus isolates, 10 Fusobacterium necrophorum isolates, and 12 isolates of anaerobic gram-negative rods) was determined by the agar dilution method. All isolates except one Bacteroides fragilis isolate (beta-lactamase producer) were susceptible to penicillin G, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and chloramphenicol (the B. fragilis strain was susceptible to the last four), which had MICs at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC90s) of < or = 0.06, < or = 0.06, < or = 0.06 0.25, < or = 0.06, and 4.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. Spiramycin was active against the gram-positive aerobes (MIC90, 1.0 microgram/ml) but not against the anaerobes (MIC90, 16.0 micrograms/ml). Similar trends were noted for susceptibilities of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to ofloxacin (MIC90s, 2.0 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively). Occasional strains of aerobic streptococci were resistant to oxytetracycline, but all anaerobes were susceptible. Tinidazole was active against all anaerobes (MIC90, 2.0 micrograms/ml). beta-Lactamase was produced only by the B. fragilis isolate.
TI  - A retrospective review of cases of anaerobic empyema and update of bacteriology.
AB  - We conducted a retrospective study to update the bacteriology of 46 cases of anaerobic empyema that were originally studied between 1976 and 1993 at the Wadsworth Anaerobic Bacteriology Clinical Research Laboratory (Los Angeles). Anaerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for all 46 pleural fluid specimens, and aerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for 41 of these specimens. Thirty-seven clinical charts were available for review. A total of 161 anaerobic isolates (3.5 per patient) representing 64 species or groups were recovered. The most common isolates were as follows: Fusobacterium nucleatum (19); Prevotella oris-buccae group (13, 9 of which were P. oris); Bacteroides fragilis group (11, 4 of which were B. fragilis); pigmented Prevotella species (17, 8 of which were in the Prevotella intermedia-nigrescens group); Peptostreptococcus species (17, 9 of which were Peptostreptococcus micros); Eubacterium species (7); Lactobacillus species (8); Actinomyces species (7); and Clostridium species (7). Nineteen if the cases were of purely anaerobic etiology; of these, eight were caused by a single organism: F. nucleatum (five cases); B. fragilis (two cases); and Prevotella mangus (one case). Of the 45 aerobic isolates (1.1 per patient), viridans streptococci were most common (21 isolates), followed by group D nonenterococcal streptococcus (four isolates). Only nine gram-negative rods (six enteric and three nonenteric organisms) and one Staphylococcus aureus isolate were recovered. The susceptibility to penicillin of 64 isolates was examined with the use of the spiral gradient method; 21 (33%) of these isolates were beta-lactamase positive (MICs ranged from 1.1 to > or = 54 micrograms/mL vs < or = 0.27 micrograms/mL for beta-lactamase-negative strains).
TI  - [Comparative in vitro activity of ampicillin, cefoperazone and their combinations with sulbactam, as well as that of other antibiotics against anaerobic organisms].
AB  - Susceptibility of 180 strains of anaerobic organisms to ampicillin, cefoperazone  and their combinations with sulbactam, as well as that to cefoxitin, imipenem and metronidazole was studied with the method of serial microdilutions. 100 per cent of the strains was susceptible to the ampicillin + cefoperazone combination. Only 1 strain of Bacteroides fragilis was resistant to imipenem. 73.4 and 57.8 per cent of the B. fragilis strains were susceptible to cefoxitin and cefoperazone respectively. No resistance to metronidazole was detected. 100 per cent of the strains belonging to Bacteroides spp. fragilis (gr.) and Prevotella spp. was resistant to all the antibiotics except ampicillin. Gram-positive anaerobic cocci were susceptible to all the antibiotics. The strains of Actinomyces spp. and Propionibacterium acnes were resistant to metronidazole. Only 48.7 per cent the Actinomyces strains was susceptible to cefoxitin.
TI  - Anaerobic pericarditis: case report and review.
AB  - Purulent pericarditis is uncommon and is rarely caused by anaerobic bacteria. We  describe a 58-year-old man with purulent pericarditis secondary to infection with Bacteroides fragilis; the most likely source for the B. fragilis infection was subsequently found to be a ruptured appendix. His pericarditis eventually resolved after drainage of purulent fluid and treatment with antibiotics directed against B. fragilis. We also review 29 cases of anaerobic pericarditis previously reported in the English-language literature (we excluded those cases due to actinomyces). In 17 cases only anaerobic bacteria were isolated, while in 13 anaerobes were isolated with a mixture of facultative and/or aerobic bacteria. The cases were secondary to a contiguous focus of infection or occurred via hematogenous seeding. Treatment of both anaerobic pericarditis and purulent pericarditis due to aerobic bacteria entails adequate drainage and appropriate antibiotic therapy, and in all cases there should be a search for the source of the organism infecting the pericardium.
TI  - Interaction of the salivary glycoprotein EP-GP with the bacterium Streptococcus salivarius HB.
AB  - The interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein EP-GP with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. EP-GP could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of ELISA or by electrophoresis in combination with Western Transfer. The results indicated that EP-GP is bound only by Streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides fragilis, S. gordonii, S. oralis, S. sanguis, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. rattus, S. constellatus, and S. anginosus. Binding of EP-GP to S. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be pH-dependent with a maximum binding between pH 5 and 6. For further characterization of the binding of EP-GP to S. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. EP-GP was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. We were able to identify a 27-kD EP-GP binding protein, by extraction of S. salivarius-cell wall antigens and electrophoretic techniques. In addition to EP-GP, S. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory IgA and low-molecular-weight mucin (MG-2).
TI  - Antibacterial activity of oral antibiotics against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The spectrum and the antibacterial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to oral antibiotics isolated from clinical specimens was assessed in two different centres, the first receiving specimens from University departments and the second from general practitioners and small hospitals. Susceptibility was studied with a microtiter ready-to-use panel system, using the manufacturer's modified Wilkins-Chalgren's broth as the test medium for the following antibiotics: ampicillin, ampicillin+sulbactam, amoxicillin+clavulanic acid, cephalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, clindamycin, doxycycline and erythromycin. Anaerobic bacteria frequently encountered in clinical specimens from the University departments were mainly resistant Bacteroides spp., especially Bacteroides fragilis, Propionibacterium spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp., whereas in the outpatient center, Peptostreptococcus spp, Actinomyces spp. and Veillonella parvula (usually considered as colonizing flora) represented 90% of the cultured bacteria. The study shows that the members of most Bacteroides spp. encountered in a hospital environment are resistant to most of these agents (except clindamycin, amoxicillin+clavulanic acid, and ampicillin+sulbactam), whereas the gram-positive pathogens are widely covered by most of the orally available agents studied including cefetamet.
TI  - [Study of obligate anaerobic bacterial sensitivity to tinidazole and metronidazole (determination of minimal inhibiting concentration--MIC)].
AB  - Comparative susceptibility testing of 428 strains of obligate anaerobic bacteria  belonging to genera Propionibacterium, Arachnia, Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Anaerorhabdus, Fibrobacter, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus and Clostridium to metronidazole and tinidazole was performed. The study of the susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria was carried out by the method of serial dilution in Brucella agar according to Finegold and Sutter (1972). Strains of B. fragilis species, B. fragilis group, other Bacteroides spp.. Fusobacterium spp. and Clostridium spp. were susceptible to both chemotherapeutics in clinically attainable concentrations. Of particular significance is the greater susceptibility of these bacteria to tinidazole. Taking into account this activity, tinidazole is a superior agent in the treatment of anaerobic infections. Both chemotherapeutics were not active against, rarely isolated from severe infections. Gram-positive anaerobic rods from genera Propionibacterium. Actinomyces and Arachnia and were partially active against peptostreptococci.
TI  - Experimental studies of survival of anaerobic bacteria at 4 degrees C and 22 degrees C in two different transport systems.
AB  - The survival of anaerobic bacteria on swabs in two different transport systems at 4 degrees C and 22 degrees C was evaluated. The transport systems were a charcoal-impregnated cotton swab in modified Stuart transport medium (MST), and a viscose swab in modified SIFF transport medium (BTM) (Bionor). The following eight clinical strains of anaerobic bacteria were tested for quantitative recovery at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h; Fusobacterium necrophorum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides intermedius, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptococcus magnus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium tetani, and Actinomyces israelii. Additionally, a mixture of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was tested together with Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum and Clostridium perfringens. Both transport systems preserved the bacteria, but the BTM medium gave a better quantitative recovery of the bacteria than the MST in 29/64 (45%) of the experiments, whereas the opposite was the case in 15/64 (23%) of the experiments (p < 0.05). There was no significant strain-related difference between the recovery of 10 different B. fragilis strains. There was no major difference in the recovery of the anaerobes in the two systems at 4 degrees C compared to 22 degrees C, except for Fusobacterium necrophorum, which survived best at 4 degrees C in the Bionor transport system.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of intracranial abscesses.
AB  - The bacteriologic and clinical findings of 39 pediatric patients with intracranial abscess are presented. Twenty-three children presented with brain abscess and 16 with subdural empyema. Predisposing conditions were present in all instances. Sinusitis was present in 25 children and 4 patients each had chronic otitis media, dental abscess, and congenital heart disease. The abscess was located in the frontal area in 14 patients, parietal in 13, and temporal in 12. Anaerobic organisms alone were recovered in 22 patients (56%), aerobic bacteria alone in 7 (18%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 10 (26%) patients. There were 79 anaerobic isolates (2 per specimen). The predominant anaerobes were anaerobic Gram-positive cocci (29 isolates); Bacteroides sp. (12, including 5 Bacteroides fragilis group), Fusobacterium sp. (14 isolates); and Prevotella sp. and Actinomyces sp. (6 isolates each). A total of 17 aerobic or facultative isolates (0.4 per specimen), including 11 Gram-positive cocci and 6 Haemophilus sp., were recovered. Antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients. Nine patients (i.e., 6 with sinusitis and subdural empyema, 3 with sinusitis and brain abscess) did not respond to antimicrobial therapy and aspiration of the abscess, and required surgical drainage of inflamed sinuses. These findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of intracranial abscess in children.
TI  - The comparative antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide.
AB  - The antimicrobial effectiveness of calcium hydroxide, camphorated paramonochlorophenol, and formocresol in root canals of extracted human teeth was compared. Canals in single-rooted teeth were enlarged and inoculated with Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, and Bacteroides gingivalis or Bacteroides fragilis. After treatment with a test agent and sealing and incubation for 1 hour, the canal contents were analyzed for the number of viable test bacteria and compared with that of inoculated teeth not treated with test agents. All test agents exhibited antimicrobial activity against all bacteria, with percent reductions in viable bacteria ranging from 64.3% to 100%. The combined data for Pulpdent paste and calcium hydroxide showed significantly higher antimicrobial activity than the combined data for camphorated paramonochlorophenol and formocresol for S. mutans and B. gingivalis or B. fragilis but showed no difference for A. viscosus.
TI  - Oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  - Two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. Of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (Peptostreptococcus (1); Eubacterium (9); Clostridium (6); Veillonella (6); Megasphera (1); Bacteroides (28); Fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (P. anaerobius (1); E. fossor (9); C. villosum (1); B. fragilis (1); B. tectum (2); B. heparinolyticus (2)). Three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (LRT) or paraoral (PO) bacterial infections. Of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. Phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. Among the obligately anaerobic species, Gram-positive cocci including P. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, E. fossor 11% and other Gram-positive rods (excluding Clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. The Gram-negative rods comprised B. fragilis 5%, B. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented Bacteroides 3% and other Bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of Fusobacterium (7%), and Gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. Among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by Pasteurella spp. 19%, Escherichia coli 17%, Actinomyces spp. 9%, Streptococcus spp. 9%. Incidental facultative isolates were Enterococcus spp. 2%, Enterobacter cloaceae 2%, Actinobacillus spp. 2% and Gram-negative corroding rods 5%. On the basis of the similarities (as determined by DNA hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. E. fossor and B. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and LRT and PO diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.
TI  - Evaluation of the ATB 32 A system for identification of anaerobic bacteria isolated from clinical specimens.
AB  - A new miniaturized 4-h method for the identification of anaerobic bacteria, ATB 32 A (API System SA, Montalieu Vercieu, France), was evaluated against conventional methods of identification. The evaluation was done by using 260 recent clinical isolates and 21 reference strains of anaerobic bacteria. All reference strains were correctly identified and did not figure in the detailed analysis. Of the 140 gram-negative bacilli, 90.6% of Bacteroides spp. and 95.5% of Fusobacterium spp. were correctly identified to the species level, with an additional 8.4% of the Bacteroides spp. being identified to the genus level. Clostridia were correctly identified in 85.9% of cases, with an additional 9.9% being identified to the genus level. Peptostreptococci were correctly identified in 91.6% of cases. The 4 strains of Actinomyces spp. were all identified correctly, as were 10 of the 11 strains of Propionibacterium spp. A total of 3.1% of strains were not identified by ATB 32 A, while for 1.9% of strains, completely false identifications were obtained. Estimation of the individual preformed enzyme results may pose problems, although these decrease with familiarity with the system. With certain enzyme profiles, additional testing was necessary to arrive at an identification; however, there was no requirement for gas-liquid chromatography. If certain additions are made to the data base and the difficulties of determination of organisms to the species level among the non-Bacteroides fragilis (sensu stricto) members of the B. fragilis group can be reduced, this system holds promise as a reliable standardized alternative for the identification of anaerobic bacteria in clinical laboratories.
TI  - Enhancement of the infectivity of Fusobacterium necrophorum by other bacteria.
AB  - Necrobacillosis is caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum (FN), but other organisms  are often present in the lesions. Their possible role was studied in experiments made with a virulent FN strain which, by itself, produced fatal necrobacillosis in mice provided that large doses (greater than 10(6) organisms, subcutaneously) were given. Mice were inoculated subcutaneously with FN suspended in sub-lethal doses (0.1 ml) of undiluted or diluted broth cultures of other bacteria. Undiluted culture of a strain of Escherichia coli reduced the infective dose of FN to less than 10 organisms; in the necrobacillosis lesions that developed, fusobacteria greatly outnumbered E. coli. A heat-killed preparation or sterile filtrate of E. coli culture had little if any effect on FN. Citrobacter freundii and comparatively small numbers of Corynebacterium (Actinomyces) pyogenes produced effects similar to that of E. coli. An alpha-haemolytic streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium nucleatum also enhanced the infectivity of FN, though less strikingly than E. coli. FN increased the persistence in vivo of the alpha-haemolytic streptococcus and B. fragilis, and enabled the latter to multiply profusely.
TI  - The synergistic effect of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The synergistic interaction of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime against 187 clinically significant anaerobic organisms was investigated. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces odontolyticus, propionibacteria, lactobacilli, peptostreptococci, Streptococcus intermedius and Veillonella were sensitive to cefotaxime. Both Eubacterium lentum and Streptococcus morbillorum were resistant. The susceptibility of the clostridia varied from 0.125 to greater than 256 mg/L; only 20% of species demonstrated synergy between cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefotaxime against members of the genus Bacteroides ranged from 0.0625 to greater than 256 mg/L. The MIC50 of cefotaxime to Bacteroides fragilis and B. vulgatus was lowered from 6 and 4 mg/L, respectively, to 2 and 1 mg/L, respectively, when 4 mg/L desacetylcefotaxime was added to the medium. Full or partial synergy was demonstrated by 50.7% of the Bacteroides species tested. While cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime act synergistically against many members of the genus Bacteroides, the MIC of at least 10% of strains is not affected by this combination.
TI  - Susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibility of 1,117 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined by the agar dilution technique. Metronidazole was the most active agent; only Propionibacterium acnes and Actinomyces sp. isolates were resistant. Clindamycin and chloramphenical were the next most effective agents. Beta-lactam antibiotics, with the exception of penicillin, were active against most anaerobes other than the Bacteroides fragilis group. At a breakpoint of 8 mg/l, 25% of Fusobacterium spp. and 30% of the non-fragilis Bacteroides spp. were resistant to penicillin. The highest resistance to beta-lactams was seen in the B. fragilis group. Within the indole-positive members of the group, resistance rates of 71% were seen for cefoxitin, 49% for moxalactam, 79% for cefotaxime, 22% for piperacillin and 89% for penicillin. We conclude that metronidazole has the most predictable in vitro activity against common clinical anaerobic isolates and that resistance to beta-lactams was frequent and of potential clinical importance as these latter agents are frequently used in the prophylaxis and therapy of mixed anaerobic infections.
TI  - Inhibitory and cidal antimicrobial actions of electrically generated silver ions.
AB  - One promising alternative to antibiotics in the treatment of localized infections is the generation of antimicrobial silver ions by the use of low intensity direct current from a pure silver anode implanted at the site of an infection. This study investigates the in vitro bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of this system on a variety of organisms.
TI  - Short-term failure of IUD removal to alter bacterial flora in a patient with chronic anaerobic endometritis.
AB  - A patient with cytological and clinical evidence of IUD-associated anaerobic endometritis was studied with quantitative and qualitative bacteriological techniques. With the exception of elimination of Actinomyces israelii from the deep endocervical/endometrial culture, IUD removal induced minimal qualitative changes in the bacterial flora of the endocervical/endometrial sample during the 35 days the patient was monitored. The interposition of menstruation did not significantly alter either the quantitative or qualitative interrelationship of the bacteria present.
TI  - Ability of oral bacteria to degrade fibronectin.
AB  - The fibronectin-degrading ability of 116, mainly oral, strains was assayed by using plasma-derived fibronectin adsorbed to a polystyrene surface. Ability to degrade fibronectin was revealed in strains of Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides loeschii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptococcus prevotii, Clostridium sporogenes, and Propionibacterium acnes. The fibronectinolytic activity of subgingival bacteriological samples was found to be related to the presence of B. gingivalis and B. intermedius. In addition, strains of the nonoral Bacteroides species B. asaccharolyticus and B. fragilis showed fibronectin-degrading ability. No such ability was detected in the oral strains tested of Streptococcus, Veillonella, Actinomyces, Lactobacillus, Actinobacillus, Capnocytophaga, Fusobacterium, or Haemophilus species.
TI  - In vitro activity of Sch 34343 and cefbuperazone against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activities of Sch 34343, a new penem antibiotic, and cefbuperazone,  a new cephamycin antibiotic, were determined against 459 clinical anaerobic bacterial isolates and compared with the activities of imipenem and cefoxitin, respectively, by an agar dilution method. Both penems showed potent and similar activity against all anaerobic bacteria tested, particularly Peptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Clostridium perfringens. All organisms except a single strain of Fusobacterium necrogenes were inhibited by an 8 micrograms/ml concentration of either Sch 34343 or imipenem. Overall, gram-positive bacilli, particularly Lactobacillus species, Clostridium difficile, and Bifidobacterium and Actinomyces species, were relatively more resistant to either penem than other genera of anaerobic bacteria tested. Cefbuperazone demonstrated only modest activity against a wide spectrum of anaerobic bacteria. It had excellent and selective activity against B. fragilis and Bacteroides vulgatus but was highly inactive against Bacteroides distasonis and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron within the B. fragilis group. Both cephamycins showed virtually no activity against C. difficile and Lactobacillus spp. Although cefbuperazone was more active against Bifidobacterium spp., it had less activity against Fusobacterium spp., Eubacterium spp., and all Bacteroides spp. other than B. fragilis and B. vulgatus.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefbuperazone, a new cephamycin, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The 90% MIC of cefbuperazone (BMY 25182) was 32 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp., 128 micrograms/ml for Fusobacterium and Clostridium spp., 64 micrograms/ml for Eubacterium and Peptococcus spp., 8 micrograms/ml for Actinomyces spp., and 32 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus spp. The level of activity of cefbuperazone was higher against B. fragilis and lower against anaerobic cocci than those of related cephalosporins, i.e., cefoxitin, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, and cefmenoxime. However, the activity of cefbuperazone was comparable to that of moxalactam against all groups tested. Size of inoculum and type of media used did not alter the MICs of cefbuperazone for B. fragilis. Cefbuperazone showed synergistic activity when combined with cefoxitin against resistant strains of B. fragilis.
TI  - Production of menaquinones by intestinal anaerobes.
AB  - Ninety intestinal organisms (71 isolates from fecal samples of neutropenic patients with cancer or from various sites in patients with intraabdominal infections and 19 control strains) were examined by reverse-phase thin-layer chromatography for their ability to produce menaquinones in vitro. Menaquinones were found in all of 24 organisms of the Bacteroides fragilis group. Two other Bacteroides species, Bacteroides disiens and Bacteroides bivius, also produced menaquinones. A single isolate of Bacteroides species lacked menaquinones. These constituents were found in all of five strains of Escherichia coli, all of four strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, five of eight strains of Propionibacterium species, two of five strains of Eubacterium species, and the one strain each of Arachnia propionica and Veillonella parvula tested. No menaquinones were detected in organisms of the genera Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Actinomyces, Peptococcus, or Peptostreptococcus. These findings suggest that E. coli, Bacteroides species, and some gram-positive, anaerobic, non-spore-forming bacilli produce menaquinones that may be a source of vitamin K in patients who are deprived of exogenous vitamin K1.
TI  - Anaerobic infections in childhood.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria are part of the normal flora of mucous membranes and outnumber aerobic bacteria in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. Anaerobes can be isolated from pediatric patients with various infections when appropriate techniques for transportation and cultivation of samples are employed. Frequently anaerobes are isolated in combination with other facultative or aerobic bacteria. The genera or groups of anaerobes most frequently isolated from pyogenic infections in children are (in order of decreasing frequency) OFFteroides, Clostridium, gram-positive cocci, Fusobacterium, gram-positive rods (Eubacterium, Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium, Actinomyces, and Bifidobacterium), and gram-negative cocci (Veillonella and Acidaminococcus). Clostridium perfringens causes bacteremia and wound infections. Clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a lethal illness in adults and a paralytic syndrome in infants. Clostridium difficile can cause antibiotic-associated colitis or diarrhea. Bacteroides fragilis is most frequently involved in intraabdominal infections, infections of the female genital tract, subcutaneous abscesses, and bacteremia. Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides oralis are the predominent anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. Fusobacterium species are pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses, and orofacial infections. Anaerobic gram-positive cocci can be recovered from all types of infections but predominate in respiratory tract and intra-abdominal infections. Recognition of the pathogenic qualities of the various anaerobic organisms can assist in their prompt identification and in the initiation of appropriate therapy.
TI  - Susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - With the significant increase in resistance of anaerobic bacteria to antimicrobial agents in recent years, susceptibility testing of these organisms becomes very important. In addition to survey studies, hospitals should be determining their local patterns, and therapy of at least the more serious infections should be guided by susceptibility tests. Of the various tests available, those most suitable for smaller hospitals for guidance of patient management are the broth disc elution procedure and the micro broth dilution tray test.
TI  - Tinidazole--microbiology, pharmacology and efficacy in anaerobic infections.
AB  - Tinidazole is a 5-nitroimidazole with selective activity against anaerobic bacteria and protozoa. It is bactericidal at low concentrations and its spectrum covers most anaerobic bacteria and some capnophilic microorganisms. Anaerobic bacteria known to be resistant to tinidazole include anaerobic streptococci, actinomyces and propionibacteria. Tinidazole is one of the most active antibacterial agents against Bacteroides fragilis which is one of the most resistant species of anaerobic bacteria. Only a few strains have been reported to be resistant. Tinidazole has been shown to be efficacious in protozoal infections such as trichomonal vaginitis, amoebiasis and giardiasis. Clinical studies have also shown that tinidazole is efficacious in the treatment of anaerobic infections including respiratory tract infections, intra-abdominal sepsis and obstetrical and gynecological infections. Since tinidazole has no activity against aerobic bacteria, it must be combined with other antibacterial agents in the treatment of mixed infections involving aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Tinidazole has also been used successfully alone or in combination with other antimicrobial agents for prophylaxis in patients undergoing elective colonic and abdominal surgery, emergency appendectomy and gynecological surgery.
TI  - Adaptation of an automated microbiology system for the growth of anaerobes and performance of antimicrobial susceptibility tests.
AB  - The authors examined the feasibility of growing anaerobes in an automated microbiology system (MS-2) and using the system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. A total of 78 of 100 clinical anaerobic isolates grew in the MS-2 if 100 microL of an undiluted overnight suspension of organisms was inoculated into at least 2.5 mL of freshly prepared Wilkins-Chalgren broth supplemented with 0.07% agar. Susceptibility test results were determined with 50 anaerobes tested against seven antibiotics in the MS-2 system and were compared with results determined with a qualitative reference susceptibility test method. of the 350 tests, 88% of the MS-2 results agreed with the qualitative reference results. False-susceptible and false-resistant results were reported for 8.6 and 3.4%, respectively, of the MS-2 results.
TI  - [Antibiotic treatment of human actinomykoses (author's transl)].
AB  - In the complex aetiology of human actinomykoses, various Actinomyces species, especially A. israelii, play the pathogenetically leading role in the mixed flora so typical for these diseases. A number of other microaerophilic and anaerobic bacteria are also part of such mixed flora. Since these "concomitant" bacteria are themselves potentially pathogenic, it is important to have data on antibiotic sensitivity for the entire spectrum of microorganisms, to achieve effective and economic chemotherapy of human actinomykoses. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics were determined for Actinomyces and the most important concomitant bacteria from actinomykotic processes: Actinobacillus actinomycetem-commitants, Bacteroides of the Melaninogenicus group, B. fragilis, B. theta-iotaomicron, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium spp. and Propionibacteria. The results indicate that aminopenicillines are the drug of first choice, if in the actinomykoses there are no Bacteroides strains resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. These tests further indicate that clinically the combination of aminopenicillin and clindamycin, as well as aminopenicillin and metronidazol, are indicated. Minocycline and especially cefoxitin, a beta-lactamase resistant cephalosporin, inhibit with few exceptions all bacteria which are potentially involved in actinomykotic processes.
TI  - Bacteriology of intracranial abscess in children.
AB  - The bacteriological and clinical findings in 19 pediatric patients with intracranial abscess are presented. Ten children presented with subdural empyema and nine had brain abscess. Sinusitis was present in 14 children, and dental abscess in two. The abscess was located in the frontal and parietal area in seven instances each, and in the temporal area in five. Anaerobic organisms alone were recovered in 12 (63%) of the patients (including eight with subdural empyema and four with brain abscess), aerobic bacteria alone were present in two children (11%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were present in five (26%) patients. There were 43 anaerobic isolates (2.3 per specimen). The predominant anaerobes were anaerobic Gram-positive cocci (16 isolates); Bacteroides sp. (10, including two B. fragilis); Fusobacterium sp. (nine isolates); and Actinomyces sp. (five isolates). A total of eight aerobic isolates (0.4 per specimen), including five Gram-positive cocci and three Haemophilus sp., were recovered. Antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients. Five patients, four with sinusitis and subdural empyema and one with sinusitis and brain abscess, did not respond to antimicrobial therapy and aspiration of the abscess, and required surgical drainage of their inflamed sinuses. These findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of intracranial abscess in children.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to nitroimidazoles.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility of 355 Swedish clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria to three nitroimidazole drugs was determined by the agar dilution method. The drugs were metronidazole, tinidazole and ornidazole. In addition the in vitro susceptibility of 32 strains of clostridium difficile to metronidazole was determined. Gram-negative rods and clostridia were inhibited by 4 microgram/ml or less of all three compounds except one strain of C. difficile, which was not inhibited by 16 microgram/ml of metronidazole. Against strains of the Bacteroides fragilis group, tinidazole was slightly more active than metronidazole and ornidazole. Only about 70% of anaerobic cocci (peptococci and peptostreptococci) were inhibited by 4 microgram/ml of the three drugs, whereas the remaining isolates were resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration greater than or equal to 8 microgram/ml). Anaerobic streptococci were not included in this material. Actinomyces, arachnia and propionibacteria were resistant to the nitroimidazole drugs. At achievable serum levels, nitroimidazoles inhibited the majority of anaerobic bacteria found with greatest frequency in anaerobic infections.
TI  - Chemical and physical differentiation of superoxide dismutases in anaerobes.
AB  - Superoxide dismutase activity in crude or partially purified cell extracts from several species and strains of obligate anaerobe Bacteroides was inhibited instantaneously by NaN3 and was inactivated rapidly upon incubation with H2O2. The extent of NaN3 inhibition varied from 41 to 93%, and the half-life of the enzymatic activity in 5 mM H2O2 ranged from 1.2 to 6.1 min, depending upon the organism tests. When grown in a defined medium containing 59Fe, Bacteroides fragilis (VPI 2393) incorporated radiolabel into a 40,000-molecular-weight NaN3- and H2O2-sensitive superoxide dismutase but did not incorporate 54Mn into that protein under similar growth conditions. The anaerobe Actinomyces naeslundii (VPI 9985) incorporated 54Mn but not 59Fe into a NaN3-insensitive and H2O2-resistant superoxide dismutase. The apparent molecular weight of the superoxide dismutase from this and several other Actinomyces spp. was estimated to be 110,000 to 140,000. Comparison of these data with studies of homogeneous metallosuperoxide dismutases suggests that the Bacteroides spp. studied contain a ferrisuperoxide dismutase, whereas Actinomyces spp. contain a managanisuperoxide dismutase.
TI  - Comparison of moxalactam (LY127935) and cefotaxime against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activities of moxalactam (LY127935 [6059S]) and cefotaxime were compared with those of cefoxitin, cefamandole, cefuroxime, carbenicillin, and penicillin by agar dilution susceptibility testing of a variety of anaerobic bacteria. Moxalactam proved to be the most active agent tested against Bacteroides fragilis and other species of the B. fragilis group. Moxalactam and cefotaxime showed activity similar to the other drugs against the remaining species of Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Actinomyces, Propionibacterium, and Veillonella. Penicillin was the most effective drug tested against most species of Clostridium, the anaerobic gram-positive cocci, and Eubacterium lentum.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria in late infections following orthopedic surgery.
AB  - Twelve patients with late anaerobic infection following hip or knee arthroplasty  or tibia osteosynthesis are presented. Peptococci (Peptococcus asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. prevotii) and peptostreptococci (Peptostreptococcus micros, P. anaerobius, P. parvulus) were present in nine of the cases. Anaerobic gram-positive or -negative rods were found in three cases (Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces israelii, and Bacteroides fragilis). Antibodies against the isolated bacteria were detected in sera of nine patients. Anaerobic bacteria seem to be responsible for some of the late reactions that may follow arthroplasty or osteosynthesis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of antituberculosis agents against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Anaerobic infections may coexist with tuberculosis, and can be mistaken for one another. The effect of therapy with antituberculosis chemotherapeutic agents against anaerobic bacteria (with the exception of rifampin) is unknown. We therefore examined the in vitro efficacy of certain commonly used antituberculosis agents (rifampin, isoniazid, and ethambutol) against 370 strains of anaerobic bacteria, including 86 isolates of Bacteroides fragilis. Rifampin at a concentration of 2 microgram/ml inhibited 91 percent of all anaerobic isolates. Both ethambutol and isoniazid were totally ineffective against any of the anaerobes tested, even at 64 microgram/ml. Therapy with rifampin in an unsuspected anaerobic infection can be misdiagnosed for tuberculosis. Therefore, when tuberculosis is suspected, isoniazid and ethambutol can be used and rifampin withheld until the acid-fast bacilli are demonstrated by additional diagnostic procedures, such as transtracheal aspiration.
TI  - Comparative susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria to metronidazole, ornidazole,  and SC-28538.
AB  - The susceptibilities of 284 anaerobic bacteria, including 55 strains of the Bacteroides fragilis group, were determined by an agar dilution technique to metronidazole and two newer nitroimidazoles, ornidazole and SC-28538. All three agents showed marked in vitro activity against virtually all anaerobic bacteria tested. At concentrations </=1 mug/ml, SC-28538 was significantly more active than either metronidazole or ornidazole. At concentrations of >1 mug/ml, the activities of all three agents were comparable. Propionibacterium and Actinomyces showed significant resistance to all three agents. Anaerobic and microaerophilic members of the genus Streptococcus were also often resistant, in contrast to Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus strains. In addition, the bactericidal activities of ornidazole and SC-28538 were determined against 27 strains of the B. fragilis group by a broth dilution technique. The minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentrations of each agent were very close. At concentrations of </=0.5 mug/ml, SC-28538 showed greater bactericidal activity; at concentrations of >/=2 mug/ml, the activies of both agents were similar.
TI  - Effect of sonic treatment on pure cultures and aggregates of bacteria.
AB  - Pure cultures of a variety of bacteria were treated with ultrasonic energy using  a sonic probe. Fractions of organisms killed at different sonic energies were calculated, and Streptococcus mutans was 600 times more resistant than Fusobacterium nucleatum, the most sensitive organism tested. The effects of sonic treatment on aggregates of bacteria were examined, and the results were interpreted as a model of the events that probably occur during the sonic dispersion of dental plaque.
