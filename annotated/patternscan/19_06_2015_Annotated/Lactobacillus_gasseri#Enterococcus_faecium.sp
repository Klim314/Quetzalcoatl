TI  == bacteriocin production, antibiotic susceptibility and prevalence of haemolytic and gelatinase activity in faecal lactic acid bacteria isolated from healthy ethiopian infants.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterise lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from faecal samples of healthy ethiopian infants, with emphasis on bacteriocin production and antibiotic susceptibility. one hundred fifty lab were  obtained from 28 healthy ethiopian infants. the isolates belonged to lactobacillus (81/150), enterococcus (54/150) and streptococcus (15/150) genera.  lactobacillus species were more abundant in the breast-fed infants while enterococcus dominated the mixed-fed population. bacteriocin-producing lab species were isolated from eight of the infants. many different bacteriocins were identified, including one new bacteriocin from streptococcus salivarius, avicin a (class iia) from enterococcus avium, one class iia bacteriocin from enterococcus  faecalis strains, one unknown bacteriocin from e. faecalis and two unknown bacteriocins from lactobacillus fermentum strains and the two-peptide gassericin  t from lactobacillus gasseri isolate. susceptibility tests performed for nine antibiotics suggest that some lactobacilli might have acquired resistance to erythromycin (3 %) and tetracycline (4 %) only. the streptococci were generally antibiotic sensitive except for penicillin, to which they showed intermediate resistance. all enterococci were susceptible to ampicillin while 13 % showed penicillin resistance. only one e. faecalis isolate was vancomycin-resistant. tetracycline (51 %) and erythromycin (26 %) resistance was prevalent among the enterococci, but multidrug resistance was confined to e. faecalis (47 %) and enterococcus faecium (33 %). screening of enterococcal virulence traits revealed  that 2 % were beta-haemolytic. the structural genes of cytolysin were detected in 28 % of the isolates in five enterococcal species, the majority being e. faecalis and enterococcus raffinosus. this study shows that bacteriocin production and antibiotic resistance is a common trait of faecal lab of ethiopian infants while  virulence factors occur at low levels.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly irish subjects.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects,  using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus),  gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to  growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.

TI  == are probiotics detectable in human feces after oral uptake by healthy volunteers?
AB  == goals: assessment of the presence of probiotic bacteria in feces after oral ingestion. background: probiotic bacteria are said to have beneficial effects on  the host. as a precondition for any effect, probiotic strains must survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract. study: the feces of seven volunteers  were analyzed for the presence of probiotic strains after one week's oral ingestion of each of six commercially available products: e. coli nissle 0.5-5 x  10(9) cells (mutaflor), enterococcus faecium sf 68 7.5 x 10(7) cells (bioflorin), lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium infantis both 1 x 10(9) cells (infloran), lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum both 1 x 10(8) cells (omniflora), lactobacillus casei rhamnosus 1 x 10(9) cells (antibiophilus), and yoghurt enriched with lactobacillus casei immunitas 1 x 10(10) cells (actimel). ten colonies were selected from each stool sample, and dna was extracted and typed using random amplification of polymorphic dna (rapd). typing patterns of the ingested probiotics and the fecal isolates were compared. results: fingerprints identical to the ingested probiotic strains were recovered from fecal samples of 4/7 volunteers after one week of mutaflor, from 4/6 after taking bioflorin, and from 1/6 after infloran. cultivation of strains of the same species from fecal specimens was negative after consumption of antibiophilus, omniflora and actimel. conclusions: after oral consumption of probiotics, e. coli and enterococci could be detected in stool samples (57% and 67%, respectively). in contrast, with only one exception, ingested lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could not be detected in human feces.

TI  == therapeutic value of a lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum fixed bacterium combination in acute diarrhea: a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial.
AB  == a multicenter, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial, involving 169 outpatients at 9 centers, was conducted to assess the efficacy of a fixed bacterium combination of lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum in the therapy of acute diarrhea. in particular, this clinical trial was designed to prove equivalent therapeutic efficacy of a fixed bacterium combination versus an exhaustive investigated mono-bacterium medicinal  product. all patients, free to carry on usual daily activities, received 1 capsule 3 times a day of either a fixed bacterium combination of lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum or enterococcus faecium mono-bacterium. all treatments were continued for a maximum of 6 days in line with the normal course  of acute diarrhea. primary efficacy criterion was the severity and duration of diarrhea assessed by the ensemble of stool frequency as change from baseline and  stool consistency at trial day 2, 3 and 4, and time in days until normal bowel function (recovery). the median duration of diarrhea was 2.70 days versus 2.67 days (fixed bacterium combination of lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum versus mono-bacterium enterococcus feacium). the total mean difference of  duration of diarrhea was 0.072 days. this result can be considered equivalent. however, the proportion of patients with complete recovery tended to be higher in the fixed bacterium combination group (92.6% versus 87.1%) resulting in a number  needed to treat (nnt) of 18.1. the fixed bacterium combination reduced the number of unformed stools by 80% and the mono-bacterium by 75% during the first 2 days of treatment. both treatments were well tolerated. oral therapy with a fixed combination of lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum shortens the duration and decreases the severity of acute self-limiting diarrhea in adults comparable to an effective mono-bacterium medicinal product. it therefore appears to be a useful and safe treatment for this disease.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == human milk is a source of lactic acid bacteria for the infant gut.
AB  == objectives: to investigate whether human breast milk contains potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria, and therefore, whether it can be considered a synbiotic food. study design lactic acid bacteria were isolated from milk, mammary areola, and breast skin of eight healthy mothers and oral swabs and feces of their respective breast-fed infants. some isolates (178 from each mother and newborn pair) were randomly selected and submitted to randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) polymerase chain reaction analysis, and those that displayed identical rapd patterns were identified by 16s rdna sequencing. results: within each mother and newborn pair, some rod-shaped lactic acid bacteria isolated from mammary areola, breast milk, and infant oral swabs and feces displayed identical rapd profiles. all of them, independently from the mother and child pair, were identified as lactobacillus gasseri. similarly, among coccoid lactic acid bacteria from these different sources, some shared an identical rapd pattern and were identified as enterococcus faecium. in contrast,  none of the lactic acid bacteria isolated from breast skin shared rapd profiles with lactic acid bacteria of the other sources. conclusions: breast-feeding can be a significant source of lactic acid bacteria to the infant gut. lactic acid bacteria present in milk may have an endogenous origin and may not be the result  of contamination from the surrounding breast skin.

TI  == taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.
