TI  - Three-phase succession of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria to reach a stable ecosystem within seven days of natural bamboo shoot fermentation as revealed by different molecular approaches.
AB  - Microbial community structure and population dynamics during spontaneous bamboo shoot fermentation for production of 'soidon' (indigenous fermented food) in North East India were studied using cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent molecular approaches. Cultivation-dependent analyzes (PCR amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis and rRNA gene sequencing) and cultivation-independent analyzes (PCR-DGGE, qPCR and Illumina amplicon sequencing) were conducted on the time series samples collected from three independent indigenous soidon fermentation batches. The current findings revealed three-phase succession of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria to attain a stable ecosystem within 7 days natural fermentation of bamboo shoots. Weissella spp. (Weissella cibaria, uncultured Weissella ghanensis) and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris predominated the early phase (1 - 2 days) which was joined by Leuconostoc citreum during the mid phase (3 days), while Lactobacillus brevis and Lactobacillus plantarum emerged and became dominant in the late phase (5 - 7 days) with concurrent disappearance of W. cibaria and L. lactis subsp. cremoris. Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and uncultured Lactobacillus acetotolerans were predominantly present throughout the fermentation with no visible dynamics. The above identified dominant bacterial species along with their dynamics can be effectively utilized for designing a starter culture for industrialization of soidon production. Our results showed that a more realistic view on the microbial ecology of soidon fermentation could be obtained by cultivation-dependent studies complemented with cultivation-independent molecular approaches. Moreover, the critical issues to be considered for reducing methodological biases while studying the microbial ecology of traditional food fermentation were also highlighted with this soidon fermentation model.

TI  - Identification and antimicrobial activity detection of lactic Acid bacteria isolated from corn stover silage.
AB  - A total of 59 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains were isolated from corn stover silage. According to phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences and recA gene polymerase chain reaction amplification, these LAB isolates were identified as five species: Lactobacillus (L.) plantarum subsp. plantarum, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Enterococcus mundtii, Weissella cibaria and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, respectively. Those strains were also screened for antimicrobial activity using a dual-culture agar plate assay. Based on excluding the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide, two L. plantarum subsp. plantarum strains ZZU 203 and 204, which strongly inhibited Salmonella enterica ATCC 43971(T), Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698(T) and Escherichia coli ATCC 11775(T) were selected for further research on sensitivity of the antimicrobial substance to heat, pH and protease. Cell-free culture supernatants of the two strains exhibited strong heat stability (60 min at 100 degrees C), but the antimicrobial activity was eliminated after treatment at 121 degrees C for 15 min. The antimicrobial substance remained active under acidic condition (pH 2.0 to 6.0), but became inactive under neutral and alkaline condition (pH 7.0 to 9.0). In addition, the antimicrobial activities of these two strains decreased remarkably after digestion by protease K. These results preliminarily suggest that the desirable antimicrobial activity of strains ZZU 203 and 204 is the result of the production of a bacteriocin-like substance, and these two strains with antimicrobial activity could be used as silage additives to inhibit proliferation of unwanted microorganism during ensiling and preserve nutrients of silage. The nature of the antimicrobial substances is being investigated in our laboratory.
TI  - Construction of a shuttle vector based on the small cryptic plasmid pJY33 from Weissella cibaria 33.
AB  - A cryptic plasmid, pJY33, from Weissella cibaria 33 was characterized. pJY33 was  2365 bp in size with a GC content of 41.27% and contained two putative open reading frames (ORFs). orf1 encoded a putative hypothetical protein of 134 amino acids. orf2 was 849 bp in size, and its putative translation product exhibited 87% identity with a replication initiation factor from a plasmid from W. cibaria KLC140. A Weissella-Escherichia coli shuttle vector, pJY33E (6.5 kb, Em(r)), was constructed by ligation of pJY33 with pBluescript II SK(-) and an erythromycin resistance gene (Em(r)). pJY33E replicated in Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Weissella confusa. A single-stranded DNA intermediate was detected from Lb. brevis 2.14 harbouring pJY33E, providing evidence for rolling-circle replication of pJY33. Most Lb. brevis 2.14 cells (85.9%) retained pJY33E after one week of daily culturing in MRS broth without Em. An aga gene encoding alpha-galactosidase (alpha-Gal) from Leuconostoc mesenteroides was successfully expressed in Lb. brevis 2.14 using pJY33E, and the highest level of alpha-Gal activity (36.13 U/mg protein) was observed when cells were grown on melibiose.
TI  - Cancer Preventive Potential of Kimchi Lactic Acid Bacteria (Weissella cibaria, Lactobacillus plantarum).
AB  - The number of death due to cancer has been increasing in Korea. Chemotherapy is known to cause side effects because it damages not only cancerous cells but healthy cells. Recently, attention has focused on food-derived chemopreventive and anti-tumor agents or formulations with fewer side effects. Kimchi, most popular and widely consumed in Korea, contains high levels of lactic acid bacteria and has been shown to possess chemopreventive effects. This review focuses on Weissella cibaria and Lactobacillus plantarum, the representatives of kimchi lactic acid bacteria, in terms of their abilities to prevent cancer. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms by which lactic acid bacteria in kimchi prevent carcinogenic processes and improve immune functions.
TI  - Halotolerance and survival kinetics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from jalapeno pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) fermentation.
AB  - The microbiota associated with spontaneous fermentation of vegetables in a saline substrate may represent an important group of bacteria in the food industry. In this work, the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) Weissella cibaria, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paraplantarum, and Leuconostoc citreum were identified by partial 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. In addition, entophytic bacteria such as Pantoea eucalypti, Pantoea anthophila, Enterobacter cowanii, and Enterobacter asburiae were detected, but they were irrelevant for the fermentation process and were inhibited after 12 h of fermentation when the pH decreased from 6.5 to 4.9. Moreover, 2 species of yeast were isolated and identified as Hanseniaspora pseudoguilliermondii and Kodamaea ohmeri by their partial 26S rRNA gene sequence. The growth of LAB was evaluated at different sodium chloride contents. L. citreum was the most halotolerant species followed by L. plantarum and W. cibaria with a concentration index to obtain a 50% population reduction (IC(50)) of 7.2%, 6.6%, and 5.2%, respectively. Furthermore, the growth of LAB and Escherichia coli O157:H7 was evaluated in the presence of the main phenylpropanoids from chilli peppers such as p-coumaric and ferulic acid. It was determined that LAB can grow in both acids at 4 mM, unlike E. coli O157:H7, whose growth is inhibited in the presence of these acids.
TI  - Multivariate analysis of buckwheat sourdough fermentations for metabolic screening of starter cultures.
AB  - This study investigated the metabolic activity of 35 strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which were able to grow in buckwheat sourdoughs and delivers a detailed explanation of LAB metabolism in that environment. To interpret the high-dimensional dataset, descriptive statistics and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were used. Heterofermentative LAB showed a clear different metabolism than facultative (f.) heterofermentative and homofermentative LAB, which were more similar. Heterofermentative LAB were mainly characterized by high free SH groups and acetic acid production; they were also able to consume arabinose and glucose. Homofermenters were mainly characterized by lower free amino nitrogen content and they did not show a good capacity to consume arabinose and fructose. Except for the heterofermentative Weissella cibaria strain, only homofermentative strains showed high ornithine yields. Some f. heterofermentative strains differed from homofermentative due to the high lactic acid production as well as low glucose and arginine consumption. LAB containing more genes encoding peptidase activities and genes involved in aroma production showed a high consumption of free amino acids. Strain-dependent activities could be clearly distinguished from group dependent ones (homofermentative, f. heterofermentative and heterofermentative), e.g., some Lactobacillus paracasei and Lactobacillus plantarum strains showed the highest carbohydrate consumption. However, some microbial activities were more strain-dependent than group-dependent. Multivariate analysis of raw data delivered a detailed and clear explanation of LAB metabolism in buckwheat sourdough fermentations.
TI  - Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of some lactic Acid bacteria isolated from bee pollen: a preliminary study.
AB  - In the present work, five hundred and sixty-seven isolates of lactic acid bacteria were recovered from raw bee pollen grains. All isolates were screened for their antagonistic activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. Neutralized supernatants of 54 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) cultures from 216 active isolates inhibited the growth of indicator bacteria. They were phenotypically characterized, based on the fermentation of 39 carbohydrates. Using the simple matching coefficient and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages (UPGMA), seven clusters with other two members were defined at the 79% similarity level. The following species were characterized: Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactococcus lactis, Pediococcus acidilactici, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and unidentified lactobacilli. Phenotypic characteristics of major and minor clusters were also identified. Partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene of representative isolates from each cluster was performed, and ten strains were assigned to seven species: Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus ingluviei, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillus acidipiscis and Weissella cibaria. The molecular method used failed to determine the exact taxonomic status of BH0900 and AH3133.
TI  - Use of sourdough fermentation and mixture of wheat, chickpea, lentil and bean flours for enhancing the nutritional, texture and sensory characteristics of white bread.
AB  - This study aimed at investigating the addition of legume (chickpea, lentil and bean) flours to wheat flour bread. Type I sourdough containing legumes or wheat-legume flours were prepared and propagated (back slopped) in laboratory, according to traditional protocols that are routinely used for making typical Italian breads. Based on kinetic of acidification and culture-dependent data, the wheat-legume sourdough was further characterized and selected for bread making. As determined by RAPD-PCR and partial sequencing of 16S rDNA gene analyses, lactic acid bacteria in wheat-legume sourdough included Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus fermentum, Weissella cibaria, Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactobacillus coryneformis, Lactobacillus rossiae, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus parabuchneri and Lactobacillus paraplantarum. Two breads containing 15% (w/w) of legume (chickpea, lentil and bean) flours were produced using selected wheat-legume sourdough (WLSB) and traditional wheat sourdough (WSB). Compared to wheat yeasted bread (WYB), the level of total free amino acids (FAA) was higher in WSB and WLSB. Phytase and antioxidant activities were the highest in WLSB. Compared to bread WYB, the addition of legume flours decreased the in vitro protein digestibility (IVPD) (WYB versus WSB). However, the dough fermentation with WSLB favored an increase of IVPD. According to the levels of carbohydrates, dietary fibers and resistant starch, WSB and WLSB showed lower values of hydrolysis index (HI) compared to WYB. As showed by texture and image analyses and sensory evaluation of breads, a good acceptability was found for WSB and, especially, WLSB breads.
TI  - Influence of sourdough on in vitro starch digestibility and predicted glycemic indices of gluten-free breads.
AB  - Gluten-free flours (buckwheat, quinoa, sorghum and teff) were fermented using obligate heterofermentative strain Weissella cibaria MG1 (Wc) and facultative heterofermentative Lactobacillus plantarum FST1.7 (Lp). Starch hydrolysis of breads with and without sourdough (controls) was analyzed in vitro using enzymatic digestion followed by dialysis (10-11 kDa). Hydrolysis indices as well as predicted glycemic indices (pGI) were calculated from reducing sugars released into the dialysate. Amounts of resistant starch (RS; % of total starch) were determined by enzymatic digestion. Upon sourdough addition, RS significantly decreased in buckwheat (Wc 1.28%, Lp 1.44%) and teff sourdough breads (Wc 0.87%, Lp 0.98%) in comparison to their controls (2.01% and 1.92%, respectively). However, no correlation was found with starch hydrolysis. Predicted GIs were reduced upon sourdough addition in wheat (ctrl 100; Wc 85; Lp 76) in comparison to control breads. This was not the case in most gluten-free breads with the exception of sorghum (ctrl 72; Lp 69) and teff sourdough breads (ctrl 74; Lp 68). In contrast, increased pGIs were found in quinoa (ctrl 95; Wc 106; Lp 103) and buckwheat sourdough breads (ctrl 80; Wc 89; Lp 86).
TI  - Diversity and technological potential of lactic acid bacteria of wheat flours.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were analysed from wheat flours used in traditional bread making throughout Sicily (southern Italy). Plate counts, carried out in three different media commonly used to detect food and sourdough LAB, revealed a maximal LAB concentration of approximately 4.75 Log CFU g(-1). Colonies representing various morphological appearances were isolated and differentiated based on phenotypic characteristics and genetic analysis by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR. Fifty unique strains were identified. Analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing grouped the strains into 11 LAB species, which belonged to six genera: Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus and Weissella. Weissella cibaria, Lactobacillus plantarum, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides and Leuconostoc citreum were the most prevalent species. The strains were not geographically related. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of total DNA of flour was used to provide a more complete understanding of the LAB population; it confirmed the presence of species identified with the culture-dependent approach, but did not reveal the presence of any additional LAB species. Finally, the technological characteristics (acidifying capacity, antimicrobial production, proteolytic activity, organic acid, and volatile organic compound generation) of the 50 LAB strains were investigated. Eleven strains were selected for future in situ applications.
TI  - Bacteriophage ecology in a commercial cucumber fermentation.
AB  - To reduce high-salt waste from cucumber fermentations, low-salt fermentations are under development. These fermentations may require the use of starter cultures to ensure normal fermentations. Because potential phage infection can cause starter culture failure, it is important to understand phage ecology in the fermentations. This study investigated the phage ecology in a commercial cucumber fermentation. Brine samples taken from a fermentation tank over a 90-day period were plated onto deMan-Rogosa-Sharpe agar plates. A total of 576 lactic acid bacterial isolates were randomly selected to serve as potential hosts for phage isolation. Filtered brine served as a phage source. Fifty-seven independent phage isolates were obtained, indicating that 10% of the bacterial isolates were sensitive to phage attack. Phage hosts include Lactobacillus brevis (67% of all hosts), Lactobacillus plantarum (21%), Weissella paramesenteroides, Weissella cibaria, and Pediococcus ethanolidurans. Nearly 50% of phages were isolated on day 14, and the majority of them attacked L. brevis. Some phages had a broad host range and were capable of infecting multiple hosts in two genera. Other phages were species specific or strain specific. About 30% of phage isolates produced turbid pinpoint plaques or only caused reduced cell growth on the bacterial lawns. Six phages with distinct host ranges were characterized. The data from this study showed that abundant and diverse phages were present in the commercial cucumber fermentation, which could cause significant mortality to the lactic acid bacteria population. Therefore, a phage control strategy may be needed in low-salt cucumber fermentations.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of lactic acid bacteria from pobuzihi (fermented cummingcordia), a traditional fermented food in Taiwan.
AB  - Lactobacillus pobuzihii is a novel species which has been previously found in pobuzihi (fermented cummingcordia), a traditional fermented food in Taiwan. However, the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) microflora in pobuzihi has not been studied in detail. In this study, LAB from pobuzihi were isolated, identified, and characterized. A total of 196 LAB were isolated; 79 cultures were isolated from the sample collected from a manufacturing factory, 38 from pobuzihi samples collected from 4 different markets, and 79 from 2 fresh cummingcordia samples. These isolates were characterized phenotypically and then divided into eight groups (A to H) by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA. Lactobacillus plantarum was the most abundant LAB found in most samples during the fermentation of pobuzihi. On the other hand, Enterococcus casseliflavus and Weissella cibaria were, respectively, the major species found in the two fresh cummingcordia samples. A potential novel species or subspecies of lactococcal strain was found. In addition, seven L. plantarum and five W. cibaria strains showed inhibitory activity against the indicator strain Lactobacillus sakei JCM 1157(T). This is the first report describing the distribution and varieties of LAB existing in the pobuzihi during its fermentation process and the final product on the market.
TI  - Influence of artisan bakery- or laboratory-propagated sourdoughs on the diversity of lactic acid bacterium and yeast microbiotas.
AB  - Seven mature type I sourdoughs were comparatively back-slopped (80 days) at artisan bakery and laboratory levels under constant technology parameters. The cell density of presumptive lactic acid bacteria and related biochemical features were not affected by the environment of propagation. On the contrary, the number of yeasts markedly decreased from artisan bakery to laboratory propagation. During late laboratory propagation, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) showed that the DNA band corresponding to Saccharomyces cerevisiae was no longer detectable in several sourdoughs. Twelve species of lactic acid bacteria were variously identified through a culture-dependent approach. All sourdoughs harbored a certain number of species and strains, which were dominant throughout time and, in several cases, varied depending on the environment of propagation. As shown by statistical permutation analysis, the lactic acid bacterium populations differed among sourdoughs propagated at artisan bakery and laboratory levels. Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, and Weissella cibaria dominated in only some sourdoughs back-slopped at artisan bakeries, and Leuconostoc citreum seemed to be more persistent under laboratory conditions. Strains of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis were indifferently found in some sourdoughs. Together with the other stable species and strains, other lactic acid bacteria temporarily contaminated the sourdoughs and largely differed between artisan bakery and laboratory levels. The environment of propagation has an undoubted influence on the composition of sourdough yeast and lactic acid bacterium microbiotas.
TI  - Monitoring of the microbial communities involved in the soy sauce manufacturing process by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - Soy sauce is a traditional seasoning produced through the fermentation of soybeans and wheat using microbes. In this study, the microbial communities involved in the soy sauce manufacturing process were analyzed by PCR-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). The bacterial DGGE profile indicated that the bacterial microbes in the koji were Weissella cibaria (Weissella confusa, Weissella kimchii, Weissella salipiscis, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus iners, or Streptococcus thermophilus), Staphylococcus gallinarum (or Staphylococcus xylosus), and Staphylococcus kloosii. In addition to these bacteria, Tetragenococcus halophilus was also detected in the mash during lactic acid fermentation. The fungal DGGE profile indicated that the fungal microbes in the koji were not only Aspergillus oryzae but also several yeasts. In the mash, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii appeared in the early fermentation stage, Candida etchellsii (or Candida nodaensis) and Candida versatilis were detected at the middle fermentation stage, and Candida etchellsii was detected at the mature fermentation stage. These results suggest that the microbial communities present during the soy sauce manufacturing process change drastically throughout its production. This is the first report to reveal the microbial communities involved in the soy sauce manufacturing process using a culture-independent method.
TI  - Newly isolated lactic acid bacteria with probiotic features for potential application in food industry.
AB  - Five newly isolated lactic acid bacteria were identified as Weissella cibaria, Enterococcus faecium, and three different strains of Lactobacillus plantarum by 16S rRNA sequencing. Essential probiotic requirements of these isolates such as tolerance to phenol, low pH, high sodium chloride, and bile salt concentration were checked. Efficiency in adherence to mucin and hydrophobicity of the bacterial cell were also evaluated by in vitro studies. Antimicrobial activities against some pathogens were tried, and the sensitivity of these strains against 25 different antibiotics was also checked. Further studies revealed Weissella and Enterococcus as substantial producers of folic acid. Folate is involved as a cofactor in many metabolic reactions, and it has to be an essential component in the human diet. The folate level in the fermented samples was determined by microbiological assay using Lactobacillus casei NCIM 2364 as indicator strain. The three strains of L. plantarum showed significant inhibitory activity against various fungi that commonly contaminate food stuffs indicating their potential as a biopreservative of food material.
TI  - Isolation and characterisation of lactic acid bacteria from jiang-gua (fermented  cucumbers), a traditional fermented food in Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Jiang-gua (fermented cucumbers) is a popular traditional fermented food in Taiwan. The microflora of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in jiang-gua have not been investigated in detail. In this study, LAB from jiang-gua were isolated, characterised and identified. RESULTS: A total of 103 LAB were isolated; 70 cultures were isolated from jiang-gua samples and 33 cultures were isolated from its raw substrate, cucumber. These isolates were mainly characterised phenotypically and then divided into seven groups (A-G) by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA. The isolates were identified as Enterococcus casseliflavus, Leuconostoc lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paraplantarum, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Weissella cibaria and Weissella hellenica. The antibacterial activities of the isolates were determined and 11 Lc. lactis subsp. lactis strains showed inhibitory activity against the indicator strain Lactobacillus sakei JCM 1157(T) . CONCLUSION: Heterofermentative W. cibaria and Leu. lactis were the major LAB found in jiang-gua samples without soy sauce. In soy sauce-added samples, homofermentative L. pentosus and L. plantarum were the most abundant LAB. In addition, the results also suggested that HhaI and RsaI restriction enzymes could be applied to distinguish W. hellenica and Weissella paramesenteroides.
TI  - Assessment of bacterial diversity in selected Philippine fermented food products  through PCR-DGGE.
AB  - The bacterial population in several Philippine fermented food preparations was assessed by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) of the 16S rRNA gene (16S rDNA). Genomic DNA was isolated directly from alamang (fermented shrimp paste), burong isda (fermented fish and rice), burong hipon (fermented shrimp and rice), burong mustasa (fermented mustard leaves), tuba (sugar cane wine), suka (vinegar) and sinamak (spiced vinegar) using one of two protocols, namely - MoBio DNA Extraction Kit procedure and a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-based method. Samples recalcitrant to both methods underwent enrichment in three culture broths prior to DNA isolation. Isolated DNA was amplified using nested primer pairs targeting the bacterial 16S rDNA. PCR products were subjected to DGGE to elucidate the bacterial diversity in each fermented food. 16S rDNA sequence analyses revealed that lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and acetic acid bacteria (AAB) were dominant in the food samples. The LAB identified were Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus panis, Lactobacillus pontis and Weissella cibaria. Identified AAB were Acetobacter pomorum, Acetobacter ghanensis, Acetobacter orientalis, and Acetobacter pasteurianus. Among these, L. fermentum, L. plantarum and W. cibaria are established probiotic bacteria, while L. panis and L. pontis are potential probiotic bacteria. This finding would increase the appeal and significance of local fermented foods to consumers. Furthermore, the majority of the identified bacteria in the study have not been reported before in culture-dependent studies of similar food preparations. As such, some of the bacterial 16S rDNA obtained were cloned to have an initial partial bacterial 16S rDNA library for Philippine fermented foods.
TI  - Identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from corn stovers.
AB  - One hundred and twenty-six strains were isolated from corn stover in Henan Province, China, of which 105 isolates were considered to be lactic acid bacteria (LAB) according to Gram-positive, catalase-negative and mainly metabolic lactic acid product. Analysis of the 16S ribosomal DNA sequence of 21 representative strains was used to confirm the presence of the predominant groups and to determine the phylogenetic affiliation of isolates. The sequences from the various LAB isolates showed high degrees of similarity to those of the GenBank type strains between 99.4% and 100%. The prevalent LAB, predominantly Lactobacillus (85.6%), consisted of L. plantarum (33.3%), L. pentosus (28.6%) and L. brevis (23.7%). Other LAB species as Leuconostoc lactis (4.8%), Weissella cibaria (4.8%) and Enterococcus mundtii (4.8%) also presented in corn stover. The present study is the first to fully document corn stover-associated LAB involved in the silage fermentation. The identification results revealed LAB composition inhabiting corn stover and enabling the future design of appropriate inoculants aimed at improving the fermentation quality of silage.
TI  - Antifungal activity of 2 lactic acid bacteria of the Weissella genus isolated from food.
AB  - In the present study, a total of 116 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains isolated  from Mill flour and fermented cassava were screened for their antifungal activity. Three strains among 116 were selected for their strongest inhibitory activity against food molds. These 3 strains were Lactobacillus plantarum VE56, Weissella cibaria FMF4B16, and W. paramesenteroides LC11. The compounds responsible for the antifungal activity were investigated. The strains displayed an inhibitory activity against targeted molds at acidic pH. However, the influence of organic acids was rejected according to the calculated minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). Antifungal compounds were investigated in the cell-free supernatants and phenyllactic acid (PLA) was detected in different amounts with a maximal concentration for Lb. plantarum VE56 (0.56 mM). Hydroxy fatty acid, such as 2-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoic acid, was also produced and involved in the inhibitory activity of Lb. plantarum VE56 and W. paramesenteroides LC11. Antifungal LAB are known to produce PLA and 3-hydroxy fatty acids and other organic acids with antifungal activity. This short communication focuses on antifungal activity from Weissella genus. The antifungal activity was attributed to antifungal compounds identified such as PLA, 2-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoic acid, and other organic acids. Nevertheless, the concentration produced in the cell-free supernatant was too low to compare to their MIC, suggesting that the inhibitory activity was caused by a synergy of these different compounds. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Antifungal LAB are interesting to prevent food spoilage in fermented food and prolong their shelf life. In this way, chemical preservatives could be avoided and replaced by natural preservatives.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in Mongolia.
AB  - Spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in Mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. The objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in Mongolia. The LAB counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/mL. Fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of LAB, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. In total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe agar and M17 agar. Each isolate was considered to be presumptive LAB based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multiplex PCR assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. All isolates from Mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as Enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), Enterococcus durans (3 strains), Lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), Lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), Lactobacillus casei (16 strains), Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), Lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), Lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), Lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), Lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), Lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), Leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), Streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and Weissella cibaria (1 strain). The predominant LAB were Strep. thermophilus and Lb. helveticus, which were isolated from all sampling sites. The results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of Mongolia have complex compositions of LAB species. Such diversity of LAB provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.
TI  - Effect of lactic acid fermentation on antioxidant, texture, color and sensory properties of red and green smoothies.
AB  - Weissella cibaria, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sp. and Lactobacillus pentosus were variously identified from blackberries, prunes, kiwifruits, papaya and fennels by partial 16S rRNA gene sequence. Representative isolates from each plant species were screened based on the kinetics of growth on fruit juices. A protocol for processing and storage of red and green smoothies (RS and GS) was set up, which included fermentation by selected lactic acid bacteria starters and exo-polysaccharide producing strains. Starters grew and remained viable at ca. 9.0 log cfu g(-1) during 30 days of storage at 4 degrees C. No contaminating Enterobacteriaceae and yeast were found throughout storage. Values of soluble solids, total titratable acidity and viscosity distinguished started RS and GS compared to spontaneously (unstarted) fermented smoothies. Color difference dE *(ab) and browning index were positively affected by lactic acid fermentation. Consumption of carbohydrates by lactic acid bacteria was limited as well as it was the lactic fermentation. Consumption of malic acid was evident throughout storage. Polyphenolic compounds and, especially, ascorbic acid were better preserved in started RS and GS compared to unstarted samples. This reflected on the free radical scavenging activity. A statistical correlation was only found between the level of ascorbic acid and free radical scavenging activity. As shown by a fi rst-order equation, the rate of degradation of ascorbic acid through storage were found to be higher in the unstarted compared to started RS and GS. Fermentation by lactic acid bacteria clearly improved the sensory attributes of RS and GS.
TI  - Isolation and characterisation of lactic acid bacteria from yan-jiang (fermented  ginger), a traditional fermented food in Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Yan-jiang (fermented ginger) is a popular traditional fermented food  in Taiwan. The lactic acid bacteria (LAB) microflora in yan-jiang has not been studied in detail. In this study, LAB from yan-jiang were isolated, characterised and identified. RESULTS: A total of 176 LAB were isolated; 160 cultures were isolated from yan-jiang samples and 16 cultures were isolated from raw ginger. These isolates were characterised phenotypically and then divided into nine groups (A to I) by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA. Lactobacillus sakei and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis were the major LAB found in the initial 2 days of fermentation without pickled plums; these species were mostly replaced by Weissella cibaria and L. plantarum after 3 days of fermentation. In the fermentation bucket with added pickled plums, W. cibaria was the most abundant LAB found during fermentation. The antibacterial activities of the isolates were determined. Twenty-four Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and 19 W. cibaria strains showed inhibitory activity against the indicator strain L. sakei JCM 1157(T) . CONCLUSION: Results demonstrate that various LAB species were more numerous when fermentation was carried out without pickled plums. LAB also had effects on the aroma and flavour of yan-jiang.
TI  - Biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in spontaneously-fermented buckwheat and teff sourdoughs.
AB  - In this study, four different laboratory scale gluten-free (GF) sourdoughs were developed from buckwheat or teff flours. The fermentations were initiated by the spontaneous biota of the flours and developed under two technological conditions (A and B). Sourdoughs were propagated by continuous back-slopping until the stability was reached. The composition of the stable biota occurring in each sourdough was assessed using both culture-dependent and -independent techniques. Overall, a broad spectrum of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts species, belonging mainly to the genera Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, Kazachstania and Candida, were identified in the stable sourdoughs. Buckwheat and teff sourdoughs were dominated mainly by obligate or facultative heterofermentative LAB, which are commonly associated with traditional wheat or rye sourdoughs. However, the spontaneous fermentation of the GF flours resulted also in the selection of species which are not consider endemic to traditional sourdoughs, i.e. Pediococcus pentosaceus, Leuconostoc holzapfelii, Lactobacillus gallinarum, Lactobacillus vaginalis, Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus graminis and Weissella cibaria. In general, the composition of the stable biota was strongly affected by the fermentation conditions, whilst Lactobacillus plantarum dominated in all buckwheat sourdoughs. Lactobacillus pontis is described for the first time as dominant species in teff sourdough. Among yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida glabrata dominated teff sourdoughs, whereas the solely Kazachstania barnetti was isolated in buckwheat sourdough developed under condition A. This study allowed the identification and isolation of LAB and yeasts species which are highly competitive during fermentation of buckwheat or teff flours. Representatives of these species can be selected as starters for the production of sourdough destined to GF bread production.
TI  - Diversity and dynamics of bacterial populations during spontaneous sorghum fermentations used to produce ting, a South African food.
AB  - Ting is a spontaneously fermented sorghum food that is popular for its sour taste and unique flavour. Insight of the microbial diversity and population dynamics during sorghum fermentations is an essential component of the development of starter cultures for commercial production of ting. In this study, bacterial populations associated with spontaneous sorghum fermentations were examined using a culture-independent strategy based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequence analysis of V3-16S rRNA gene amplicons, and a culture-dependent strategy using conventional isolation based on culturing followed by 16S rRNA and/or pheS gene sequence analysis. The entire fermentation process was monitored over a 54 h period and two phases were observed with respect to pH evolution and microbial succession. The first phase of the process (0-6h) was characterized by relatively high pH conditions and the presence of Enterococcus mundtii, albeit that this species was only detected with the culture-dependent approach. The second phase of the fermentation process (12-54 h) was characterized by increased acidity and the predominance of a broader range of lactic acid bacteria, including Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Weissella cibaria, Enterococcus faecalis, and a close relative of Lactobacillus curvatus, as well as some members of the Enterobacteriaceae family. The Lb. curvatus-like species was only detected with PCR-DGGE, while the majority of the other species was only detected using the culture-dependent approach. These findings highlighted the fact that a combination of both approaches was essential in revealing the microbial diversity and dynamics during spontaneous sorghum fermentations.
TI  - Natural populations of lactic acid bacteria associated with silage fermentation as determined by phenotype, 16S ribosomal RNA and recA gene analysis.
AB  - One hundred and fifty-six strains isolated from corn (Zea mays L.), forage paddy  rice (Oryza sativa L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) silages prepared on dairy farms were screened, of which 110 isolates were considered to be lactic acid bacteria (LAB) according to their Gram-positive and catalase-negative characteristics and, mainly, the lactic acid metabolic products. These isolates were divided into eight groups (A-H) based on the following properties: morphological and biochemical characteristics, gamma-aminobutyric acid production capacity, and 16S rRNA gene sequences. They were identified as Weissella cibaria (36.4%), Weissella confusa (9.1%), Leuconostoc citreum (5.3%), Leuconostoc lactis (4.9%), Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (8.0%), Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (4.5%), Lactobacillus paraplantarum (4.5%) and Lactobacillus plantarum (27.3%). W. cibaria and W. confusa were mainly present in corn silages, and L. plantarum was dominant on sorghum and forage paddy rice silages, while L. pseudomesenteroides, L. plantarum and L. paraplantarum were the dominant species in alfalfa silage. The corn, sorghum and forage paddy rice silages were well preserved with lower pH values and ammonia-N concentrations, but had higher lactic acid content, while the alfalfa silage had relatively poor quality with higher pH values and ammonia-N concentrations, and lower lactic acid content. The present study confirmed the diversity of LAB species inhabiting silages. It showed that the differing natural populations of LAB on these silages might influence fermentation quality. These results will enable future research on the relationship between LAB species and silage fermentation quality, and will enhance the screening of appropriate inoculants aimed at improving such quality.
TI  - Isolation and characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ripe mulberries in Taiwan.
AB  - The objective of this study was to isolate, characterize, and identify lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from ripe mulberries collected in Taiwan. Ripe mulberry samples were collected at five mulberry farms, located in different counties of Taiwan. Eighty-eight acid-producing cultures were isolated from these samples, and isolates were divided into classes first by phenotype, then into groups by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Phenotypic and biochemical characteristics led to identification of four bacterial groups (A to D). Weissella cibaria was the most abundant type of LAB distributed in four mulberry farms, and Lactobacillus plantarum was the most abundant LAB found in the remaining farm. Ten W. cibaria and one Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis isolate produced bacteriocins against the indicator strain Lactobacillus sakei JCM 1157(T). These results suggest that various LAB are distributed in ripe mulberries and W. cibaria was the most abundant LAB found in this study.
TI  - Probiotic table olives: microbial populations adhering on olive surface in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain Lactobacillus paracasei IMPC2.1 in an industrial plant.
AB  - This study reports the dynamics of microbial populations adhering on the surface  of debittered green olives cv. Bella di Cerignola in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain Lactobacillus paracasei IMPC2.1 in different brining conditions (4% and 8% (w/v) NaCl) at room temperature and 4 degrees C. The probiotic strain successfully colonized the olive surface dominating the natural LAB population and decreasing the pH of brines to <or=5.0 after 30 days until the end of fermentation. The dynamics of microbial populations associated with olive surface and belonging to the different groups indicated that inoculated olives held at room temperature did not host Enterobacteriaceae at the end of fermentation. Yeast populations were present in a low number (<or=log(10) 5.7 CFU/g) throughout the process. A considerable genetic diversity of LAB species colonizing the olive surface was found mainly in inoculated set brined in 8% NaCl, as indicated by the Shannon diversity index calculated for each set. Generally, strains of Lactobacillus coryniformis, L. paracasei, L. plantarum, L. pentosus, L. rhamnosus, L. brevis, L. mali, L. vaccinostercus, L.casei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuc. pseudomesenteroides, Lactococcus lactis, Weissella paramesenteroides, W. cibaria, Enterococcus casseliflavus group and E. italicus were identified during the whole process. In particular, L. pentosus was the most frequently isolated species and it showed a high strain diversity throughout fermentation in all processes except for the one held at 4 degrees C. Also a notable incidence of Leuc. mesenteroides on olives was highlighted in this study during all fermentation. Results indicated that the human strain L. paracasei IMPC2.1 can be considered an example of a strain used in the dual role of starter and probiotic culture which allowed the control of fermentation processes and the realization of a final probiotic product with functional appeal.
TI  - Identification of lactic acid bacteria associated with the production of plaa-som, a traditional fermented fish product of Thailand.
AB  - Plaa-som is a Thai fermented fish product for which whole fish or fish fillets are fermented with either cooked rice or steamed sticky rice, salt, and garlic. A total of 762 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated during plaa-som fermentation by culture on CaCO(3)-MRS agar plates. They were screened and grouped by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), giving six groups that were identified by ribosomal DNA sequencing as Lactococcus garvieae, Streptococcus bovis, Weissella cibaria, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus fermentum. Freshly mixed ingredients contained low populations of LAB (less than 10 CFU/g) that subsequently grew during fermentation to final populations of approximately 10(7)CFU/g. Early stages of the process were dominated by the presence of Lc. garvieae, S. bovis, and W. cibaria. At 48 h into fermentation, W. cibaria, P. pentosaceus, and Lb. plantarum were prevalent, and gave way to a dominance of Lb. plantarum that completed the fermentation. A mixture of these LAB species could be considered as species for development of a starter culture for plaa-som fermentation.
TI  - Genotypic diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from African traditional alkaline-fermented foods.
AB  - AIM: To identify and compare lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from alkaline fermentations of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) leaves, roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa) and African locust bean (Parkia biglobosa) seeds for production of, respectively, Ntoba Mbodi, Bikalga and Soumbala. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 121 LAB were isolated, identified and compared by phenotyping and genotyping using PCR amplification of 16S-23S rDNA intergenic transcribed spacer (ITS-PCR), repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) and DNA sequencing. The results revealed a diversity of genera, species and subspecies of LAB in African alkaline fermentations. The isolates were characterized as nonmotile (in most cases) Gram-positive rods, cocci or coccobacilli, catalase and oxidase negative. ITS-PCR allowed typing mainly at species level, with differentiation of a few bacteria at subspecies level. Rep-PCR permitted typing at subspecies level and revealed significant genotypic differences between the same species of bacteria from different raw materials. DNA sequencing combined with use of API 50CHL and API 20Strep systems allowed identification of bacteria as Weissella confusa, Weissella cibaria, Lactobacillus plantarum, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus avium and Enterococcus hirae from Ntoba Mbodi; Ent. faecium, Ent. hirae and Pediococcus acidilactici from Bikalga and Soumbala. CONCLUSION: LAB found in African alkaline-fermented foods belong to a range of genera, species and subspecies of bacteria and vary considerably according to raw material. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our study confirms that LAB survive in alkaline fermentations, a first crucial stage in determining their significance and possible value as probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Tarhana, a traditional Turkish fermented food.
AB  - Tarhana is a traditional fermented product produced from a mixture of spontaneously fermented yogurt and wheat flour in Turkey. The aims of the present study were to enumerate and identify for the first time by molecular biology-based methods predominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated during processing of Tarhana. Samples were collected from eight different regions of Turkey. In order to explore the relationship between raw material and the microbiology of Tarhana, yogurt and wheat flour were also analyzed. A total of 226 Gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates were obtained from MRS, M17 and SBM (Slanetz and Bartley Medium). The isolates were grouped and identified using a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods including rep-PCR fingerprinting [(GTG)(5) primer], multiplex PCR, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and carbohydrate assimilation profiling. Pediococcus acidilactici were found to constitute 27% of the isolates, 19% were identified as Streptococcus thermophilus, 19% as Lactobacillus fermentum, 12% as Enterococcus faecium, 7% as Pediococcus pentosaceus, 5% as Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, 4% as Weissella cibaria, 2% as Lactobacillus plantarum, 2% as Lactobacillus delbrueckii spp. bulgaricus, 2% as Leuconostoc citreum, 1% as Lactobacillus paraplantarum and 0.5% as Lactobacillus casei. The different production sites investigated all had individual LAB profiles, but with P. acidilactici and S. thermophilus being isolated from the majority of samples. The main source of P. acidilactici and S. thermophilus was found to be the yogurt.
TI  - Biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in French wheat sourdough as determined by molecular characterization using species-specific PCR.
AB  - The lactic acid microflora of nine traditional wheat sourdoughs from the Midi-Pyrenees area (South western France) was previously isolated and preliminary characterized using conventional morphological and biochemical analysis. However, such phenotypic methods alone are not always reliable and have a low taxonomic resolution for identification of lactic acid bacteria species. In the present study, a total of 290 LAB isolates were identified by PCR amplification using different sets of specific primers in order to provide a thorough characterization of the lactic flora from these traditional French sourdoughs. Overall, the LAB isolates belonged to 6 genera: Lactobacillus (39%, 8 species), Pediococcus (38%, 1 species), Leuconostoc (17%, 2 species), Weissella (4%, 2 species), Lactococcus (1%, 1 species) and Enterococcus (<1%, 1 species) and 15 different species were detected: L. plantarum, L. curvatus, L. paracasei, L. sanfranciscensis, L. pentosus, L. paraplantarum, L. sakei, L. brevis, P. pentosaceus, L. mesenteroides, L. citreum, W. cibaria, W. confusa, L. lactis and E. hirae. Facultative heterofermentative LAB represent more than 76% of the total isolates, the main species isolated herein correspond to L. plantarum and P. pentosaceus. Obligate heterofermentative lactobacilli (L. sanfranciscencis, L. brevis) represent less than 3% of the total isolates whereas Leuconostoc and Weissella species represent 21% of the total isolates and have been detected in eight of the nine samples. Detection of some LAB species was preferentially observed depending on the isolation culture medium. The number of different species within a sourdough varies from 3 to 7 and original associations of hetero- and homofermentative LAB species have been revealed. Results from this study clearly confirm the diversity encountered in the microbial community of traditional sourdough and highlight the importance of LAB cocci in the sourdough ecosystem, along with lactobacilli.
TI  - Antifungal activity of strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a semolina ecosystem against Penicillium roqueforti, Aspergillus niger and Endomyces fibuliger contaminating bakery products.
AB  - Thirty samples of Italian durum wheat semolina and whole durum wheat semolina, generally used for the production of Southern Italy's traditional breads, were subjected to microbiological analysis in order to explore their lactic acid bacteria (LAB) diversity and to find strains with antifungal activity. A total of 125 presumptive LAB isolates (Gram-positive and catalase-negative) were characterized by repetitive extragenic palindromic-PCR (REP-PCR) and sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene, leading to the identification of the following species: Weissella confusa, Weissella cibaria, Leuconostoc citreum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus rossiae and Lactobacillus plantarum. The REP-PCR results delineated 17 different patterns whose cluster analysis clearly differentiated W. cibaria from W. confusa isolates. Seventeen strains, each characterized by a different REP-PCR pattern, were screened for their antifungal properties. They were grown in a flour-based medium, comparable to a real food system, and the resulting fermentation products (FPs) were tested against fungal species generally contaminating bakery products, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium roqueforti and Endomyces fibuliger. The results of the study indicated a strong inhibitory activity - comparable to that obtained with the common preservative calcium propionate (0.3% w/v) - of ten LAB strains against the most widespread contaminant of bakery products, P. roqueforti. The screening also highlighted the unexplored antifungal activity of L. citreum, L. rossiae and W. cibaria (1 strain), which inhibited all fungal strains to the same or a higher extent compared with calcium propionate. The fermentation products of these three strains were characterized by low pH values, and a high content of lactic and acetic acids.
TI  - Phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from "Alheira", a traditional fermented sausage produced in Portugal.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from "Alheira", a fermented sausage produced in Portugal. LAB were identified to genus and species level by phenotypic characteristics, using genus or species-specific primers and sequencing of the gene encoding 16S rRNA. Two-hundred and eighty-three isolates were grouped into 14 species. Lactobacillus plantarum was isolated from all sausages and Enterococcusfaecalis from most of the samples. Low numbers of Lactobacillus paraplantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus zeae, Lactobacillus paracasei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Pediococcus acidilactici, Weissella cibaria, Weissella viridescens and Enterococcus faecium were recorded. The genetic heterogeneity of L. plantarum and E. faecalis strains were determined by numerical analysis of DNA banding patterns obtained by RAPD-PCR. Strains of L. plantarum and E. faecalis were different from different producers. This study forms the basis from which starter cultures could be selected for production of "Alheira".
TI  - Effect of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria starters on health-promoting and sensory properties of tomato juices.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, Weissella cibaria/confusa, Lactobacillus brevis, Pediococcus pentosaceous, Lactobacillus sp. and Enterococcus faecium/faecalis were identified from raw tomatoes by Biolog System, partial 16S rRNA gene sequence and subjected to typing by Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RAPD-PCR) analysis. Ten autochthonous strains were singly used to ferment tomato juice (TJ) via a protocol which included fermentation at 25 degrees C for 17 h and further storage at 4 degrees C for 40 days. Unstarted TJ and TJ fermented with an allochthonous strain of L. plantarum were used as the controls. All autochthonous strains grew well in TJ reaching cell densities ca. 10,000 and 10 times higher than unstarted TJ and TJ fermented with the allochthonous strain. Viscosity of TJs fermented with autochthonous strains was generally the highest, especially when started with W. cibaria/confusa which synthesized exo-polysaccharides. Overall, unstarted TJ and TJ fermented with the allochthonous strain showed marked decreases of ascorbic acid (ASC), glutathione (GSH) and total antioxidant activity (TTA) during storage. On the contrary, several TJs fermented with autochthonous strains, especially with L. plantarum POM1 and POM 35, maintained elevated values of ASC, GSH and TAA. The variation of color indexes mirrored the above behavior. TJs fermented with the above two autochthonous strains were compared to controls based on volatile components through Purge and Trap or Solid Phase Microextraction Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (PT or SPME-GC/MS) analysis. As shown by Principal Component Analysis a large number of volatiles belonging to various chemical classes markedly differentiated TJs fermented with autochthonous strains with respect to controls.
TI  - Identification of yeast and bacteria involved in the mezcal fermentation of Agave salmiana.
AB  - AIMS: To identify the yeast and bacteria present in the mezcal fermentation from  Agave salmiana. METHODS AND RESULTS: The restriction and sequence analysis of the amplified region, between 18S and 28S rDNA and 16S rDNA genes, were used for the identification of yeast and bacteria, respectively. Eleven different micro-organisms were identified in the mezcal fermentation. Three of them were the following yeast: Clavispora lusitaniae, Pichia fermentans and Kluyveromyces marxianus. The bacteria found were Zymomonas mobilis subsp. mobilis and Zymomonas mobilis subsp. pomaceae, Weissella cibaria, Weissella paramesenteroides, Lactobacillus pontis, Lactobacillus kefiri, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus farraginis. CONCLUSIONS: The phylogenetic analysis of 16S rDNA and ITS sequences showed that microbial diversity present in mezcal is dominated by bacteria, mainly lactic acid bacteria species and Zymomonas mobilis. Pichia fermentans and K. marxianus could be micro-organisms with high potential for the production of some volatile compounds in mezcal. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: We identified the community of bacteria and yeast present in mezcal fermentation from Agave salmiana.
TI  - Characterization of Italian cheeses ripened under nonconventional conditions.
AB  - Four Italian cheeses (Casciotta di Urbino, Barricato San Martino, Vento d'Estate, and Ubriaco di Raboso) nonconventionally ripened under different plant materials (walnut leaves, herbs, hay, and wine by-products, respectively) were compared for compositional, microbiological, biochemical, and volatile profile characteristics. Mean values for gross composition were rather similar. Because primary starters were not used for manufacture, the endogenous lactic acid bacteria were mainly present (7.0 to 9.0 log10 cfu/g). Except for Lactobacillus paracasei and Leuconostoc mesenteroides, which were commonly identified in 3 cheeses, Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus sanguinicola, Lactobacillus brevis, Enterococcus durans/Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Weissella cibaria/Weissella confusa were variously found in the 4 cheeses. Random amplification of polymorphic DNA-PCR analysis showed the biodiversity among the strains, and the species of lactobacilli were in part grouped according to their origin. As shown by the principal component analysis of reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography data for the pH 4.6-soluble fractions and by the determination of free AA, the secondary proteolysis of Barricato San Martino and Vento d'Estate mainly differed from the other 2 cheeses. Purge-and-trap and solid-phase microextraction were coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine volatile compounds. Vento d'Estate showed the highest levels of almost all chemical classes, and Casciotta di Urbino was characterized by a very low level of volatile components. Esters, ketones, and terpenes were the chemical classes that mainly differentiated the cheeses. Several volatile compounds seemed to be released directly from the plant materials used for ripening, especially terpenes for Vento d'Estate cheese. The lowest level of volatile free fatty acids was found in Casciotta d'Urbino, in which rennet paste was not used during manufacture. The highest concentration of free fatty acids, especially butyric and caproic acids, was found in Vento d'Estate cheese.
TI  - Characterisation and biochemical properties of predominant lactic acid bacteria from fermenting cassava for selection as starter cultures.
AB  - A total of 375 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from fermenting cassava in South Africa, Benin, Kenya and Germany, and were characterised by phenotypic and genotypic tests. These could be divided into five main groups comprising strains of facultatively heterofermentative rods, obligately heterofermentative rods, heterofermentative cocci, homofermentative cocci and obligately homofermentative rods, in decreasing order of predominance. Most of the facultatively heterofermentative rods were identified by phenotypic tests as presumptive Lactobacillus plantarum-group strains, which also comprised the most predominant bacteria (54.4% of strains) isolated in the study. The next predominant group of lactic acid bacteria (14.1% of total isolates) consisted of obligately heterofermentative rods belonging either to the genus Lactobacillus or Weissella, followed by the heterofermentative cocci (13.9% of isolates) belonging to the genera Weissella or Leuconostoc. Homofermentative cocci were also isolated (13.3% of isolates). Biochemical properties such as production of alpha-amylase, beta-glucosidase, tannase, antimicrobials (presumptive bacteriocin and H(2)O(2)-production), acidification and fermentation of the indigestible sugars raffinose and stachyose, were evaluated in vitro for selection of potential starter strains. A total of 32 strains with one or more desirable biochemical properties were pre-selected and identified using rep-PCR fingerprinting in combination with 16S rRNA sequencing of representative rep-PCR cluster isolates. Of these strains, 18 were identified as L. plantarum, four as Lactobacillus pentosus, two each as Leuconostoc fallax, Weissella paramesenteroides and Lactobacillus fermentum, one each as Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and Weissella cibaria, while two remained unidentified but could be assigned to the L. plantarum-group. These strains were further investigated for clonal relationships, using RAPD-PCR with three primers, and of the 32 a total of 16 strains were finally selected for the development as starter cultures for Gari production.
TI  - Glucan and fructan production by sourdough Weissella cibaria and Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - After a large screening on sourdough lactic acid bacteria, exopolysaccharide (EPS)-forming strains of Weissella cibaria, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Pediococcus pentosaceus were selected. After 6 days of incubation at 30 degrees C, the synthesis of EPS in MRS-based broth ranged from 5.54 to 7.88 mg mL-1. EPS had an apparent molecular mass of ca. 104 Da. As shown by carbohydrate consumption, the synthesis of EPS was found from sucrose only. Two types of homopolysaccharides were synthesized: glucans simultaneously with growth and fructans after 1 day of incubation. Two protein bands of ca. 180-200 kDa were in situ detected on SDS-PAGE gels incubated with sucrose. PCR products of ca. 220 bp were found for L. plantarum PL9 (100% of identity to putative priming glycosyltransferase of L. plantarum WCFS1) and W. cibaria WC4 (80% of identity to putative glycosyltransferase, epsD, of Bacillus cereus G9241) by using hybrid primers for the priming gtf genes. Degenerated primers DexreuR and DexreuV showed a unique PCR product, and the predicted amino acid sequences were identical for W. cibaria WC4 and L. plantarum PL9. The sequence had similarity with polysaccharide biosynthesis glycosyltransferases. W. cibaria WC4 or L. plantarum LP9 synthesized ca. 2.5 g kg-1 EPS during sourdough fermentation with sucrose added. Compared to the sourdough started with an EPS-negative strain, the sourdough started with W. cibaria WC4 or L. plantarum LP9 increased the viscosity, and the resulting bread had higher specific volume and lower firmness. The synthesis of EPS by selected sourdough lactic acid bacteria could be considered as a useful tool to replace the additives for improving the textural properties of baked goods.
TI  - Enzymatic activities of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Cornetto di Matera sourdoughs.
AB  - Forty-one strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from Cornetto di Matera  sourdoughs were screened for their enzymatic activities, to elucidate their possible roles during the fermentation process. Urease, peptidase, phytase, phosphatase and beta-glucosidase activities were measured spectrophotometrically using synthetic substrates. Proteolytic activities were examined in model doughs, using neutral and acidified sterile doughs as controls. All strains had low urease, glutamyl aminopeptidase and iminopeptidase activities, whereas differences within species were observed for the other enzymatic activities. Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Lactobacillus curvatus strains generally showed high aminopeptidase, X-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase, beta-glucosidase and phytase activities, while the enzymatic activities of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus pentosus and Weissella cibaria varied between strains. In order to classify the strains on the basis of similar enzymatic profiles, a hierarchical cluster analysis was carried out. Several strains of L. plantarum, L. curvatus and Leuc. mesenteroides showed an interesting combination of proteolytic, peptidase, beta-glucosidase and phytase activities, suggesting their possible usefulness as a mixed starter culture in bread-making processes.
TI  - Monitoring the lactic acid bacterial diversity during shochu fermentation by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - The presence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) during shochu fermentation was monitored by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and by bacteriological culturing. No LAB were detected from fermented mashes by PCR-DGGE using a universal bacterial PCR primer set. However, PCR-DGGE using a new primer specific for the 16S rDNA of Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Tetragenococcus, Enterococcus, and Vagococcus and two primers specific for the 16S rDNA of Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, and Weissella revealed that Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus nagelii, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Weissella cibaria inhabited in shochu mashes. It was also found that the LAB community composition during shochu fermentation changed after the main ingredient and water were added during the fermentation process. Therefore, we confirmed that PCR-DGGE using all three primers specific for groups of LAB together was well suited to the study of the LAB diversity in shochu mashes. The results of DGGE profiles were similar to the results of bacteriological culturing. In conclusion, LAB are present during shochu fermentation but not dominant.
