TI  - [Species distribution of pathogens and prognostic factors for catheter-related bloodstream infections in intensive care unit].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the incidence and species distribution of catheter-related  bloodstream infection (CRBSI) in intensive care unit (ICU) at our hospital and analyze the risk factors for CRBSI. METHODS: Hospitalized patients microbiologically diagnosed as CRBSI were recruited from January 2012 to June 2013. And the clinical data were collected retrospectively and analyzed by software IBM SPSS 19.0. RESULTS: Among 67 patients diagnosed as nosocomial CRBSI, 24 cases (35.8%) died while 43 survived. And a total of 81 strains were detected, including 42 Gram-positive (G(+)) bacteria (51.9%), 36 Gram-negative (G(-)) bacteria (44.4%) and 3 fungi (3.7%).The predominant pathogenic G(+) and G(-) bacteria were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Acinetobacter baumannii respectively. With multiple Logistic regressions, age >/= 65 years, higher acute physiology & chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score and polymicrobial CRBSI were independent predictors of worse outcomes. CONCLUSION: The recent prevalent pathogens of CRBSI in ICU are S.epidermidis and A.baumannii. Advanced age, disease severity and polymicrobial CRBSI are significant independent risk factor of mortality for CRBSI patients in ICU.
TI  - Nanotechnology approaches for antibacterial drug delivery: Preparation and microbiological evaluation of fusogenic liposomes carrying fusidic acid.
AB  - Many antibacterial drugs have some difficulty passing through the bacterial cell  membrane, especially if they have a high molecular weight or large spatial structure. Consequently, intrinsic resistance is shown by some bacterial strains. Reduced cell membrane permeability is one of the mechanisms of resistance known for fusidic acid (FUS), a bacteriostatic steroidal compound with activity limited to Gram-positive bacteria. Moreover, the lipophilic character of FUS has been shown to cause drug retention inside the bilayers of cell membranes, preventing its diffusion towards target sites inside the cytoplasm. Targeting antimicrobial agents by means of liposomes may be a valid strategy in the treatment of infections refractory to conventional routes of antimicrobial treatment. On this basis, loading of FUS in fusogenic liposomes (FLs) was planned in this study. Fusogenic small unilamellar vesicles loaded with FUS were produced to evaluate their influence on improving the cell penetration and antibacterial activity of the antibiotic. The produced carriers were technologically characterised and were subjected to an in vitro microbiological assay against several strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The experimental results showed that encapsulating FUS in a liposomal carrier can improve antimicrobial efficacy and reduce the effective concentration required, probably through putative mechanisms of increased diffusion through the bacterial cell membrane. In fact, whilst free FUS was active only on the tested Gram-positive strains, incubation of FUS-loaded FLs exhibited growth inhibitory activity both against Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. The lowest MICs were obtained against Staphylococcus epidermidis (</=0.15mug/mL) and Acinetobacter baumannii (37.5mug/mL) clinical strains.
TI  - Surveillance of catheter-related infections: the supplementary role of the microbiology laboratory.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The burden of catheter-related infections (CRIs) in developing countries is severe. In South Africa, a standardised surveillance definition does not exist and the collection of catheter days is challenging. The aim of the study was to provide baseline data on the prevalence of CRIs and to describe the epidemiology of CRI events within a tertiary academic hospital. METHODS: Surveillance was laboratory-based and conducted for a six month period. A microbiologically confirmed CRBSI (MC-CRBSI) event was defined as the isolation of the same microorganism from the catheter and concomitant blood cultures (BCs), within 48 h of catheter removal, which were not related to an infection at another site. RESULTS: A total of 508 catheters, removed from 332 patients, were processed by the laboratory, of which only 50% (253/508 removed from 143/332 patients) of the catheters were accompanied by BCs within 48 h. Sixty-five episodes of MC-CRBSI in 57 patients were detected, involving 71 catheters and 195 microbial isolates. The institutional prevalence rate was 3.7 episodes per 1 000 admissions and 5.8 episodes per 10 000 in-patient days. Catheter day data was collected in only six wards of the hospital. The pooled laboratory incidence was 10.1 MC-CRBSI episodes per 1 000 catheter days, whereas the hospital-based central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rate was pooled at 5.7 episodes per 1 000 catheter days. The majority of patients had an underlying gastro-intestinal condition (33%; 19/56) with a non-tunnelled, triple-lumen central venous catheter, placed in the subclavian vein (38%; 27/71). The most predominant pathogen was methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (28%; 55/195), followed by extensively-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (18%; 35/195). CONCLUSIONS: Catheter-related infection prevention and control efforts require urgent attention, not only to keep patients safe from preventable harm, but to prevent the spread of multidrug resistant microorganisms.
TI  - Anti-cancer, immunoregulatory, and antimicrobial activities of the frog skin host-defense peptides pseudhymenochirin-1Pb and pseudhymenochirin-2Pa.
AB  - Pseudhymenochirin-1Pb (Ps-1Pb) and pseudhymenochirin-2Pa (Ps-2Pa) are host-defense peptides, first isolated from skin secretions of the frog Pseudhymenochirus merlini (Pipidae). Ps-1Pb and Ps-2Pa are highly cytotoxic (LC50<12 muM) against non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells, and colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells but are also hemolytic against human erythrocytes (LC50=28+/-2 muM for Ps-1Pb and LC50=6+/-1 muM for Ps-2Pa). Ps-2Pa shows selective cytotoxicity for tumor cells (LC50 against non-neoplastic human umbilical vein (HUVEC) cells=68+/-2 muM). Ps-1Pb and Ps-2Pa (5 mug/mL) significantly inhibit production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and the multifunctional cytokine IL-6 from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 mice and enhance the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-23 from both unstimulated and LPS-stimulated macrophages. Ps-1Pb potently (MIC</=10 muM) inhibits growth of multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of the Gram-positive bacteria methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and the Gram-negative bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Ps-2Pa shows the same high potency (MIC</=10 muM) against the Gram-positive bacteria but is 2-4 fold less potent against the Gram-negative isolates. Ps-1Pb at 4xMIC kills 99.9% of Escherichia coli within 30 min and 99.9% of S. aureus within 180 min. In conclusion, cytotoxicity against tumor cells, cytokine-mediated immunomodulatory properties, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity suggest that the Ps-1Pb and Ps-2Pa represent templates for design of non-hemolytic analogs for tumor therapy and for treatment of infections in cancer patients produced by multidrug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - [Etiology of surgical site infections in orthopedic surgery after multiple injuries].
AB  - Surgical site infection is one of the most severe complications in patients with  multiple injuries. It causes elongation of hospitalization time, greatly increases costs of treatment and may directly endanger patient's life. The aim of the study was to analyze bacterial flora causing surgical site infections in group of patients with multiple injuries. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on medical history of 31 patients with multiple injuries, who in years 2011-2012 due to surgical site infections required further treatment in Department of Musculoskeletal System Infections. RESULTS: In analyzed material majority of infections were caused by multiple bacteria species--18 (58%). Throughout the isolated flora the most frequent were gram-negative bacteria, especially A. baumanii--16 (29.6%) and P. areuginosa--5 (9.3%). Participation of gram-positive flora which until now was dominating as a cause of musculoskeletal system infections, has significantly decreased. Additionally, in this group we can see dominance of bacteria from Enterococcus genus--E. fecalis--10 (18.5%), and not as it used to be from Staphylococcus--S. aureus--6 (11%), S. epidermidis--3 (5.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The most common were acute infections caused by multiple bacteria species with dominance of gram-negative flora. Very interesting is the fact of fall of infection rate caused by Staphylococci. Monitoring of bacterial etiological factors has a key role in proper antibiotic administration, with is essential in successful surgical treatment.
TI  - Preventing microbial colonisation of catheters: antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of cellobiose dehydrogenase.
AB  - The ability of cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) for antimicrobial and antibiofilm functionalisation of urinary catheters was investigated. A recombinantly produced CDH from Myriococcum thermophilum was shown to completely inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus both in liquid and solid media when supplemented with either 0.8 mM or 2 mM cellobiose as substrate. Biofilm formation on silicone films was prevented by CDH when supplemented with 1mM cellobiose. The CDH/cellobiose system also successfully inhibited many common urinary catheter-colonising micro-organisms, including multidrug-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Interestingly, CDH was also able to produce H(2)O(2) during oxidation of extracellular polysaccharides (exPS) formed by micro-organisms in the absence of cellobiose. The H(2)O(2) production and consequently antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities on these exPS were enhanced by incorporation of glycoside hydrolases such as amylases. Hydrolysis of polysaccharides by these enzymes increases the number of terminal reducing sugars as substrates for CDH as well as destabilises the biofilm. Furthermore, CDH suspended in catheter lubricants killed bacteria in biofilms colonising catheters. Incorporation of the CDH/cellobiose system in the lubricant therefore makes it an easy strategy for preventing microbial colonisation of catheters.
TI  - [Prevalence and features of pathogenic bacteria in the department of hematology without bone marrow transplantation in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 2010 to 2012].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence, pathogens, and clinical features of infection in consecutive cases from 2010 to 2012 in Peking Union Medical College Hospital. METHOD: The incidence, pathogen, treatment, and outcomes of patients with hematological diseases who had positive findings of bacterium in their samples from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: There were 449 positive samples (5.8%) from 4 890 patients during this period, among which 388 were proved to be with pathogenic bacteria. Samples separated from patients with community-aquired infections accounted for 8.4% of all positive samples. Most community-aquired infections were caused by Gram-negative bacteria (75%), although no multidrug-resistant bacteria was observed. Samples separated from patients with nosocomial infections accounted for 91.6% of all positive samples. Respiratory tract (49.4%) and peripheral blood (32.6%) were the most common samples with positive results. Skin soft tissues (10.4%), and urine (3.7%) were less common samples. Most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infections were Gram-negative (66.9%). The most common Gram-negative bacteria included Escherichia coli (13.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), and Klebsiella pneumonia (12.1%), while Staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), Enterococcus faecium (7.0%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.1%) were the most common Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria consisted of most of sputum samples and peripheral blood samples. Samples from the surface of skin wound and anal swab were composed largely by Gram-positive bacteria (63.8%). The detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumonia/Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis were 24.0%, 87.9% and 38.4%, respectively. The resistance to Acinetobacter baumannii was serious. Multidrug-resistant, extensive drug resistant and pan drug resistant A. baumannii acountted for 74% of all A. Baumannii infections. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed low resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, levofloxacin and minocycline. Also, 22 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 9 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Epidermidis were detected, which were only sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. All patients were treated in the haematology wards and most of them were under agranulocytosis or immunosuppression. Finally, 22 patients reached clinical recovery through anti-infective therapy, whereas 49 patients died. Among those deaths, 42 patients attributed to severe infections and infection-associated complications. Fourteen of all the deaths might be infected with drug-resistance bacteria. There were 61 samples proved to be bacteria colonization. Nonfermenters such as Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia made up for a large amount of bacteria colonization. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogens of nosocomial infections in the hematology ward are mainly Gram-negative bacteria. The incidences and pathogens vary from different infection sites. Nosocomial infection still has a higher mortality rate. Once nonfermenters are detected positive, the pathogenic or colonial bacteria should be distinguished.
TI  - Highly drug-resistant pathogens implicated in burn-associated bacteremia in an Iraqi burn care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In low- and middle-income countries, bloodstream infections are an important cause of mortality in patients with burns. Increasingly implicated in burn-associated infections are highly drug-resistant pathogens with limited treatment options. We describe the epidemiology of bloodstream infections in patients with burns in a humanitarian surgery project in Iraq. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, descriptive study of blood culture isolates identified between July 2008 and September 2009 among patients with burns in a single hospital in Iraq who developed sepsis. RESULTS: In 1169 inpatients admitted to the burn unit during the study period, 212 (18%) had suspected sepsis, and 65 (6%) had confirmed bacteremia. Sepsis was considered the primary cause of death in 198 patients (65%; 95% CI 65-70) of the 304 patients that died. The most commonly isolated organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22 isolates [34%]), Staphylococcus aureus (17 [26%]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8 [12%]), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7 [11%]), Acinetobacter baumannii (6 [9%]), and Enterobacter cloacae (5 [8%]). A high proportion of Enterobacteriaceae strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and S. aureus isolates were uniformly methicillin-resistant. For gram-negative bacteria, the most reliably active antibiotics were imipenen and amikacin. CONCLUSIONS: Burn patients with sepsis in Iraq were commonly found to have bloodstream pathogens resistant to most antibiotics available locally. Effective empirical therapy of burn sepsis in this region of Iraq would consist of vancomycin or teicoplanin and a carbapenem-class antibiotic with antipseudomonal activity.
TI  - [A prospective randomized controlled trial on effect of norvancomycin tube sealing for prevention of central venous catheter-related infection in critical patients].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical value of tube-sealing with norvancomycin and  heparin saline mixture for prevention of central venous catheter-related infection (CRI). METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled trial was performed. 120 patients who were admitted to department of critical care medicine from January 2012 to January 2014 were included, with their subclavian vein catheterization installation time longer than 48 hours, age over 18 years and younger than 80 years, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score reaching 10-29. The patients were divided into two groups using a random number table, and finally 116 patients were enrolled. Norvancomycin and heparin saline mixture were used for tube sealing in the intervention group (n=56), while only heparin saline was used in the control group (n=60). The incidence of CRI, catheter correlated spectrum of pathogens, adverse events, mortality, hospital day, catheter retention time, and hospital costs were compared between two groups. RESULTS: (1) There was no significant difference in the incidence of CRI between intervention group and control group [7.14% (4/56) vs. 8.33% (5/60), chi(2)=0.058, P=1.000]. There was no catheter pathogenic colonization in the intervention group, but there were 2 cases of catheter pathogenic colonization in control group. (2) A total of 7 pathogens were found in two groups. Three cases with pathogenic bacteria was found in the intervention group, with 1 case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 case Acinetobacter baumannii, and 1 case fungi. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, fungi, and Acinetobacter baumannii was found in the control group, with 1 case of each. There was no significantly statistical difference between two groups (all P>0.05), but there was a decreasing trend of Gram-positive cocci infection in the intervention group. (3) There was no significant difference in the catheter thrombosis, local bleeding or hematoma, catheter dislocation and other adverse events between intervention group and control group [21.43% (12/56) vs. 23.33% (14/60), chi(2)=0.060, P=0.806]. (4) There were no significant differences in mortality [7.14% (4/56) vs. 8.33% (5/60), chi(2)=0.058, P=1.000], hospital day (35.9+/-15.2 days vs. 34.1+/-16.3 days, t=16.330, P=0.620), catheter retention time (25.0+/-4.5 days vs. 24.5+/-5.1 days, t=26.427, P=2.560) and cost of hospitalization (10 thousand Yuan: 3.42+/-1.22 vs. 3.72+/-1.30, t=13.215, P=1.560) between intervention group and control group. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with central venous catheter, application norvancomycin with heparin saline mixture for tube sealing did not reduce the incidence of CRI, the incidence of adverse events and mortality, does not reduce hospitalization time, catheter retention time and hospital costs, but may reduce the catheter colonization and infection of Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Tolerability and efficacy of long-term treatment with daptomycin, ceftazidime and colistin in a patient with a polymicrobial, multidrug-resistant prosthetic joint reinfection: a case report.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Prosthetic joint infections are severe complications of joint implants. Further complications arise when polymicrobial and/or multidrug-resistant microorganisms are involved. Currently, there are limited data on the management of these infections and on the tolerability of long-term treatment with daptomycin, ceftazidime and colistin. CASE PRESENTATION: A 55-year-old Caucasian woman who had a right hip prosthesis removed 1 year prior because of infection was admitted for prosthesis reimplantation. On admission at our hospital, anamnesis regarding etiology and management of prosthesis infection was not available. On clinical, laboratory findings and imaging studies infection was not suspected. A hip prosthesis was reimplanted. At surgery, histopathological and microbiological investigations were not taken. Three weeks after reimplantation, surgical site infection due to Enterobacter cloacae was diagnosed and oral ciprofloxacin was prescribed. Four days later, a periprosthesis fluid collection was evidenced and a percutaneous needle aspirate grew Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. Enterobacter genome was also detected from the same sample. Teicoplanin and meropenem were added to ciprofloxacin without clinical improvement. Moreover, acetabular cup dislocation was documented. She underwent prosthesis explantation, debridement, and positioning of an antimicrobial mixed spacer. From the intraoperatory cultures S. epidermidis and Acinetobacter baumannii were grown. Daptomycin, ceftazidime, colistin and rifampin were administered. Four days later, rifampin was stopped due to a suspected liver toxicity. While undergoing therapy she presented recurrent episodes of wound dehiscence and on the 22nd week of treatment a further surgical debridement was performed, upon which the spacer was removed. At this time, intraoperative cultures resulted negative. Three months later, after a total of 8 months, antimicrobials were interrupted. Subsequently, a femoral transcondylar traction was positioned, and 3 weeks later a new prosthesis was reimplanted. At over 1 year after reimplantation she is well. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that microbiologic investigations are mandatory even when prosthetic joint infection is not suspected. Molecular methods for identification of microorganisms can be used in addition to conventional cultures especially when patients are under antibiotic treatment. Daptomycin, ceftazidime and colistin can be administered for several months without side effects. Guidelines specifically addressing the diagnosis and the management of polymicrobial, multidrug-resistant prosthetic joint infections need to be developed.
TI  - Polyethyleneimine and polyethyleneimine-based nanoparticles: novel bacterial and  yeast biofilm inhibitors.
AB  - Biofilms are commonly involved in medical device-related infections. The purpose  of this study was to determine the antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity of polyethyleneimine (PEI) and PEI-based nanoparticles (nanoPEI) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Acinetobacter baumannii and Candida albicans (clinical and ATCC strains), and to evaluate their effect upon biofilm formation on polyurethane (PUR)-like catheters. MICs and minimal lethal concentrations of PEI and nanoPEI were determined according to CLSI microdilution reference protocols. For PEI, the MIC value was 195.31 mg l(-1) for all the bacteria and 48.83 mg l(-1) for the yeast strains. For nanoPEI, the MIC value was 1250 mg l(-1) for all the strains except A. baumannii, for which it was 2500 mg l(-1). Biofilm formation was assessed with PUR-like catheter segments and biofilm metabolic activity was quantified by colorimetry with a tetrazolium reduction assay. Plasma membrane integrity and membrane potential were assessed by flow cytometry after staining microbial cells with a membrane-impermeable dye, propidium iodide, and a membrane-potential marker, DiBAC4(3). PEI inhibited growth of all microbial species; higher concentrations of nanoPEI were needed to inhibit growth of all species. Biofilm formation in the presence of anti-bacterial PEI activity was dose-dependent (except for S. epidermidis) and species-related. NanoPEI at 0.5xMIC and MIC significantly reduced the metabolic activity of biofilms of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and A. baumannii, whereas 2xMIC was required in order to inhibit biofilm metabolic activity.
TI  - Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance among clinical isolates recovered from a tertiary care hospital in Al Qassim, Saudi Arabia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergences of antimicrobial-resistances have become an important  issue in global healthcares. Limitations in surveying hinder the actual estimates of resistance in many countries. THE AIM: the present study was designed to retrospectically survey antimicrobial susceptibility for resistance profiling of dominant pathogens in a tertiary-care center in Buraidah, Saudi Arabia from January-2011 to December-2011. MATERIALS AND METHODS: the design was cross-sectional and spanned records of a 1000 bacterial non-related isolates. Antibiograms were based on the 2012 Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: showed that Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli, were the most resistant. All isolates of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, were resistant to penicillin (100%), and oxacillin with 52%, 75%, and 82%, respectively. Interestingly, an increasing trend of resistance-pattern was seen for the three species against gentamicin 26%, 50%, 68% ciprofloxacin 22%, 50%, 68%, tetracycline 30%, 44%, 27%, erythromycin 26%, 64%, 73%, and clindamycin 20%, 47%, 50% suggesting potential between-species transfer of resistances. Acinetobacter baumannii was resistances to all antibiotics tested including ciprofloxacin (90%), ceftazidime (89%), cefepime (67%), Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (66%), amikacin (63%), gentamicin (51%), tetracycline (43%), piperacillin-tazobactam (42%), and imipenem (9%). A similar pattern was seen by P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, a typical pattern of resistance in K. pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing organisms was observed. CONCLUSION: we have shown staphylococci, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enteric bacteria were the most resistant species in this region.
TI  - Potent antimicrobial activity of bone cement encapsulating silver nanoparticles capped with oleic acid.
AB  - Bone cement is widely used in surgical treatments for the fixation for orthopaedic devices. Subsequently, 2-3% of patients undergoing these procedures develop infections that are both a major health risk for patients and a cost for the health service providers; this is also aggravated by the fact that antibiotics are losing efficacy because of the rising resistance of microorganisms to these substances. In this study, oleic acid capped silver nanoparticles (NP) were encapsulated into Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-based bone cement samples at various ratios. Antimicrobial activity against Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus, S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Acinetobacter baumannii was exhibited at NP concentrations as low as 0.05% (w/w). Furthermore, the mechanical properties and cytotoxicity of the bone cement containing these NP were assessed to guarantee that such material is safe to be used in orthopaedic surgical practice.
TI  - Control of multi-drug-resistant pathogens with non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate wound dressing.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-thermal dielectric-barrier discharge plasma (non-thermal plasma)  is being investigated for use in wound healing. Alginate gel, already in clinical use, is non-toxic but has no meaningful antimicrobial property. This study reports that a non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate wound dressing has strong antimicrobial properties. METHODS: Alginate gel was treated with non-thermal plasma in room air and inoculated with bacterial pathogens. At 15 min after this, bacterial cell viability was determined by colony assay or 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4- nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) assay. The anti-biofilm efficacy of the non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate gel was investigated and the treated gel was tested against vascular endothelial cells for a cytotoxic effect. The proliferation and migration of bacterial cells before and after exposure to the treated gel were investigated with an in vitro wound testing assay. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe changes in the gel surface associated with exposure to bacterial pathogens. The treated gel was tested against Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Candida albicans, and C. glabrata as representative pathogens (at 10(6)-10(9) colony-forming units [CFU]/mL), and the thickness of a plasma-treated gel dressing and distance between a glass dielectric-barrier discharge plasma probe and the gel surface were kept constant. RESULTS: Non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate gel exhibited a strong biocidal property and inactivated all of the pathogens included in the study at counts of 10(8) CFU/mL and within 15 sec of treatment. The treated gel inactivated 10(9) CFU/mL of the organisms within 1 min, and 3 min of exposure to the treated gel inactivated pathogens embedded in biofilms. The plasma-treated gel showed no significant cytotoxicity, and endothelial cells exposed to the treated gel proliferated and migrated well across a wound area over a period of time. Dressings made with the treated gel retained their biocidal effects for about a month. Scanning electron microscopy showed no damage to the surfaces of treated gels, but damage to the bacterial pathogens on plasma exposure. CONCLUSION: A non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate gel dressing has the clinical potential to decontaminate wounds, prevent surgical site infection, and promote wound healing.
TI  - Next science wound gel technology, a novel agent that inhibits biofilm development by gram-positive and gram-negative wound pathogens.
AB  - Loss of the skin barrier facilitates the colonization of underlying tissues with  various bacteria, where they form biofilms that protect them from antibiotics and host responses. Such wounds then become chronically infected. Topical antimicrobials are a major component of chronic wound therapy, yet currently available topical antimicrobials vary in their effectiveness on biofilm-forming pathogens. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of Next Science wound gel technology (NxtSc), a novel topical agent designed to kill planktonic bacteria, penetrate biofilms, and kill the bacteria within. In vitro quantitative analysis, using strains isolated from wounds, showed that NxtSc inhibited biofilm development by Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae by inhibiting bacterial growth. The gel formulation NxtSc-G5, when applied to biofilms preformed by these pathogens, reduced the numbers of bacteria present by 7 to 8 log10 CFU/disc or CFU/g. In vivo, NxtSc-G5 prevented biofilm formation for 72 h when applied at the time of wounding and infection and eliminated biofilm infection when applied 24 h after wounding and infection. Storage of NxtSc-G5 at room temperature for 9 months did not diminish its efficacy. These results establish that NxtSc is efficacious in vitro and in vivo in preventing infection and biofilm development by different wound pathogens when applied immediately and in eliminating biofilm infection already established by these pathogens. This novel antimicrobial agent, which is nontoxic and has a usefully long shelf life, shows promise as an effective agent for the prevention and treatment of biofilm-related infections.
TI  - Drug resistance analysis of bacterial strains isolated from burn patients.
AB  - This study aimed to analyze the spectrum and drug resistance of bacteria isolated from burn patients to provide a reference for rational clinical use of antibiotics. Up to 1914 bacterial strain specimens isolated from burn patients admitted to hospital between 2001 and 2010 were subjected to resistance monitoring by using the K-B paper disk method. Retrospective analysis was performed on drug resistance analysis of burn patients. The top eight bacterium strains according to detection rate. A total of 1355 strains of Gram-negative (G(-)) bacteria and 559 strains of Gram-positive (G(+)) bacteria were detected. The top eight bacterium strains, according to detection rate, were Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterococcus. Drug resistance rates were higher than 90% in A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus, which accounted for 52.2, 21.7, 27.8, and 33.3%, respectively, of the entire sample. Those with drug resistance rates lower than 30% accounted for 4.3, 30.4, 16.7, and 16.7%, respectively. Multidrug-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) accounted for 49.2 and 76.4% of the S. epidermis and S. aureus resistance, respectively. Antibacterial drugs that had drug resistance rates to MRSE and MRSA higher than 90% accounted for 38.9 and 72.2%, respectively, whereas those with lower than 30% drug resistance rates accounted for 11.1 and 16.7%, respectively. The burn patients enrolled in the study were mainly infected with G(-) bacteria. These results strongly suggest that clinicians should practice rational use of antibiotics based on drug susceptibility test results.
TI  - Antibiofilm and antimicrobial efficacy of DispersinB(R)-KSL-W peptide-based wound gel against chronic wound infection associated bacteria.
AB  - The medical importance of bacterial biofilms has increased with the recognition of biofilms as one of the major contributors to the slow or non-healing chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, and pressure ulcers. Being a protected community of microorganisms, biofilms are notoriously refractory to antibiotic treatments. As the conventional treatment modalities have proven ineffective, this study provides the in vitro evidence to support the use of a novel combination of DispersinB((R)) antibiofilm enzyme that inhibits biofilm formation and disperses preformed biofilm, and thus making the biofilm bacteria more susceptible to a broad-spectrum KSL-W antimicrobial peptide. The combination of DispersinB((R)) and KSL-W peptide showed synergistic antibiofilm and antimicrobial activity against chronic wound infection associated biofilm-embedded bacteria such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS), and Acinetobacter baumannii. In addition, the wound gel formulation comprising DispersinB((R)), KSL-W peptide, and a gelling agent Pluronic F-127 showed a broad-spectrum and enduring antimicrobial activity against test organisms. Furthermore, as compared to commercial wound gel Silver-Sept, DispersinB((R))-KSL-W peptide-based wound gel was significantly more effective in inhibiting the biofilm-embedded MRSA, S. epidermidis, CoNS, Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, A. baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P < 0.05). Thus, this study provides promising evidence for the potential application of antibiofilm-antimicrobial DispersinB((R))-KSL-W wound gel in chronic wound management.
TI  - Bioactive glass BAG-S53P4 for the adjunctive treatment of chronic osteomyelitis of the long bones: an in vitro and prospective clinical study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the in vitro antibacterial activity of the bioglass BAG S53P4 against multi-resistant microorganisms commonly involved in osteomyelitis and to evaluate its use in surgical adjunctive treatment of osteomyelitis. METHODS: In vitro antibacterial activity of BAG-S53P4 against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates was evaluated by means of time kill curves, with colony counts performed after 24, 48 and 72 hours of incubation. In vivo evaluation was performed by prospectively studying a cohort of 27 patients with a clinically and radiologically diagnosed osteomyelitis of the long bones in an observational study. Endpoints were the absence of infection recurrence/persistence at follow-up, no need for further surgery whenever during follow-up and absence of local or systemic side effects connected with the BAG use. RESULTS: In vitro tests regarding the antibacterial activity of BAG S53P4 showed a marked bactericidal activity after 24 hrs against all the tested species. This activity continued in the subsequent 24 hrs and no growth was observed for all strains after 72 hrs. Results of the clinical study evidenced no signs of infection in 24 patients (88.9%) at the follow-up, while 2 subjects showed infection recurrence at 6 months from index operation and one more needed further surgical procedures. BAG-S53P4 was generally well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: The in vitro and in vivo findings reinforce previous observations on the efficacy of BAG-S53P4 for the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis of the long bones, also in the presence of multi-resistant strains and in immunocompromised hosts, without relevant side effects and without the need for locally adding antibiotics.

TI  - [Surveillance of bacterial distribution and drug resistance in inpatients with surgical infections: a single center study].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the bacterial distribution and drug resistance in patients with surgical infections, and provide the basis for the standardization treatment of the surgical infection. METHODS: Retrospectively analyzed from January 2008 to December 2011 surgical infection in our samples bacteria identification and drug sensitivity test results. RESULTS: A total of 3829 nonduplicate isolates from 3257 samples, Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 62.4% (the main microbes were P.aeruginosa, K. pneumonia and E.coli etc) and Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 37.6% (the main microbes were Enterococcus, Staphylococcus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus). Incidence of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis were on an obvious increase. For the performance of the high level of sensitive to Imipenem, Amikacin, Piperacillin and Tazobactam by E. coli and K. pneumonia. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii to cephalosporins, Carbapenems and Fluoroqinolones were higher resistant with Multidrug resistance. No vancomycin and teicoplanin resistant Enterococcus faecium were found. The prevalence of ESBL E.coli was 45.6%-61.5% and ESBL K.pneumoniae isolates were fluctuated. The methicillin-resistant S.aureus (MRSA) isolates were relatively high (21.1%-55.8%), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis was higher than the other Gram-positive cocci. Vancomycin for Staphylococcus performance was highly sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: The main composition of surgical clinical infection pathogens are Gram-negative bacillus, and the emergency of resistance of bacteria to antibacterial drugs is a common phenomenon. The resistant rate shows ascendant trend; Drug resistance is significantly higher in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Antimicrobial resistance is a serious and challenging issue.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy and wound-healing property of a topical ointment containing nitric-oxide-loaded zeolites.
AB  - Topical delivery of nitric oxide (NO) through a wound dressing has the potential  to reduce wound infections and improve healing of acute and chronic wounds. This study characterized the antibacterial efficacy of an ointment containing NO-loaded, zinc-exchanged zeolite A that releases NO upon contact with water. The release rate of NO from the ointment was measured using a chemiluminescence detection system. Minimum bactericidal concentration assays were performed using five common wound pathogens, including Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii), Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) and a fungus (Candida albicans). The time dependence of antimicrobial activity was characterized by performing log-reduction assays at four time points after 1-8 h ointment exposure. The cytotoxicity of the ointment after 24 h was assessed using cultured 3T3 fibroblast cells. Minimum microbicidal concentrations (MMCs) for bacterial organisms (5x10(7) c.f.u.) ranged from 50 to 100 mg ointment (ml media)(-1); the MMC for C. albicans (5x10(4) c.f.u.) was 50 mg ointment (ml media)(-1). Five to eight log reductions in bacterial viability and three log reductions in fungal viability were observed after 8 h exposure to NO-zeolite ointment compared with untreated organisms. Fibroblasts remained viable after 24 h exposure to the same concentration of NO-zeolite ointment as was used in antimicrobial tests. In parallel studies, full-thickness cutaneous wounds on Zucker obese rats healed faster than wounds treated with a control ointment. These data indicate that ointment containing NO-loaded zeolites could potentially be used as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial wound-healing dressing.
TI  - [Distribution and antibiotic resistance of bacteria causing bloodstream infections in patients in intensive care unit].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and antibiotic resistance of bacteria  causing bloodstream infections in intensive care unit (ICU) patients and to provide a basis for rational clinical use of antibiotics. METHODS: The data of positive specimens, including whole blood, catheter blood and bone marrow samples, were isolated from ICU patients from January 2010 to December 2012. Disc diffusion method, micro-dilution and Etest method were used to test drug sensitivity. Distribution and antibiotic resistance of bacteria were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 1077 strains were isolated from 903 patients with bloodstream infection during 3 years. Gram-positive (G(+)) bacteria and Gram-negative (G(-)) bacteria accounted for 59.33% (639 isolates) and 40.67% (438 isolates) respectively. The 5 most frequently isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus epidermidis (20.06%, 216 isolates) followed in order by Escherichia coli (13.93%, 150 isolates), Acinetobacter baumannii (10.03%, 108 isolates), Klebsiella pneumonia (7.80%, 84 isolates) and Staphylococcus aureus (6.96%, 75 isolates). There was no significant difference in distribution of bacteria during 3 years. The resistance rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis was higher than that of Staphylococcus aureus to most of the tested drugs. The resistance rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis to quinoline/dalfopristin (4.2%) and nitrofurazone (15.3%) was relatively low, while resistance to penicillin (94.4%), linezolid (93.1%), piperacillin/tazobactam (90.3%), cefoperazone/sulbactam (87.5%) and oxacillin (83.3%) was over 80%. The resistance rate of Staphylococcus aureus to penicillin (96.0%), cefoperazone/sulbactam (84.0%), linezolid (76.0%) and oxacillin (76.0%) was over 70%, and resistance to the other common antibacterial drugs was below 70%. The resistance rate of Acinetobacter baumannii to amikacin (38.9%), nitrofurazone (91.7%), cefotetan (88.9%), ceftazidime (88.9%), ampicillin (88.9%), ceftriaxone (86.1%), the cefepime (86.1%), aztreonam (80.6%) and cefazolin (80.6%), and overall above 80%. The resistance rate of Escherichia coli to amikacin (30.0%), cefotetan (24.0%) and imipenem (16.0%) was below 30%, while resistance to ampicillin/sulbactam (94.0%), levofloxacin (84.0%), ampicillin (84.0%) and ceftriaxone (80.0%) was over 80%. CONCLUSIONS: Among the bacteria causing bloodstream infection as isolated from ICU patients, G(+) and G(-) bacteria accounted for 59.33% and 40.67%, respectively. The resistance rate of G(-) was higher than that of G(+), and resistance rate of majority of bacteria was higher than 60% on average. Before obtaining the susceptibility test Results, both G(-) and G(+) should be taken into account on choosing antimicrobial drugs in the treatment of ICU patients.
TI  - Infectious risk assessment of unsafe handling practices and management of clinical solid waste.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine the bacterial agents present in various clinical solid wastes, general waste and clinical sharp waste. The waste was collected from different wards/units in a healthcare facility in Penang Island, Malaysia. The presence of bacterial agents in clinical and general waste was determined using the conventional bacteria identification methods. Several pathogenic bacteria including opportunistic bacterial agent such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes were detected in clinical solid wastes. The presence of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in clinical sharp waste was determined using 16s rDNA analysis. In this study, several nosocomial pathogenic bacteria strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Lysinibacillus sphaericus, Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in clinical sharp waste. The present study suggests that waste generated from healthcare facilities should be sterilized at the point of generation in order to eliminate nosocomial infections from the general waste or either of the clinical wastes.
TI  - [Epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of clinical isolates about hospital infection from patients with hematological diseases].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiology and antibiotic resistance of isolates  from hospitalized patients with hematological disease from 2005 to 2011. METHODS: A total of 1453 bacterial strains were isolated from patients with hematological disease from January 2005 to December 2011. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by micro-dilution method. RESULTS: (1) The majority of the bacterial strains were respiratory passage examples (57.5%). The portage of blood examples in our division (13.60%) was higher than of whole hospital (6.26%), with lower positive rate of bacterial culture (52.37%) than of whole hospital (60.24%). Chemotherapy-induced agranulocytosis was the main reason for hospital infection. 578 (39.8%) bacterial strains were gram positive, and 875 (60.2%) gram negative bacillus. Staphylococcus epidermidis strains and glucose nonfermenters had a tendency of ascensus. (2) Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) accounted for 72.8% antibiotic resistance. Detection rates of ESBLs in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 18.9% and 10.4%, respectively. (3) No obvious changes of antimicrobial resistances of Staphylococcus and Enterococcus were observed during these years. The Enterobacteriaceae strains showed lowest resistance rates to Carbapenems, next to Cefoperazone/sulbactam and Piperacillin/tazobactam. But the resistance rates of Escherichia coli to Cefepime and Ceftazidime were gradually increasing during the past years. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii of glucose nonfermenters showed lowest resistance rates to Cefoperazone/sulbactam, but the resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Carbapenems increased. CONCLUSIONS: Escherichia coli was the highest in quantity of gram negative bacillus and glucose nonfermenters had a tendency of ascensus. The resistance rates of Escherichia coli to Cefepime and Ceftazidime, Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Carbapenems were gradually increasing in the past years.
TI  - Biofilm formation by clinical isolates and the implications in chronic infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biofilm formation is a major virulence factor contributing to the chronicity of infections. To date few studies have evaluated biofilm formation in infecting isolates of patients including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative multidrug-resistant (MDR) species in the context of numerous types of infectious syndromes. Herein, we investigated the biofilm forming capacity in a large collection of single patient infecting isolates and compared the relationship between biofilm formation to various strain characteristics. METHODS: The biofilm-forming capacity of 205 randomly sampled clinical isolates from patients, collected from various anatomical sites, admitted for treatment at Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC) from 2004-2011, including methicillin-resistant/methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA/MSSA) (n=23), Acinetobacter baumannii (n=53), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=36), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=54), and Escherichia coli (n=39), were evaluated for biofilm formation using the high-throughput microtiter plate assay and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Relationships between biofilm formation to clonal type, site of isolate collection, and MDR phenotype were evaluated. Furthermore, in patients with relapsing infections, serial strains were assessed for their ability to form biofilms in vitro. RESULTS: Of the 205 clinical isolates tested, 126 strains (61.4%) were observed to form biofilms in vitro at levels greater than or equal to the Staphylococcus epidermidis, positive biofilm producing strain, with P. aeruginosa and S. aureus having the greatest number of biofilm producing strains. Biofilm formation was significantly associated with specific clonal types, the site of isolate collection, and strains positive for biofilm formation were more frequently observed to be MDR. In patients with relapsing infections, the majority of serial isolates recovered from these individuals were observed to be strong biofilm producers in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to evaluate biofilm formation in a large collection of infecting clinical isolates representing diverse types of infections. Our results demonstrate: (1) biofilm formation is a heterogeneous property amongst clinical strains which is associated with certain clonal types, (2) biofilm forming strains are more frequently isolated from non-fluid tissues, in particular bone and soft tissues, (3) MDR pathogens are more often biofilm formers, and (4) strains from patients with persistent infections are positive for biofilm formation.
TI  - Photoinactivation of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria with the antimicrobial peptide (KLAKLAK)(2) conjugated to the hydrophilic photosensitizer eosin Y.
AB  - We test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial peptide (KLAKLAK)(2) enhances the photodynamic activity of the photosensitizer eosin Y upon conjugation. The conjugate eosin-(KLAKLAK)(2) was obtained by solid-phase peptide synthesis. Photoinactivation assays were performed against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii AYE, as well as the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus , and Staphylococcus epidermidis . Partitioning assays were performed with E. coli and S. aureus . Photohemolysis and photokilling assays were also performed to assess the photodynamic activity of the conjugate toward mammalian cells. Eosin-(KLAKLAK)(2) photoinactivates 99.999% of 10(8) CFU/mL of most bacteria tested at a concentration of 1 muM or below. In contrast, neither eosin Y nor (KLAKLAK)(2) cause any significant photoinactivation under similar conditions. The increase in photodynamic activity of the photosensitizer conferred by the antimicrobial peptide is in part due to the fact that (KLAKLAK)(2) promotes the association of eosin Y to bacteria. Eosin-(KLAKLAK)(2) does not significantly associate with red blood cells or the cultured mammalian cell lines HaCaT, COS-7, and COLO 316. Consequently, little photodamage or photokilling is observed with these cells under conditions for which bacterial photoinactivation is achieved. The peptide (KLAKLAK)(2) therefore significantly enhances the photodynamic activity of eosin Y toward both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria while interacting minimally with human cells. Overall, our results suggest that antimicrobial peptides such as (KLAKLAK)(2) might serve as attractive agents that can target photosensitizers to bacteria specifically.
TI  - Toxicity, antimicrobial and anthelmintic activities of Vernonia guineensis Benth. (Asteraceae) crude extracts.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: This study examined the antibacterial, antifungal, and anthelmintic properties of extracts obtained from the plant Vernonia guineensis, a plant commonly used in traditional Cameroonian medicine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For in vitro studies, 10 g of leaf and tuber powder from V. guineensis was extracted separately using dichloromethane, methanol and distilled water. The extracts were dried in vacuo and used for antimicrobial and anthelmintic activity studies. In the antimicrobial assay, extracts were tested against bacterial and fungal organisms including; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Acinetobacter baumannii, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. In the anthelmintic assay, larval and adult stages of the hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum and the mouse nematode Trichuris muris were used. For the acute toxicity test, male and female rats of 150-200 g body weight were used in the experiment. The aqueous extract of V. guineensis tubers was administered in 4 doses of 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 mg/kg per group (n=6), respectively, and the control group received distilled water. RESULTS: The crude extracts exhibited weak antibacterial and antifungal activity except for the dichloromethane extract, which showed moderate activity against A. fumigatus (MIC=200 mug/ml). In the anthelmintic assay, the organic extracts of the tubers had 100% killing efficacy against T. muris at 2mg/ml in 48 h, while the aqueous extract showed no activity. The organic leaf extracts demonstrated potent activity killing 100% of the adult worms 1mg/ml in 24h. The aqueous leaf extract was active at 2mg/ml in 72 h, killing 100% of the adult worms. In the acute toxicity test, V. guineensis did not produce any toxic signs or death at the maximum concentration of 4000 mg/kg. CONCLUSION: Crude extracts from V. guineensis possess anthelmintic activity against T. muris with only weak antibiotic activity. Acute administration of aqueous extract from V. guineensis tubers did not produce toxic effects in rats. The absence of acute toxicity at the highest concentration tested indicates that the tea decoction from V. guineensis extract is safe at concentrations </= 4000 mg/kg.
TI  - The effect of a wound care solution containing polyhexanide and betaine on bacterial counts: results of an in vitro study .
AB  - Polyhexanide and betaine topical solution is used in the management of infected wounds as a cleaning agent. An in vitro study was conducted to examine the antimicrobial effects of a solution containing 0.1% of the antimicrobial agent polyhexanide and 0.1% of the surfactant betaine. Three batches of each product were tested, and culture results of 13 microorganisms were evaluated after 7, 14, and 28 days using USP <51> methodology. Growth reduction was identical at each day following exposure to the solution in all micro-organisms except Aspergillus brasiliensis. A range of 5.3-log to 5.8-log reduction was seen for the following micro-organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Candida albicans, S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, and E. faecalis. For A. brasiliensis, reductions were 2.1-log, 2.3-log and 2.8-log at 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively. The results of this study indicate a 4+ log inhibition of activity in 12 of 13 micro-organisms exposed to the solution. Research to elucidate the potential clinical effects of these observations is needed.
TI  - In vivo antibiofilm effect of cerium, chitosan and hamamelitannin against usual agents of catheter-related bloodstream infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) are common healthcare-associated infections associated with increased morbidity and medical costs. Antiseptic- and antibiotic-coated central venous catheters (CVCs) have been proposed to reduce the incidence of CRBSIs, with variable success. The aim of this study was to determine the in vivo antibiofilm activity of biocompatible and inexpensive compounds, such as cerium nitrate, chitosan and hamamelitannin, against usual agents of CRBSIs. METHODS: The antibiofilm effect of cerium nitrate, chitosan and hamamelitannin was tested against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii and Candida albicans in a mouse foreign body infection model, using polyurethane catheter segments. Biofilm formation was assessed with a crystal violet assay to quantify the total biomass, with a tetrazolium reduction assay to quantify the metabolic activity and with scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: At subinhibitory concentrations, cerium nitrate significantly reduced biofilm formation by C. albicans, chitosan significantly decreased biofilm formation by S. epidermidis and C. albicans, and hamamelitannin significantly inhibited all bacterial biofilms. DISCUSSION: The in vivo antibiofilm effect of cerium nitrate against C. albicans and of chitosan against C. albicans and S. epidermidis, at subinhibitory concentrations, makes them promising alternatives to coat CVCs. Moreover, the microbicidal effect on a wider range of CVC colonizers was previously reported in vitro for both compounds, at higher concentrations. For all bacterial strains, the highest in vivo antibiofilm efficacy was achieved with hamamelitannin. For A. baumannii, this is the first report of in vivo inhibition.
TI  - Monitoring of antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from laboratory animals.
AB  - The drug resistance of microorganisms isolated from laboratory animals never treated with antibiotics is being reported consistently, while the number of laboratory animals used in medicine, pharmacy, veterinary medicine, agriculture, nutrition, and environmental and health science has increased rapidly in Korea. Therefore, this study examined the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from laboratory animals bred in Korea. A total of 443 isolates (7 species) containing 5 Sphingomonas paucimobilis, 206 Escherichia coli, 60 Staphylococcus aureus, 15 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 77 Enterococcus faecalis, 27 Citrobacter freundii, 35 Acinetobacter baumannii were collected from the nose, intestine, bronchus and reproductive organs of ICR mice and SD rats. Of these species, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterococcus faecalis showed significant antimicrobial resistance according to the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) in E-test. In case of Acinetobacter baumannii, several isolates showed MIC values 16-128 microg/mL for cefazolin and cefoxitin, and higher resistance (128-512 microg/mL) to nitrofurantoin than that of standard type. Resistance to cefazolin, cefoxitin and nitrofurantoin was detected in 17.14, 20.00, and 8.57% of the Acinetobacter baumannii isolates, respectively. In addition, 44.1% of the Enterococcus faecalis isolates collected from the laboratory animals were resistant to oxacillin concentration of 16-32 microg/mL range, while MIC value of standard type was below oxacillin concentration of 6 microg/mL. These results suggest that in rodent species of laboratory animals, Acinetobacter baumannii are resistance to cefazolin, cefoxitin and nitrofurantoin, whereas those of Enterococcus faecalis were resistance to oxacillin.
TI  - [Analysis of distribution characteristics and drug resistance of 2748 strains of  pathogens isolated from burn patients].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide epidemiological data of the distribution characteristics and drug resistance of the pathogens isolated from burn patients in recent years for guiding rational use of antibiotics in clinic. METHODS: Totally 2748 strains of pathogens were isolated from 1977 specimens (blood, catheter, wound excretion, etc.) collected from 478 patients hospitalized in Institute of Burn Research of Southwest Hospital from March 2003 to June 2011. After being identified by API strips, drug resistance of the 2748 isolated pathogens to 55 commonly-used antibiotics including gentamicin, tobramycin, piperacillin, amikacin, etc. was tested by K-B paper disk diffusion method. The WHONET 5.3 software was used to analyze the following subjects: the distribution of the pathogens with different types and different sources each year, the changes in drug-resistant rates of Gram negative bacilli, Gram positive cocci, and fungi to several antibiotics, and the changes in sensitive rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), Staphylococcus aureus (SA), Acinetobacter baumannii (AB), Candida albicans (CA) to several antibiotics. RESULTS: Among 2748 strains of pathogens, 1879 strains of Gram negative bacilli accounted for 68.38%, 628 strains of Gram positive cocci accounted for 22.85%, and 241 strains of fungi accounted for 8.77%. The isolation rate of strains from wound excretion ranked the first (1022 strains accounted for 37.19%), followed by those from respiratory tract (995 strains accounted for 36.21%) and blood (421 strains accounted for 15.32%). Strains isolated from other types of specimens were rare. Isolation rate of PA ranked the first (996 strains accounted for 36.24%), followed by SA (495 strains accounted for 18.01%) and AB (395 strains accounted for 14.37%). Isolation rate of AB showed a trend of increase year by year, but that of SA presented the opposite trend. Isolation rate of PA was quite stable. There were 484 strains of methicillin resistant SA among Staphylococci, accounting for 17.61%. Resistant rates of PA and AB to polymyxin B and polymyxin E were below 30.00%, and those of PA and AB to other antibiotics, such as the third generation cephalosporins, beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and quinolones, were from 57.91% to 100.00%. Resistant rate of AB to minocycline was 39.68%. From 2004 to 2011, sensitive rate of PA to quinolone antibiotics showed an increasing trend year by year, but that of AB to minocycline, netilmicin, imipenem, meropenem, tobramycin, and cefoperazone/sulbactam presented the opposite trend. Resistant rates of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and SA to teicoplanin and linezolid were less than 10.00%. Resistant rate of SA, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium to vancomycin was 0. Resistant rates of SA to quinupristin/dalfopristin, minocycline, fusidic acid, and compound sulfamethoxazole were low, respectively 0.82%, 9.35%, 2.21%, and 31.85%. Sensitive rates of SA to erythromycin, clindamycin, compound sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and minocycline showed an increasing trend year by year. Both infection rate and resistant rate of fungi were low. The resistant rates of CA to 5 kinds of antibiotics were less than 15.00%. The sensitive rate of CA to 5-flucytosine declined slightly, and those of CA to the other 4 antibiotics showed an increasing trend year by year. CONCLUSIONS: The three dominant pathogens that cause infection in burn patients hospitalized in Institute of Burn Research of Southwest Hospital in recent years are PA, SA, and AB in order. PA and AB are outstandingly multidrug-resistant among the isolated strains. AB might replace PA as the main pathogenic bacterium that cause the death of burn patients with infection.
TI  - Kirenol production in hairy root culture of Siegesbeckea orientalis and its antimicrobial activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the excellent anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic efficacy associated with kirenol generation, the content of kirenol in Siegesbeckea orientalis is quite low. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to establish a reliable kirenol production protocol by transformed root cultures of S. orientalis and to investigate the antimicrobial activities of kirenol, hairy root, and S. orientalis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transformed root cultures of S. orientalis were established by the transformation of Agrobacterium rhizogenes A4. Transgenic status of the roots was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using rolB specific primers. The biomass and kirenol accumulation of hairy root clones were assessed using four different culture media: MS, MS/2, B5, and white. The antimicrobial activities of kirenol, hairy root, and S. orientalis were evaluated by the disc diffusion method. RESULTS: The optimum media for kirenol synthesis was MS. The content of kirenol in transformed hairy roots made up about 80% of that observed in natural leaves of S. orientalis (1.6 mg/g dry weight). All tested samples displayed antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive pathogens including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Acinetobacter baumannii, with MIC ranging from 78 to 625 mug/mL. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The high level of kirenol contents was obtained from hairy roots of S. orientalis. Kirenol was effective against gram-positive bacteria. Interestingly, the extract from hairy roots showed a diverse antimicrobial effect from that of kirenol and S. orientalis.
TI  - [Changes of etiology of chronic sinusitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore etiology distribution changes of chronic naso sinusitis. METHOD: The purulent discharges taken from the maxillary sinus and posterior ethmoid sinus of 111 patients during endoscopic sinus surgery were cultured for both bacteria and fungi as experimental group. In the control group, the discharges of the nasal cavity from 30 healthy adults were also cultured for bacteria. The culture results were compared with data of 2005, and changes in the distribution of pathogenic microorganisms were analyzed. RESULT: Fifteen species, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus viridans, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, were cultured from the testing group. The total positive rate of bacteria was 81.8%. The detectable rates of Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and various fungi were 37.8%, 54.4%, 7.8% respectively. Five species including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus viridans, Branhamella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus etc were cultured from the control group. There was significant differences between 2005 and 2010 in experimental group (chi2 = 0.009, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Bacterial infection is a major reason for chronic sinusitis. The bacteria distribution structure changed from the original gram-positive bacteria to gram-negative bacteria. Fungal infections can not be ignored. To bacteria culture and drug sensitivity test should be done before antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of statins: a comparative study of atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Statins have several effects beyond their well-known antihyperlipidemic activity, which include immunomodulatory, antioxidative and anticoagulant effects. In this study, we have tested the possible antimicrobial activity of statins against a range of standard bacterial strains and bacterial clinical isolates. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values were evaluated and compared among three members of the statins drug (atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin). RESULTS: It was revealed that statins are able to induce variable degrees of antibacterial activity with atorvastatin, and simvastatin being the more potent than rosuvastatin. Methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (VSE), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterobacter aerogenes, were more sensitive to both atorvastatin, and simvastatin compared to rosuvastatin. On the other hand, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae were more sensitive to atorvastatin compared to both simvastatin and rosuvastatin. Furthermore, most clinical isolates were less sensitive to statins compared to their corresponding standard strains. CONCLUSION: Our findings might raise the possibility of a potentially important antibacterial class effect for statins especially, atorvastatin and simvastatin.
TI  - The Design and Construction of K11: A Novel alpha-Helical Antimicrobial Peptide.
AB  - Amphipathic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides comprise a class of broad-spectrum agents that are used against pathogens. We designed a series of antimicrobial peptides, CP-P (KWKSFIKKLTSKFLHLAKKF) and its derivatives, and determined their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, their minimum hemolytic concentrations (MHCs) for human erythrocytes, and the Therapeutic Index (MHC/MIC ratio). We selected the derivative peptide K11, which had the highest therapeutic index (320) among the tested peptides, to determine the MICs against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and 22 clinical isolates including Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Klebsiella pneumonia. K11 exhibited low MICs (less than 10 mug/mL) and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, especially against clinically isolated drug-resistant pathogens. Therefore, these results indicate that K11 is a promising candidate antimicrobial peptide for further studies.
TI  - The impact of the types of microorganisms isolated from blood and wounds on the results of treatment in burn patients with sepsis.
AB  - Despite development of combustiology, infections continue to be the most important cause of death among patients with burns. Sepsis is the most severe clinical presentation of infection in patients after thermal injuries who require immediate treatment. Early diagnosis and proper treatment of sepsis are important in the clinical management that is often hampered for multiple reasons, e.g. impaired patient immunity, problems with microorganisms with multi-antibacterial drug resistance. The aim of the study was to assess effect of type of a microorganism isolated from blood and wound on results of treatment of sepsis in patients with burns. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Effect of type of microorganisms isolated from blood and wound on the result of treatment of sepsis was studied in 338 patients hospitalized immediately after an injury in Centre for Burn Treatment in Siemianowice Slaskie in years 2003 - 2004 (at the age of 18 - 96 years, 66 women and 272 men). Clinical symptoms of generalized infection were found in all study subjects. The study group was divided into two subgroups: cured patients and patients who died of sepsis. The following parameters were assessed in both subgroups: type of microorganism isolated from blood, type of microorganism isolated from wound as well as occurrence of the same and different infections of blood and burn wound. RESULTS: positive blood cultures were found in 165 patients (48.8%), 106 (64.2%) were cured, 59 (35.8%) died. The most commonly isolated microorganisms in cured patients were Gram(+) Staphylococcus epidermidis MRSE (19.81%) and Staphylococcus aureus MRSA (18.87%). Gram(-) intestinal rods were least commonly isolated from this group. The most commonly isolated microorganisms from blood of patients who were to die, included non-fermenting Gram(-) rods Acinetobacter baumannii (35.59%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.03%). Mixed bacterial flora was found in the blood of 22.03% patients. Among patients who were to die, the same microorganisms were found in the blood and in the wound in 32.2% of patients, while this rate was 17.92 in cured patients. The most commonly found bacteria in the blood and burn wound in the cured patients included Staphylococcus aureus MRSA (31.58%) and Staphylococcus aureus (21.05%). In the group of patients who were to die, the most common bacteria isolated simultaneously from the blood and burn wound included Acinetobacter baumannii (47.37%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (36.84%). CONCLUSIONS: 1. The patients with thermal injuries are at higher risk of death in the event of sepsis caused by Gram(-) bacteria versus Gram(+) bacteria. 2. Infection of blood and burn wound caused by the same bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanni increases the risk of death due to sepsis in patients with burns following thermal injuries.
TI  - Cerium, chitosan and hamamelitannin as novel biofilm inhibitors?
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The colonization of indwelling medical devices and subsequent biofilm formation represents a global challenge since it promotes the persistence of infection and contributes to antimicrobial resistance. The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of cerium, chitosan and hamamelitannin against usual microbial colonizers and to assess their efficacy regarding biofilm formation on polyurethane (PUR)-like catheters. METHODS: The antimicrobial and anti-biofilm effect of cerium nitrate, low molecular weight chitosan (LMWC) and hamamelitannin was tested against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii and Candida albicans strains. Biofilm formation was assessed with PUR-like catheter segments and the metabolic activity was quantified by colorimetry with a tetrazolium reduction assay. RESULTS: Cerium nitrate and LMWC inhibited the microbial growth of all microbial strains tested; hamamelitannin showed no inhibition. Regarding biofilm formation on PUR-like catheters, with subinhibitory concentrations: cerium nitrate significantly inhibited the metabolic activity of C. albicans; LMWC reduced the metabolic activity of S. epidermidis and C. albicans; and hamamelitannin decreased the metabolic activity of all tested bacteria, but not of yeasts. CONCLUSIONS: The microbicidal activity of cerium nitrate and LMWC was clearly demonstrated in this study, as was their fungistatic effect at lower concentrations. Hamamelitannin significantly reduced biofilm metabolic activity of all tested bacteria. These microbial inhibitors may play a promising role regarding different biomedical applications.
TI  - Garlic ointment inhibits biofilm formation by bacterial pathogens from burn wounds.
AB  - When thermal injury damages the skin, the physical barrier protecting underlying  tissues from invading micro-organisms is compromised and the host's immune system becomes supressed, facilitating colonization and infection of burn wounds with micro-organisms. Within the wound, bacteria often develop biofilms, which protect the bacteria from the immune response and enhance their resistance to antibiotics. As the prophylactic use of conventional antibiotics drives selection of drug-resistant strains, the use of novel agents to prevent biofilm formation by wound pathogens is essential. In the present study, we utilized our recently developed in vitro wound biofilm model to examine the antibiofilm activity of garlic (Allium sativum). Wound pathogens were inoculated on sterile cellulose discs, exposed to formulated garlic ointment (GarO) or ointment base, and incubated to allow biofilm development. Biofilms were quantified and visualized microscopically. GarO prevented biofilm development by Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and caused a 2-5 log reduction of the bioburden within Enterococcus faecalis biofilms. Additionally, GarO disrupted partially developed biofilms produced by S. aureus, S. epidermidis and A. baumannii. The antistaphylococcal activity of GarO was stable for over 3 months at room temperature. Thus, GarO could be used as a prophylactic therapy to prevent wound biofilms caused by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria from forming, and may be a potential therapy for disrupting established staphylococcal biofilms.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial growth and biofilm production by constituents from Hypericum spp.
AB  - Biofilm embedded bacterial pathogens such as Staphylococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii are difficult to eradicate and are major sources of bacterial infections. New drugs are needed to combat these pathogens. Hypericum is a plant genus that contains species known to have antimicrobial properties. However, the specific constituents responsible for the antimicrobial properties are not entirely known, nor have most compounds been tested as inhibitors of biofilm development. The investigation presented here tested seven secondary metabolites isolated from the species Hypericum densiflorum, Hypericum ellipticum, Hypericum prolificum, and Hypericum punctatum as inhibitors of bacterial growth and biofilm production. Assays were conducted against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, clinical methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Five of the seven compounds demonstrated growth inhibition against the Gram-positive bacteria with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 1.95 microg/mL to 7.81 microg/mL. Four of the secondary metabolites inhibited biofilm production by certain Gram-positive strains at sub-MIC concentrations.
TI  - Epidemiologic characteristics of resistant microorganisms present in reserves from an intensive care unit.
AB  - In this study, significant contamination in the intensive care unit environment was observed (P < .004). Sampling of inanimate surfaces and equipment found vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, ciprofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and S epidermidis, and multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii with similarities (60%-80%) to blood culture isolates.
TI  - The inhibitory effect of Zingiber corallinum Hance essential oil on drug-resistant bacteria and evaluation of its acute toxicity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The excessive and irregular use of antibiotics could result in the generation and diffusion of drug-resistant bacteria. The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of Zingiber corallinum Hance essential oil (ZCHO) on drug-resistant bacteria, especially on drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. MATERIAL/METHODS: Susceptibility testing was used to evaluate the effect of ZCHO on growth inhibition of drug-resistant bacteria by paper disk method. Mice orally administered with ZCHO were used to observe acute toxicity and to determine median lethal dose (LD(5)(0)) of ZCHO. Broth dilution method was used to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of ZCHO on drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. RESULTS: ZCHO exhibited an obvious inhibitory effect not only on gram-negative drug-resistant bacteria including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter baumannii, but also on gram-positive drug-resistant bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. The ZCHO containing 79% terpinen-4-ol revealed better bacteriostatic effect than ZCHO with 34% terpinen-4-ol. The LD(5)(0) of ZCHO was 1790.427 mg/kg. The MIC and MBC of ZCHO on drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii were 1457.81 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: ZCHO has obvious bacteriostasis and bactericidal effects, especially against drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Therefore, ZCHO is a promising natural bioactive component with antibacterial effect and satisfactory safety due to its low toxicity.
TI  - Changing trends in antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens, 1985-2005: a study from a medical center in northern Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance is a major health problem worldwide. We evaluated the antimicrobial resistance trends of 16 major bacterial pathogens at a tertiary medical center in northern Taiwan. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of annual summary documents for antimicrobial susceptibility of clinically isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from 1985 to 2005. The numbers of isolates and susceptibilities were calculated for three 7-year periods: first period, 1985-1991; second period, 1992-1998; and the third period, 1999-2005. RESULTS: During the 21-year period, 219,715 bacterial pathogens were identified. A significant increase in incidence over time was found for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S epidermidis, penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, erythromycin-resistant S pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, cefotaxime/ceftriaxone-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Additionally, a significant increase in ciprofloxacin resistance rates over time from 1996 to 2005 was noted for E coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and A baumannii (through 1997 to 2005). However, a significant decrease in erythromycin resistance rate with time from 1999 to 2005 was found for Groups A and B streptococci, non-A, B, D streptococci, and S pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Resistance to antimicrobial agents increased rapidly in the past two decades in Taiwan and has become very common in major bacterial pathogens. Continuous enforcement of policies to limit use of antimicrobial agents and active surveillance of antimicrobial resistance through a nationwide system are both warranted.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals in 2009.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline and comparative agents were determined for a collection of the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens from hospital-associated patients across Canada in 2009 as part of the ongoing CANWARD surveillance study. In total, 4,546 isolates from 15 sentinel Canadian hospital laboratories were tested using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method. Compared with other cephalosporins, including ceftobiprole, cefepime, and ceftriaxone, ceftaroline exhibited the greatest potency against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with a MIC(9)(0) of 0.25 mug/ml. Ceftaroline also demonstrated greater potency than ceftobiprole against community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (MIC(9)(0), 0.5 mug/ml) and health care-associated MRSA (MIC(9)(0), 1 mug/ml) and was at least 4-fold more active than other cephalosporins against Staphylococcus epidermidis; all isolates of MSSA and MRSA tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=1 mug/ml). Against streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline MICs (MIC(9)(0), </=0.03 mug/ml) were comparable to those of ceftobiprole; however, against penicillin-nonsusceptible, macrolide-nonsusceptible, and multidrug-nonsusceptible isolates of S. pneumoniae, ceftaroline demonstrated 2- to 4-fold and 4- to 16-fold more potent activities than those of ceftobiprole and ceftriaxone, respectively. All isolates of S. pneumoniae tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=0.25 mug/ml). Among Gram-negative isolates, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity (MIC(9)(0), </=0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli (92.2% of isolates were susceptible), Klebsiella pneumoniae (94.1% of isolates were susceptible), Proteus mirabilis (97.7% of isolates were susceptible), and Haemophilus influenzae (100% of isolates were susceptible). Ceftaroline demonstrated less potent activity (MIC(9)(0), >/=4 mug/ml) against Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Overall, ceftaroline demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a recent collection of the most frequently encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates from patients attending hospitals across Canada in 2009.
TI  - Contamination of anesthesia circuits by pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of contamination of anesthesia circuits by  collecting 56 culture samples from the circular system; previously reprocessed tracheas by disinfection with 1% hypochlorite or 2% glutaraldehyde after being washed in non-sterile water and soap and dried by using compressed air and stored in surgical grade paper; and from other places of the non-reprocessed respiratory circuit, before anesthetic procedures. METHODS: Samples from the inspiratory and expiratory branches of the tracheas, canister, soda-lime, and collector jar (drain) through swab in Stuart medium and streaked in Agar blood, Mac Conkey, and Sabouraud growth media. RESULTS: The level of contamination with fungus and bacteria in the inspiratory and expiratory branches of tracheas reached up to 39.3% in some sites; in some cases, more than one microorganism was present, 75% fungal and 25% bacterial contamination. Cultures were positive for Candida sp., Dermatophytus sp., Penicillium sp., Aspergillus sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Contamination was observed in 25% of the canisters with growth of Candida sp., Penicillium sp., Dermatophytus sp., Aspergillus sp., and Fusarium sp. In the collector jar, a contamination rate of 36% was observed with growth of Candida sp., Dermatophytus sp., S. saprophyticus and Acinetobacter baumannii. Microorganisms did not grow in soda-lime cultures. CONCLUSIONS: In all sites investigated except for soda-lime growth of microorganisms was observed with the possibility of cross infection.
TI  - Chitosan augments photodynamic inactivation of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (PDI) was shown to be a promising treatment modality for microbial infections. This study explores the effect of chitosan, a polycationic biopolymer, in increasing the PDI efficacy against Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), as well as the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Chitosan at <0.1% was included in the antibacterial process either by coincubation with hematoporphyrin (Hp) and subjection to light exposure to induce the PDI effect or by addition after PDI and further incubation for 30 min. Under conditions in which Hp-PDI killed the microbe on a 2- to 4-log scale, treatment with chitosan at concentrations of as low as 0.025% for a further 30 min completely eradicated the bacteria (which were originally at approximately 10(8) CFU/ml). Similar results were also found with toluidine blue O (TBO)-mediated PDI in planktonic and biofilm cells. However, without PDI treatment, chitosan alone did not exert significant antimicrobial activity with 30 min of incubation, suggesting that the potentiated effect of chitosan worked after the bacterial damage induced by PDI. Further studies indicated that the potentiated PDI effect of chitosan was related to the level of PDI damage and the deacetylation level of the chitosan. These results indicate that the combination of PDI and chitosan is quite promising for eradicating microbial infections.
TI  - Suprathel-antiseptic matrix: in vitro model for local antiseptic treatment?
AB  - Acetic acid is a traditional antiseptic agent that has been used for more than 6000 years. The main goal of this study was to demonstrate the suitability of Suprathel (PolyMedics Innovations GmbH, Denkendorf, Germany) in combination with various antiseptic agents to create an "antiseptic-matrix" especially designed for problematic microorganisms such as Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter baumannii, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are frequently associated with burns. The study was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial effect of a "Suprathel-antiseptic matrix" (Suprathel combined with acetic acid 3%, povidone-iodine 11% [Betaisodona], polyhexanide 0.04% [Lavasept], phenoxyethanol 2%/octenidine dihydrochloride 0.1% [Octenisept], mafenide acetate 5%, and chlorhexidine gluconate 1.5%/cetrimid 15% [Hibicet]). As a means to assess the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria strains were tested: Escherichia coli, P vulgaris, P aeruginosa, A baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S aureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococcus groups A and B. The tests showed a positive bactericidal effect of the Suprathel-antiseptic matrix, particularly with problematic Gram-negative bacteria such as P vulgaris, P aeruginosa, and A baumannii, except for the combination of Suprathel and mafenide acetate. It can be concluded that Suprathel-antiseptic matrix appears to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but clinical studies need to be performed to confirm these in vitro observations. The authors' previous studies have shown that acetic acid demonstrates a wide antiseptic spectrum for microorganisms typically found in burn patients. The combination of Suprathel and acetic acid worked well in this study and appears to be promising for future clinical application.
TI  - [Infection in patients with malignant tumors].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characters of infection in patients with malignant  tumors, especially the distribution, yearly change of pathogens, and pathogen resistance to common antibacterial agents. METHODS: We respectively analyzed the characters of infection in 489 patients with malignant tumors. RESULTS: The respiratory tract was the most frequent infection site (61.1%). The infection was mainly caused by opportunistic pathogens. The Gram-negative bacterias mainly consisted of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii (46.3%). The Gram-positive bacteria mainly consisted of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (29.9%), and the rest 23.8% of the infection was caused by different fungi, mainly consisting of Candida albicans. The ratio of the Gram-negative bacteria resistance to antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins (except ceftazidime), sulfanilamides, tetracyclines and quinolones was higher. The ratio of the Gram-positive bacteria resistance to antibiotics such as penicillins, macrolides and quinolones was higher. The ratio of fungus resistance to antibacterial agents such as fluconazol and itraconazole was higher. The infection caused by fungi obviously increased in the past 5 years. CONCLUSION: The infection in patients with malignant tumors is mainly caused by opportunistic pathogens, and the pathogen resistance to antibacterial agents is serious. The infection caused by fungi is increasing.
TI  - Efficacy of concurrent application of chlorhexidine gluconate and povidone iodine against six nosocomial pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) and povidone iodine (PI) are rarely used concurrently despite a lack of evidence regarding functional incompatibility of these agents. METHODS: CHG and PI, alone and combined, were evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible S aureus [MSSA] and methicillin-resistant S aureus [MRSA]), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli using checkerboard microbroth dilution techniques. Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was the concentration (percent wt/vol) that reduced bacterial burden >/= 5-log(10) colony-forming units/mL at 2 hours when compared with bacterial densities in growth controls. Fractional bactericidal concentration indexes (FBCIs) were calculated to determine CHG and PI compatibility. Additionally, tissue plugs from freshly excised porcine vaginal mucosa were infected with S aureus (MSSA), treated for 2 hours with CHG 3%, PI 5%, or CHG 3% and PI 5% combined and then viable bacteria on the tissue plugs enumerated. RESULTS: In broth, CHG demonstrated dose-dependent bactericidal activity, whereas PI activity was all-or-none. All isolates studied were similarly susceptible to CHG (MBCs: 0.0078% +/- 0.0019%, 0.0069% +/- 0.0026%, 0.0024% +/- 0.0005%, 0.0024% +/- 0.0005%, 0.0059% +/- 0.0%, and 0.0029% +/- 0.0%, respectively). The MBCs of PI were identical (0.625%) for all isolates. Overall, FBCI calculations showed indifference. Treatment of MSSA-infected porcine tissue for 2 hours demonstrated that the CHG-PI combination was superior to either antiseptic alone. CONCLUSION: FBCIs, determined in broth culture, indicate that combining CHG and PI had no negative impact on antisepsis. Moreover, data from an ex vivo porcine mucosal infection model suggest a potential benefit when combining the 2 antiseptic agents.
TI  - Influence of third-generation cephalosporin resistance on adult in-hospital mortality from post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical features, etiology and predictors of in-hospital mortality in adults with post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 60 adult patients with culture-proven post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis hospitalized between September 2006 and August 2008. RESULTS: Of the 60 patients, 88.3% had monomicrobial infection and 11.7% had mixed infection. The mean duration from the first neurosurgical procedure to the diagnosis of meningitis was 21 days (range, 1-134 days). The median frequency of neurosurgical procedure before meningitis was 1 (range, 1-5). A total of 69 isolates were identified from the cerebrospinal fluid, the most common pathogens were Gram-negative bacilli (43, 62.3%), followed by Gram-positive bacteria (24, 34.8%). The three most common Gram-negative bacilli were Serratia marcescens (7, 10.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6, 8.7%), and Enterobacter cloacae (4, 5.8%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates comprised less than 3%. Notably, glucose non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli other than Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas spp. accounted for 11.6% of the total. Of the Gram-negative bacilli, resistance rates to the third-generation cephalosporins, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, were 58.1% and 34.9%, respectively. The two most common Gram-positive pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (10, 14.5%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (including S. epidermidis) (10, 14.5%). The in-hospital mortality rate was 15.0%, which was significantly related to Gram-negative bacilli resistant to third-generation cephalosporins in multivariate analysis (adjusted odds ratio = 33.65; p = 0.047). CONCLUSION: These findings may portend the spread of serious resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in nosocomial Gram-negative bacilli throughout the neurosurgical units, suggestive of the need to reassess the empirical use of third-generation cephalosporins in post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis.
TI  - [Investigation of distribution of bacteria and fungi in severe acute pancreatitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spectrum of bacteria and fungi in different sites in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: The prospective study was performed in 205 patients with SAP treated from January 2000 to December 2008. The Infection rate of bacteria and fungi was observed prospectively in pancreatic necrosis and(or) pus form abdomen, body fluids and deep vein catheter in SAP. Body fluids and pancreatic necrosis were cultured twice a week. Central venous catheter was cultured when it had been placed for two weeks. Blood was cultured for bacteria and fungi when body temperature was more than 39 degrees C. Constituent ratio of bacteria and fungi was observed in different sites and in all sites within 28 days after onset of SAP. RESULTS: There were 937 pathogens, among which infection rates of gram-negative bacteria was higher than gram-positive bacteria and fungi (P < 0.05), the infection rates of gam-positive bacteria and fungi were similar. Infection rates of gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis (55.2%), bile (55.4%), blood (68.1%) and central venous catheter (44.4%) were increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-positive bacteria and (30.2%, 33.9%, 23.4%, 38.9%) and fungi (14.6%, 10.7%, 8.5%, 16.7%); however, infection rate of fungi (59.6%) was increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-negative bacteria (24.0%) and gram-positive bacteria (16.3%) in urine; infection rate of gram-negative bacteria (53.2%) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of fungi (27.1%) and gram-positive bacteria (19.7%) in sputum. Infection rate of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) in gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis, bile, blood, central venous catheter and sputum was significantly higher than that of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae) (P < 0.01); infection rate of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli) was higher significantly (P < 0.01) than that of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii). Infection rate of staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium in pancreatic necrosis and sputum;but infection rate of Enterococcus faecium in bile and urine was significantly higher than other gram-positive bacteria (P < 0.05). There was not difference among gram-positive bacteria;however, infection rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis in central venous catheter was increased significantly (P < 0.05). Infection rate of candida mycoderma in pancreatic necrosis, bile, urine and sputum was significantly higher than that of tricho bacteria (P < 0.05). The peak of infection rate of microbes in body fluid was within 2 to 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Constituent ratio in gram-negative, gram-positive bacteria and fungi as well as their species in different sites is diverse. The peak of infection rate of microbes is 2 to 3 weeks after onset of the disease.
TI  - [Clinical relevance of time-to-positivity in BACTEC9240 blood culture system].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous monitoring systems have allowed determination of the time-to-positivity (TTP). We evaluated the clinical relevance of TTP in the BACTEC9240 system (Becton-Dickinson, USA). METHODS: A total of 2,354 vials of positive blood cultures were evaluated over 2 months. TTP was monitored from each of BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F (BD) or Pediatric Plus/F and Lytic Anaerobic/F bottles, and the differential time-to-positivity (DTP) for blood samples drawn simultaneously via catheter and a peripheral site was determined. RESULTS: The average TTP of the positive vials was 17.4 hr, and 79.9% and 95.2% of the vials showed positivity within 24 and 48 hr, respectively. While the average TTP values for Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were less than 10 hr, those for Candida spp., anaerobes, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium spp, Bacillus spp. other than cereus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were 35.3, 27.0, 56.8, 45.8, 23.0, and 26.3 hr, respectively. The negative predictive values of TTP over 24 hr to predict Staphylococcus aureus among staphylococci and S. pneumoniae among alpha-hemolytic streptococci were 76.7% and 100%, respectively. Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus faecalis showed shorter TTP in anaerobic vials than in aerobic vials. DTP of more than 2 hr was observed for 27.8%, 72.2%, and 45.5% of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Candida spp. CONCLUSIONS: TTP can be used to discriminate pathogens and contaminants. The shorter TTP in anaerobic vials of certain Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus spp. would facilitate further identification. DTP is useful for diagnosing catheter-related bloodstream infection by S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Candida spp.
TI  - Synergistic effects between conventional antibiotics and 2-aminoimidazole-derived antibiofilm agents.
AB  - 2-aminoimidazoles are an emerging class of small molecules that possess the ability to inhibit and disperse biofilms across bacterial order, class, and phylum. Herein, we report the synergistic effect between a 2-aminoimidazole/triazole conjugate and antibiotics toward dispersing preestablished biofilms, culminating with a 3-orders-of-magnitude increase of biofilm dispersion toward Staphylococcus aureus biofilms. Furthermore, we document that the 2-aminoimidazole/triazole conjugate will also resensitize multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria to the effects of conventional antibiotics, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.
TI  - Dual-action hygienic coatings: benefits of hydrophobicity and silver ion release  for protection of environmental and clinical surfaces.
AB  - Coatings that demonstrate reduced attachment of crystalline precipitates and the  medical device colonising Staphylococcus epidermidis were prepared by the immobilisation of silver doped perfluoropolyether-urethane siloxane thin films on glass substrates. The presence of stratified hydrophobic perfluoropolyether groups protects the coating surface from the attachment of crystalline hydrophilic species such as chlorides and phosphates, whilst silver ion release inhibited attachment of S. epidermidis and subsequent biofilm formation in vitro. The release of silver ions protects the perfluoro groups from the hydrophobic interactions of S. epidermidis cells, which can reduce the hydrophobicity of the protective coating. These coatings also exhibited significant antibacterial activity against planktonic Acinetobacter baumannii and S. epidermidis bacterial strains. Detailed elemental and chemical surface analysis obtained using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) provided useful information on the effect of bacterial incubation on key indicator hydrophobic and hydrophilic functional groups. XPS analysis indicated preferential adsorption of S. epidermidis cells at the hydrophobic sites along the polymeric chain. These dual-action hygienic coatings can be employed to protect against contamination environmental surfaces and bacterial colonisation on implanted medical devices.
TI  - Chemical synthesis and biological screening of 2-aminoimidazole-based bacterial and fungal antibiofilm agents.
AB  - A collection of 2-aminoimidazole/triazole amides has been synthesized and screened for antibiofilm activity. This class of small molecules was found to modulate the biofilm activity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a multidrug-resistant strain of Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB), a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Rhodospirillum salexigens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Vibrio vulnificus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium as well as the yeast Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. Furthermore, lead compounds were found to not lyse red blood cells at active concentrations.
TI  - In vitro activity of nemonoxacin, a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, against 2,440 clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nemonoxacin (TG-873870), a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, was tested against 2,440 clinical isolates. Nemonoxacin was at least fourfold more active than levofloxacin and moxifloxacin against most gram-positive cocci tested (shown by the following MIC(90)/range [microg/ml] values; community-associated methicillin [meticillin]-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5/0.015 to 2; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.5/0.015 to 4 for methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and 2/0.12 to 2 for methicillin-resistant staphylococci; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.015/< or = 0.008 to 0.25; Enterococcus faecalis, 1/0.03 to 128). Nemonoxacin activity against gram-negative bacilli was similar to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin (MIC(90)/range [microg/ml]; Escherichia coli, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2/< or = 0.015 to 128; K. oxytoca, 0.5/0.06 to 1; Proteus mirabilis, 16/0.25 to > or = 512; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Acinetobacter baumannii, 1/0.12 to 16).
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and evaluation of antibacterial activity of some thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole incorporating diphenylsulfone moieties.
AB  - A series of thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole incorporating diphenylsulfone moieties were synthesized starting from 5-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thioles 3a-c, X=H, Cl, Br. Thus, alkylation of 1,2,4-triazoles 3 with phenacyl bromide or 4-bromophenacyl bromide afforded S-substituted 1,2,4-triazoles 4, 5. These new intermediates 4 and 5, in the presence of H(2)SO(4) (c), were cyclized to 2-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl]-6-(4-Y-phenyl)[1,3]thiazolo[3,2-b]-[1,2,4]-triaz oles 6, 7 (I) and not to isomeric thiazolo[2,3-c][1,2,4]-triazoles 6, 7 (II). The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, (1)H, (13)C NMR and elemental analysis. MS spectra confirmed the formation of thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole 6, 7 (forms I) in detriment of [2,3-c] isomeric compounds (forms II). The potential antibacterial effects of the synthesized compounds were investigated using standard bacterial strains: Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606, Citrobacter freundii ATCC 8090, Escherichia coli ATCC 11775, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579.
TI  - In vivo model of human pathogen infection and demonstration of efficacy by an antimicrobial pouch for pacing devices.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Device-related infections represent a significant clinical challenge. Once established, these infections prove difficult to treat with existing antibiotic regimens, compromising the health of device recipients, and usually requiring surgical intervention to resolve. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of the AIGIS(RX) antibacterial envelope (TyRx Pharma, Inc., Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA) designed to reduce device-related infections by incorporating minocycline and rifampin in a controlled release polymer. METHODS: An infection was established in a rabbit model by creating bilateral subcutaneous implant pockets, into which a pacing device with or without AIGIS(RX) was placed. The incisions were closed, and a defined dose of bacteria was infused into each implant pocket. After 7 days, devices were explanted and sampled for viable bacteria by swabbing and sonication. RESULTS: Initial studies evaluated the ability of the AIGIS(RX) pouch to reduce Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epi) infection in this model using clinical and quantitative microbial endpoints. Results demonstrate S. epi infection in all control samples, while no pathogens were recovered from samples with the AIGIS(RX) pouch. Systemic antibiotic levels were undetectable. Additional studies tested the efficacy of the AIGIS(RX) pouch with additional bacterial strains, Staphylococcus capitis, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter Baumannii. In each case, the device and implant pocket with the AIGIS(RX) pouch was free of any signs of infection. An assessment of biofilm produced by Acinetobacter demonstrated the elimination of biofilm formation on the implanted device. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that in this animal model, the AIGIS(RX) device reduces the risk for infection of viable pathogens within implant pockets.
TI  - [Etiology of infections in the wounded victims of Wenchuan Earthquake].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the etiology of infections in the wounded victims of Wenchuan Earthquake. METHODS: 2135 smears of secretion were made from 1823 hospitalized wounded victims of Wenchuan Earthquake to detect the pathogens. Specimens were delivered to be cultured. The bacteria thus obtained were identified. Drug sensitivity test was conducted. RESULTS: 2002 specimens, 1243 specimens of secretion (62.1%), 600 blood specimens (30.0%), 102 specimens of pus or secretion of respiratory tract (5.1%), 45 specimens from catheter (2.2%), and 12 urine specimens (0.5%). Pathogens were found in 725 cases. The top five pathogenic bacteria isolated within 1 month after the quake were Acinetobacter baumannii (16.7%), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (16.7%), Escherichia coli (12.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.5%), and Candida tropicalis (8.3%), quite different from the pathogen spectrum of the common in-patients within one month before the quake: Escherichia coli (18.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.4%), Candida glabrata (11.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (9.1%). The isolation rate of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus after the earthquake was significantly lower, and the isolation rates of extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca were all significantly higher than those from the common surgical patients before the quake (all P < 0.05). There were not significant differences in the isolation rates of multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas alcaligenes and Acinetobacter baumannii before and after the quake. CONCLUSION: Infection is frequent after natural disasters. It is necessary to summarize the changes of spectrum of pathogens and drug-resistant spectrum.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activity of Flindersine isolated from the traditional medicinal plant, Toddalia asiatica (L.) Lam.
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: The leaves and root of Toddalia asiatica (L.) Lam. (Rutaceae) are widely used as a folk medicine in India. Hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, methanol and water extracts of Toddalia asiatica leaves and isolated compound Flindersine were tested against bacteria and fungi. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antibacterial and antifungal activities were tested against bacteria and fungi using disc-diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). The compound was confirmed using X-ray crystallography technique. RESULTS: Antibacterial and antifungal activities were observed in ethyl acetate extract. One active principle Flindersine (2,6-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-5H-pyrano [3,2-c] quinoline-5-one-9cl) was isolated from the ethyl acetate extract. The MIC values of the compound against bacteria Bacillus subtilis (31.25 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (62.5 microg/ml), Staphylococcus epidermidis (62.5 microg/ml), Enterococcus faecalis (31.25 microg/ml), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (250 microg/ml), Acinetobacter baumannii (125 microg/ml) and fungi Trichophyton rubrum 57 (62.5 microg/ml), Trichophyton mentagrophytes (62.5 microg/ml), Trichophyton simii (62.5 microg/ml), Epidermophyton floccosum (62.5 microg/ml), Magnaporthe grisea (250 microg/ml) and Candida albicans (250 microg/ml) were determined. CONCLUSIONS: Ethyl acetate extract showed promising antibacterial and antifungal activity and isolated compound Flindersine showed moderate activity against bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Silver doped perfluoropolyether-urethane coatings: antibacterial activity and surface analysis.
AB  - The colonisation of clinical and industrial surfaces with pathogenic microorganisms has prompted increased research into the development of effective antibacterial and antifouling coatings. There is evidence that implanted biomedical surfaces coated with metallic silver can be inactivated by physiological fluids, thus reducing the bioactivity of the coating. In this work, we report the biofilm inhibition of Staphylococcus epidermidis using a room temperature processed silver doped perfluoropolyether-urethane coating. The release of silver ions from these fluoropolymers over a six-day period inhibited bacterial encrustation - as observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicated differences in carbon, fluorine and sodium surface composition between silver doped and undoped fluoropolymers after exposure to nutrient rich media. These silver doped perfluoropolyether coatings also exhibited antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii; suggesting potential use in preventing transmission of pathogenic and opportunistic microbes on environmental surfaces in healthcare facilities. The broad-spectrum antibacterial activity of these silver release coatings may be exploited on biomaterials surfaces to combat the development of resistant Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae that can occur during prophylactic treatment for urinary tract infections.
TI  - The antimicrobial effect of acetic acid--an alternative to common local antiseptics?
AB  - Acetic acid has been commonly used in medicine for more than 6000 years for the disinfection of wounds and especially as an antiseptic agent in the treatment and prophylaxis of the plague. The main goal of this study was to prove the suitability of acetic acid, in low concentration of 3%, as a local antiseptic agent, especially for use in salvage procedures in problematic infections caused by organisms such as Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This study was designed to compare the in vitro antimicrobial effect of acetic acid with those of common local antiseptics such as povidone-iodine 11% (Betaisodona), polyhexanide 0.04% (Lavasept), mafenide 5% and chlohexidine gluconate 1.5% cetrimide 15% (Hibicet). Former studies suggest the bactericidal effect of acetic acid, but these data are very heterogeneous; therefore, a standardised in vitro study was conducted. To cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial strains were tested: Escherichia coli, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and beta-haemolytic Streptococcus group A and B. The tests showed excellent bactericidal effect of acetic acid, particularly with problematic Gram-negative bacteria such as P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. The microbiological spectrum of acetic acid is wide, even when tested at a low concentration of 3%. In comparison to our currently used antiseptic solutions, it showed similar - in some bacteria, even better - bactericidal properties. An evaluation of the clinical value of topical application of acetic acid is currently underway. It can be concluded that acetic acid in a concentration of 3% has excellent bactericidal effect and, therefore, seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but further clinical studies are necessary.
TI  - Bacterial resistance surveillance in China: a report from Mohnarin 2004-2005.
AB  - The aim of this study was to establish a nationwide antimicrobial resistant surveillance network and obtain information on bacterial resistance in China. A total of 4075 clinical bacterial isolates were collected from 17 hospitals in 15 cities throughout China. Antibacterial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the standard agar dilution method recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The results of the MICs revealed the following bacterial resistance characteristics. Oxacillin resistance was shown by 62.9% of Staphylococcus aureus and 82.89% of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. Penicillin non-sensitivity was show by 40.7% of the Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, which included 10.5% penicillin-resistant strains and 30.2% penicillin-intermediate strains. Five strains of Enterococci were vancomycin-intermediate, but all Enterococci strains were sensitive to teicoplanin. All Staphylococci were susceptible to glycopeptides. A high resistance to macrolides was a predominant characteristic of the Gram-positive cocci. Enterobacteriaceae strains were clearly resistant to the third generation cephalosporins, with the exception of ceftazidime, and the resistance rates ranged from 20 to 70%. About 65% of the Escherichia coli strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones. Carbapenems remained highly active against all the target bacteria. Latamoxef, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime were all active against Enterobacteriaceae, which showed resistant rates of less than 10%. Imipenem resistance was found in 10.6% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 10.4% of Acinetobacter baumannii strains, most of which were multidrug resistant isolates. Combinations of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor and fluoroquinolones also had potent antibacterial activity against non-fermenters. Amikacin was active against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. In conclusion, methicillin-resistant Staphylococci, penicillin-insensitive S. pneumoniae, macrolides-resistant Gram-positive cocci, cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, multidrug-resistant nonfermenters and fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli were revealed to be the most serious problems in terms of bacteria resistance in China. No glycopeptides-resistant Staphylococcus strains were isolated, and the appearance of glycopeptides-resistant Enterococci was seldom.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of 3931 organisms isolated from intensive care units in Canada: Canadian National Intensive Care Unit Study, 2005/2006.
AB  - We tested the in vitro activity of 15 antimicrobials against Gram-positive cocci  and 12 antimicrobials against Gram-negative bacilli versus 3931 isolates (20 most common organisms) obtained between September 1, 2005, and June 30, 2006, from 19 intensive care units (ICUs) across Canada. The most active (based upon MIC only) agents against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis were dalbavancin, daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 0.06 and < or =0.03, 0.25 and 0.12, 2 and 1, 0.5 and 0.5, and 1 and 2, respectively. The most active agents against vancomycin-resistant enterococci were daptomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 1, 4, and 0.12, respectively. The most active agents against Escherichia coli were amikacin, cefepime, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, and tigecycline with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 4, < or =1, < or =0.12, 8, and 0.5, respectively. The most active agents against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli were meropenem and tigecycline with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of < or =0.12 and 1, respectively. The most active agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were amikacin, cefepime, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 16, 32, 16, and 64, respectively. The most active agents against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were tigecycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 4 and 4, respectively. The most active agents against Acinetobacter baumannii were fluoroquinolones (e.g., levofloxacin), meropenem, and tigecycline with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 0.5, 1, and 2, respectively. In conclusion, the most active agents versus Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative bacilli obtained from Canadian ICUs were daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, dalbavancin and amikacin, cefepime, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, and tigecycline (not P. aeruginosa), respectively.
TI  - [Investigation of 728 strains of infectious bacteria in burn ward and analysis of their antibiotic resistance].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the infectious strains of bacteria in our burn ward in recent 5 years, and analyze their antibiotic resistance. METHODS: Bacteria were isolated from the wound excretions of 306 burn patients hospitalized during 2001 to 2006 for analyzing their strains and their antibiotic resistance. RESULTS: 378 strains were Grams positive bacteria, among them Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant strain. Further analysis showed that methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ranked the first in occurrence, followed by methicillin-resistance Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) and Enterococcus fecalis, 338 strains were Gram negative bacteria, and among them Acinetobacter baumannii was predominant, and Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ranked the 2nd and 3rd. Twelve strains were fungi. CONCLUSION: Drug resistance to antibiotics in our burn ward may be related to the beta-lactamases from acinetobacter baumannii and multiple-drug-resistance of MRSA.
TI  - [Epidemiology and susceptibility profile of blood culture isolates in an intensive care unit (2002-2005)].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to determine the epidemiological profile and the antibiotics susceptibility of bacteria identified in blood culture in the intensive care unit, to improve empirical antibiotherapy. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A retrospective study was made over a four-year period (2002-2005) in the intensive care unit of the Mohammed-V Military Hospital. It included all the bacteria identified in blood culture. RESULTS: During this period, we collected 286 isolates, Gram-negative bacilli 49.3% and Gram-positive cocci 46.85%. The most frequently identified species were Acinetobacter baumannii (13.63%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (12.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.9%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). Enterobacteriaceae accounted for 25.54%: Klebsiella pneumoniae 7%, and Enterobacter cloacae 7%. The rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was 52.94 % and coagulase negative staphylococci 60.24%. No resistance to glycopeptides was observed. Enterobacteriaceae were resistant to third generation cephalosporins in 42.6 % and had a broad-spectrum betalactamase phenotype in 18%. The resistance rate of A. baumannii was 68.7% for ceftazidime and 31.4% for imipenem. The resistance rate of P. aeruginosa to the third generation cephalosporines and the imipenem were respectively 16.6% and 10.5%. CONCLUSION: A regular epidemiologic study of blood culture isolates and determination of susceptibility to antibiotics are necessary to improve empiric therapy.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Microbiology of postoperative infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical infections, accounting for approximately one quarter of all  nosocomial infections, contribute to longer hospital stays and higher medical costs. Clinical failure of antibiotic treatment often is associated with increasing drug resistance. METHODS: Non-duplicated microbial isolates obtained at our institution from surgical patients were identified and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using the Sceptor system in 2001-2002 and the Phoenix system in 2003-2005. Epidemiologic data were extracted using Epicenter and Powerlab. During selected periods, genetic and biochemical characterization was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, colony blot hybridization, gene amplification and sequencing, isoelectric focusing, and enzyme kinetics. RESULTS: The specimens were most commonly isolated from infections at surgical sites (24.0%), the urinary tract (19.0%), and blood stream (10.6%). Isolates of Escherichia coli showed an increasing prevalence of resistance to penicillins, third-generation cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin, whereas the prevalence of resistant Staphylococcus aureus generally declined. Highly aggressive multi-drug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were widespread, although colistin remained effective in 100% of cases. A significant increase was seen in infections attributable to S. epidermidis and Candida albicans. The overall number of Enterobacteriaceae carrying extended-spectrum beta-lactamases increased continuously, and new resistance traits emerged. It appeared that the TEM-92 determinant moved from Enterobacteriaceae to nonfermenting gram-negative rods such as Acinetobacter baumannii. CONCLUSION: The number and type of antimicrobial-resistance determinants are increasing.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16SrDNA oligonucleotide array].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. However conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. On the basis of special gene sequence, PCR provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. But it is difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic agents. Oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of target genes. The objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the PCR product of 16SrDNA using a pair of universal primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: By comparison and analysis of the 16SrDNA sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. A pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. The probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of PCR using the universal primers. RESULTS: The universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, Neisseria meningitides, Citrobacter freundii, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human DNA as control. The results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could not hybridize with other bacteria. The lowest concentration of DNA (product of PCR) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. The results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. The results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. From the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system, which contains amplification of the segment of 16rDNA from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of PCR products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Epidemiology of nosocomial pneumonia in infants after cardiac surgery.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pattern of nosocomial pneumonia (NP) in infants in a pediatric surgical ICU after cardiac surgery may differ from that seen in adult ICUs. STUDY OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of NP in infants after cardiac surgery and, secondarily, to describe the changes of the distribution and antibiotic resistance of the pathogen during the last 3 years. METHODS: Data were collected between June 1999 and June 2002 from 311 consecutive infants who underwent open-heart surgery in our hospital. We retrospectively analyzed the distribution and antibiotic resistance pattern of all the pathogenic microbial isolates cultured from lower respiratory tract aspirations. RESULTS: Of 311 infants, 67 patients (21.5%) acquired NP after cardiac surgery. The incidence of NP was more frequently associated with complex congenital heart defect (CHD) compared to simple CHD (43% vs 15.9%, chi(2) = 22.47, p < 0.0001). The proportion of late-onset NP was higher in patients with complex CHD (chi(2) = 6.02, p = 0.014). A total of 79 pathogenic microbial strains were isolated. Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) were the most frequent isolates (68 isolates, 86.1%), followed by fungi (6 isolates, 7.6%) and Gram-positive cocci (5 isolates, 6.3%). The main GNB were Acinetobacter baumanii (11 isolates, 13.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 isolates, 12.7%); other commonly seen GNB were Flavobacterium meningosepticum (7 isolates, 8.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7 isolates, 8.9%), Escherichia coli (6 isolates, 7.6%), and Xanthomonas maltophilia (5 isolates, 6.2%). The most commonly seen Gram-positive cocci were Staphylococcus aureus (2 isolates, 2.5%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 isolates, 2.5%). The frequent fungi were Candida albicans (5 isolates, 6.3%). Most GNB were sensitive to cefoperazone-sulbactum, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, amikacin. The bacteria producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases were mainly from K pneumoniae and E coli; the susceptibility of ESBL-producing strains to imipenem was 100%. There were one case of methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) and 1 case of methicillin-resistant S epidermidis; their susceptibility to vancomycin, gentamycin, and ciprofloxacin were 100%. From 1999 to 2002 in infants with NP after open-heart surgery, there was a trend of increasing frequency of multiresistant GNB such as A baumanii, P aeruginosa, and K pneumoniae. However, no remarkable changes of distribution were found in Gram-positive cocci and fungi in the 3-year period. Early onset episodes of NP were frequently caused by Haemophilus influenzae, methicillin-sensitive S aureus, and other susceptible Enterobacteriaceae. Conversely, in patients who acquired late-onset NP, P aeruginosa, A baumannii, other multiresistant GNB, MRSA, and fungi were the predominant organisms. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of pathogens and their antibiotic-resistance patterns in NP in infants after cardiac surgery had not shown an increasing prevalence of Gram-positive pathogens as reported by several adult ICUs. GNB still remained the most common pathogens during the last 3 years in our hospital. There was a trend of increasing antibiotic resistance in these isolates.
TI  - Sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin B was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees C with five inocula of 14 bacteria. Two yeasts (Candida spp) and one Aspergillus were also tested. Contaminated media were then inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a Bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. Changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened daily by visual inspection. The sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. RESULTS: Organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria irrespective of the starting inoculums: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Haemophilus influenzae. For micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal only (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida kruzei, Aspergillus fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. Mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (SD 13.8, range 2-52). In cases of detection by the blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. A total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the National Taiwan University Hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. Most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. For many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. Some strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. Moxifloxacin was less active against P. aeruginosa, but was more active against S. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. In conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. The drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in Taiwan.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - The ex vivo antimicrobial activity and colonization rate of two antimicrobial-bonded central venous catheters.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Catheter-related sepsis is an important complication associated with the use of central venous catheters. Recent studies have suggested that antimicrobial-bonded catheters may reduce catheter colonization and catheter-related sepsis. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the antimicrobial activity and the colonization rate of two commercially available antimicrobial-bonded central venous catheters. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled, nonblinded study. SETTING: Medical intensive care unit of a university-affiliated teaching hospital. PATIENTS: One hundred twenty consecutive medical intensive care unit patients requiring new central venous catheters (fresh stick). INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive a) a Standard Arrow; b) an ARROWgard; or c) a Cook Bio-Guard Spectrum central venous catheter. Central venous catheters were removed when they were no longer required or when catheter-related sepsis was suspected. Under aseptic conditions, the distal 12 cm of the removed catheters were cut into six 2-cm segments. Semiquantitative culture was performed (by roll technique) on the distal segment. Colonization was defined as >15 colony-forming units. Using a modified Kirby-Bauer technique, the zone of inhibition of the remaining five segments was determined against the following organisms: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Candida albicans Catheters that were removed within 24 hrs of insertion were excluded from the analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seven patients were not assessable. The baseline clinical and demographic characteristics were similar among the three groups of patients. Eleven Standard Arrow (28%), seven ARROWgard (19%), and four Bio-Guard (11%) catheters were colonized (p = .05 for Bio-Guard vs. control). Staphylococci were the most common colonizing organisms. Two patients with Standard Arrow catheters (5%) and one patient with an ARROWgard catheter (3%) developed catheter-related sepsis. Antibiotic-coated catheters significantly inhibited the growth of all test organisms except C. albicans (p < or = .05). Zones of inhibition were significantly larger for the Bio-Guard compared with the ARROWgard catheter when tested against MRSA, S. epidermidis, and E. faecalis (p < or = .002). CONCLUSION: The Bio-Guard central venous catheter had greater ex vivo antimicrobial activity against MRSA, S. epidermidis, and E. faecalis compared with the ARROWgard catheter, and this was associated with a significantly lower rate of catheter colonization.
TI  - [Bacterial strains isolated from neutropenic patients and their resistance to antibiotics].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although Gram negative as well as Gram positive bacteria participate  in febrile episodes of neutropenic patients, in particular recently the ratio of Gram positive bacteria is increasing. The objective of the present work was to investigate the incidence and antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacterial agents in neutropenic patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: The presence of bacteria was investigated in 446 neutropenic patients hospitalized at the Haematological Clinic in 1995. Haemocultures (apparatus Bact/Alert 120, cultivation media Organon-Teknika) and urine were examined. The sensitivity for antibiotics was tested by the standard dilution micromethod. In blood most frequently Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated (45.4%), coagulase-negative strains of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (14.4%), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (complex 6.3%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.3%). In urine the following were detected: Staphylococcus epidermidis (36.5%), Enterococcus sp. (14.5%), Escherichia coli (13.1%), Enterococcus faecalis (11.6%) and Enterococcus solitarius (6.5%). In all strains resistance to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic drugs was assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Investigation of the frequency of different bacterial species, along with monitoring of the resistance is an essential prerequisite of initial antibiotic therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients.
TI  - Neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Airway colonization with Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) and Gram-positive cocci (GPC) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. Whether GNB are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI) and/or to the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is unknown. METHODS: We prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. Data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. The severity of BPD was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with GPC (Staphylococus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). Superimposed on 36% of these infants was GNB airway colonization with Klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), Enterobacter cloacae (25%), Escherichia coli (25%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), Serratia marcescen (10%), Acinetobacter baumannii and Haemophilus influenzae (5%). Comparison between 174 GPC- and 86 GNB-colonized infants showed that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. Fifteen percent of GNB-colonized infants developed BSI caused by GNB and 14% developed BSI caused by GPC. No significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and BSI was noted. GNB infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with GPC. GNB colonization was a predictor of severe BPD after controlling for ventilation. Ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of GNB-colonized and 33% of noncolonized infants and was not a predictor of BPD severity. CONCLUSION: GNB airway colonization creates a moderate risk for BSI. Antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate GNB. GNB airway colonization is associated with severe BPD, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate GNB from the airways should be undertaken.
TI  - Emergence of bacterial resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin in a university hospital.
AB  - We have continuously monitored the in-vitro activities of imipenem and ciprofloxacin against large numbers of non-fastidious clinical isolates. After eight years of use, 97-100% of Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter baumannii remained susceptible to imipenem, but susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa declined from 100% to 91%. After six years of use, 94%-100% of Enterobacteriaceae (except Providencia stuartii) remained susceptible to ciprofloxacin but susceptibility of P. stuartii, A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa declined from 100% to 46%, 66% and 84%, respectively. Oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were considered to be resistant to imipenem and all beta-lactams. There were no quinolone-resistant staphylococci observed in 1986, but susceptibilities of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus to ciprofloxacin decreased to 85-93% for oxacillin-susceptible strains and to 7-39% for oxacillin-resistant strains. Enterococcus faecalis has remained susceptible to imipenem and the modal MIC of ciprofloxacin has remained 1 mg/L; however, susceptibility to ciprofloxacin 2 mg/L decreased from 94% to 64%. Imipenem-quinolone cross-resistance was observed for staphylococci but not for P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Synergistic interaction between ofloxacin and cefotaxime against common clinical  pathogens.
AB  - Antimicrobial synergy resulting from combined antibiotic therapy is often important in the treatment of serious bacterial infections. To investigate the interactions between cefotaxime (CTX), desacetylcefotaxime (DES), and ofloxacin (OFL), 247 recent clinical isolates were tested for in vitro susceptibility to each antibiotic alone by an agar dilution technique and retested with the various antibiotic combinations using a checkerboard protocol. Fractional inhibitory concentrations were calculated for all organisms with all drug combinations. Time kill kinetic studies were performed on selected isolates to examine the bactericidal activity of the various antimicrobial combinations. Of the 110 gram-negative organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy between CTX, DES and OFL was demonstrable for 89 (81%). Included in the study were 70 members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, 20 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10 strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, and 10 isolates of Xanthomonas maltophilia. Additive activity was observed against an additional 13 (11%) isolates. Findings were similar for the 89 gram-positive isolates examined. Organisms tested included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (9), methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis (10), Enterococcus faecalis (10), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (20). Synergy or partial synergy was observed against 81 (91%). Less synergistic activity was detected, however, with members of the Bacteroides fragilis group. Of the 48 organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy was noted for only 27 (57%). Isolates representative of each major group of organisms included in the study were tested to determine whether synergistic bactericidal activity was also demonstrable with the three drugs. Time kill studies supported the checkerboard results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates obtained in 1989 and 1990.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. The bacteria studied were Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), Escherichia coli, Salmonella species, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Bacteroides fragilis. In contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii. The minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (MIC90s) were < 1 microgram/mL against most tested species. Ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. All fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, with MIC90s < or = 1 microgram/mL. For methicillin-resistant strains, on the other hand, the MIC90s were > or = 4 micrograms/mL. There was no significant difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. Most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against B. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. The MIC90s of most quinolones assayed against K. pneumoniae, Citrobacter spp., E. cloacae, S. aureus and S. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. Therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.
TI  - Opportunistic nosocomial multiply resistant bacterial infections--their treatment and prevention.
AB  - One of the most difficult problems confronting the clinician who deals with nosocomial infections is that of microbial resistance. The predominant nosocomial infections (urinary tract infections, pneumonia, septicaemia, surgical wound infections) involve increasing numbers of Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium jeikeium or resistant enterococci as well as new multiresistant Gram-negative bacilli such as Xanthomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter baumannii and Alcaligenes xylosoxydans. The emergence and spread of Klebsiella pneumoniae and other Enterobacteriaceae producing novel plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases active against third-generation cephalosporins contribute to the difficulty in treating nosocomial infections.
