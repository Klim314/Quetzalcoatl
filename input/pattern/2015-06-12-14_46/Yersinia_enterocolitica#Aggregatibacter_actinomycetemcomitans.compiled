TI  - Modulation of connexin signaling by bacterial pathogens and their toxins.
AB  - Inherent to their pivotal tasks in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, gap junctions, connexin hemichannels, and pannexin hemichannels are frequently involved in the dysregulation of this critical balance. The present paper specifically focuses on their roles in bacterial infection and disease. In particular, the reported biological outcome of clinically important bacteria including Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Yersinia enterocolitica, Helicobacter pylori, Bordetella pertussis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter rodentium, Clostridium species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus and their toxic products on connexin- and pannexin-related signaling in host cells is reviewed. Particular attention is paid to the underlying molecular mechanisms of these effects as well as to the actual biological relevance of these findings.
TI  - Transcriptional activation of the tad type IVb pilus operon by PypB in Yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  - Type IV pili are virulence factors in various bacteria and mediate, among other functions, the colonization of diverse surfaces. Various subclasses of type IV pili have been identified, but information on pilus expression, biogenesis, and the associated phenotypes is sparse for the genus Yersinia. We recently described the identification of PypB as a transcriptional regulator in Yersinia enterocolitica. Here we show that the pypB gene is associated with the tad locus, a genomic island that is widespread among bacterial and archaeal species. The genetic linkage of pypB with the tad locus is conserved throughout the yersiniae but is not found among other bacteria carrying the tad locus. We show that the genes of the tad locus form an operon in Y. enterocolitica that is controlled by PypB and that pypB is part of this operon. The tad genes encode functions necessary for the biogenesis of the Flp subfamily of type IVb pili initially described for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans to mediate a tight-adherence phenotype. In Y. enterocolitica, the Flp pilin protein shows some peculiarities in its amino acid sequence that imply similarities as well as differences compared to typical motifs found in the Flp subtype of type IVb pili. Flp is expressed and processed after PypB overproduction, resulting in microcolony formation but not in increased adherence to biotic or abiotic surfaces. Our data describe the transcriptional regulation of the tad type IVb pilus operon by PypB in Y. enterocolitica but fail to show most previously described phenotypes associated with this type of pilus in other bacteria.
TI  - EmaA, a potential virulence determinant of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  in infective endocarditis.
AB  - The gram-negative fastidious human oropharyngeal Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is implicated in the etiology of infective endocarditis. EmaA, an oligomeric coiled-coil adhesin homologous to YadA of Yersinia enterocolitica, was hypothesized to mediate the interaction of A. actinomycetemcomitans with collagen. Collagen, the most abundant protein in human bodies and the main component of extracellular matrix (ECM), predominates in the supporting tissue of cardiac valves. To extend our earlier studies using purified collagen to determine bacterial binding activities, we developed a tissue model using rabbit cardiac valves to investigate the interaction of A. actinomycetemcomitans with native collagen. The resected mitral valves, with or without removal of the endothelium, were incubated with equivalent numbers of the wild type and the isogenic emaA mutant defective in collagen binding. There was no difference in binding between the wild-type and the mutant strains when the endothelium remained intact. However, the emaA mutant was fivefold less effective than the wild-type strain in colonizing the exposed ECM. A 10-fold increase in the binding of the wild-type strain to ECM was observed compared with the intact endothelium. Similar observations were replicated in an in vivo endocarditis rabbit model; the emaA mutant was 10-fold less effective in the initial infection of the traumatized aortic valve. Colocalization studies indicated that A. actinomycetemcomitans bound to type I collagen. A. actinomycetemcomitans preferentially colonized the ECM and, together with the evidence that EmaA interacts with the native collagen, suggested that the adhesin is likely a potential virulence determinant of the bacterium in the initiation of infective endocarditis.
TI  - Novel surface structures are associated with the adhesion of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans to collagen.
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is a gram-negative, facultative, anaerobic bacterium that colonizes the human oral cavity and the upper respiratory tract. This bacterium is strongly associated with localized aggressive periodontitis and adult periodontitis and is the causative agent for other serious systemic infections. Recently, we have identified a protein, EmaA (extracellular matrix protein adhesin A), that mediates the adhesion of A. actinomycetemcomitans to collagen. The conserved sequence and predicted secondary structure suggest that EmaA is an orthologue of the Yersinia enterocolitica adhesin YadA. Electron microscopy examinations of A. actinomycetemcomitans have identified antenna-like protrusions associated with the surface of the bacterium. These structures are absent on emaA mutant strains and can be restored by transformation of the mutant strain with emaA in trans. The loss of these structures is associated with a decrease in the binding of this bacterium to collagen. The antenna-like structures are composed of a long rod that terminates in an ellipsoidal head region. The analysis of these structures using image processing techniques has provided an initial estimate of the overall dimensions, which suggests that the appendages are oligomeric structures formed by either three or four subunits. Together, the data suggest that emaA is required for the expression of novel appendages on the surface of A. actinomycetemcomitans that mediate the adhesion of the bacterium to collagen.
TI  - Identification of an extracellular matrix protein adhesin, EmaA, which mediates the adhesion of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans to collagen.
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is an aetiologic agent in the development of periodontal and some systemic diseases in humans. This pathogen localizes to the underlying connective tissue of the oral cavity in individuals with periodontal disease. The adhesion of A. actinomycetemcomitans to extracellular matrix components of the connective tissue prompted this study to identify gene products mediating the interaction of A. actinomycetemcomitans to these molecules. A transposon mutagenesis system was optimized for use in A. actinomycetemcomitans and used to generate an insertional mutant library. A total of 2300 individual insertion transposon mutants were screened for changes in the adhesion to collagen and fibronectin. Mutants were identified which exhibited the following phenotypes: a decrease in collagen binding; a decrease in fibronectin binding; a decrease in binding to both proteins; and an increase in binding to both collagen and fibronectin. The identification of mutants defective in adhesion to the individual proteins indicates that distinct adhesins are expressed by this organism. Molecular analysis of these mutants implicated 11 independent loci in protein adhesion. One gene, emaA, is likely to encode a direct mediator of collagen adhesion, based on predicted protein features homologous to the collagen-binding protein YadA of Yersinia enterocolitica. EmaA was localized to the outer membrane, as expected for an adhesin. Reduction in fibronectin adhesion appeared to be influenced by abrogation of proteins involved in molybdenum-cofactor biosynthesis. Several other loci identified as reducing or increasing adhesion to both collagen and fibronectin are suggested to be involved in regulatory cascades that promote or repress expression of collagen and fibronectin adhesins. Collectively, the results support the hypothesis that A. actinomycetemcomitans host colonization involves afimbrial adhesins for extracellular matrix proteins, and that the expression of adhesion is modulated by global regulatory mechanisms.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of part of the S10 operon from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans FDC Y4.
AB  - We have cloned and sequenced the 5.2 kb EcoRI fragment that contained part of the S10 operon from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans FDC Y4. The order of the ribosomal protein genes was identical to that of the S10 operon of Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequences of ribosomal proteins in this operon displayed significant homologies (65.3%-100%) to those of H. influenzae, E. coli, Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. Phylogenetic trees obtained for these ribosomal proteins were similar to that obtained for 16S rRNA.
