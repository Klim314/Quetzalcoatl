TI  == modulation of small intestinal homeostasis along with its microflora during acclimatization at simulated hypobaric hypoxia.
AB  == at high altitude (ha) hypobaric hypoxic environment manifested several pathophysiological consequences of which gastrointestinal (gi) disorder are very  common phenomena. to explore the most possible clue behind this disorder intestinal flora, the major player of the gi functions, were subjected following  simulated hypobaric hypoxic treatment in model animal. for this, male albino rats were exposed to 55 kpa (approximately 4872.9 m) air pressure consecutively for 30 days for 8 h/day and its small intestinal microflora, their secreted digestive enzymes and stress induced marker protein were investigated of the luminal epithelia. it was observed that population density of total aerobes significantly decreased, but the quantity of total anaerobes and escherichia coli increased significantly after 30 days of hypoxic stress. the population density of strict anaerobes like bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides sp. and lactobacillus sp. and obligate anaerobes like clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus sp. were expanded along with their positive growth direction index (gdi). in relation to the huge multiplication of anaerobes the amount of gas formation as well as content of iga and igg increased in duration dependent manner. the activity of some luminal enzymes from microbial origin like a-amylase, gluco-amylase, proteinase, alkaline phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase were also elevated in hypoxic condition. besides, hypoxia induced in formation of malondialdehyde along with significant attenuation of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase activity and lowered gsh/gssg pool in the intestinal epithelia. histological study revealed disruption of intestinal epithelial barrier with higher infiltration of lymphocytes in lamina propia and atrophic structure. it can be concluded that hypoxia at ha modified gi microbial imprint and subsequently causes epithelial barrier dysfunction which may relate to the small  intestinal dysfunction at ha.

TI  == antibacterial epipolythiodioxopiperazine and unprecedented sesquiterpene from pseudallescheria boydii, a beetle (coleoptera)-associated fungus.
AB  == pseudallescheria boydii residing in the gut of coleopteran (holotrichia parallela) larva produces four new epipolythiodioxopiperazine (etp) boydines a-d  (3-6) and two novel sesquiterpene boydenes a (7) and b (10), in addition to bisdethiobis(methylthio)-deacetylaranotin (1), bisdethiodi(methylthio)-deacetylapoaranotin (2), am6898 a (8) and ovalicin (9). the structure elucidation was accomplished by a combination of spectral methods with quantum chemical calculations of optical rotations and electronic circular dichroism (ecd) spectra. boydine b (4) was shown to be active against the clinical strains bifidobacterium sp., veillonella parvula, anaerostreptococcus sp., bacteroides vulgatus and peptostreptococcus sp. with an mic range of 0.2-0.8 mum, and the pharmacophore 3-hydroxy-2,4,6-trimethyl-5-oxooct-6-enoyl chain of 4  was shown to have (2r,3s,4s)-configurations. boydene a (7) possessed an unprecedented carbon skeleton, suggesting an unusual biochemistry that allows an  intramolecular aldol addition in the fungus. collectively, the finding may inspire the discovery of new antibacterial agents and the understanding on biosyntheses of polythiodioxopiperazine and sesquiterpene metabolites.

TI  == [repression of bacterial biofilms in suppurative necrotic complications of diabetic foot syndrome by ultrasound cavitation].
AB  == aim: study of wound microbial landscape in suppurative necrotic complications in  patients with diabetic foot syndrome (dfs), and a possibility of suppression of bacterial biofilm development in these wounds by ultrasound cavitation (usc). materials and methods: 2 randomized groups of patients were included in the study: main group of 145 individuals with suppurative necrotic complications of dfs, who received ultrasound cavitation therapy, and comparison group of 86 patients who received basic therapy. in the main group sonoca-180 (siring, germany) unit, that allows to combine the process of mechanical wound treatment with antibacterial action of low frequency ultrasound, was used for wound treatment. quantitative and qualitative composition of wound microflora was studied by using bacteriological method with parallel utilization of transmission and scanning electron microscopy in the dynamic of usc treatment. results: in patients with dfs bacterial biofilms containing congestions in the polysaccharide matrix and fixed at the surface of dense structure of periostenum wound were detected. in the microbial landscape in dfs patients in 21% of cases aerobic-anaerobic microflora was detected, while associations included mostly from 2 to 5 bacteria species--members of the peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, prevotella, bacteroides genera. bacteria of staphylococcus, acinetobacter, pseudomonas, escherichia and klebsiella sp. genera were detected less frequently. application of usc in the main group resulted in a decrease of microbial contamination of wounds in the short-term. conclusion: usc method, when compared  with classical therapy approach in dfs complications, in patients with suppurative necrotic complications allows not only to remove mechanically the necrotic tissues but also to effectively suppress the bacterial biofilms that have formed in the wounds, this promotes the acceleration of recovery process and preparation of the patients for further plastic surgery intervention.

TI  == [bacterial mixed infection in women with chronic recurrent cystitis].
AB  == aim: to study microbial repertoire of urine in healthy women and patients with chronic recurrent cystitis (crc) including facultative anaerobic (fa) and non-clostridial anaerobic (nca) bacteria. materials and methods. triple bacteriological study of urine was performed in three groups of women: group i--22 healthy virgin women aged 18- 25 years, group ii--24 women aged 18 - 25 years with regular sexual contacts, group iii--72 women aged 20 - 60 years with crc, before antibacterial therapy. bacteriological method was used to study qualitative and quantitative composition of urine microflora. results: in all subjects from groups i and ii aerobic-anaerobic associations with predomination of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), corynebacteria, peptococci, and peptostreptococci were isolated from urine. quantity of isolated nca bacteria was significantly higher than that of fa. in etiologic structure of crc, nca bacteria, enterobacteria, and cns predominated. spectrum of nca bacteria isolated from patients with crc was wider and level of bacteriuria--higher (p < 0.05) compared to groups i and ii. bacteria were identified in aerobic-anaerobic associations. in 85.7% of cases following nca were identified in biopsy samples:  propionibacterium sp. (41.8%), peptococcus sp. (35.7%), eubacterium sp. (28.6%),  peptostreptococcus sp. (14.3%), and bacteroides sp. (14.3%). aerobic-anaerobic associations were observed in 7.1% of samples. conclusion: urine of healthy women is not sterile. aerobic-anaerobic mixed infections were detected in patients with crc that should take into account during diagnostics and treatment of this disease.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  == six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from viguiera arenaria baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying mic values ranging from 1 to 10 mug ml-1. the results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.

TI  == subgingival microbial profiles of smokers with periodontitis.
AB  == the subgingival microbiome is largely uncultivated, and therefore, cultivation-based and targeted molecular approaches have limited value in examining the effect of smoking on this community. we tested the hypothesis that  the subgingival biofilm is compositionally different in current and never-smokers by using an open-ended molecular approach for bacterial identification. subgingival plaque from deep sites of current and never-smokers matched for disease was analyzed by 16s sequencing. smokers demonstrated greater abundance of parvimonas, fusobacterium, campylobacter, bacteroides, and treponema and lower levels of veillonella, neisseria, and streptococcus. several uncultivated peptostreptococci, parvimonas micra, campylobacter gracilis, treponema socranskii, dialister pneumosintes, and tannerella forsythia were elevated in this group, while veillonella sp. oral clone b2, neisseria sp. oral clone 2.24, streptococcus sanguinis, and capnocytophaga sp. clone ah015 were at lower levels. the microbial profile of smoking-associated periodontitis is distinct from that of non-smokers, with significant differences in the prevalence and abundance of disease-associated and health-compatible organisms.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == uncultivated bacteria as etiologic agents of intra-amniotic inflammation leading  to preterm birth.
AB  == intra-amniotic infection and inflammation are major causes of preterm birth (ptb). however, intra-amniotic inflammation is often detected in the absence of infection. this may partly be due to the culturing methods employed in hospital laboratories, which are unable to detect the uncultivated species. in this study, intra-amniotic microbial infections associated with ptb were examined by both culture and 16s rrna-based culture-independent methods and were corroborated by the presence of intra-amniotic inflammation. amniotic fluid (af) specimens from 46 pregnancies complicated by ptb and 16 asymptomatic women were analyzed. no bacterial dna was amplified in af collected from the asymptomatic women. among the 46 samples associated with ptb, bacterial dna was amplified from all (16/16)  of the culture-positive samples and 17% (5/30) of the culture-negative samples. in the culture-positive group, additional species were detected in more than half (9/16) of the cases by pcr and clone analysis. altogether, approximately two- thirds of the species detected by the culture-independent methods were not isolated by culture. they included both uncultivated and difficult-to-cultivate species, such as fusobacterium nucleatum, leptotrichia (sneathia) spp., a bergeyella sp., a peptostreptococcus sp., bacteroides spp., and a species of the  order clostridiales. to examine intra-amniotic inflammation, an af proteomic fingerprint (mass-restricted score) was determined by surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. inflammation was detected in all five samples which were culture negative but pcr positive. women who were  pcr positive more often had elevated interleukin-6 levels in their af, histological chorioamnionitis, and funisitis and delivered neonates with early-onset neonatal sepsis. previously unrecognized, uncultivated, or difficult-to-cultivate species may play a key role in the initiation of ptb.

TI  == correlates of periodontal decline and biologic markers in older adults.
AB  == background: there is limited information on infectious and host responses distinguishing older people with or without active periodontitis. this study measured bacterial and serum cytokine and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hscrp) levels in older persons. methods: elders (mean age: 67 years), whose periodontal status had declined most or least (20% worst or 20% best) over 5 years, were enrolled. two years later, they were classified as periodontally declining (active periodontitis [ap]), if they had at least five teeth with probing depth (pd) > or =5 mm, or stable (stable periodontally [sp]), if they did not. groups were compared with respect to demographics, pd, clinical loss of attachment, subgingival bacteria, serum hscrp, interleukin (il)-1beta and -6, and chronic diseases. results: ten ap and 24 sp subjects were identified; 13% of women and 44% of men from the original sample were in the ap group (p <0.05). most asians were sp; most whites and all african americans were classified as having ap (p <0.01). more ap elders had osteoporosis (p <0.01), but the ap and sp groups did not differ with respect to il-1beta and -6 or hscrp. bacterial counts  were higher in the ap group for parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros) (7.7 x 10(5) cells versus 3.8 x 10(5) cells; p <0.05), prevotella intermedia (25.7 x 10(5) cells versus 9.8 x 10(5) cells; p <0.01), tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (16.2 x 10(5) cells versus 8.0 x 10(5) cells; p <0.05), and streptococcus mutans (6.2 x 10(5) cells versus 2.0 x 10(5) cells; p <0.01). three risk factors were most predictive of periodontal decline: pd, osteoporosis, and being white or african american. conclusion: periodontal decline was associated with osteoporosis, ethnicity, pd,  gender, serum hscrp, and levels of four bacterial species.

TI  == influence of local tetracycline on the microbiota of alveolar osteitis in rats.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of local tetracycline on the occurrence of alveolar osteitis in rats, and on the microbiota associated to  this infection. forty wistar rats were randomly assigned to 4 groups (n=10): i -  the rats had the maxillary right incisor extracted and the alveolar wound did not receive any treatment; ii - adrenaline and ringer-pras were introduced into the alveolar wound; iii - the alveolar wound was irrigated with sterile saline; and iv - the alveolar wound was irrigated with an aqueous solution of tetracycline. microbial samples from the alveolar wounds were collected 2 days after surgery and inoculated on blood agar (with and without 8 microg/ml of tetracycline) and other selective media, and were incubated in either aerobiosis or anaerobiosis at 37 degrees c, for 2 to 14 days. it was verified that tetracycline reduced the occurrence of alveolar osteitis in the rats and caused significant changes in the microbiota of the surgical sites, decreasing the number of anaerobes and increasing the participation of tetracycline-resistant and multi-resistant microorganisms.

TI  == bacterial examination of endodontic infections by clonal analysis in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to examine the diversity of bacterial  species in the infected root canals of teeth associated with endodontic abscesses by cloning and sequencing techniques in concert with denaturing high-performance  liquid chromatography. methods: samples collected from five infected root canals  were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with universal 16s ribosomal dna primers. products of these pcrs were cloned and sequenced. denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) was used as a screening method to  reduce the number of clones necessary for dna sequencing. results: all samples were positive for the presence of bacteria and a range of 7-13 different bacteria were found per root canal sample. in total, 48 different oral clones were detected among the five root canal samples. olsenella profusa was the only species present in all samples. porphyromonas gingivalis, dialister pneumosintes, dialister invisus, lachnospiraceae oral clone, staphylococcus aureus, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, peptostreptococcus micros and enterococcus faecalis were found in two of the five samples. the majority of the taxa were present in only one sample, for example tannerella forsythia, shuttleworthia satelles and filifactor alocis. some facultative anaerobes that are frequently isolated from endodontic infections such as e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus  and lactobacillus spp. were also found in this study. conclusion: clonal analysis of the microflora associated with endodontic infections revealed a wide diversity of oral species.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of clinically relevant anaerobes in estonia from 1999 to 2001.
AB  == at present little or no data is available regarding the resistance profiles of anaerobic bacteria in relation to the general usage of antibiotics. the objective of this study was to assess whether any potential relationship exists between the dynamics of antibiotic resistance of anaerobic bacteria and the consumption of antibiotics during the last 3 years within the estonian population. in total, 416 anaerobic isolates were investigated from various clinical samples. the anaerobes were isolated on wilkins-chalgren agar, incubated in an anaerobic glove box and identified by standard methods. beta-lactamase negative strains were tested against metronidazole, clindamycin, benzylpenicillin and the positive strains were further tested against metronidazole, clindamycin, and ampicillin/sulbactam  by e-tests. the results of the susceptibility tests were interpreted according to the current criteria of nccls. data from the estonian state agency of medicines was used to assess the antibiotic consumption rate in the population (defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants annually). the following species of anaerobes were isolated: b. fragilis group, bacteroides sp., fusobacterium sp., porphyromonas sp., prevotella sp., peptostreptococcus sp., in addition to various unidentified gram-positive rods. metronidazole resistance was not found among gram-negative bacteria despite a relatively high consumption of this antimicrobial agent in estonia. only ampicillin/sulbactam demonstrated excellent  in vitro activity against all anaerobes. unexpectedly despite a relatively low rate of consumption of clindamycin a high rate of resistance to this agent occurred; a similar situation was noted for penicillin. in the present study we did not observe a relationship between the changes in antibiotic consumption (ddd/1000) rate and the resistance pattern of anaerobic bacteria to metronidazole, clindamycin, penicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam during a 3-year follow-up period. high resistance to penicillin among some species and also to clindamycin is similar to the global trend and argues for limited use of these antibiotics in empirical treatment. we would suggest that monitoring of local susceptibility pattern is necessary for the selection of initial empirical therapy.

TI  == occurrence and activity of human intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of dietary lignans.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota is necessary for the production of enterolignans  from the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (sdg). however, little is known about the bacteria that contribute to sdg conversion. therefore, we aimed at describing the occurrence and activity of sdg metabolising bacteria. the data showed differences in conversion efficiency between sdg deglycosylating species, but sdg was completely deglycosylated within 20 h by five of six strains. the strain clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db showed the highest initial rate  of sdg deglycosylation. furthermore, we found that bacteroides distasonis and b.  fragilis made up 0.5% and 3.3% of total faecal bacteria, respectively. however, clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db was detected within the dominant microbiota of only  two out of 20 faecal samples. bacteria involved in the demethylation step of sdg  conversion also demethylated a variety of compounds other than sdg. in particular, peptostreptococcus productus demethylated the lignans pinoresinol, lariciresinol and matairesinol. finally, eggerthella lenta catalysed the reduction of pinoresinol and lariciresinol to secoisolariciresinol.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacteria in asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to use terminal restriction fragment length  polymorphism analysis and the 16s rrna gene clone library to investigate the diversity of the microbiota associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections and to compare the bacterial community structure in these two clinical conditions. samples were taken from asymptomatic endodontic infections associated with chronic periradicular lesions and from symptomatic infections clinically diagnosed as acute abscesses. 16s rrna genes from dna isolated from clinical samples were used to construct clone libraries or were subjected to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. sequence analysis of 186 clones revealed 42 taxa; 23 (55%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which seven were unique to endodontic infections. clone sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that the most commonly detected taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum (including terminal restriction fragment types 1 and 2), peptostreptococcus micros/peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone aj062/bs044/fg014, prevotella species, dialister species, mogibacterium species, lachnospiraceae oral clone 55a-34, filifactor alocis, megasphaera sp. oral clone cs025/bs073, and veillonella sp. oral clone bp1-85/veillonella dispar/v. parvula. bacteroides-like sp. oral clone x083/bacteroidales oral clone mce7_20 and dialister sp. oral clone bs016/mce7_134 were detected only in asymptomatic teeth. on the other hand, f. nucleatum terminal restriction fragment type 2, prevotella intermedia, dialister pneumosintes, and some phylotypes were exclusively detected in symptomatic samples. bacterial profiles of symptomatic endodontic infections generated by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis were clearly different from those of asymptomatic infections. overall, the average number of terminal restriction fragments in symptomatic samples was significantly larger than in asymptomatic samples. molecular analysis of the microbiota associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic endodontic infections indicates that the endodontic bacterial diversity is greater than previously described by culture methods and that the structure of the microbiota differ significantly between asymptomatic and symptomatic infections.

TI  == phylogeny of human intestinal bacteria that activate the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota is essential for the conversion of the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (sdg) via secoisolariciresinol (seco) to  the enterolignans enterodiol (ed) and enterolactone (el). however, knowledge of the species that catalyse the underlying reactions is scant. therefore, we focused our attention on the identification of intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of sdg. strains of bacteroides distasonis, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides ovatus and clostridium cocleatum, as well as the newly isolated strain clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db, deglycosylated sdg. demethylation of seco was catalysed by strains of butyribacterium methylotrophicum, eubacterium callanderi, eubacterium limosum and peptostreptococcus productus. dehydroxylation of seco was catalysed by strains of clostridium scindens and eggerthella lenta. finally, the newly isolated strain ed-mt61/pyg-s6 catalysed the dehydrogenation of ed to el. the results indicate that the activation of sdg involves phylogenetically diverse bacteria, most of which are members of the dominant human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == trypanosoma cruzi: influence of predominant bacteria from indigenous digestive microbiota on experimental infection in mice.
AB  == to verify the influence of some predominant components from indigenous microbiota on systemic immunological responses during experimental chagas disease, germ-free nih swiss mice were mono-associated with escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides vulgatus or peptostreptococcus sp. and then infected with the y strain of trypanosoma cruzi. all the mono-associations predominantly induced a th1 type of specific immune response to the infection by t. cruzi. a direct correlation was observed between a higher survival rate and increased ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha production (p<0.05) in e. faecalis-, b. vulgatus-, and peptostreptococcus-associated mice. moreover, higher levels of anti-t. cruzi igg1 and anti-t. cruzi igg2a were also found in mono-associated animals after infection. on the other hand, with the exception of e. faecalis-associated mice,  mono-association induced a lower il-10 production after infection (p<0.05) when compared with germ-free animals. interestingly, spleen cell cultures from non-infected germ-free and mono-associated mice spontaneously produced higher levels (p<0.05) of il-10 than cultures from infected mono-associated mice, except again for e. faecalis-associated animals. in conclusion, the presence of the components of the indigenous microbiota skews the immune response towards production of inflammatory cytokines during experimental infection with t. cruzi  in gnotobiotic mice. however, the degree of increase in production of cytokines depends on each bacterial component.

TI  == distribution of periodontal pathogens in korean aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: microbial associations in aggressive periodontitis versus different ethnic origins are substantially unknown. we undertook this study to determine the prevalence of seven putative periodontopathogens in korean patients and to evaluate microbial differences in localized and generalized aggressive periodontitis patients. methods: thirty-nine aggressive periodontitis patients between 20 and 35 years old (24 males and 15 females; mean age 29.6 years) were selected according to clinical criteria. the patients were subclassified into 17  localized and 22 generalized aggressive periodontitis patients. in each of the 39 individuals, subgingival plaque samples were collected from four diseased teeth (> or = 6 mm probing depth, 156 sites) and one healthy site (< or = 3 mm probing  depth, 39 sites). polymerase chain reaction (pcr) of the 16s ribosomal rna gene fragments (about 530 bp) of plaque bacteria and their subsequent detection by dot-blot hybridization using specific oligonucleotide probes were performed to determine the presence of seven periodontopathogens. results: the prevalences were 75% for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 94.2% for tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus), 99.4% for fusobacterium sp., 85.9% for micromonas micros (formerly peptostreptococcus micros), 96.8% for porphyromonas gingivalis, 78.8% for prevotella intermedia, and 96.8% for treponema sp. the prevalences of these bacteria were significantly higher in diseased sites than in healthy sites. logistic regression analysis showed that p. intermedia was more significantly associated with generalized aggressive periodontitis than the localized form, with an odds ratio of 3.28 (95% confidence interval 1.26-8.56, p = 0.015). conclusions: our results demonstrate that the seven periodontal pathogens analyzed are strongly associated with korean aggressive periodontitis. in particular, p. intermedia are more significantly associated with generalized aggressive periodontitis, a more severe and progressive form, than with localized aggressive periodontitis.

TI  == clinical review: bacteremia caused by anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  == this review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of bacteremia caused by anaerobic bacteria in children. bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus sp., clostridium sp., and fusobacterium sp. were the most common clinically significant anaerobic isolates. the strains of anaerobic organisms found depended, to a large extent, on the portal of entry and the underlying disease. predisposing conditions include: malignant neoplasms, immunodeficiencies, chronic renal insufficiency, decubitus ulcers, perforation of viscus and appendicitis, and neonatal age. organisms identical to those causing anaerobic bacteremia can often be recovered from other infected sites that may have served as a source of persistent bacteremia. when anaerobes resistant to penicillin are suspected or isolated, antimicrobial drugs such as clindamycin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, cefoxitin, a carbapenem, or the combination of a  beta-lactamase inhibitor and a penicillin should be administered. the early recognition of anaerobic bacteremia and administration of appropriate antimicrobial and surgical therapy play a significant role in preventing mortality and morbidity in pediatric patients.

TI  == detection of major putative periodontopathogens in korean advanced adult periodontitis patients using a nucleic acid-based approach.
AB  == background: although extensive microbial analyses have been performed from subgingival plaque samples of periodontitis patients, systematic analysis of subgingival microbiota has not been carried out in a korean population so far. the purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of major putative periodontopathogens in korean patients by culture-independent methods. methods: a total of 244 subgingival plaque samples (5 sites in each participant) were taken  from 29 advanced adult periodontitis (ap) patients and 20 periodontally healthy subjects. ap samples were obtained from the 4 deepest periodontal pockets (> or =6 mm probing depth [pd]) and 1 healthy site (< or =3 mm pd) in each patient. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) of 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) of subgingival plaque bacteria was performed with eubacterial primers. aliquots of pcr products were then applied on nylon membranes and hybridized with specific oligonucleotide probes labeled with digoxigenin. results: all diseased sites harbored fusobacterium sp., while porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema sp., and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 96% of 116 diseased sites. peptostreptococcus micros, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia were present in 82%, 74%, and 71% of diseased sites, respectively. in  sites of periodontally healthy subjects, fusobacterium sp. was present in the highest proportion (58%). treponema sp., p. gingivalis, and b. forsythus were detected in 22%, 18%, and 18% of healthy sites, respectively. p. micros, p. intermedia, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were found in 8%, 2%, and 1% of healthy  sites, respectively. the prevalence of the periodontopathogens, with the exceptions of fusobacterium sp. and b. forsythus, was significantly higher in the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects (p <0.05). conclusions: using highly sensitive methods relying on 16s ribosomal rna-based oligonucleotide probes, we confirmed the strong association of 7 putative periodontopathogens with ap patients in a korean population. with the exceptions of fusobacterium sp. and b. forsythus, all the periodontopathogens were significantly more associated with the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects.

TI  == the microbial spectrum of brain abscess with special reference to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the bacteriological and clinical findings of 18 cases of brain abscess are presented. identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic strains was performed both by conventional methods and the newer rapid ana ii panel and e-test methods, respectively. characterization of the anaerobic isolates was done by restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp). anaerobic or aerobic organisms alone were recovered in three (16.6%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic  in another three (16.6%) patients. there were nine anaerobic isolates. the predominant anaerobes were prevotella melaninogenicus (four isolates), bacteroides preacutus (three isolates), fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus sp. (one isolate each). a total of six aerobic isolates, all of which were gram-positive cocci were recovered. all the anaerobic isolates were susceptible to metronidazole, but two isolates of p. melaninogenicus were resistant to penicillin. there was complete agreement between the identification  based on biochemical profiles and rflp patterns. these findings indicate the microbial complexity of brain abscess and the need to target antimicrobial therapy against both the aerobic and anaerobic components of infection.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == [trovafloxacin in gynecology].
AB  == presence of microorganisms in the female lower genital tract (lgt) in concentrations that modify the established normal equilibrium produce different symptoms that make necessary to consult the gynecologist. it is currently accepted that infections of the lgt are due to microorganisms that are normally integrating the internal flora, except for the erroneously called "sexually transmitted diseases" that are caused by external microorganisms. this means that all those microorganisms usually present without causing any disease manifestations may, under certain circumstances and determined concentrations, originate or be associated to infections. lactobacillus sp. and corynebacterium sp. are normally the most frequent microorganisms in the vagina together with streptococcus (aerobe), streptococcus agalactiae and others like enterococcus, peptostreptococcus, bacteroides sp., bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, pseudomonas, klebsiella, fusobacterium, escherichia coli. different antibiotic schemes are proposed for different infections (bacterial vaginosis, gonococcia, chlamydial infections, pelvic inflammatory disease). they  are discussed in different sections. trovafloxacin has shown to be effective in the treatment of infections due to chlamydia with excellent clinical results and  a good tolerance. it was effective as single dose therapy in the treatment of acute gonococcia with therapeutic success in 99% of the treated patients. new fluoroquinolones are also effective in the treatment of infections due to aerobial pathogens. the use of trovafloxacin in the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease would present great advantages: on one hand, it would cover  the wide spectrum of microorganisms responsible for the infection and, on the other, would permit an early switch to oral therapy once the acute phase is over.

TI  == sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

AB  == the microbiology of in 55 ear aspirates obtained from 34 children with chronic otorrhea was studied. aspiration of the middle ear exudate was done immediately following removal of tympanostomy tube (tt). the middle ear aspirates and swab specimens of the external auditory canals were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. sixty-five isolates were recovered only from the middle ears, 73 only from the external ear canals, and 73 were present at both sites. analysis of the  138 middle ear isolates demonstrated the recovery of aerobic bacteria only in 28  patients (50%), anaerobes only in seven (13%), and both aerobes and anaerobes in  20 (36%). there were 77 aerobic and 61 anaerobic isolates. commonly recovered aerobes were pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 isolates), staphylococcus aureus (11), proteus sp. (7), moraxella catarrhalis (6), klebsiella pneumoniae (5) and non-typable haemophilus influenzae (5). commonly isolated anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp. (25 isolates), prevotella sp. (10), bacteroides sp. (8) and fusobacterium sp. (6). pseudomonas aeruginosa and s. aureus were more often isolated in children older then 6 years. these findings demonstrate the polymicrobial bacteriology of tt-related otorrhea in children. specimens collected from the external auditory canals can be misleading. reliable information can be obtained from the ear exudes when collected through the tt or  through the open perforation after their removal.

TI  == [an evaluation of pathogens in patients with bronchopulmonary infection by transtracheal aspiration: december 1978-march 1993].
AB  == we performed transtracheal aspiration (tta) in 1165 patients, who were suspected  to have bronchopulmonary infection, from december 1978 to march 1993. we isolated pathogens from tta in 806 patients (69.2%). we isolated h. influenzae (62 cases), s. pneumoniae (39 cases) and m. catarrhalis (24 cases) in patients with acute bronchitis, s. pneumoniae (65 cases), alpha-streptococcus sp. (52 cases), h. influenzae (32 cases) and s. aureus (29 cases) in patients with pneumonia or lung abscess and h. influenzae (174 cases), s. pneumoniae (84 cases), p. aeruginosa (81 cases) and m. catarrhalis (42 cases) in patients with chronic lower respiratory tract infection. anaerobic bacteria isolated from tta included peptostreptococcus sp. (19 cases), bacteroides sp. (19 cases) and others. mycoplasma pneumoniae was isolated from tta in 8 patients with pneumonia without  other organisms. virus isolated from tta included rhinovirus (6 cases) and others. these results suggest that various pathogens affect the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary infection. therefore, we must diagnose the bronchopulmonary infection by the correct methods such as tta.

TI  == study of gene transfer in vitro and in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice from lactococcus lactis strains to various strains belonging to human intestinal  flora.
AB  == the use of genetically modified organisms (gmo) in dairy products requires evaluation of the dna transfer capacity from such organisms among the human intestinal microflora. thus, both in vitro and in vivo [in the digestive tract (dt) of mice] transfer from lactococcus lactis donor strains of the conjugative plasmid pil205 (cmr) and the non-conjugative plasmid pil253 (emr) to: (1) recipient strains isolated from human faecal flora bacteroides sp., bifidobacterium sp., peptostreptococcus sp. (strictly anaerobic bacterial strains) and enterococcus faecalis, (2) a whole human faecal flora, was studied.  in both cases, no gene transfer was observed to strictly anaerobic bacterial strains. dna transfer was only observed to the e. faecalis strain: in vivo cmr e. faecalis transconjugants were isolated from sequentially multi-associated mice and when the recipient strains associated with the mice, they were a defined mixture of bacteroides sp., bifidobacterium sp., peptostreptococcus sp. and e. faecalis strains. when mice were associated with the whole human faecal flora, the plasmid pil205 was transferred into some facultative anaerobic streptococci.  it was also shown that dna transfer occurred even when the lactococcal donor strain was transient in the dt of the gnotobiotic host animals.

TI  == peptostreptococcal infection in children.
AB  == 680 peptostreptococcus sp. (ps) were recovered from 598 (34%) of 1,750 specimens  obtained from 554 patients. they included 103 ps asaccharolyticus, 74 ps magnus,  56 ps prevotii, 51 ps micros, 46 ps anaerobius, 11 ps morbilorum, and 10 ps saccharolyticus. most infections were polymicrobial (in 553 instances or 92%) but in 45 (8%), ps were recovered in pure culture. most ps were isolated from abscesses (237), ears (104), peritoneal fluid (95), lung infections (66), bone (30) and sinuses (24). predisposing conditions were present in 224 (40%) children. these were previous surgery (54), immunodeficiency (43), malignancy (35), trauma (34), diabetes (23), prematurity (22), steroid therapy (19), foreign body (10) and sickle-cell anemia (7). the organisms most commonly isolated with ps were bacteroides sp. (276, including 190 b. fragilis group), prevotella sp. (159), fusobacterium sp. (122), escherichia coli (114), and staphylococcus aureus (97). antimicrobial therapy was administered to all but 14 patients. surgical drainage or correction of pathology was performed in 307 (56%) patients. 10 patients (2%) died of their infection. these data illustrate the importance of ps and suggests their enhancing potentials in infection in children.

TI  == effect of different combinations of antibiotics on experimental septic peritonitis in rabbits.
AB  == this study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of different combinations of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of experimental septic peritonitis. two hundred rabbits, divided into ten groups of 20 rabbits each, were used. septic peritonitis was provoked in two stages: treatment of animals by mechanical lavage or antibiotics was performed during the first stage; blood cultures, isolation and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the peritoneal cavity were performed during the second stage. the parameters assessed were survival and, in the second phase, the formation of peritoneal abscesses. the most significant finding was noted in the first phase, where diffuse peritonitis took  place, with a very high mortality rate due to bacteremia and sepsis. in both blood and pus from the peritoneal cavity cultures in all groups, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis (among the aerobes) and bacteroides fragilis, clostridium sp. and peptostreptococcus sp. (among anaerobes) were the predominant pathogens identified. high mortality rates appeared to be due to the aerobic microbes, particularly escherichia coli, whereas abscess formation was related to the anaerobes, particularly bacteroides  fragilis. all antibiotics tested were effective, whether alone or in combination. metronidazole, however, was the most effective in the reduction of intraabdominal abscesses. the lowest mortality rate was observed in animals injected with piperacillin and a combination of cefoxitin and an aminoglycoside with metronidazole. finally, good peritoneal lavage seemed to be as effective as any combination of antibiotic treatment.

TI  == sub-gingival microflora in macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey.
AB  == the macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey is one of several non-human primate (nhp) models for periodontal disease. this report presents the bacteriology of the gingival sulci in m. mulatta monkeys. three sub-gingival sites (maxillary right central incisor, the disto-buccal of the mandibular left second molar and mesio-buccal of the mandibular right second molar) of 9 monkeys were evaluated clinically before scaling and 7 days after scaling. plaque samples were obtained  from sub-gingival sites before clinical examination and studied bacteriologically by dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and by primary phenotypic characterizations of culture isolates. several gingival sites presented with mild gingival inflammation. anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic  bacteria were the predominant flora colonizing the gingival sulci. the major microbial groups were haemophilus species (100% of sites; percentage of total anaerobic count (tac): 21-51), peptostreptococcus micros (89%, 7.5-29.5), actinomyces sp. (85%, 7-27), fusobacterium nucleatum (90%, 5-8), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (73%, 1.3-12), black-pigmented anaerobic rods (bpar) (80%,  0.6-6.5) and oral streptococci (80%, 0.2-1.0). microbial groups detected less often were wolinella sp. (66%, 0-2.6), capnocytophaga sp. (30%), eikenella corrodens (4.7%, 0), campylobacter sp. (28%, 0-0.1) and spirochetes (4.7%, 0-0.07). seven days after gingival sites were scaled, the plaque score and indices for gingival inflammation declined significantly. the gingival flora after scaling were characterized by lower proportions of the actinomyces sp., p.  micros and bpar; and increased proportions of the oral streptococci, relative to  pre-scaling levels.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [the role anaerobes in dermatitis digitalis et interdigitalis in cattle].
AB  == altogether 52 tissue samples and swabs from the corium of the claw of diseased cattle were investigated. microbiological examinations revealed the presence of 11 strictly anaerobic bacterial strains that belonged to the species peptococcus  asacharolyticus, pc. sacharolyticus, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides asacharolyticus and b. melaninogenicus. the remaining isolates were classified as bacteroides, fusobacterium, streptococcus and clostridium. in the above-mentioned strains observations of their biochemical, morphological and enzymatic properties (tab. i) were carried out. their resistance to antibiotics was evaluated from the qualitative viewpoint (tab. ii). capillary isotachophoresis was used to determine the amounts of volatile fatty acids that developed during glucose fermentation (tab. iii). in the single clinical samples the above-mentioned strains occurred as association of microorganism. the anaerobic genera bacteroides and fusobacterium were found in 52% of the samples (bacteroides sp. and fusobacterium sp. were recorded in 25% and 12% of the samples, respectively, whereas in 15% of  the samples both species occurred). according to our results the etiology of dermatitis digitalis et interdigitalis is closely connected with the incidence of anaerobes. of the latter, those belonging to the genera bacteroides and fusobacterium are of major importance.

TI  == diagnosis and management of anaerobic infections of the head and neck.
AB  == anaerobic bacteria are important pathogens in head and neck infections such as chronic otitis media, chronic sinusitis, chronic mastoiditis, head and neck abscesses, cervical adenitis, parotitis, and postoperative infection. bacteroides sp (bacteroides melaninogenicus group, bacteroides oralis, and bacteroides fragilis group), peptostreptococcus sp, and fusobacterium sp predominate. the observed recent increase in the number of beta-lactamase-producing strains of bacteroides sp isolated in head and neck infections has been associated with increased failure rates of the penicillins in the management of these infections. the pathogenicity of these organisms is expressed through their ability not only  to survive penicillin therapy but also to shield penicillin-susceptible pathogens from the drug. because of these direct and indirect virulent characteristics of anaerobic bacteria, appropriate antimicrobial therapy must be directed against all pathogens in mixed infections.

TI  == the acute phase of experimental infection with trypanosoma cruzi is more severe in mice monoassociated with strict anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == 1. the influence of some components of the normal human intestinal flora on the acute phase of experimental infection with strain cl of trypanosoma cruzi was studied in 30-day-old germ-free or gnotobiotic cfw (lob) mice monoassociated with bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus sp or clostridium sp by intragastric inoculation of 10(6) bacteria 10 days before the intraperitoneal infection with 5 x 10(3) trypomastigotes/g body weight. 2. significantly earlier parasitemia peak  and mortality were observed in bacteroides fragilis- and clostridium-associated mice (16.75 +/- 0.96 and 15.00 +/- 1.15 days, respectively) when compared with germfree animals (18.83 +/- 1.17 days). more precocious mortality (10.40 +/- 2.06 days) and, curiously, much lower blood parasitemia were observed in peptostreptococcus-associated mice than in other gnotobiotic mice. 3. the extent  of cardiac tissue parasitism decreased in the following order: germfree, b. fragilis-associated, clostridium-associated, and peptostreptococcus-associated animals. the levels of inflammatory reaction decreased in the following order: germfree, peptostreptococcus-associated, clostridium-associated, and b. fragilis-associated mice. 4. these results show that the acute phase of experimental infection with t. cruzi was more severe in mice associated with strict anaerobic bacteria when compared with germfree animals. this suggests that a normal intestinal flora may be another factor, in addition to nutritional and genetic factors, responsible for the different susceptibility of organisms of the same species infected with t. cruzi.

AB  == bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with  bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. we obtained semen samples from 37  men attending a special infertility clinic and assessed the relationship between  seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. one hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. the microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), peptostreptococcus sp (62%), bacteroides sp (27%), gardnerella vaginalis (19%), lactobacillus sp (16%), actinomyces sp (16%), enterococcus (11%), and veillonella (11%). other microorganisms including group b streptococcus, hemophilus, escherichia coli, mobiluncus, and clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. when the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (p greater  than .05 for each comparison). the proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == bacterial vaginosis as a risk factor for post-cesarean endometritis.
AB  == bacterial species associated with bacterial vaginosis have been isolated more frequently from endometrial cultures of patients with postpartum endometritis than expected from the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis among pregnant women. to further assess the association between bacterial vaginosis and postpartum endometritis, vaginal gram smears were obtained from women admitted for delivery. vaginal smears of women delivered by cesarean were scored as normal or as indicating bacterial vaginosis. factors related independently to postpartum endometritis by multiple logistic regression analysis included maternal age less  than 25 years, any duration of membrane rupture, and bacterial vaginosis. the unadjusted odds ratio for the development of postpartum endometritis associated with bacterial vaginosis (odds ratio = 6.1, 95% confidence interval 3.3-15.9) was not appreciably changed in the multivariable analysis (odds ratio = 5.8, 95% confidence interval 3.0-10.9) after adjusting for maternal age, duration of labor, and duration of membrane rupture. at the time of endometritis, bacteroides sp, peptostreptococcus sp, and gardnerella vaginalis were isolated more frequently from the endometrium using a triple lumen endometrial sampling method  among patients with bacterial vaginosis than among those with a normal gram stain. bacterial vaginosis appears to be an important risk factor for postpartum  endometritis after cesarean delivery.

TI  == [significance of the bacterial flora in the etiology of apical periodontitis. qualitative, quantitative and topographical aspects].
AB  == in the international literature it is shown the central role of root canal infection in the etiology of periapical lesions. as a matter of fact it has been  proved (13) that sterile necrotic pulp tissue is completely unable to cause inflammatory reactions at the periapex. infection of endodontic origin extends to the supporting tissues of the tooth only in the case of their acute inflammation  (e.g. acute apical periodontitis, acute alveolar abscess, phoenix abscess). on the other hand in chronic inflammation bacteria remain confined in the endodontic space. only few exceptions to this general rule have been experimentally proved.  in endodontics we deal with a mixed infection which is composed by obligate anaerobes and by facultative anaerobes. the most frequently found obligate anaerobes are bacteroides sp. and fusobacterium sp. (gram- rods) anaerobic diphtheroides (gram+ rods) peptostreptococcus sp. (gram+ cocci) and veilonella sp. (gram- cocci). actinomyces sp., lactobacillus sp., streptococcus sp., and staphilococcus sp. are the facultative anaerobes most frequently found.

TI  == bacteriotherapy for chronic relapsing clostridium difficile diarrhoea in six patients.
AB  == six patients with chronic relapsing diarrhoea caused by clostridium difficile were treated with rectal instillation of homologous faeces (one patient) or a mixture of ten different facultatively aerobic and anaerobic bacteria diluted in  sterile saline (five patients). the mixture led to a prompt loss of cl difficile  and its toxin from the stools and to bowel colonisation by bacteroides sp, which  had not been present in pre-treatment stool samples. strains of escherichia coli, cl bifermentans, and peptostreptococcus productus in the mixture inhibited the in-vitro growth of cl difficile, which in turn inhibited the growth of bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides vulgatus, and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. the finding that bacteroides sp had been absent during the patients' illness but was  present after recovery suggests that the absence of bacteroides sp may result in  chronic relapsing cl difficile diarrhoea, and that its presence may prevent colonisation by cl difficile.

TI  == direct and indirect pathogenicity of anaerobic bacteria in respiratory tract infections in children.
AB  == bacteroides sp (bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides oralis, and bacteroides  fragilis), peptostreptococci, and fusobacteria are important pathogens in respiratory tract infections (rti). these organisms are often recovered mixed with other aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic bacteria. evidence supporting their virulence is provided by studies showing their synergistic potentials in mixed infections and their increased virulence when encapsulated. a recent increase in numbers of beta-lactamase producing strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria in rti has been associated with increased failure rates of penicillins in eradication of these infections. these infections include chronic  otitis media, chronic sinusitis and mastoiditis, chronic recurrent tonsillitis, and lung abscesses. the pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin therapy but also to protect penicillin susceptible pathogens from that drug. these direct and indirect virulence characteristics of anaerobic bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all pathogens in mixed infections. the synergy that exists between different aerobic and anaerobic organisms in the respiratory tract is due to several pathogenic mechanisms. these mechanisms include the production of a capsule, which protects organisms from phagocytosis, and the production of beta-lactamase, which inactivates penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins. both of these mechanisms enhance infection and induce complications. however, more work is necessary to prevent encapsulation and the production of enzymes. data, thus far, indicate that there  are therapeutic modalities that can be used to prevent these occurrences and eliminate many mixed rti.

(37), bacteroides bivius (23), bacteroides asaccharolyticus (12), peptococcus asaccharolyticus (29), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (19), unidentified anaerobic gram-positive cocci (18), escherichia coli (17), nonhemolytic streptococci (16), neisseria gonorrhoeae (13), and gardnerella vaginalis (38). clinical cure was noted in 29 of 30 moxalactam-treated and 29 of  30 clindamycin/tobramycin-treated patients. moxalactam was effective in five of six cases of tuboovarian abscess, all 22 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease with peritonitis, the one case of endomyometritis and the one wound abscess. clindamycin/tobramycin was effective in eight of nine cases of tuboovarian abscess, all 14 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease with peritonitis, and all seven cases of endomyometritis. no adverse hematologic, renal, or hepatic effects were noted with either regimen.

AB  == the effects of sulphasalazine (sasp), azodisal sodium (ads), and their metabolites were tested in vitro on aerobic and anaerobic faecal bacterial strains. sulphapyridine (sp) had a mild to moderate effect on escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis. sasp also had a growth-inhibitory effect on strep. faecalis. the other substances had no effect on the aerobic strains. sasp, sp, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and, to a certain extent, n-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid exerted a growth-inhibitory effect on the anaerobic strains. of special interest  was the inhibitory effect on clostridium difficile strains. in recent years the possibility that overgrowth of cl. difficile could cause flare-ups of inflammatory bowel disease has been discussed. some studies suggested that sasp treatment could predispose to cl. difficile superinfection, whereas others found  sasp more probable to exert a prophylactic effect. our findings support the theory that sasp treatment reduces rather than promotes the risk of cl. difficile superinfection.

AB  == in the present study we sought to determine whether serum antibody was present against microorganisms which predominate in the subgingival flora of young adults with generalized severe periodontitis (sp). subjects with sp were often seropositive for eubacterium brachy, fusobacterium nucleatum e3c22, and peptostreptococcus micros, whereas subjects with juvenile periodontitis (jp) and  subjects with healthy periodontium (hp) were not. both sp and jp subjects were more frequently seropositive for bacteroides gingivalis, f. nucleatum d52b16, and f. nucleatum e1d1 than were hp subjects. the data were most striking for b. gingivalis, for which both the incidence and the magnitude of specific antibody was clearly elevated for sp and jp subject groups. however, sp subjects generally had either a high antibody titer or no detectable titer. in contrast, jp and hp subjects generally had at least very small amounts of antibody. except at very low levels of antibody, neither sp nor jp groups differed significantly from the  hp group for antibody to eubacterium nodatum, bacteroides intermedius (homology group 4197 or 8944), or lactobacillus minutus antibody. there was a high frequency of antibody to e. nodatum, with very high titers in all groups despite  the fact that this organism is rarely found in hp subjects. for eubacterium timidum, the jp group was clearly more frequently seropositive than the hp group. despite high levels of l. minutus in subgingival flora, none of the 50 sp subjects had a detectable antibody titer, and only four of the hp and jp subjects had detectable antibody. these results indicate that many organisms in the subgingival flora elicit antibody responses. b. gingivalis is probably the best example among the species tested. however, some organisms that are present in high concentration, e.g., l. minutus, apparently fail to induce significant antibody responses.

AB  == tonsils were obtained from 22 young adults (mean age, 23 years) suffering from chronic tonsillitis. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained from core tonsillar cultures in all patients, yielding an average of 9.0 isolates (5.3 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes) per specimen. the predominant anaerobic isolates were  bacteroides sp, fusobacterium sp, and gram-positive cocci. the predominant aerobic isolates were alpha-hemolytic streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, branhamella catarrhalis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and hemophilus sp. beta-lactamase-production was noted in 32 isolates recovered from 18 tonsils (82%). these included all eight isolates of s aureus and five b fragilis, and 11  of 24 b melaninogenicus group (46%). our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature of deep tonsillar flora in young adults with chronic tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of beta-lactamase-producing organisms in most of the patients.

TI  == microorganisms isolated from infected aural fistulas.
AB  == aural fistula is a congenital deformity of the external ear relatively common in  orientals and rare in caucasians. suppuration tends to occur, and chemotherapy rather than surgical drainage should be attempted. however, the lack of information concerning infected aural fistulas has made appropriate chemotherapy  difficult. microorganisms isolated from 13 cases of infected aural fistulas were  studied from january 1981 to december 1982. six species and 22 strains were isolated; nonsporeforming faculative anaerobes were detected in 12 cases. the isolated pathogens included peptococcus sp (10 cases), peptostreptococcus sp (3), bacteroides sp (3), and fusobacterium sp (2). one case exhibited only staphylococcus aureus. our data also stresses the etiologic importance of anaerobic gram-positive cocci in infected aural fistulas.

TI  == the effect of lincomycin-neomycin treatment on experimental anaerobic bacterial bovine mastitis.
AB  == three healthy lactating quarters of a friesland cow were each experimentally infected with a pure culture of a strain of either bacteroides fragilis, eubacterium lentum or a peptostreptococcus sp. respectively. the onset and progression to clinical mastitis was monitored 12 hourly by examination for clinical signs of inflammation, bacterial culture, somatic cell counts and with a strip cup. all infected quarters developed clinical mastitis within 24 hours. the 2 quarters infected with b. fragilis and e. lentum respectively were treated 4 times consecutively at 12 hour intervals, commencing at 24 h by intramammary instillation of 10 ml of a mixture containing 200 mg lincomycin hydrochloride, 200 mg neomycin sulphate and 5 mg methylprednisolone (lincocin forte, upjohn). both quarters became clinically normal and no bacteria could be detected in the secretions 12 hours after the first treatment. at 36 hours the strip cup became negative, and the somatic cell count dropped to less than 500 x 10(3) at 72 hours after the initial treatment. the quarter infected with a peptostreptococcus sp. was unable to overcome the infection by natural means when intramammary treatment was delayed for the first 36 hours after the onset of clinical mastitis. subsequent treatment of this quarter gave results similar to those treated earlier.

TI  == death of an african elephant from probable toxemia attributed to chronic pulpitis.
AB  == a 31-year-old captive male african elephant (loxodonta africana) of 5,000-kg body weight died suddenly in ventral recumbency. lesions seen at necropsy were bilateral purulent pulpitis and periodontitis of both tusks, serous atrophy of coronary groove fat, grammocephalus cholangitis, myocardial and skeletal lipofuscinosis, and scattered segmental necrosis in the pectoral muscles. nonhemolytic streptococci, corynebacterium sp, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, fusobacterium nucleatum, and bacteroides sp, were recovered from the exudate around one or both tusks. we postulated that the elephant died of hypoxia from prolonged ventral recumbency because of weakness and inability to rise secondary  to toxemia from bilateral pulpitis and periodontitis.

TI  == the frequency and some characteristics of anaerobic bacteria isolated from various forms of bovine mastitis.
AB  == the prevalence of strictly anaerobic bacteria in the secretions from untreated cases of mastitis in lactating dairy cows was investigated. the study involved 147 friesland cows in 12 highveld herds. all herds yielded cows with anaerobic udder infections. no anaerobic bacteria were recovered from cows with normal quarters or those with latent aerobic infections. only anaerobes were present in  10% of so-called 'aseptic' mastitis cases. a variety of anaerobic organisms was isolated concurrently with facultative bacteria from 5,3% and 58,8% of cases classified as subclinical and clinical respectively. peptococcus spp. was associated with corynebacterium pyogenes and bacteroides spp. with staphylococcus aureus and/or streptococcus agalactiae in 80% anaerobic udder infections. gram positive anaerobic species were mostly sensitive to penicillin-g but all the gram negative rods were resistant. in addition, all b. fragilis strains produced beta-lactamase. the ability to produce heparinase was demonstrated in one strain  of peptococcus indolicus and a peptostreptococcus sp.

AB  == aspiration of peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) was aseptically performed in 16 children. patients' median age was 10 years (range 6 to 17 years), and 12 were males. unilateral abscess was present in all but one child. all aspirates were cultured for aerobes and anaerobes and yielded bacterial growth in all patients.  anaerobes were isolated in all patients; in 3 patients (19%), they were the only  organism isolated, and in 13 (81%), they were mixed with aerobes. there were 91 anaerobic isolates (5.7 per specimen): 42 bacteroides sp. (including 23 b. melaninogenicus, 5 b. oralis and 4 b. ruminicola ss. brevis); 18 anaerobic gram-positive cocci (including 10 peptostreptococcus sp., 4 peptococcus sp. and 4 microaerophilic streptococci); 15 fusobacterium sp.; and 3 clostridium sp. there  were 32 aerobic isolates (2.0 per specimen): 11 gamma-hemolytic streptococci, 8 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 4 group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, 4 haemophilus sp. and 3 s. aureus. beta-lactamase production was noted in 13 isolates recovered from 11 patients (68%). these were all isolates of s. aureus (3), 8 of 23 b. melaninogenicus (35%), and 2 of 5 b. oralis (40%). our findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of peritonsillar abscesses in children, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in two thirds of the patients.

TI  == comparison of three methods of susceptibility testing of bacteroidaceae, peptococcaceae and other anaerobes to doxycycline.
AB  == the in vitro activity of doxycycline against 147 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes was determined by broth dilution, agar dilution and agar  diffusion tests. the strains were isolated from clinical specimens in 1977. saccharolytic bacteroides strains (39 b. fragilis, 6 b. thetaiotaomicron, 4 b. vulgatus) showed broth dilution mics of less than or equal to 0.0625-4.0 microgram/ml after 5 h incubation and mics of less than or equal to 16 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation at 37 degrees c. with strains of b. oralis, b. melaninogenicus ss. intermedius, b. corrodens, veillonella sp. and megasphaera elsdenii the broth dilution mics were less than or equal to 0.0625-32 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation. peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium acnes, eubacterium sp., bifidobacterium sp. and clostridium sp. had broth dilution mics of less than or equal to 2 microgram/ml, whereas peptococcus spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.0625 to greater than 32 microgram/ml. with the great majority of strains tested, mics were 2 to 256 times higher in agar than in broth dilution tests. clinical and experimental studies seem to be needed to determine which of the in vitro data are correlated to the outcome of doxycycline therapy. several groups and species were separately considered for statistical analysis of the relationship between zone size and mic. with gram-positive anaerobes, correlation was poor between broth dilution mic and zone size (correlation coefficients r = - 0.168 for peptococcaceae, and r = - 0.108 for p. acnes). when calculating the regression lines for agar dilution mics and zone diameters, a higher correlation was found (r = - 0.9 for peptococcaceae; r = - 0.397 for p. acnes). with b. fragilis and other bacteroides species correlation coefficients were r = - 0.807 to r = - 0.891 for broth and agar dilution mics and zone size but stochastic linearity was lacking.

AB  == a growth medium and test were developed for rapid detection of urease in fermentative anaerobic bacteria. using nonselective rumen fluid roll-tube agar medium and the new test, it was confirmed that peptostreptococcus productus is often the most numerous urease-forming species in human feces. also, some fecal strains of ruminococcus albus, clostridium innocuum, and clostridium beijerinckii produced urease. single strains of fusobacterium prausnitzii, coprococcus catus,  and streptococcus mitis that were strongly ureolytic on isolation later lost this ability. urease activity was also detected in many strains of nonselectively isolated rumen species. they include succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, treponema sp., ruminococcus bromii (not previously known to be present in the rumen), butyrivibrio sp., bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides ruminicola, and p. productus.  most p. productus strains contain urease; however, the uniformity of this feature in the other species noted above is not known. the urease in many of these species was not detected if the growth medium contained 0.2% or more (each) yeast extract and trypticase.

TI  == [susceptibility to thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol of anaerobic bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  == the in vitro susceptibility to thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol of 272 anaerobes, most of which were recent clinical isolated, was determined by broth dilution tests, with chloramphenicol, 133 anaerobic gram-negative non-sporing rods (48 bacteroides fragilis, 13 b. thetaiotaomicron, 14 b. oralis, 16 sphaerophorus varius etc.) had mic values of 0.03 through 16 microng/ml. very similar results (mic, 0.06-16 microng/ml) were obtained with thiamphenicol. in concentrations of 4 microng/ml or less chloramphenicol inhibited 90.2% and thiamphenicol 78.95% of the strains. strains with only moderate sensitivity to both antibiotics (mic, 8 or 16 microng/ml) belonged to b. fragilis or other bacteroides species. members of the fusobacterium and sphaerophorus group were susceptible to less than or equal to 2 microng chloramphenicol/ml and less than or equal to 4 microng thiamphenicol/ml respectively. with both antibiotics, 102 strains of gram-positive non-sporing anaerobes (p. acnes, peptostreptococcus spp., peptococcus spp.) were susceptible to less than or equal to 8 microng/ml. of 37 clostridium isolates, 35 (belonging to c. perfringens, c. septicum, c. cadaveris etc.) were inhibited by concentrations of 8 microng/ml or less of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. only one strain each of c. perfringens and clostridium sp. had an mic of 16 microng thiamphenicol/ml. accordingly, resistance to thiamphenicol or chloramphenicol was not observed. a standardized monodisk agardiffusion test was performed on 40 bacteroidaceae, 18 peptococcaceae and 20 c, (p.) acnes strains. only a poor correlation was observed between mic and zone size for thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol. therefore, inhibition zone diameter measurement cannot be regarded as a reliable method to detect chloramphenicol or thiamphenicol resistance in anaerobes. thiamphenicol, which is virtually as active against anaerobes as chloramphenicol but lacks serious toxicity, may well play an important role in the therapy of various anaerobic infections.

(5 strains) were susceptible.  on the contrary, propionibacterium acnes (6 strains) was resistant to 100 mcg/ml  or more of tinidazole and metronidazole. the antibacterial activity of tinidazole was stronger against bacteroides than that of metronidazole, while almost equal against peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium and fusobacterium. tinidazole was bactericidal against f. varium in a concentration of 2 mic till 24 hours of incubation but did not show such an activity on b. fragilis ss. fragilis in same concentration even after 12 hours of incubation. on the other hand, metronidazole was bactericidal against b. fragilis ss. fragilis while was not against f. varium. against p. prevotii bactericidal activity of both drugs was similar. tinidazole as well as metronidazole is an excellent chemotherapeutic agent against anaerobic bacteria excluding propionibacterium acnes and bifidobacterium adolescentis.

TI  == the reduction of n-hydroxy-4-acetylaminobiphenyl by the intestinal microflora of  the rat.
AB  == the role of the intestinal flora in the conversion of n-hydroxy-4-acetyl-aminobiphenyl (n-oh-aabp) to 4-acetylaminobiphenyl has been examined. this reaction, which reverses the metabolic activation of the parent carcinogen, can be demonstrated in cultures of some bacteria indigenous to the intestinal microflora. these include cultures of clostridium sp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus productus i, and bacteroides fragilis ss. thetaiotaomicron and ss. vulgatus. in contrast, cultures of lactobacillus plantarum and escherichia coli show little or no capacity for this reaction. the  reduction of n-oh-aabp is also carried out by homogenates of liver, kidney, and brain. on a weight basis, the cecal flora is considerably more active in reducing n-oh-aabp than are homogenates of tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. the cecal flora also has a greater activity for reducing n-oh-aabp than the stomach flora, an observation which may relate to the induction of tumors in the forestomach but not in the cecum of rats fed this compound. the products of the metabolism of n-oh-aabp have been compared in germ-free and conventional animals. glucuronide conjugates of n-oh-aabp are found in the cecal contents and feces only of the germ-free rats, while 4-acetylaminobiphenyl is found in the feces only of conventional rats. these results suggest that the flora, by hydrolyzing glucuronides and reducing n-oh-aabp, may influence the level of metabolities of 4-acetylaminobiphenyl which are critical for carcinogenesis.

AB  == studies on the rate and extent of galacturonic acid and isolated pectin digestion were carried out with nine strains of rumen bacteria (butyrivibrio fibrisolvens h10b and d16f, bacteroides ruminicola 23 and d31d, lachnospira multiparus d15d, peptostreptococcus sp. d43e, b. succinogenes a3c, ruminococcus flavefaciens b34b, and r. albus 7). only three strains, 23, d16f, and d31d, utilized galacturonic acid as a sole energy source, whereas all strains except a3c and h10b degraded (solubilized) and utilized purified pectin. nutrient composition of the basal medium and separate sterilization of the substrate affected the rate and extent of fermentation for both substrates. pectin degradation and utilization were measured with two maturity stages each of intact bromegrass and alfalfa. for bromegrass i, all strains tested (b34b, 23, d16f, d31d, d15d, and d43e) degraded  a considerable amount of pectin and, with the exception of b34b, utilized most of what was degraded. similar, but lower, results were obtained with bromegrass ii,  except for the two strains of b. ruminicola, 23 and d31d, which were unable to degrade and utilize pectin from this forage. all strains were able to degrade and utilize pectin from both maturity stages of alfalfa; however, values were considerably lower for strains 23 and d31d. synergism studies, in which a limited utilizing strain, b34b, was combined with the limited degrading strain, d31d, resulted in a slight increase in degradation and a very marked increase in utilization of the pectin in all four forages. similar results were obtained on both alfalfa substrates with a combination of strains b34b and d16f; however, no  increases were observed with this combination on bromegrass.

TI  == oxygen sensitivity of various anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == anaerobes differ in their sensitivity to oxygen, as two patterns were recognizable in the organisms included in this study. strict anaerobes were species incapable of agar surface growth at po(2) levels greater than 0.5%. species that were found to be strict anaerobes were treponema macrodentium, treponema denticola, treponema oralis n. sp., clostridium haemolyticum, selenomonas ruminatium, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and lachnospira multiparus. moderate anaerobes would include those species capable of growth in the presence of oxygen levels as high as 2 to 8%. the moderate anaerobes could be exposed to room atmosphere for 60 to 90 min without appreciable loss of viability. species considered as moderate anaerobes were bacteroides fragilis, b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, fusobacteria nucleatum, clostridium novyi type a, and peptostreptococcus elsdenii. the recognition of at  least two general types of anaerobes would seem to have practical import in regard to the primary isolation of anaerobes from source material.
