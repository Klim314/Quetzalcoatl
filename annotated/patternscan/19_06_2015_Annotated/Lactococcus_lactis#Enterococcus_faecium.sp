TI  == phenotypic and genotypic characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from raw goat milk and effect of farming practices on the dominant species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria, in particular lactococcuslactis, play a decisive role in the cheese making process and more particularly in lactic cheeses which are primarily produced on goat dairy farms. the objective of this study was therefore to identify the main lactic acid bacteria found in raw goats' milk from three different regions in france and evaluate if certain farming practices have an effect on the distribution of species of lactic acid bacteria in the various milk samples. identification at genus or species level was carried out using phenotypic tests and genotypic methods including repetitive element rep-pcr, species-specific pcr and 16s rrna gene sequencing. the distribution of the main bacterial species in the milk samples varied depending on farms and their characteristics. out of the 146 strains identified, l. lactis was the dominant species (60% of strains), followed by enterococcus (38%) of which enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. within the species l. lactis, l. lactis subsp  lactis was detected more frequently than l. lactis subsp cremoris (74% vs. 26%).  the predominance of l. lactis subsp cremoris was linked to geographical area studied. it appears that the animals' environment plays a role in the balance between the dominance of l. lactis and enterococci in raw goats' milk. the separation between the milking parlor and the goat shed (vs no separation) and only straw in the bedding (vs straw and hay) seems to promote l. lactis in the milk (vs enterococci).

TI  == chloride-inducible expression vector for delivery of antimicrobial peptides targeting antibiotic-resistant enterococcus faecium.
AB  == antibiotic-resistant enterococcal infections are a major concern in hospitals where patients with compromised immunity are readily infected. enterococcus faecium bacteria are of particular interest as these pathogens account for over 80% of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections. antimicrobial peptides (amps) produced at the site of infection by engineered bacteria may offer a potential alternative to traditional antibiotics for the treatment of resistant bacteria such as e. faecium. for this mode of delivery to be effective, it is essential to identify a suitable protein expression system that can be used in the desired delivery bacterium. in this study, we describe a promising chloride-inducible promoter and its application in the bacterial delivery of amps from lactococcus lactis to reduce counts of e. faecium bacteria in vitro. reporter gene studies show that at chloride concentrations found within the human intestines, the chloride-inducible promoter exhibits high levels of protein expression compared to those of the commonly used nisin-inducible promoter. these results indicate that this system is powerful and would not require the exogenous administration of an inducer molecule. in its application for amp production against e. faecium in vitro, l. lactis producing amps under the chloride promoter rapidly decreased e. faecium counts by nearly 10,000-fold. as an extension of this application, we also demonstrate the potential in using this type of delivery system in combination with traditional antibiotics to slow the development of resistance. collectively, this study shows the promise of using a  chloride-inducible promoter for the bacterial delivery of amps in the body for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and other antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

TI  == characterization, identification and application of lactic acid bacteria isolated from forage paddy rice silage.
AB  == there has been growing interest to develop forage rice as a new feed resource for livestock. this study was to characterize the natural population of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and select potentially excellent strains for paddy rice silage preparation in china. one hundred and twenty-six strains were isolated and screened from paddy rice silage prepared using a small-scale fermentation system, and ninety-nine of these isolates were considered to be lab based on their gram-positive and catalase-negative morphology and the production of most of their metabolic products as lactic acid. these isolates were divided into eight groups (a-h) on the basis of their morphological and biochemical characteristics. the group a to h strains were identified as lactobacillus (l.) plantarum subsp. plantarum (species ratio: 8.1%), l. casei (5.1%), leuconostoc (ln.) pseudomesenteroides (11.1%), pediococcus (p.) pentosaceus (24.2%), enterococcus (e.) mundtii (12.1%), lactococcus (lc.) garvieae (15.2%), e. faecium (9.1%) and lc. lactis subsp. lactis (15.2%) based on sequence analyses of their 16s rrna and reca genes. p. pentosaceus was the most abundant member of the lab population in  the paddy rice silage. a selected strain, namely l. casei r 465, was found to be  able to grow under low ph conditions and to improve the silage quality with low ph and a relatively high content of lactic acid. this study demonstrated that forage paddy rice silage contains abundant lab species and its silage can be well preserved by inoculation with lab, and that strain r 465 can be a potentially excellent inoculant for paddy rice silage.

TI  == pyrosequencing vs. culture-dependent approaches to analyze lactic acid bacteria associated to chicha, a traditional maize-based fermented beverage from northwestern argentina.
AB  == the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) associated with chicha, a traditional maize-based fermented alcoholic beverage from northwestern argentina, was analyzed using culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. samples corresponding to 10 production steps were obtained from two local producers at maimara (chicha m) and tumbaya (chicha t). whereas by culture-dependent approach  a few number of species (lactobacillus plantarum and weissella viridescens in chicha m, and enterococcus faecium and leuconostoc mesenteroides in chicha t) were identified, a higher quantitative distribution of taxa was found in both beverages by pyrosequencing. the relative abundance of otus was higher in chicha  m than in chicha t; six lab genera were common for chicha m and t: enterococcus,  lactococcus, streptococcus, weissella, leuconostoc and lactobacillus while pediococcus only was detected in chicha m. among the 46 identified lab species, those of lactobacillus were dominant in both chicha samples, exhibiting the highest diversity, whereas enterococcus and leuconostoc were recorded as the second dominant genera in chicha t and m, respectively. identification at species level showed the predominance of lb. plantarum, lactobacillus rossiae, leuconostoc lactis and w. viridescens in chicha m while enterococcus hirae, e. faecium, lc. mesenteroides and weissella confusa predominated in chicha t samples. in parallel, when presumptive lab isolates (chicha m: 146; chicha t: 246) recovered from the same samples were identified by isr-pcr and rapd-pcr profiles, species-specific pcr and 16s rrna gene sequencing, most of them were assigned to the leuconostoc genus (lc. mesenteroides and lc. lactis) in chicha m, lactobacillus, weissella and enterococcus being also present. in contrast, chicha t exhibited the presence of enterococcus and leuconostoc, e. faecium being the most representative species. massive sequencing approach was applied for the first time to study the diversity and evolution of microbial communities during chicha manufacture. although differences in the lab species profile between the two geographically different chicha productions were observed by culturing, a larger number for predominant lab species as well as other minorities were revealed by pyrosequencing. the fine molecular inventory achieved by pyrosequencing provided more precise information on lab population composition than culture-dependent analysis processes.

TI  == selenite-stress selected mutant strains of probiotic bacteria for se source production.
AB  == selenium deficiency is a major health problem worldwide for about 1 billion people. bacterial cells usually possess low tolerance to selenite stress and also low ability to reduce high concentrations of toxic selenite. here, high tolerance to selenite and selenium bioaccumulation capability were developed in mutated clones of probiotic and starter bacteria including enterococcus faecium, bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis, lactobacillus casei and lactococcus lactis  ssp. lactis by food-level strain development process and clone selection. all mutant clones possessed increased glutathione concentration and glutathione reductase activity. the selenite treatment increased further these values in l. casei mutant strain pointing at a different selenite reduction pathway and/or stress response in this organism. considerable conversion of selenite to cell bound selenium forms with a concomitant high biomass production was detected in e. faecium and b. animalis ssp. lactis cultures. possible application of these strains as food and feed supplements is under investigation.

TI  == efficacy of the direct-fed microbial enterococcus faecium alone or in combination with saccharomyces cerevisiae or lactococcus lactis during induced subacute ruminal acidosis.
AB  == this study aimed at investigating enterococcus faecium alone or e. faecium in combination with saccharomyces cerevisiae or lactococcus lactis during a subacute ruminal acidosis (sara) challenge. four ruminally fistulated holstein dairy cows  were assigned to the following treatments in a 4x4 latin square design: (1) control (con); (2) e. faecium (ef); (3) ef + s. cerevisiae (efsc); (4) ef + l. lactis dsm 11037 (efll). each experimental period consisted of 18 d of adaptation to the respective direct-fed microbial, 3 d of sara challenge, and 7d of rest. rumen ph was recorded every 10 min over 24 h on d 17 of adaptation, d 2 of sara,  and d 6 of rest. on the last day of adaptation, sara, and rest, samples of rumen  content (0 and 3 h after feeding) were taken for volatile fatty acids, lactate, vitamin b12, rumen microbes, and lipopolysaccharides determination. blood samples (0 and 6 h after feeding) were taken for the measurement of acute-phase proteins. dry matter intake and milk yield were recorded daily. during sara, mean rumen ph  with efsc (5.94) was not different from that of efll (5.95) and tended to be higher than with con (5.82) or ef (5.82). postfeeding vitamin b12 concentrations  in the rumen were greater with efsc (134.5ng/g) than with ef (99.6ng/g) and tended to be greater when compared with con (101.2ng/g) or efll (104.9ng/g). during rest, prefeed vitamin b12 was greater with efsc (166.5ng/g) compared with  con (132.3ng/g). the efsc treatment did better than ef alone on ph characteristics during adaptation and sara and on maintenance of ruminal vitamin  b12 status during sara. milk yield drop from d 1 to 3 of sara was smaller with efsc (-0.8kg/d), ef (-0.9kg/d), or efll (-0.9kg/d) compared with con (-7.5kg/d).

TI  == isolation of enterococcus faecium nm113, enterococcus faecium nm213 and lactobacillus casei nm512 as novel probiotics with immunomodulatory properties.
AB  == probiotics, defined as living bacteria that are beneficial for human health, mainly function through their immunomodulatory abilities. hence, these microorganisms have proven successful for treating diseases resulting from immune deregulation. the aim of this study was to find novel candidates to improve on and complement current probiotic treatment strategies. of 60 lactic acid bacterial strains that were isolated from fecal samples of healthy, full-term, breast-fed infants, three were chosen because of their ability to activate human  immune cells. these candidates were then tested with regard to immunomodulatory properties, antimicrobial effects on pathogens, required pharmacological properties and their safety profiles. to identify the immunomodulatory structures of the selected isolates, activation of specific innate immune receptors was studied. the three candidates for probiotic treatment were assigned enterococcus  faecium nm113, enterococcus faecium nm213 and lactobacillus casei nm512. compared with the established allergy-protective strain lactococcus lactis g121, these isolates induced release of similar amounts of il-12, a potent inducer of t helper 1 cells. in addition, all three neonatal isolates had antimicrobial activity against pathogens. analysis of pharmacological suitability showed high tolerance of low ph, bile salts and pancreatic enzymes. in terms of safe application in humans, the isolates were sensitive to three antibiotics (chloramphenicol, tetracycline and erythromycin). in addition, the enterococcus isolates were free from the four major virulence genes (cyla, agg, efaafs and ccf). moreover, the isolates strongly activated toll-like receptor 2, which suggests lipopeptides as their active immunomodulatory structure. thus, three novel bacterial strains with great potential as probiotic candidates and promising immunomodulatory properties have here been identified and characterized.

TI  == isolation and molecular identification of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacterium spp. from faeces of the blue-fronted amazon parrot in brazil.
AB  == in brazil, the blue-fronted amazon parrot (amazona aestiva) is a common pet. the  faecal microbiota of these birds include a wide variety of bacterial species, the majority of which belong to the gram-positive lactic acid bacteria (lab) clade. the aim of this study was to investigate differences in the diversity and abundance of lab and bifidobacterium spp. in the cloacae between wild and captive birds and to select, identify and characterise lab for consideration as a parrot  probiotic. cloacal swabs were collected from 26 wild and 26 captive birds. bacterial dna was extracted, and the 16s rrna genes were amplified. the numbers of pcr-positive enterococcus, pediococcus, and lactobacillus species isolated from wild and captive birds were significantly different (p<0.05). enterococcus was the most frequently isolated genus, followed by pediococcus, lactobacillus, lactococcus and bifidobacterium. enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus coryniformis, lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and bifidobacterium bifidum were the most frequently isolated species from all birds. this study increases our understanding of the faecal microbiota, and may help to improve the nutrition and habitat management of captive and wild parrots. the bacterial population identified in the faecal microbiota of clinically healthy wild and captive parrots can serve as a database to analyse variations in the gut microbiota of pathogen-infected parrots and to develop probiotics specific to these genera.

TI  == modified lactic acid bacteria detect and inhibit multiresistant enterococci.
AB  == we designed lactococcus lactis to detect enterococcus faecalis. upon detection, l. lactis produce and secrete antienterococcal peptides. the peptides inhibit enterococcal growth and reduce viability of enterococci in the vicinity of l. lactis. the enterococcal sex pheromone ccf10 serves as the signal for detection.  expression vectors derived from pcf10, a ccf10-responsive e. faecalis sex-pheromone conjugative plasmid, were engineered in l. lactis for the detection system. recombinant host strains were engineered to express genes for three bacteriocins, enterocin a, hiracin jm79 and enterocin p, each with potent antimicrobial activity against e. faecalis. sensitive detection and specific inhibition occur both in agar and liquid media. the engineered l. lactis also inhibited growth of multidrug-resistant e. faecium strains, when induced by ccf10. the presented vectors and strains can be components of a toolbox for the development of alternative antibiotic technologies targeting enterococci at the site of infection.

TI  == construction of a novel inducible expression vector for lactococcus lactis m4 and lactobacillus plantarum pa21.
AB  == a vector that drives the expression of the reporter gusa gene in both lactobacillus plantarum and lactococcus lactis was constructed in this study. this vector contained a newly characterized heat shock promoter (phsp), amplified from an enterococcus faecium plasmid, par6. functionality and characterization of this promoter was initially performed by cloning phsp into pnz8008, a commercial  lactococcal plasmid used for screening of putative promoters which utilizes gusa  as a reporter. it was observed that phsp was induced under heat, salinity and alkaline stresses or a combination of all three stresses. the newly characterized phsp promoter was then used to construct a novel lactobacillus vector, par1801 and its ability to express the gusa under stress-induced conditions was reproducible in both lb. plantarum pa21 and l. lactis m4 hosts.

TI  == plantaricin ld1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of lactobacillus plantarum ld1.
AB  == plantaricin ld1, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum ld1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees c for 20 min and 121 degrees c for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a ph range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of  organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. the crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase k showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. the molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kda, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. it inhibited not only related strains but also other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as lactobacillus curvatus nrrl b-4562, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis nrrl b-1821, enterococcus faecium nrrl b-2354, enterobacter cloacae nrrl b-14298, micrococcus  luteus, staphylococcus aureus, urogenic escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri and vibrio sp. these properties of plantaricin ld1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.

TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == diversity of bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria isolated from mediterranean fish viscera.
AB  == nine lactic acid bacteria strains showing bacteriocin-like activity were isolated from various fresh fish viscera. the following species were identified based on 16s rdna sequences: enterococcus durans (7 isolates), lactococcus lactis (1) and  enterococcus faecium (1). these strains were active against listeria innocua and  other lab. random amplified polymorphic dna analyses showed four major patterns for the e. durans species. pcr analyses revealed a nisin gene in the genome of the lc. lactis strain. genes coding enterocins a, b and p were found in the genome of the e. faecium isolate. enterocins a and b genes were also present in the genome of e. durans gm19. hence, this is the first report describing e. durans strains producing enterocins a and b. electrospray ionization mass spectrometry revealed that the purified bacteriocin produced by the e. durans gmt18 strain had an exact molecular mass of 6,316.89 da. this bacteriocin was designated as durancin gmt18. edman sequencing failed to proceed; suggesting that durancin gtm18 may contain terminal lanthionine residues. overall, the results obtained revealed the presence of a variety of enterococci in mediterranean fish  viscera, as evidenced by their genetic profiles and abilities to produce different bacteriocins. these strains could be useful for food biopreservation or as probiotics.

TI  == development of a selective and differential medium for capsulated lactococcus garvieae.
AB  == a selective and differential medium termed 'lg agar' was developed for the isolation and presumptive identification of lactococcus garvieae that results in  black colonies with red halos. in this study, all 14 strains of l. garvieae and only 9 of the 148 strains representing 38 other species were able to grow on the  lg agar. the nine viable strains on lg agar plates (including enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis, vibrio fluvialis, vibrio furnissii, vibrio mimicus and vibrio salmonicida) were further differentiated from l. garvieae by various colours or colony features. colonies isolated from the mixing culture and the infected giant sea perch using lg agar plates were all positively identified as l. garvieae by conventional tests and 16s rdna sequencing. furthermore, lg agar discriminated capsulated strains of l. garvieae, which were believed to be correlated with pathogens of fish and shellfish, from non-capsulated ones by colony appearances. the specificity and differentiating ability of lg agar suggest that this medium displays considerable potential for primary isolation and presumptive identification of l. garvieae from pathological and environmental samples.

TI  == distribution of antimicrobial-resistant lactic acid bacteria in natural cheese in japan.
AB  == to determine and compare the extent of contamination caused by antimicrobial-resistant lactic acid bacteria (lab) in imported and domestic natural cheeses on the japanese market, lab were isolated using deman, rogosa and sharpe (mrs) agar and mrs agar supplemented with six antimicrobials. from 38 imported and 24 japanese cheeses, 409 lab isolates were obtained and their antimicrobial resistance was tested. the percentage of lab resistant to dihydrostreptomycin, erythromycin, and/or oxytetracycline isolated from imported  cheeses (42.1%) was significantly higher than that of lab resistant to dihydrostreptomycin or oxytetracycline from cheeses produced in japan (16.7%; p=0.04). antimicrobial resistance genes were detected in enterococcus faecalis (tetl, tetm, and ermb; tetl and ermb; tetm) e. faecium (tetm), lactococcus lactis (tets), lactobacillus (lb.), casei/paracasei (tetm or tetw), and lb. rhamnosus (ermb) isolated from seven imported cheeses. moreover, these e. faecalis isolates were able to transfer antimicrobial resistance gene(s). although antimicrobial resistance genes were not detected in any lab isolates from japanese cheeses, lb. casei/paracasei and lb. coryniformis isolates from a japanese farm-made cheese were resistant to oxytetracycline (minimal inhibitory concentration [mic], 32 microg/ml). leuconostoc isolates from three japanese farm-made cheeses were also  resistant to dihydrostreptomycin (mic, 32 to >512 microg/ml). in conclusion, the  present study demonstrated contamination with antimicrobial-resistant lab in imported and japanese farm-made cheeses on the japanese market, but not in japanese commercial cheeses.

TI  == a novel type of peptidoglycan-binding domain highly specific for amidated d-asp cross-bridge, identified in lactobacillus casei bacteriophage endolysins.
AB  == peptidoglycan hydrolases (pghs) are responsible for bacterial cell lysis. most pghs have a modular structure comprising a catalytic domain and a cell wall-binding domain (cwbd). pghs of bacteriophage origin, called endolysins, are  involved in bacterial lysis at the end of the infection cycle. we have characterized two endolysins, lc-lys and lc-lys-2, identified in prophages present in the genome of lactobacillus casei bl23. these two enzymes have different catalytic domains but similar putative c-terminal cwbds. by analyzing purified peptidoglycan (pg) degradation products, we showed that lc-lys is an n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, whereas lc-lys-2 is a gamma-d-glutamyl-l-lysyl endopeptidase. remarkably, both lysins were able to lyse only gram-positive bacterial strains that possess pg with d-ala(4)-->d-asx-l-lys(3) in their cross-bridge, such as lactococcus casei, lactococcus lactis, and enterococcus faecium. by testing a panel of l. lactis cell wall mutants, we observed that lc-lys and lc-lys-2 were not able to lyse mutants with a modified pg cross-bridge, constituting d-ala(4)-->l-ala-(l-ala/l-ser)-l-lys(3); moreover, they do not lyse the l. lactis mutant containing only the nonamidated d-asp cross-bridge, i.e. d-ala(4)-->d-asp-l-lys(3). in contrast, lc-lys could lyse the ampicillin-resistant e. faecium mutant with 3-->3 l-lys(3)-d-asn-l-lys(3) bridges replacing the wild-type 4-->3 d-ala(4)-d-asn-l-lys(3) bridges. we showed that the c-terminal cwbd of lc-lys binds pg containing mainly d-asn but not pg with only the nonamidated d-asp-containing cross-bridge, indicating that the cwbd confers to lc-lys its narrow specificity. in conclusion, the cwbd characterized in this study is a novel type of pg-binding domain targeting specifically the d-asn interpeptide bridge of pg.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly irish subjects.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects,  using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus),  gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to  growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.

AB  == crustin (mrcrs) was sequenced from a freshwater prawn macrobrachium rosenbergii.  the mrcrs protein contains a signal peptide region at n-terminus between 1 and 22 and a long whey acidic protein domain (wap domain) at c-terminus between 57 and 110 along with a wap-type 'four-disulfide core' motif. phylogenetic results show  that mrcrs is clustered together with other crustacean crustin groups. mrcrs showed high sequence similarity (77%) with crustin from pacific white shrimp litopenaeus vannamei and japanese spiny lobster panulirus japonicas. i-tasser uses the best structure templates to predict the possible structures of mrcrs along with pdb ids such as 2rela and 1flei. the gene expressions of mrcrs in both healthy m. rosenbergii and those infected with virus including infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (ihhnv) and white spot syndrome virus (wssv) and bacteria aeromonas hydrophila (gram-negative) and enterococcus faecium (gram-positive) were examined using quantitative real time pcr. to understand its biological activity, the recombinant mrcrs gene was constructed and expressed in  escherichia coli bl21 (de3). the recombinant mrcrs protein agglutinated with the  bacteria considered for analysis at a concentration of 25 mug/ml, except lactococcus lactis. the bactericidal results showed that the recombinant mrcrs protein destroyed all the bacteria after incubation, even less than 6 h. these results suggest that mrcrs is a potential antimicrobial peptide, which is involved in the defense system of m. rosenbergii against viral and bacterial infections.

TI  == interactive effects of ph and temperature on the bacteriocin stability by response surface analysis.
AB  == the combined influence of ph and temperature on bacteriocins produced by three lactic acid bacteria, pediococcus pentosaceus mmz26, enterococcus faecium mmz17 and lactococcus lactis mmz25, isolated from tunisian traditional dry fermented meat was studied using a second order orthogonal factorial design and response-surface methodology (rsm). this method allows estimating the interactive effects of ph and temperature on the stability of each bacteriocin. the high heat stability of the three bacteriocins was demonstrated, with optimum values at light acidic ph around 5.0, temperature below 90 degrees c and short incubation times. this study contributes to a better understanding of relation between bacteriocins production and stability in order to enhance their, in situ, application as a food and feed biopreservative in fermented and/or heated food products.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria from farmed seabass dicentrarchus labrax.
AB  == the use of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in the prevention or reduction of fish diseases is receiving increasing attention. in the present study, 47 lab strains  were isolated from farmed seabass ( dicentrarchus labrax ) and were phenotypically and phylogenetically analysed by 16s rdna and randomly amplified polymorphic dna - polymerase chain reaction (rapd-pcr). their antimicrobial effect was tested in vitro against a wide variety of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. most of the strains isolated were enterococci belonging to the following species: enterococcus faecium (59%), enterococcus faecalis (21%), enterococcus sanguinicola (4 strains), enterococcus mundtii (1 strain), enterococcus pseudoavium (1 strain), and lactococcus lactis (1 strain). an aerococcus viridans strain was also isolated. the survey of their antimicrobial susceptibility showed that all isolates were sensitive to vancomycin and exhibited resistance to between 4 and 10 other antibiotics relevant for therapy in human and animal medicine. different patterns of resistance were noted for skin and intestines isolates. more than 69% (32 strains) of the isolates inhibited the growth of the majority of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria tested,  including listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, aeromonas hydrophila, aeromonas salmonicida, vibrio anguillarum, and carnobacterium sp. to our knowledge, this is the first report of bioactive enterococcal species isolated from seabass that could potentially inhibit the undesirable bacteria found in food systems.

TI  == effect of acid lactic bacteria isolated from faeces of healthy dogs on growth parameters and aflatoxin b1 production by aspergillus species in vitro.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to evaluate the inhibitory effect of enterococcus faecium and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis isolated from faeces of healthy dogs on (i) lag phase, (ii) growth rate, and (iii) aflatoxin b1 production by aspergillus section flavi on in vitro assays. thirteen lactic acid  bacteria (lab) isolates were used as antagonist microorganisms. antagonistic activity was assayed against four potentially aflatoxigenic aspergillus section flavi isolates: a. flavus (af210 and af281), a. parasiticus (ap245) and a. parasiticus (nrrl 2999). in general, the longest lag phases of aspergillus isolates were obtained with e. faecium gj40. respecting the growth rate, no significant reduction was found in this parameter in the interaction assays with  a. flavus and antagonist isolates respecting the control. while in a. parasiticus a significant reduction in growth rate was only observed in the interaction among reference strain and e. faecium mf5 isolate (p < 0.05). in general, afb1 production was reduced by most of the lab isolates assayed, except for e. faecium gj18, gj20, mf3 and mf4. this study provides the first data about the antiaflatoxigenic activity of autochthonous lab isolated from dog faeces.

TI  == biodiversity and growth dynamics of lactic acid bacteria in artisanal pdo ossau-iraty cheeses made from raw ewe's milk with different starters.
AB  == the biodiversity and growth dynamics of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in farm-house  ossau-iraty cheeses were investigated from vat milk to 180 days of ripening in six independent batches made from six raw ewe's milks using five typical cheese-making methods. commercial starter s1 was used for three batches, starter  s1 combined with s2 for one batch and no starter for two batches. up to ten lab species from five genera and up to two strains per species were identified per milk; up to eleven species from five genera and up to three strains per species were identified per cheese. lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus paracasei, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, and leuconostoc mesenteroides were detected in all cheeses. lactococci reached the highest counts irrespective of the milk and starter used. lactococci and enterococci increased during manufacture, and mesophilic lactobacilli increased during ripening. strain and species numbers, the percentage of isolates originating from the raw milk, maximum counts of each genus/species and time for reaching them, all varied according to whether or not a starter was used and the composition of the starter. the genotypes of strains within species varied according to the raw milk used. this generated distinct lab microbiotas throughout manufacture and ripening that will certainly impact on the characteristics of the ripened cheeses.

TI  == oxalate-degrading capacities of lactic acid bacteria in canine feces.
AB  == in this study, lactic acid bacteria in canine feces were isolated and identified, and their oxalate-degrading capacities were evaluated. the oxalate-degrading capacities were determined for 24 of 47 (51.06%) lactic acid bacteria isolates. of these, 8 isolates [leuconostoc mesenteroides (rl75), lactococcus garvieae (cd2), lactococcus subsp. lactis (cs21), enterococcus faecium (cl71 and cl72), and enterococcus faecalis (cd14, cs62, and cd12)] degraded more than 5% of the oxalate present, while the others degraded less than 5% of the oxalate in vitro.  isolates that degraded more than 5% of the oxalate present were selected for further examination. the oxalate-degrading capacities of individual isolates, a mixture of enterococcus, a mixture of lactococcus, and a mixture of the eight isolates were evaluated in media containing different concentrations of glucose (sufficient, insufficient, or no glucose). in comparison with the control medium, all of the individual isolates and mixtures of isolates could degrade oxalate in  all three groups (p<0.05). in most cases, the isolates growing in medium with 20  g/l of glucose had higher oxalate-degrading capacities than those growing in medium with 2.5 g/l of glucose or no glucose. the mixture of all isolates showed  higher oxalate-degrading capacity than the individual isolates and other mixtures. the oxalate-degrading capacities of the isolates were isolate dependent.

TI  == host range of enterococcal vana plasmids among gram-positive intestinal bacteria.
AB  == objectives: the most prevalent type of acquired glycopeptide resistance is encoded by the vana transposon tn1546 located mainly on transferable plasmids in  enterococcus faecium. the limited occurrence in other species could be due to the lack of inter-species transferability and/or stability of tn1546-containing plasmids in other species. we investigated the in vitro transferability of 14 pre-characterized vana-containing plasmids hosted by e. faecium (n = 9), enterococcus faecalis (n = 4) and enterococcus raffinosus (n = 1) into several enterococcal, lactobacterial, lactococcal and bifidobacterial recipients. methods: a filter-mating protocol was harmonized using procedures of seven partner laboratories. donor strains were mated with three e. faecium recipients,  three e. faecalis recipients, a lactobacillus acidophilus recipient, a lactococcus lactis recipient and two bifidobacterium recipients. transfer rates were calculated per donor and recipient. transconjugants were confirmed by determining their phenotypic and genotypic properties. stability of plasmids in the new host was assessed in long-term growth experiments. results: in total, 282 enterococcal matings and 73 inter-genus matings were performed and evaluated. in  summary, intra-species transfer was far more frequent than inter-species transfer, if that was detectable at all. all recipients of the same species behaved similarly. inter-genus transfer was shown for broad host range control plasmids (pip501/pambeta1) only. acquired resistance plasmids remained stable in  the new host. conclusions: intra-species transfer of enterococcal vana plasmids was far more frequent than transfer across species or genus barriers and may thus explain the preferred prevalence of vana-containing plasmids among e. faecium. a  reservoir of vana plasmids in non-enterococcal intestinal colonizers does not seem to be reasonable.

TI  == ftir-based polyphasic identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional greek graviera cheese.
AB  == this study used a combination of phenotypic, physical (fourier transformed infra-red [ftir] spectroscopy) and molecular (rflp and sscp analysis of 16s rrna  genes) methods to identify the lactic acid bacteria (lab) flora present in traditional greek graviera cheese after five weeks of ripening. a total of 300 isolates collected from high dilution plates of tsaye (incubated at 30 degrees c), m-17 (22 degrees c) and m-17 (42 degrees c) agar media were clustered by ftir and then representative strains of each cluster were cross-identified blindly by  all methods. based on their ftir spectra, 282 isolates were lab grouped in 28 clusters. the lab species identified and their prevalence in the cheese samples were: lactobacillus casei/paracasei (68.8%), lactobacillus plantarum (19.5%), streptococcus thermophilus (8.9%), enterococcus faecium (2.1%), and lactococcus lactis (0.7%). also, staphylococcus equorum (11 isolates), corynebacterium sp. (5 isolates) and brevibacterium sp. (1 isolate) were recovered from tsaye. comparative identification results showed that phenotypic and molecular methods were in mutual agreement as regards the lab species identified. the present polyphasic identification approach based on rapid ftir screening of 10-fold more  isolates than a previous classical identification approach allowed or improved detection of few sub-dominant species; however the predominant lab species in the cheese samples were the same with both approaches.

TI  == microbial stability and safety of traditional greek graviera cheese: characterization of the lactic acid bacterial flora and culture-independent detection of bacteriocin genes in the ripened cheeses and their microbial consortia.
AB  == the microflora of four batches of traditional greek graviera cheese was studied at 5 weeks of ripening, and 200 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolates were phenotypically characterized and screened for antilisterial bacteriocins. the cheeses were also analyzed for organic acids by high-performance liquid chromatography and for the potential presence of 25 known lab bacteriocin genes directly in cheese and their microbial consortia by pcr. all batches were safe according to the european union regulatory criteria for listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, enterobacteria, and coagulase-positive staphylococci. the cheese flora was dominated by nonstarter lactobacillus casei/paracasei (67.5%) and lactobacillus plantarum (16.3%) strains, whereas few streptococcus thermophilus (3.8%), lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (0.6%), and leuconostoc (1.9%) organisms were present. enterococcus faecium (9.4%) and enterococcus durans (0.6%) were isolated among the dominant lab from two batches; however, enterococci were present in all batches at 10- to 100-fold lower populations than mesophilic lactobacilli. sixteen e. faecium isolates produced antilisterial enterocins. in accordance, enterocin b gene was detectable in all cheeses and enterocin p gene was present in one cheese, whereas the consortia of all cheeses contained at least two of the enterocin a, b, p, 31, l50a, and l50b genes. plantaricin a gene  was also amplified from all cheeses. mean concentrations of lactic, acetic, citric, and propionic acids in the ripened cheeses exceeded 1.5% in total, of which approximately 0.9% was lactate. thus, organic acid contents constitute an important hurdle factor for inhibiting growth of pathogens in traditional graviera cheese products, with lab bacteriocins, mainly enterocins, potentially contributing to increased cheese safety.

TI  == detection of human intestinal catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci by rrna-targeted reverse transcription-pcr.
AB  == an analytical system based on rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) for enumeration of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci was established. subgroup- or species-specific primer sets targeting 16s or 23s rrna  from enterococcus, streptococcus, and lactococcus were newly developed. the rt-qpcr method using these primers together with the previously reported primer sets specific for the enterococcus genus, the streptococcus genus, and several streptococcus species was found to be able to quantify the target populations with detection limits of 10(3) to 10(4) cells per gram feces, which was more than 100 times as sensitive as the qpcr method (10(6) to 10(8) cells per gram feces).  the rt-qpcr analysis of fecal samples from 24 healthy adult volunteers using the  genus-specific primer sets revealed that enterococcus and streptococcus were present as intestinal commensals at population levels of log(10) 6.2 +/- 1.4 and  7.5 +/- 0.9 per gram feces (mean +/- standard deviation [sd]), respectively. detailed investigation using species- or subgroup-specific primer sets revealed that the volunteers harbored unique enterococcus species, including the e. avium  subgroup, the e. faecium subgroup, e. faecalis, the e. casseliflavus subgroup, and e. caccae, while the dominant human intestinal streptococcus species was found to be s. salivarius. various lactococcus species, such as l. lactis subsp.  lactis or l. lactis subsp. cremoris, l. garvieae, l. piscium, and l. plantarum, were also detected but at a lower population level (log(10) 4.6 +/- 1.2 per gram  feces) and prevalence (33%). these results suggest that the rt-qpcr method enables the accurate and sensitive enumeration of human intestinal subdominant but still important populations, such as gram-positive cocci.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal italian goat cheese.
AB  == the lactic acid bacteria community in traditional goat cheese produced in three dairies in valsesia (piemonte, italy) was studied at different steps of the manufacturing process. these cheeses were produced from raw milk without starter  bacteria, and no protocol was followed during the manufacturing process. three hundred thirty-two isolates were characterized and grouped by results of both morphophysiological tests and random amplification of polymorphic dna plus pcr analysis. bacteria were identified by partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. lactococci were the dominant lactic acid bacteria in raw milk. their initial numbers ranged from 5 to 7 log cfu ml(-1). their levels increased during manufacturing and decreased during ripening. the growth trend for enterococci was comparable to that of lactococci, although enterococci counts were lower. lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, lactococcus garviae, and enterococcus faecalis were the most frequently isolated species during goat cheese manufacturing, whereas the highest numbers of enterococcus (e. faecium, e. durans, e. gilvus, and e. casseliflavus) were isolated with the greatest frequency from ripened cheese samples. occasionally, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc lactis, and lactobacillus paraplantarum also were isolated.

AB  == a total of 96 lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from african indigenous fermented products and cow's intestines to study their inhibitory capability against multi-drug-resistant uropathogens. escherichia coli accounted for approximately 45% of isolated uropathogens, followed by staphylococcus spp. (20%). the gram negative uropathogens were highly resistant to quinolones, co-trimoxazole, teicoplanin and some beta-lactams, while the staphylococcus spp.  showed high resistance to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams and macrolides. twenty-four lab isolates were selected based on their antimicrobial activity against two uropathogenic staphylococcus aureus strains and bacteriocin production. lab strains showing antimicrobial activity were grouped into smaller  groups through amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). representative strains were identified as weissella spp., enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus brevis through sequencing of 16s rdna. the weissella spp. and l. brevis strains demonstrated remarkable inhibitory activity  against seven strains of gram negative uropathogens. two strains of l. lactis produced a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance active against lactobacillus sakei. in this study, an unusual high rate of co-trimoxazole, quinolones and macrolides resistance among uropathogens from south west nigeria was discovered.  based on their sensitivity to weissella spp., there is a potential for using these lab as a natural approach for the protection against the uropathogens assayed.

AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are widely used in food industry and their growth performance is important for the quality of the fermented product. by combining results from conventional isolation methods and molecular investigation of 16s rrna gene and lactococcal/enterococcal specific genes, we identify at species level catalase negative gram positive thermoresistant cocci isolated from traditional 'leben', a 24-h fermented milk in arid area of west algeria. forty strains phenotypically related to cocci lab were identified as belonging to the species lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and other enterococcus species. no streptococcus thermophilus strain was isolated. ten different phenotype groups were recognized, and the species content of these groups were in some cases different from the expected features usually given in genus and species descriptions. in particular, atypical lactococci, able to grow in 6.5% nacl, at ph 9.5 and showing high resistance to thermal stresses were isolated. lactococci, but also enterococci isolated from traditional 'leben' produced in the desert area, may be therefore of interest in milk fermentation. further studies to assess this source of diversity within the wild microbial population should provide starter new strains for product innovation.

TI  == changes in the microbial composition of raw milk induced by thermization treatments applied prior to traditional greek hard cheese processing.
AB  == the microbiological quality, safety, and composition of mixtures of ewe's and goat's milk (90:10) used for cheesemaking were evaluated before and after thermization at 60 and 67 degrees c for 30 s. such mild thermal treatments are commonly applied to reduce natural contaminants of raw milk before processing for traditional hard greek cheeses. raw milk samples had an average total bacterial count of 7.3 log cfu/ml; most of these bacteria were lactic acid bacteria (lab) and pseudomonads. the lab flora of raw milk was dominated by enterococci (40.8%), followed by lactococci (20.4%), leuconostocs (18.4%), and mesophilic lactobacilli (10.2%). enterococcus faecalis (30.1%) and enterococcus faecium (13.7%) were the  most common lab isolates, followed by enterococcus durans, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, and leuconostoc lactis. thermization at 60 degrees c for 30 s was effective for reducing raw milk contamination by enterobacteria (5.1 log cfu/ml), coagulase-positive staphylococci (3.3 log cfu/ml), and listeria (present in 25-ml samples) to safe levels, but it also reduced mesophilic lactococci, leuconostocs, lactobacilli, and selected enterococci (72.0%) in thermized milk. thermization at 67 degrees c for 30 s had  a major inactivation effect on all bacterial groups. two nisin-producing l. lactis subsp. lactis strains (m78 and m104) were isolated from raw milk, but neither nisin-producing nor other bacteriocin-producing lab strains were isolated from thermized milk. thus, thermization treatments control harmful bacteria but also may have a negative impact on milk quality by reducing desirable lab and the biodiversity of raw milk bacteria overall, inactivating potentially protective lab strains and enhancing the ability of potentially pathogenic enterococci to grow in fresh cheese curds.

TI  == gene cloning and characterization of efma, a multidrug efflux pump, from enterococcus faecium.
AB  == a dna fragment responsible for resistance to antimicrobial agents was cloned from chromosomal dna of enterococcus faecium fn-1, a clinically isolated strain. escherichia coli kam32, a drug-hypersusceptible mutant, was used as a host for gene cloning. cells of e. coli kam32 harboring a recombinant plasmid (ptfm8) carrying the dna fragment became resistant to fluoroquinolones, macrolides, ethidium bromide, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi) and tetraphenylphosphonium chloride (tppcl). three complete open reading frames (orfs) were found in the dna insert of ptfm8, and the deduced amino acid sequences of one of the orfs showed high similarity to mdt(a) from lactococcus lactis. mdt(a) is a multidrug efflux pump belonging to a major facilitator superfamily. we designated the orf efma. e. coli kam32 cells harboring the efma showed energy-dependent efflux of dapi and tpp(+). we also observed norfloxacin/h(+) antiport due to efma. the mrna expression of efma was observed in e. faecium fn-1 grown without any exogenously  added antimicrobial agents. thus, we conclude that efma is constitutively expressed under laboratory growth conditions and would contribute to intrinsic resistance against multiple antimicrobial agents in e. faecium fn-1.

TI  == study of microbial diversity in raw milk and fresh curd used for fontina cheese production by culture-independent methods.
AB  == the bacterial populations of raw milk employed for the production of fontina cheese in alpine farms located in different valleys and altitudes (from 700 to 2246 m above sea level) were investigated by culture independent techniques. total microbial dna was isolated from milk and curd samples and used as template  in polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to study the hypervariable v3 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene and analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). representative bands of dgge patterns were sequenced for identification purposes. the use of universal primer for pcr-dgge allowed the description of the bacterial community, not only for the presence of lactic acid bacteria, but also  for other adventitious species. dgge profiles obtained from milk and fresh curd samples were generally different and typical for each farm, although some recurrent bands were observed. cluster analysis of dgge profiles did not show high similarity among samples and it was probably dependent on the different geographical areas of pastures. some lactic acid bacteria (lab) recurred in many  samples (streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc lactis) indicating that alpine milk is a preferential niche for their colonization. the microbiota included not only mesophilic and thermoresistant lab but also adventitious bacteria (macrococcus caseolyticus, rothia spp.) and psychrotrophic bacteria (chryseobacterium spp., pseudomonas spp.), that were found in almost all samples, but disappeared after the warming up at 47-48 degrees c of coagulated milk. pantoea spp. was primarily  found in curds and only with a low incidence in milk samples, indicating the environmental origin. finally the sequencing data confirmed the presence of e. faecium, e. faecalis and s. thermophilus as major species present in the curd. these species were found also in raw milk, proving its importance as source of the typical fermenting microflora.

TI  == characterization and antimicrobial spectrum of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional bulgarian dairy products.
AB  == aims: to isolate bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (lab) with high wide  spectrum antibacterial activity and to characterize their inhibitory peptides. method and results: seven lab strains [lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus (pc5),  lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (bb18), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis  (bcm5, bk15), enterococcus faecium (mh3), lactobacillus plantarum (br12), lactobacillus casei ssp. casei (bcz2)], isolated from authentic bulgarian dairy products were capable of producing bacteriocins, inhibiting the widest range of pathogenic bacteria. the bacteriocins were resistant to heating at 121 degrees c  for 15 min, stable at ph 2-10, sensitive to protease, insensitive to alpha-amylase and lipase. two of bacteriocins produced by lact. bulgaricus bb18 (bulgaricin bb18) and e. faecium mh3 (enterocin mh3) were purified and the molecular masses were determined. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of bulgaricin bb18 did not show strong homology to other known bacteriocins. conclusions: lactobacillus bulgaricus bb18 and e. faecium mh3 produce two novel bacteriocins highly similar to the pediocin-like nonlantibiotics. significance and impact of the study: the two bacteriocins are potential antimicrobial agents  and, in conjunction with their producers, may have use in applications to contribute a positive effect on the balance of intestinal microflora. furthermore, bulgaricin bb18 strongly inhibits helicobacter pylori.

TI  == cross-immunity and immune mimicry as mechanisms of resistance to the lantibiotic  lacticin 3147.
AB  == lantibiotics are antimicrobial peptides that possess great potential as clinical  therapeutic agents. these peptides exhibit many beneficial traits and in many cases the emergence of resistance is extremely rare. in contrast, producers of lantibiotics synthesize dedicated immunity proteins to provide self-protection. these proteins have very specific activities and cross-immunity is rare. however, producers of two peptide lantibiotics, such as lacticin 3147, face the unusual challenge of exposure to two active peptides (alpha and beta). here, in addition  to establishing the contribution of ltni and ltnfe to lacticin 3147 immunity, investigations were carried out to determine if production of a closely related lantibiotic (i.e. staphylococcin c55) or possession of ltni/ltnfe homologues could provide protection. here we establish that not only are staphylococcin c55  producers cross-immune to lacticin 3147, and therefore represent a natural repository of staphylococcus aureus strains that are protected against lacticin 3147, but that functional immunity homologues are also produced by strains of bacillus licheniformis and enterococcus faecium. this result raises the spectre of resistance through immune mimicry, i.e. the emergence of lantibiotic-resistant strains from the environment resulting from the possession/acquisition of immunity gene homologues. these phenomena will have to be considered carefully when developing lantibiotics for clinical application.

TI  == the d-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase incorrectly annotated pane is the sole reduction system for branched-chain 2-keto acids in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == hydroxyacid dehydrogenases of lactic acid bacteria, which catalyze the stereospecific reduction of branched-chain 2-keto acids to 2-hydroxyacids, are of interest in a variety of fields, including cheese flavor formation via amino acid catabolism. in this study, we used both targeted and random mutagenesis to identify the genes responsible for the reduction of 2-keto acids derived from amino acids in lactococcus lactis. the gene pane, whose inactivation suppressed hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase activity, was cloned and overexpressed in escherichia coli, and the recombinant his-tagged fusion protein was purified and  characterized. the gene annotated pane was the sole gene responsible for the reduction of the 2-keto acids derived from leucine, isoleucine, and valine, while ldh, encoding l-lactate dehydrogenase, was responsible for the reduction of the 2-keto acids derived from phenylalanine and methionine. the kinetic parameters of the his-tagged pane showed the highest catalytic efficiencies with 2-ketoisocaproate, 2-ketomethylvalerate, 2-ketoisovalerate, and benzoylformate (v(max)/k(m) ratios of 6,640, 4,180, 3,300, and 2,050 u/mg/mm, respectively), with nadh as the exclusive coenzyme. for the reverse reaction, the enzyme accepted d-2-hydroxyacids but not l-2-hydroxyacids. although pane showed the highest degrees of identity to putative nadp-dependent 2-ketopantoate reductases  (kprs), it did not exhibit kpr activity. sequence homology analysis revealed that, together with the d-mandelate dehydrogenase of enterococcus faecium and probably other putative kprs, pane belongs to a new family of d-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases which is unrelated to the well-described d-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase family. its probable physiological role is to regenerate the nad(+) necessary to catabolize branched-chain amino acids, leading to the production of  atp and aroma compounds.

TI  == rep-pcr characterization and biochemical selection of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the delta area of egypt.
AB  == samples of raw milk and traditional dairy products were collected from different  rural areas in the delta region. 170 isolates from these products were identified using repetitive genomic element-pcr (rep-pcr) fingerprinting. the identified isolates were tested for efficiency of biomass production and separation, acidifying activity, autolytic and aminopeptidase properties, antagonistic activities and exopolysaccharide production. the obtained results revealed that the lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus fermentum, enterococcus faecium lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis were the predominant species in egyptian dairy products. two percent of lactococcus, 10% of lactobacillus and 1% of enterococcus isolates showed fast acidifying activity. aminopeptidase and autolytic properties were generally higher for most lactobacillus strains when compared to other strains. among these species, lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei was the highest in aminopeptidase activity and autolytic properties. antagonistic activity was detected in 40% of lactococcus, 70% of lactobacillus and 50% of enterococcus isolates. some isolates produced exopolysaccharides in milk and dairy products.

AB  == kajmak is an artisanal serbian dairy product made by fermentation of milk fat. overall, 374 bacterial isolates were collected from six kajmak samples of different ages produced in the households located in distinct regions of serbia.  in order to identify lactic acid bacteria present in chosen samples of kajmak, total 349 gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates were analyzed. the recognition of isolates was performed by phenotypic characterization followed by  molecular identification using (gtg)(5)-pcr and sequence analysis of 16s rrna gene. leuconostoc mesenteroides and enterococcus faecium were the most frequently isolated species from kajmak samples. in contrast, leuconostocs and enterococci were found in bgmk3 and bgmk1 kajmak respectively, only after using enrichment technique for isolation suggesting they are present in low numbers in these kajmaks. lactococcus lactis, lactococcus raffinolactis and lactococcus garvieae were also found in those samples but in lower proportion. results showed that lactobacillus plantarum, lb. paracasei and lb. kefiri were the most frequently isolated lactobacillus species in analyzed kajmaks.

AB  == the microbial diversity within alberquilla cheese, made from a spontaneously fermented mixture of raw goats' and sheep's milk in the alpujarra mountains (granada, south-east spain), has been studied by the classical culturing method and also by molecular analysis of community dna. a collection of 206 isolates was obtained from the cheese on different selective/differential media, which were then re-grouped to 52 after randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analyses. isolates on man-rogosa and sharpe-agar (mrs), m17-glucose agar and kenner fecal (kf)-agar medium were identified by specific pcr or 16s rrna gene sequencing and belonged mainly to the lactic-acid bacteria group. the predominant genus was lactobacillus, which accounted for more than 50% of the isolates, the most abundant species being lactobacillus paracasei, followed by considerably less quantities of lb. plantarum and lb. brevis. other lactic-acid bacteria identified were pediococcus urinaequi, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuc. mesenteroides, lactococcus lactis and even the enterococci enterococcus faecium and e. devriesei. cluster analyses of rapd-pcr patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among the lactobacilli. the gram-negative bacterial strains belonged mainly to hafnia alvei species. the microbes occurring in alberquilla cheese were also studied by pcr temporal temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge) of the 16s rrna v3 region and partial 16s rrna sequencing of the ttge bands. the results showed a major presence of lactic-acid bacteria closely related to lc. lactis, lb. paracasei, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. acidophilus and enterococcus sp. the non-lactic-acid bacterium detected was identified as escherichia coli. all the enterococcus strains showed great susceptibility to the most clinically relevant antibiotics, harbouring only the virulence gene efaafm.  on the basis of their antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes we chose two strains of ln. mesenteroides that produced mesenterocin b105 and mesenterocin y105, as revealed by pcr techniques.

TI  == listeria monocytogenes and salmonella spp. in raw milk produced in brazil: occurrence and interference of indigenous microbiota in their isolation and development.
AB  == this study aimed to verify the occurrence of listeria monocytogenes and salmonella spp. in raw milk produced in brazil. on account of the poor microbiological quality of this product, possible interference from the indigenous microbiota in these pathogens was also evaluated. two-hundred and ten  raw milk samples were collected in four important milk-producing areas in brazil, tested for l. monocytogenes and salmonella spp. presence, and for enumeration of  indicator microorganisms: mesophilic aerobes, total coliforms and escherichia coli. the interference of the indigenous microbiota in the isolation procedures was also tested, as well the frequency of naturally occurring raw milk strains with antagonistic activity against both pathogens. the pathogens were not isolated in any raw milk sample, but poor microbiological quality was confirmed by the high levels of indicator microorganisms. when present at high levels, the  indigenous microbiota generated an evident interference in the methodologies of l. monocytogenes and salmonella spp. isolation, mainly when the pathogens appeared at low levels. three-hundred and sixty raw milk strains were tested for  antagonistic activity against both pathogens, and 91 (25.3%) showed inhibitory activity against l. monocytogenes and 33 (9.2%) against salmonella spp. the majority of the antagonistic strains were identified as lactic acid bacteria species, mainly lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and enterococcus faecium, known  by antimicrobial substance production.

AB  == exponential and stationary phase cells of 56 strains of the dairy streptococcus species s. thermophilus, s. macedonicus and s. salivarius, were exposed to acid,  osmotic, oxidative and heat stresses to investigate the diversity of their responses. three strains of dairy related streptococci, lactococcus lactis atcc11454, enterococcus faecium dsm20477 and enterococcus faecalis dsm20478, were included for comparison purposes. acid and heat adaptation and cross-protection to stress were studied in ten strains with different stress response patterns. cell death and the changes in protein expression were evaluated by plate counts and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis, respectively. all  strains of all species were highly tolerant of osmotic stress. with a few exceptions, acid and oxidative treatments reduced the number of viable cells by >5 log units but responses to heat stress were more variable. for some, but not all strains, stationary phase cells were more resistant to some or all stresses.  matrix cluster analysis was used to group strains on the basis of their pattern of stress response in seven clusters. significant associations between the sources of strains and stress resistance were found for acid and oxidative stresses. adaptation to stress during the exponential phase enhanced the survival of acid and heat stressed cells from 1 to 60,000-folds, but a detrimental effect  of adaptation on cell viability was evident for oxidative and osmotic stresses for three strains. adaptation and entry into the stationary phase resulted in significant changes of protein bands whose estimated molecular masses corresponded with those of proteins (dnak, gpre, groel, and groes) involved in the general stress response but no statistically significant correlation between  stress response and band intensity was evident.

AB  == enterococcus faecium it62, isolated from ryegrass in japan, was shown to produce  three different bacteriocins, two of which had molecular masses and amino acid sequences that corresponded to those of enterocin l50a and enterocin l50b. these  peptides existed, however, as chemically modified forms that were either n formylated or n formylated and oxidized at met(24). the third bacteriocin, named  enterocin it, had a molecular mass of 6,390 da, was made up of 54 amino acids, and did not correspond to any known bacteriocin. however, enterocin it was identical to the c-terminal part of the 16-amino-acid-longer bacteriocin 32 (t. inoue, h. tomita, and y. ike, antimicrob. agents chemother., 50:1202-1212, 2006). for the first time, the antimicrobial activity spectra for enterocins l50a and l50b were determined separately and included a wide range of gram-positive bacteria but also a few gram-negative strains that were weakly sensitive. slight  differences in the activities of enterocins l50a and l50b were observed, as gram-positive bacteria showed an overall higher level of sensitivity to l50a than to l50b, as opposed to gram-negative ones. conversely, enterocin it showed a very narrow antimicrobial spectrum that was limited to e. faecium strains, one strain  of bacillus subtilis, and one strain of lactococcus lactis. this study showed that e. faecium it62, a grass-borne strain, produces bacteriocins with very different activity features and structures that may be found in strains associated with food or those of clinical origin, which demonstrates that a particular enterocin structure may be widespread and not related to the producer's origin.

AB  == four italian cheeses (casciotta di urbino, barricato san martino, vento d'estate, and ubriaco di raboso) nonconventionally ripened under different plant materials  (walnut leaves, herbs, hay, and wine by-products, respectively) were compared for compositional, microbiological, biochemical, and volatile profile characteristics. mean values for gross composition were rather similar. because primary starters were not used for manufacture, the endogenous lactic acid bacteria were mainly present (7.0 to 9.0 log10 cfu/g). except for lactobacillus paracasei and leuconostoc mesenteroides, which were commonly identified in 3 cheeses, lactococcus lactis, enterococcus sanguinicola, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus durans/enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum, and weissella  cibaria/weissella confusa were variously found in the 4 cheeses. random amplification of polymorphic dna-pcr analysis showed the biodiversity among the strains, and the species of lactobacilli were in part grouped according to their  origin. as shown by the principal component analysis of reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography data for the ph 4.6-soluble fractions and by the determination of free aa, the secondary proteolysis of barricato san martino and  vento d'estate mainly differed from the other 2 cheeses. purge-and-trap and solid-phase microextraction were coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine volatile compounds. vento d'estate showed the highest levels of almost all chemical classes, and casciotta di urbino was characterized  by a very low level of volatile components. esters, ketones, and terpenes were the chemical classes that mainly differentiated the cheeses. several volatile compounds seemed to be released directly from the plant materials used for ripening, especially terpenes for vento d'estate cheese. the lowest level of volatile free fatty acids was found in casciotta d'urbino, in which rennet paste  was not used during manufacture. the highest concentration of free fatty acids, especially butyric and caproic acids, was found in vento d'estate cheese.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with fish and the fish farm environment, established by amplified rrna gene restriction analysis.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria have become a major source of concern for aquaculture in recent decades. in addition to true pathogenic species of worldwide significance, such as streptococcus iniae and lactococcus garvieae, several species have been reported to produce occasional fish mortalities in limited geographic areas, and  many unidentifiable or ill-defined isolates are regularly isolated from fish or fish products. to clarify the nature and prevalence of different fish-associated  bacteria belonging to the lactic acid bacterium group, a collection of 57 isolates of different origins was studied and compared with a set of 22 type strains, using amplified rrna gene restriction analysis (ardra). twelve distinct  clusters were delineated on the basis of ardra profiles and were confirmed by sequencing of soda and 16s rrna genes. these clusters included the following: lactococcus raffinolactis, l. garvieae, lactococcus l., s. iniae, s. dysgalactiae, s. parauberis, s. agalactiae, carnobacterium spp., the enterococcus "faecium" group, a heterogeneous enterococcus-like cluster comprising indiscernible representatives of vagococcus fluvialis or the recently recognized  v. carniphilus, v. salmoninarum, and aerococcus spp. interestingly, the l. lactis and l. raffinolactis clusters appeared to include many commensals of fish, so opportunistic infections caused by these species cannot be disregarded. the significance for fish populations and fish food processing of three or four genetic clusters of uncertain or complex definition, namely, aerococcus and enterococcus clusters, should be established more accurately.

TI  == molecular identification and diversity of enterococci isolated from slovak bryndza cheese.
AB  == three hundred and eight presumed enterococcal isolates were recovered from bryndza, a soft sheep milk cheese. the cheese samples were obtained from five different commercial distributors in slovakia and were taken at three different seasonal intervals. all isolates were identified to the species level using genotypic tools. species-specific pcr using ddl genes highlighted the predominance of enterococcus faecium (176 isolates) and assigned 50 isolates to the species enterococcus faecalis. the remaining 82 isolates were classified using repetitive element sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with primer (gtg)(5)-(gtg)(5)-pcr, in combination with phenylalanyl-trna synthase gene (phes) sequence analysis and by whole-cell protein analysis (sds-page). these strains were identified as enterococcus durans (59 strains), enterococcus italicus (8 strains), enterococcus casseliflavus (3 strains), enterococcus gallinarum (3 strains), enterococcus hirae (1 strain), and 8 strains were members of the species lactococcus lactis. of the seven enterococcal species isolated, three of them, e. durans, e. faecalis and e. faecium were present in all samples  studied, with e. faecium as the predominant one. the precise identification of enterococci in bryndza cheese is an essential step in the process of evaluation of their functional properties which will be further studied and assessed.

TI  == application of single strand conformation polymorphism --pcr method for distinguishing cheese bacterial communities that inhibit listeria monocytogenes.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the microbial communities of different cheeses where listeria monocytogenes either grew or did not grow. for this purpose, (i) isolates from the most inhibitory cheese ecosystem were identified and their ability to produce anti-listeria substances was determined, (ii) bacterial communities of cheeses with and without l. monocytogenes growth were compared using the single strand conformation polymorphism method. the study showed sscp to be an effective tool for differentiating between the bacterial communities of different cheeses manufactured with the same technology. all the cheeses with the lowest l. monocytogenes counts on day 8 were distinguished by the dominance in their sscp profiles, after amplification of the v2 region of the 16s rrna gene, of 3 peaks whose nucleotide sequences comigrated with enterococcus faecium and enterococcus saccharominimus, chryseobacterium sp and corynebacterium flavescens, lactococcus garvieae and lactococcus lactis respectively. however, no anti-listeria compounds were produced under our experimental conditions. these six bacterial species were inoculated, separately or together, into pasteurised milk and their anti-listerial activity in cheese was evaluated. the area of inhibition between the control and trial curves confirmed that l. monocytogenes is inhibited by e. saccharominimus, c. flavescens, l. lactis, l. garvieae and the mixture of all six bacterial strains. further studies should be performed to determine the metabolites involved in l. monocytogenes inhibition.

TI  == partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by human lactococcus lactis and pediococccus acidilactici isolates.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to isolate bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (lab) from human intestine. methods and results: a total of 111 lab were isolated from human adult stool and screened for their bacteriocin production. neutralized cell-free supernatants from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis mm19 and pediococcus acidilactici mm33 showed antimicrobial activity. the antimicrobials in the supernatant from a culture of l. lactis inhibited enterococcus faecium, various species of lactobacillus and staphylococcus aureus; while those in the supernatant from a culture of p. acidilactici inhibited enterococcus spp., some lactobacilli and various serotypes of listeria monocytogenes. the antimicrobial metabolites were heat-stable and were active over a ph range of 2-10. the antimicrobial activities of the supernatants of both bacteria were inhibited by many proteases but not by catalase. the plate overlay assay allowed an approximation of size between 3.5 and 6 kda for both antimicrobial substances. conclusions: as the antagonistic factor(s) produced by l. lactis mm19 and p. acidilactici mm33 were sensitive to proteolytic enzymes, it could be hypothesized that bacteriocins were involved in the inhibitory activities. inhibition spectrum and biochemical analysis showed that these bacteria produced two distinct bacteriocins. significance and impact of the study: we are the first to isolate bacteriocin-producing strains of pediococcus and lactococcus from human intestine. these strains might be useful for control of enteric pathogens.

TI  == characterization of microflora in homemade semi-hard white zlatar cheese.
AB  == the zlatar cheese belongs to the group of traditionally homemade cheeses, which are produced from nonpasteurized cow's milk, without adding of any bacterial starter culture. changes were followed in lactic acid bacteria population and chemical composition during the ripening period of cheese up to 60 days. results  showed that the percentage of lactic acid cocci was higher in raw milk and one day old cheese and their percentage was gradually decreasing, whereas the number  of lactobacilli was increasing. after 30 days of cheese ripening the number of cocci increased again, reaching the number of lactobacilli. the results of api 50 ch system and rep-pcr analysis showed that lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, lactobacillus brevis, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, enterococcuus  faecium and enterococcus faecalis were the main groups present during the ripening of zlatar cheese. results revealed that in older cheeses (45 and 60 days old) enterococci were the main group present. it was also demonstrated that 57 isolates showed antimicrobial activity. the number of bacteria showing antimicrobial activity slowly decreased during the ripening period and in samples of 60 days old cheese producers of antimicrobial activities were not detected.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity in enterococcus isolates from batzos, a raw goat milk cheese.
AB  == this study investigated the genotypic and phenotypic diversity in 34 isolates of  enterococci obtained during ripening of batzos cheese from raw goat milk and characterized phenotypically as enterococcus durans. rapd-pcr, plasmid profiling  and pfge were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. species recognition by means of rapd-pcr was in agreement with  the phenotypic identification for 29 strains. one strain was characterized as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis by rapd-pcr and four strains were grouped with the enterococcus faecium reference strain. all strains were vancomycin sensitive, while 10 strains showed beta-haemolytic reaction on human blood and the majority  of them (88.9%) showed decarboxylase activity on tyramine. all strains exhibited  antagonistic activity against bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and listeria monocytogenes and the majority inhibited enterococcus faecalis. isolates displayed weak acidifying ability and low proteolytic activities when grown in milk for 24h. however, their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk  for seven days was significant with preference for alphas-casein degradation.

TI  == high-level heterologous production and functional expression of the sec-dependent enterocin p from enterococcus faecium p13 in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == enterocin p (entp), a sec-dependent bacteriocin from enterococcus faecium p13, was produced by lactococcus lactis. the entp structural gene (entp) with or without the entp immunity gene (entip) was cloned in (1), plasmid pmg36c under control of the lactococcal constitutive promoter p32, (2) in plasmid png8048e under control of the inducible pnisa promoter, and (3) in the integration vector  pint29. introduction of the recombinant vectors in l. lactis resulted in production of biologically active entp in the supernatants of l. lactis subsp. lactis il1403 and l. lactis subsp. cremoris nz9000, and the coproduction of nisin a and entp in l. lactis subsp. lactis dpc5598. the level of production of entp, detected and quantified by specific anti-entp antibodies and a noncompetitive indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, by the recombinant l. lactis strains  depended on the host strain, the expression vector, and the presence of the entip gene in the constructs of the recombinant l. lactis strains. the highest amount of entp was produced with derivatives containing entp and entip, for both l. lactis il1403 and l. lactis nz9000. these derivatives produced up to five- to six-fold more entp than e. faecium p13. mass spectrometry analysis revealed that  entp purified from l. lactis il1403 (pjp214) has a molecular mass identical to that purified from e. faecium p13, suggesting that the synthesis, processing, and secretion of entp progresses efficiently in recombinant l. lactis hosts.

TI  == phenotypic identification and technological properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditionally processed fish products of the eastern himalayas.
AB  == sukako maacha, gnuchi, sidra and sukuti are traditional smoked and sun-dried fish products of the eastern himalayan regions of nepal and india. a total of 40 samples of sukako maacha (14), gnuchi (6), sidra (10) and sukuti (10) were collected and were analysed for microbial load. population of lactic acid bacteria (lab) as well as aerobic mesophilic counts ranged from 4.7-8.3 to 5.1-8.5 log cfu g(-1), respectively. a total of 189 strains of lab were isolated  from sukako maacha, gnuchi, sidra and sukuti samples, out of which 171 strains were cocci and 15 strains, were heterofermentative lactobacilli. lab were identified on the basis of phenotypic characters including api system as lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactococcus plantarum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, pediococcus pentosaceus and weissella confusa. lab strains produced a wide spectrum of enzymes. some strains of lab showed antagonistic properties against pathogenic strains. none of the strains produced biogenic amines in the method applied. this paper is the first report on the microbial composition, mostly lactic acid bacteria, of traditionally processed fish products of eastern  himalayas.

AB  == the presence of lactic acid bacteria (lab) during shochu fermentation was monitored by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and by bacteriological culturing. no lab were detected from fermented mashes by pcr-dgge using a universal bacterial pcr primer set. however, pcr-dgge using a new primer  specific for the 16s rdna of lactococcus, streptococcus, tetragenococcus, enterococcus, and vagococcus and two primers specific for the 16s rdna of lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella revealed that enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus nagelii, lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and weissella cibaria inhabited in shochu mashes. it was also found that the lab community composition during shochu fermentation changed after the main ingredient and water were added during the fermentation process. therefore, we confirmed that pcr-dgge using all three primers specific for groups of lab together was well suited to the study of the lab diversity in shochu mashes. the results of dgge profiles were similar to the results of bacteriological culturing. in conclusion, lab are present during shochu fermentation but not dominant.

AB  == real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) was used to quantify seven species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in alfalfa silage prepared in the presence or absence of four commercial inoculants and in uninoculated corn stover harvested and stored under a variety of field conditions. species-specific pcr primers were designed based on reca gene sequences. commercial inoculants improved the quality of alfalfa silage, but species corresponding to those in the inoculants displayed variations in persistence over the next 96 h. lactobacillus brevis was the most abundant lab (12 to 32% of total sample dna) in all of the alfalfa silages by 96  h. modest populations (up to 10%) of lactobacillus plantarum were also observed in inoculated silages. pediococcus pentosaceus populations increased over time but did not exceed 2% of the total. small populations (0.1 to 1%) of lactobacillus buchneri and lactococcus lactis were observed in all silages, while lactobacillus pentosus and enterococcus faecium were near or below detection limits. corn stover generally displayed higher populations of l. plantarum and l. brevis and lower populations of other lab species. the data illustrate the utility of rt-pcr for quantifying individual species of lab in conserved forages  prepared under a wide variety of conditions.

TI  == the n-terminal domain of enterococcal surface protein, esp, is sufficient for esp-mediated biofilm enhancement in enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == enterococci have emerged as one of the leading causes of nosocomial bloodstream,  surgical site, and urinary tract infections. more recently, enterococci have been associated with biofilms, which are bacterial communities attached to a surface and encased in an extracellular polymeric matrix. the enterococcal cell surface-associated protein, esp, enhances biofilm formation by enterococcus faecalis in a glucose-dependent manner. mature esp consists of a nonrepeat n-terminal domain and a central region made up of two types of tandem repeats followed by a c-terminal membrane-spanning and anchor domain. this study was undertaken to localize the specific domain(s) of esp that plays a role in esp-mediated biofilm enhancement. to achieve this objective, we constructed in-frame deletion mutants expressing truncated forms of esp in an isogenic background. by comparing strains expressing the mutant forms of esp to those expressing wild-type esp, we found that the strain expressing esp lacking the n-terminal domain formed biofilms that were quantitatively less in biovolume than the strain expressing wild-type esp. furthermore, an e. faecalis strain expressing only the n-terminal domain of esp fused to a heterologous protein anchor formed biofilms that were quantitatively similar to those formed by a strain expressing full-length esp. this suggested that the minimal region contributing to esp-mediated biofilm enhancement in e. faecalis was confined to the nonrepeat n-terminal domain. expression of full-length e. faecalis esp in heterologous host systems of esp-deficient lactococcus lactis and enterococcus faecium did not enhance biofilm formation as was observed for e. faecalis. these  results suggest that esp may require interaction with an additional e. faecalis-specific factor(s) to result in biofilm enhancement.

AB  == the effect of high-pressure (hp) treatments combined with bacteriocins of lactic  acid bacteria (lab) produced in situ on the survival of escherichia coli o157:h7  in cheese was investigated. cheeses were manufactured from raw milk inoculated with e. coli o157:h7 at approximately 10(5) cfu/ml. seven different bacteriocin-producing lab were added at approximately 10(6) cfu/ml as adjuncts to the starter. cheeses were pressurized on day 2 or 50 at 300 mpa for 10 min or 500 mpa for 5 min, at 10 degrees c in both cases. after 60 days, e. coli o157:h7 counts in cheeses manufactured without bacteriocin-producing lab and not pressurized were 5.1 log cfu/g. a higher inactivation of e. coli o157:h7 was achieved in cheeses without bacteriocin-producing lab when 300 mpa was applied on day 50 (3.8-log-unit reduction) than if applied on day 2 (1.3-log-unit reduction). application of 500 mpa eliminated e. coli o157:h7 in 60-day-old cheeses. cheeses made with bacteriocin-producing lab and not pressurized showed a slight reduction of the pathogen. pressurization at 300 mpa on day 2 and addition of lacticin 481-, nisin a-, bacteriocin tab 57-, or enterocin as-48-producing lab were synergistic and reduced e. coli o157:h7 counts to levels below 2 log units in 60-day-old cheeses. pressurization at 300 mpa on day 50 and addition of nisin  a-, bacteriocin tab 57-, enterocin i-, or enterocin as-48-producing lab completely inactivated e. coli o157:h7 in 60-day-old cheeses. the application of  reduced pressures combined with bacteriocin-producing lab is a feasible procedure to improve cheese safety.

AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == microarray-based detection of 90 antibiotic resistance genes of gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == homofermentative lactic acid bacteria of a traditional cheese, comlek peyniri from cappadocia region.
AB  == comlek peyniri is a typical artisanal cheese in central anatolia. this type of cheese was made by using the indigenous lactic acid bacteria (lab) flora of cow or ewes' milk. majority of the samples were taken from fresh cheese because the aim was to isolate homofermentative lab. initially 661 microbial isolates were obtained from 17 cheese samples. only 107 were found to be homofermentative lab.  these isolates were selected and identified by using both phenotypic and molecular methods. phenotypic identification included curd formation from skim milk, catalase test, gram staining and light microscopy, growth at different temperatures and salt concentrations, arginine hydrolysis, gas production from glucose, and carbohydrate fermentation. molecular identification was based on the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) of  the 16s rrna gene-its (internally transcribed spacer) region. by combining the phenotypic and molecular identification results, isolates belonging to each of the following genera were determined at species or subspecies level: 54 lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, 21 enterococcus faecium, 3 ec. faecalis, 2 ec.  durans, 10 ec. sp., 15 lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, and 2 lb. casei  strains. technological characterisation was also performed by culturing each of the strains in uht skim milk, and by monitoring ph change and lactic acid production at certain time intervals through the 24 h incubation. results of the  technological characterisation indicated that 33% of the isolates (35 strains) were capable of lowering the ph of uht milk below 5.3 after 6 h incubation at 30  degrees c. thirty four of these strains were lc. lactis subsp. lactis, and only one was an ec. faecium strain.

TI  == antimicrobial potential of immobilized lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis atcc 11454 against selected bacteria.

AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == indigenous raw milk microbiota influences the bacterial development in traditional cheese from an alpine natural park.
AB  == nostrano di primiero is a 6-month ripened cheese produced from raw milk collected in the paneveggio-pale di san martino natural park area in the italian dolomites. in summer, this cheese is made using milk collected from two different areas, passo rolle and vanoi, in the paneveggio natural park. during the experiment, the milk from the two areas was separately processed, and cheeses were made in the same cheese factory using the same technological process. the microbiota of raw milk and cheeses of the two areas was isolated and the dominant population was monitored by rapd analysis and identified by 16s rrna sequence. the milk of the passo rolle area was mainly composed of mesophilic strains, thermophilic streptococcus thermophilus, and low amounts of enterococci were also found; the milk of the vanoi area was dominated by mesophilic microbiota mostly lactococcus  lactis ssp. cremoris and ssp. lactis and lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei.  the plating of the natural starter culture revealed the presence of a relevant community of thermophilic cocci and lower amounts of enterococci. the dynamic population analysis showed the importance of the natural starter culture in the first 2 days of cheese ripening in both cheeses. moreover, the large biodiversity observed in the raw milks was also detected in the cheeses during ripening. the vanoi cheese was dominated by enterococcus faecium and streptococcus macedonicus  in the first two days and mesophilic 21 lb. paracasei ssp. paracasei became the most represented population after 15 days of ripening. in the first few days, the rolle cheese was characterized by being mainly composed of thermophilic s. macedonicus and s. thermophilus and secondarily by mesophilic cocci. during ripening, the microbiota composition changed, and at 15 days, mesophilic lactobacilli were the dominant population, but later, this was mainly composed of mesophilic cocci and lactobacilli. the taxonomical identification by 16s rrna sequence confirmed a large biodiversity related to raw milk microbiota and only five strains of s. macedonicus, lactobacillus plantarum, 21 lb. paracasei ssp. paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum and e. faecium were detected in both cheeses.

TI  == generation and utilization of polyclonal antibodies to a synthetic c-terminal amino acid fragment of divercin v41, a class iia bacteriocin.
AB  == polyclonal antibodies have been generated by immunization of rabbits with a chemically synthesized c-terminal part of divercin v41 (dvnct) conjugated to the  carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin (klh). the sensitivity and reactivity of the dvnct-klh-generated antibodies were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using supernatant from cultures of 13 representative  lactic acid bacterium strains, and specificity was confirmed by western blot analysis. anti-dvnct-klh antibodies were able to recognize not only divercin v41  but also enterocin p and piscicocin v1b, two other members of the class iia bacteriocins. production and activity of dvnv41 were evaluated by elisa and activity tests during the growth of carnobacterium divergens v41 in mrs medium containing or not containing tween 80. divercin v41, enterocin p, and piscicocin  v1b were therefore purified by a single-step immunoaffinity chromatography method using a sepharose matrix cnbr-activated directed binding of anti-dvnct-klh polyclonal antibodies.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

TI  == the screening of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactic acid bacteria and their application to inactivating psychrotrophic food-borne pathogens.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were isolated from various food samples and evaluated for hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) production. cells suspended in 0.5% (wt/vol) glucose plus 0.5% (wt/vol) lactate (ph 7.0) were incubated for 5 h at 37 degrees c under  aeration. among 193 strains, 27 strains accumulated 201-300 ppm h2o2, and 4 strains accumulated more than 301 ppm h2o2 in the cell suspensions. among the 9 high-level h2o2-producing strains, 8 strains were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. the cell-free filtrate from lc. lactis subsp. lactis ai 62, which contained approximately 350 ppm h2o2, was evaluated for antimicrobial activity against enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, listeria ivanovii, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, and aeromonas hydrophila. after 1 h incubation at 30 degrees c in the cell-free filtrate, the initial viable cell counts of the target bacteria (5.53-6.00 log cfu/ml) were reduced by 0.12-5.00 log units, except in the case of enterococci. the sensitivity varied with the bacterial species and ph. the enterococci were resistant to the treatment. our results show that h2o2 accumulated by lactic acid bacteria in a cell suspension is very effective in reducing the viable cell count of food-borne pathogens.

TI  == bacterial community dynamics during production of registered designation of origin salers cheese as evaluated by 16s rrna gene single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis.
AB  == microbial dynamics during processing and ripening of traditional cheeses such as  registered designation of origin salers cheese, an artisanal cheese produced in france, play an important role in the elaboration of sensory qualities. the aim of the present study was to obtain a picture of the dynamics of the microbial ecosystem of rdo salers cheese by using culture-independent methods. this included dna extraction, pcr, and single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp)  analysis. bacterial and high-gc% gram-positive bacterial primers were used to amplify v2 or v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene. sscp patterns revealed changes during the manufacturing of the cheese. patterns of the ecosystems of cheeses that were provided by three farmers were also quite different. cloning and sequencing of the 16s rrna gene revealed sequences related to lactic acid bacteria (lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus pentosus), which were predominant during manufacturing and ripening. bacteria belonging to the high-gc% gram-positive group (essentially corynebacteria) were found by using specific primers. the present molecular approach can effectively describe the ecosystem of artisanal dairy products.

TI  == esterolytic and lipolytic activities of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ewe's  milk and cheese.
AB  == in the present work, we report on the esterase and lipase activities of lactic acid bacteria representing the genera lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, and enterococcus isolated from ewe's milk and cheeses. esterase activity was studied using alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 12 carbon atoms and postelectrophoretic detection. the lactic acid bacteria evaluated had intracellular esterase activities, which preferentially degraded the alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 6 carbon atoms. by studying postelectrophoretic patterns, it was found that some strains presented more than one esterase. lactobacillus plantarum o236 showed four enzymes that hydrolyze carboxyl ester linkages with different specificity. lipase activity was studied in intracellular and extracellular fractions using tributyrin, tricaprylin, triolein, and milk fat as substrates. the intracellular and extracellular fractions of leuconostoc mesenteroides o257, lactobacillus plantarum o236, and lactobacillus acidophilus o177 were able to hydrolyze tributyrin. l. plantarum o186, l. acidophilus o252, enterococcus faecium o174 and o426, and enterococcus faecalis ov409 showed lipase activity associated with the intracellular fraction on tributyrin. lactococcus lactis o233, l. plantarum o155, and lactobacillus casei o190 did not hydrolyze triglycerides. not all strains that showed esterase activity exhibited high activity on triglycerides. esterase and lipase activities were species- and strain-specific. wide variations in activity between strains highlight the need for selecting appropriate starters to produce enzyme-modified cheese as well as accelerated ripened cheese.

TI  == an enterococcus faecalis abc homologue (lsa) is required for the resistance of this species to clindamycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis isolates are resistant to clindamycin (cli) and quinupristin-dalfopristin (q-d), and this is thought to be a species characteristic. disruption of a gene (abc-23, now designated lsa, for "lincosamide and streptogramin a resistance") of e. faecalis was associated with  a > or =40-fold decrease in mics of q-d (to 0.75 microg/ml), cli (to 0.12 to 0.5  microg/ml), and dalfopristin (dal) (to 4 to 8 microg/ml) for the wild-type e. faecalis parental strain (q-d mic, 32 microg/ml; cli mic, 32 to 48 microg/ml; dal mic, 512 microg/ml). complementation of the disruption mutant with lsa on a shuttle plasmid resulted in restoration of the mics of cli, q-d, and dal to wild-type levels. under high-stringency conditions, lsa was found in 180 of 180 isolates of e. faecalis but in none of 189 other enterococci. among 19 erm(b)-lacking enterococcus faecium strains, 9 (47%) were highly susceptible to cli (mic, 0.06 to 0.25 microg/ml) and had dal mics of 4 to 16 microg/ml; for the  remaining erm(b)-lacking e. faecium strains, the cli and dal mics were 4 to > 256 and 2 to > 128 microg/ml, respectively. in contrast, none of 32 erm(b)-lacking e. faecalis strains were susceptible (cli mic range, 16 to 32 microg/ml; dal mic range, > or =32 microg/ml). when lsa was introduced into an e. faecium strain initially susceptible to cli, the mics of cli and dal increased > or =60-fold and that of q-d increased 6-fold (to 3 to 6 microg/ml). introduction of lsa into two  dal-resistant (mics, > 128 microg/ml), q-d-susceptible (mics, 0.5 and 1.5 microg/ml) e. faecium strains (cli mics, 12 and >256 microg/ml) resulted in an increase in the q-d mics from 3- to 10-fold (to 8 and >32 microg/ml), respectively. although efflux was not studied, the similarity (41 to 64%) of the  predicted lsa protein to abc proteins such as vga(a), vga(b), and msr(a) of staphylococcus aureus and yjca of lactococcus lactis and the presence of walker a and b atp-binding motifs suggest that this resistance may be related to efflux of these antibiotics. in conclusion, lsa appears to be an intrinsic gene of e. faecalis that explains the characteristic resistance of this species to cli and q-d.

TI  == extracellular arginine aminopeptidase from streptococcus gordonii fss2.
AB  == streptococcus gordonii is a primary etiological agent in the development of subacute bacterial endocarditis (sbe), producing thrombus formation and tissue damage on the surfaces of heart valves. this is ironic, considering its normal role as a benign inhabitant of the oral microflora. however, strain fss2 of s. gordonii has been found to produce several extracellular aminopeptidase- and fibrinogen-degrading activities during growth in a ph-controlled batch culture. in this report, we describe the purification, characterization, and partial cloning of a predicted serine class arginine aminopeptidase (rap) with some cysteine class characteristics. isolation of this enzyme by anion-exchange, gel filtration, and isoelectric focusing chromatography yielded a protein monomer of  approximately 70 kda, as shown by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization, gel filtration, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. nested-pcr cloning enabled the isolation of a 324-bp-long dna fragment encoding the 108-amino-acid n terminus of rap. culture activity profiles and n-terminal sequence analysis indicated the export of this protein from the cell surface. homology was found with a putative dipeptidase from streptococcus pyogenes and nonspecific dipeptidases from lactobacillus helveticus and lactococcus lactis. we believe that rap may serve as a critical factor for arginine acquisition during nutrient stress in vivo and also in the proteolysis of host proteins and peptides during sbe pathology.

TI  == efficacy of nisin in combination with protective cultures against listeria monocytogenes scott a in tofu.
AB  == nisin can be used as a biopreservative to control growth of listeria monocytogenes in various minimally processed foods. tofu is an example of a non-fermented soybean product, which may allow growth of listeria at refrigeration temperatures and in which nisin may be applied to prevent multiplication of listeria. the efficacy of nisin against listeria may be compromised by the emergence of spontaneous nisin-resistant mutants. exposure of  l. monocytogenes scott a to nisin in a culture medium or in a food product results in an initial reduction of listeria population which is followed by regrowth of survivors to nisin during further incubation. in vitro studies using  standard i nutrient broth showed that enterococcus faecium bfe 900-6a and lactobacillus sakei lb 706-1a used as protective cultures in combination with nisin were able to suppress proliferation of listeria cells not killed by nisin at 10 degrees c. growth and bacteriocin production of these two strains and a third protective culture, lactococcus lactis bfe 902 was also observed in soymilk and tofu at 10 degrees c. inoculation studies with tofu prepared with nisin and protective cultures showed that lower amounts of nisin are required for an effective inhibition of l. monocytogenes scott a when either e. faecium bfe 900-6a or lc. lactis bfe 902 are used in addition. the combination of nisin with  these bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (lab) resulted in a complete suppression of listerial growth in homemade tofu stored at 10 degrees c for 1 week. lb. sakei lb 706-1a was less effective and did not prevent a slight increase of l. monocytogenes scott a numbers during storage.

AB  == the effects of bacteriocins produced by six strains of lactic acid bacteria on 9  mesophilic and 11 thermophilic commercial starter cultures were investigated in mixed cultures of commercial starters with bacteriocin-producing strains in milk. the bacteriocins produced by the test organisms were nisin a, nisin z, lacticin 481, enterocin as-48, a novel enterocin, and a novel plantaricin. mesophilic commercial starters were in most cases tolerant of bacteriocins, with only two of the starters being partially inhibited, one by four and the other by two bacteriocins. the aminopeptidase activities of mesophilic starters were generally low, and only one of the combinations of mesophilic starter-bacteriocin producer  gave double the aminopeptidase activity of the starter culture without the bacteriocin producer. thermophilic commercial starters were more sensitive to bacteriocins than mesophilic starters, with six thermophilic starters being partially inhibited by at least one of the bacteriocins. their aminopeptidase activities were generally higher than those of the mesophilic starters. the aminopeptidase activities of seven thermophilic starters were increased in the presence of bacteriocins, by factors of up to 9.0 as compared with the corresponding starter cultures alone. bacteriocin-producing strains may be used as adjunct cultures to mesophilic starters for the inhibition of pathogens in soft and semihard cheeses, because mesophilic starters are rather tolerant of bacteriocins. bacteriocin producers may also be used as adjunct cultures to thermophilic starters of high aminopeptidase activity, more sensitive to lysis by bacteriocins than mesophilic starters, for the acceleration of ripening in semihard and hard cheeses.

TI  == evidence for horizontal gene transfer in evolution of elongation factor tu in enterococci.
AB  == the elongation factor tu, encoded by tuf genes, is a gtp binding protein that plays a central role in protein synthesis. one to three tuf genes per genome are  present, depending on the bacterial species. most low-g+c-content gram-positive bacteria carry only one tuf gene. we have designed degenerate pcr primers derived from consensus sequences of the tuf gene to amplify partial tuf sequences from 17 enterococcal species and other phylogenetically related species. the amplified dna fragments were sequenced either by direct sequencing or by sequencing cloned  inserts containing putative amplicons. two different tuf genes (tufa and tufb) were found in 11 enterococcal species, including enterococcus avium, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus dispar, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus malodoratus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus pseudoavium, and enterococcus raffinosus. for  the other six enterococcal species (enterococcus cecorum, enterococcus columbae,  enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus sulfureus, enterococcus saccharolyticus, and  enterococcus solitarius), only the tufa gene was present. based on 16s rrna gene  sequence analysis, the 11 species having two tuf genes all have a common ancestor, while the six species having only one copy diverged from the enterococcal lineage before that common ancestor. the presence of one or two copies of the tuf gene in enterococci was confirmed by southern hybridization. phylogenetic analysis of tuf sequences demonstrated that the enterococcal tufa gene branches with the bacillus, listeria, and staphylococcus genera, while the enterococcal tufb gene clusters with the genera streptococcus and lactococcus. primary structure analysis showed that four amino acid residues encoded within the sequenced regions are conserved and unique to the enterococcal tufb genes and the tuf genes of streptococci and lactococcus lactis. the data suggest that an ancestral streptococcus or a streptococcus-related species may have horizontally  transferred a tuf gene to the common ancestor of the 11 enterococcal species which now carry two tuf genes.

TI  == heterologous coproduction of enterocin a and pediocin pa-1 by lactococcus lactis: detection by specific peptide-directed antibodies.
AB  == antibodies against enterocin a were obtained by immunization of rabbits with synthetic peptides ph4 and ph5 designed, respectively, on the n- and c-terminal amino acid sequences of enterocin a and conjugated to the carrier protein klh. anti-ph4-klh antibodies not only recognized enterocin a but also pediocin pa-1, enterocin p, and sakacin a, three bacteriocins which share the n-terminal class iia consensus motif (ygngvxc) that is contained in the sequence of the peptide ph4. in contrast, anti-ph5-klh antibodies only reacted with enterocin a because the amino acid sequences of the c-terminal parts of class iia bacteriocins are highly variable. enterocin a and/or pediocin pa-1 structural and immunity genes were introduced in lactococcus lactis il1403 to achieve (co)production of the bacteriocins. the level of production of the two bacteriocins was significantly lower than that obtained by the wild-type producers, a fact that suggests a low efficiency of transport and/or maturation of these bacteriocins by the chromosomally encoded bacteriocin translocation machinery of il1403. despite the  low production levels, both bacteriocins could be specifically detected and quantified with the anti-ph5-klh (anti-enterocin a) antibodies isolated in this study and the anti-ph2-klh (anti-pediocin pa-1) antibodies previously generated (j. m. martinez, m. i. martinez, a. m. suarez, c. herranz, p. casaus, l. m. cintas, j. m. rodriguez, and p. e. hernandez, appl. environ. microbiol. 64:4536-4545, 1998). in this work, the availability of antibodies for the specific detection and quantification of enterocin a and pediocin pa-1 was crucial to demonstrate coproduction of both bacteriocins by l. lactis il1403(pjm04), because indicator strains that are selectively inhibited by each bacteriocin are not available.

TI  == simple method to identify bacteriocin induction peptides and to auto-induce bacteriocin production at low cell density.
AB  == the production of some bacteriocins by lactic acid bacteria is regulated by induction peptides (ips) that are secreted by a dedicated secretion system. the ip gene cbax, for carnobacteriocin a production by carnobacterium piscicola lv17a, and a presumptive ip gene (orf6), associated with the genetic locus for enterocin b production in enterococcus faecium bfe 900, were fused to the signal  peptide of the bacteriocin divergicin a from carnobacterium divergens lv13 to access the general secretory pathway. the culture supernatants of c. piscicola ual26 and lactococcus lactis mg1363 containing either of these constructs were used to induce bacteriocin production by bac(-) cultures of c. piscicola lv17a or e. faecium ctc492. the cbax fusion product induced bacteriocin production by bac(-) c. piscicola lv17a, but the orf6 fusion product did not induce bacteriocin production by e. faecium ctc492. this represents a relatively simple method of confirming the role of presumptive ips. the transformation of c. piscicola lv17a  with the cbax gene under expression of the p32 promoter from l. lactis resulted in constitutive production of bacteriocin by either the dedicated transport apparatus or the general secretory pathway.

TI  == p45, an extracellular 45 kda protein of listeria monocytogenes with similarity to protein p60 and exhibiting peptidoglycan lytic activity.
AB  == a monoclonal antibody obtained by immunization of mice with heat-killed cells of  listeria monocytogenes serotype 4d showed reactivity towards a protein (p45) from l. monocytogenes with an apparent molecular mass of 45 kda. this protein was detected in the culture supernatant and at the cell surface of l. monocytogenes.  proteins cross-reacting with the monoclonal antibody were present in all listeria strains investigated, except l. grayi. the structural gene was cloned in escherichia coli and sequenced. translation of the gene starts at a ttg initiation codon. the gene was found to code for a protein of 402 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 42.7 kda. it has a signal peptide of  27 amino acid residues, resulting in a molecular mass for the mature polypeptide  of 39.9 kda. protein database searches showed that this protein has 55% similarity and 38% identity to protein p60 of l. monocytogenes and exhibits significant sequence similarities to p54 from enterococcus faecium and usp45 from lactococcus lactis. p45 was shown to have peptidoglycan lytic activity and the encoding gene was named spl (secreted protein with lytic property).

TI  == on the microbiological profile of traditional portuguese sourdough.
AB  == traditional manufacture of bread from maize has been noted to play important roles from both economic and social standpoints; however, enforcement of increasingly strict hygiene standards requires thorough knowledge of the adventitious microbiota of the departing dough. to this goal, sourdough as well as maize and rye flours from several geographic locations and in two different periods within the agricultural year were assayed for their microbiota in sequential steps of quantification and identification. more than 400 strains were isolated and taxonomic differentiation between them was via biomerieux api galleries (375 of which were successfully identified) following preliminary biochemical and morphological screening. the dominant groups were yeasts and lactic acid bacteria (lab). the most frequently isolated yeasts were saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida pelliculosa. the most frequently isolated lab were (heterofermentative) leuconostoc spp. and (homofermentative) lactobacillus spp.; l. brevis, l. curvatus, and l. lactis ssp. lactis were the dominant species for the lactobacillus genera; lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis for lactococci; enterococcus casseliflavus, e. durans, and e. faecium for enterococci; and streptococcus constellantus and s. equinus for streptococci.

TI  == characterization and heterologous expression of the genes encoding enterocin a production, immunity, and regulation in enterococcus faecium dpc1146.
AB  == enterocin a is a small, heat-stable, antilisterial bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium dpc1146. the sequence of a 10, 879-bp chromosomal region containing at least 12 open reading frames (orfs), 7 of which are predicted to play a role in enterocin biosynthesis, is presented. the genes enta, enti, and entf encode the enterocin a prepeptide, the putative immunity protein, and the induction factor prepeptide, respectively. the deduced proteins entk and entr resemble the histidine kinase and response regulator proteins of two-component signal transducing systems of the agrc-agra type. the predicted proteins entt and entd are homologous to abc (atp-binding cassette) transporters and accessory factors, respectively, of several other bacteriocin systems and to proteins implicated in the signal-sequence-independent export of escherichia coli hemolysin a. immediately downstream of the entt and entd genes are two orfs, the  product of one of which, orf4, is very similar to the product of the ytei gene of bacillus subtilis and to e. coli protease iv, a signal peptide peptidase known to be involved in outer membrane lipoprotein export. another potential bacteriocin is encoded in the opposite direction to the other genes in the enterocin cluster. this putative bacteriocin-like peptide is similar to lafx, one of the components  of the lactacin f complex. a deletion which included one of two direct repeats upstream of the enta gene abolished enterocin a activity, immunity, and ability to induce bacteriocin production. transposon insertion upstream of the entf gene  also had the same effect, but this mutant could be complemented by exogenously supplied induction factor. the putative enti peptide was shown to be involved in  the immunity to enterocin a. cloning of a 10.5-kb amplicon comprising all predicted orfs and regulatory regions resulted in heterologous production of enterocin a and induction factor in enterococcus faecalis, while a four-gene construct (entaitd) under the control of a constitutive promoter resulted in heterologous enterocin a production in both e. faecalis and lactococcus lactis.

TI  == heterogeneity of plant-associated streptococci as characterized by phenotypic features and restriction analysis of pcr-amplified 16s rdna.
AB  == thirty-five strains of streptococci isolated from forage grasses were examined by restriction analysis of pcr-amplified 16s rdna. using a set of seven endonucleases, five 16s rdna genotypes were obtained. the isolates could be identified as belonging to the species enterococcus faecium, ent. mundtii, ent. faecalis, ent. casseliflavus and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, respectively. to assign the isolates to one of these species, digestion with the endonuclease hinfi was sufficient. data obtained from whole-cell protein analysis were in accordance with the species identification. additionally, three of the five species found were subdivided into two related subgroups. both methods are suitable for a rapid and unequivocal identification of plant-associated streptococci. the phenotypic characters showed a high diversity and were in some  cases contrary to the expected features usually given in genus and species descriptions. the results demonstrated the close relatedness of the determined species in contrast to their high phenotypic heterogeneity.

TI  == isolation and characterization of nisin-producing lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis from bean-sprouts.
AB  == bacterial isolates from bean-sprouts were screened for anti-listeria monocytogenes bacteriocins using a well diffusion method. thirty-four of 72 isolates inhibited the growth of l. monocytogenes scott a. one, hpb 1688, which had the biggest inhibition zone against l. monocytogenes scott a, was selected for subsequent analysis. both ribotyping and dna sequencing of 16s ribosomal rna  gene demonstrated that the isolate was lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing revealed that the genomic dna of the bean-sprout isolates contained a nisin z structural gene. in mrs broth, bean-sprout isolate hpb 1688 survived at 3-4.5 degrees c for at least 20 d, grew  at 4 degrees c and produced anti-listerial compounds at 5 degrees c. when co-cultured with l. monocytogenes in mrs broth, the isolate inhibited the growth  of l. monocytogenes at 4 degrees c after 14 d and at 10 degrees c after 2 d. when co-inoculated with 10(2) cells g-1 of l. monocytogenes on fresh-cut ready-to-eat  caesar salad, l. lactis subsp. lactis (10(8) cells g-1) was able to reduce the number of l. monocytogenes by 1-1.4 logs after storage for 10 d at 7 zero and 10  degrees c. a bacteriocin-producing enterococcus faecium was also able to reduce the numbers of l. monocytogenes on caesar salad, but did not act synergistically  when co-inoculated with l. lactis subsp. lactis.

TI  == primary and secondary structures of rrna spacer regions in enterococci.
AB  == the 16s-23s and 23s-5s rrna spacer dna regions (spacer regions 1 and 2, respectively) from enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus durans and enterococcus mundtii were amplified by pcr. their  nucleotide sequences were established and a secondary structure model showing the interaction between the two spacer regions was built. whereas lactococci and streptococcus sensu stricto are characterized by a single type of spacer region 1, the enterococci show a high degree of variability in this region; thus the spacer regions 1 with and without trna(ala) were characterized. however, as shown for lactococci and streptococcus sensu stricto, the trna(ala) gene does not encode the 3'-terminal cca trinucleotide. a putative antitermination signal is found downstream from the trna(ala) gene. based on comparison with lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus, a double-stranded processing stem is proposed. in e, hirae, one of the three different types of spacer region 1 contains no trna(ala), but displays a 107 nt insertion that forms a long stem-loop structure. a similar insertion (115 nt in length) was found in e. faecium and base compensatory mutations preserve the ability to form the long stem-loop structure. such insertions may correspond to mobile intervening sequences, as found in the 23s rrna coding sequences of some gram-negative bacteria. the spacer regions 1 and 2 from the three subgroups of streptococci were compared, and except for the trna(ala) gene and the double-stranded processing sites, little similarity was found, which opens large possibilities for future development of dna-based typing methods.

AB  == providing direct-fed-microbial (dfm) bacteria and fructooligosaccharides (fos) for the control of potential escalation of salmonella colonization during simulated feed withdrawal and confinement was assessed. eight hundred and eighty  broilers (16 pens; 55 chicks per pen) were reared to 6 wk of age. chicks were sprayed with a solution containing 10(6) nalidixic-acid resistant salmonella typhimuriumnr cells per milliliter on the 2nd d after hatching. because this first challenge did not yield a high infection rate, chickens were rechallenged per os at day 18 by providing water containing 10(7) cells of s. typhimuriumnr per milliliter. at 3 and 5 wk of age, 10 birds per pen were euthanatized and cecal salmonella were quantified (log colony-forming units per gram). feed was removed from all pens at 6 wk, and pens were randomly assigned to be either the treatment group or the control group. the treatment groups were provided a dfm (mixture of nine bacteria) and fos 50 (r) (10%) in the drinking water. the control groups received drinking water only. after 6 h of feed withdrawal, chickens were cooped (eight per coop) and held 10 h. immediately after confinement, 10 chickens were used for cecal enumeration of s. typhimuriumnr. salmonella colonization declined from 99% at 3 wk to 44% at 5 wk. after feed withdrawal, application of the treatment, and confinement, 11 and 14% of the treated and control groups, respectively, yielded s. typhimuriumnr by direct plating from ceca (3.87 and 3.75 log 10 cfu/g, respectively). no difference (p >  0.05) in salmonella colonization occurred between the treated and the control groups; however, enrichment of ceca (incubation in nutrient broth at 37 c for 24  h) yielded a higher incidence of s. typhimuriumnr in the control groups (32% in the treated vs 51% in the control). ceca weights were greater in the treated group (p < 0.05). simulated feed withdrawal and confinement did not escalate salmonella colonization in the chicken ceca.

TI  == presumptive fecal streptococci in environmental samples characterized by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the use of fecal streptococci as fecal indicators requires better knowledge of the ecology of these bacteria. we isolated 371 presumptive fecal streptococci from environmental samples--domestic wastewater, forest industry wastewater, contaminated surface and seawater, well water, cow dung, bird droppings, and pristine waters--and clustered them according to their protein profiles in one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. some clusters could be tentatively identified with the help of reference strains. samples from each environment had a typical composition of streptococcus types. enterococcus faecalis was present, but not as a dominating enterococcal species, in samples in which fecal contamination was probable. enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus hirae, and enterococcus mundtii had protein profiles that were difficult to distinguish from each other.  these bacteria were found in a variety of samples. enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum had identical protein profiles. on the basis of the maximum temperatures for growth and pigment production, isolates of this protein  profile group common in forest industry wastewaters were identified as e. casseliflavus. lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was also found in this environment. nearly all strains from pristine waters belonged to protein profile  groups which could not be identified with the aid of known aerococcus, enterococcus, lactococcus, or streptococcus strains. the maximum temperatures for growth and the results of fatty acid analysis were in general agreement within each protein profile group.

TI  == identification of a streptococcal penicillin-binding protein that reacts very slowly with penicillin.
AB  == penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 5 of streptococcus faecium atcc 9790 has an unusually low affinity for penicillin (50% binding occurred at a penicillin level of 8 micrograms/ml after 60 min of incubation, and the protein only became labeled after 20 min of incubation with high concentrations of radioactive penicillin). pbps with similar properties are carried by strains of streptococcus durans, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus lactis but not by strains of groups a, b, c, and g streptococci or streptococcus pneumoniae. the strains carrying the slow-reacting pbp demonstrated a sensitivity to penicillin that was  several hundred times lower than that of strains not carrying it. spontaneous mutants with minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin of 20, 40, and 80 micrograms/ml were isolated from s. faecium atcc 9790. they all showed a dramatic increase in the amount of slow-reacting pbp produced. mutants with increased penicillin resistance were also isolated from wild-type strains of s. durans, s.  faecalis, and s. faecium. all of them carried a greater amount of the slow-reacting pbp than that carried by the parent. finally, it was found that resistant s. faecium atcc 9790 mutants grew normally in the presence of penicillin concentrations that were far above that saturating all pbps except pbp 5. cell growth was, on the contrary, inhibited by a penicillin concentration that saturated the slow-reacting pbp by 90%. this penicillin dose was equal to the minimal inhibitory concentration.
