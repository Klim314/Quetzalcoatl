probiotics for the treatment of women with bacterial vaginosis.
this review considers whether probiotics are effective agents for the treatment and/or prevention of bacterial vaginosis (bv). there seems to be an association between the absence of, or low concentrations of, vaginal lactobacilli and the development of bv. many studies have suggested that the presence of h2o2-producing vaginal lactobacilli may protect against bv, although some studies do not support this hypothesis. in-vitro studies have suggested that certain specific strains of lactobacilli are able to inhibit the adherence of gardnerella vaginalis to the vaginal epithelium and/or produce h2o2, lactic acid and/or bacteriocins, which inhibit the growth of bacteria causing bv. clinical trials showed that intra-vaginal administration of lactobacillus acidophilus for 6-12 days, or oral administration of l. acidophilus or lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14 for 2 months, resulted in the cure of bv (defined as a 0-1 positive score according to amsel's criteria), and/or reduced the recurrences of bv, and/or caused an increase in vaginal lactobacilli and restoration of a normal vaginal microbiota, significantly more frequently than did a placebo, acetic acid or no treatment. however, several trials have found no significant difference in the cure rate of bv and in the number of vaginal lactobacilli after intra-vaginal instillation of lactobacilli when compared with the effect of a placebo or oestrogen. thus, although the available results concerning the effectiveness of the administration of lactobacilli for the treatment of bv are mostly positive, it cannot yet be concluded definitively that probiotics are useful for this purpose.
lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginal microbiota of healthy women inhibit prevotella bivia and gardnerella vaginalis in coculture and cell culture.
the purpose of this study was to investigate how human vaginal isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus crispatus inhibit the vaginosis-associated pathogens gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia. results show that all the strains in coculture condition reduced the viability of g. vaginalis and p. bivia, but with differing degrees of efficacy. the treatment of g. vaginalis- and p. bivia-infected cultured human cervix epithelial hela cells with l. gasseri strain ks120.1 culture or cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs) results in the killing of the pathogens that are adhering to the cells. the mechanism of the killing activity is not attributable to low ph and the presence of lactic acid alone, but rather to the presence of hydrogen peroxide and proteolytic enzyme-resistant compound(s) present in the cfcss. in addition, coculture of g. vaginalis or p. bivia with l. gasseri ks120.1 culture or ks120.1 bacteria results in inhibition of the adhesion of the pathogens onto hela cells.
bacteriocin susceptibility of gardnerella vaginalis and its relationship to biotype, genotype, and metronidazole susceptibility.
objective: our purpose was to investigate the bacteriocin susceptibility of gardnerella vaginalis and its relationship to biotype, genotype, and resistance to metronidazole. study design: bacteriocin susceptibility of 36 g vaginalis clinical isolates was tested against a vaginal strain of lactobacillus acidophilus by a growth-inhibition method. the relationship to biotype, genotype, and resistance to metronidazole were analyzed by the chi2 test and fisher exact test. results: eight g vaginalis strains (22%) were bacteriocin-resistant. biotypes 5 and 7 were found to be the most frequent among these resistant strains. eight (42%) of the 19 isolates classified as biotype 5, 6, or 7 were bacteriocin-resistant compared with none of the isolates that were classified as other biotypes (p <.01). biotype 5 was found in higher prevalence among the isolates resistant to bacteriocin (62%) than among the susceptible isolates (14%) (p =.01). genotype b was found more frequently among the bacteriocin-resistant strains, but this finding was not statistically significant (p =.71). seven (88%) bacteriocin-resistant strains were also resistant to metronidazole. conclusion: an association between biotype and an increased resistance to bacteriocin was found. the ability of g vaginalis to resist the antibacterial activity of lactobacillus bacteriocin may be a pivotal factor in understanding bacterial vaginosis.
antimicrobial protein produced by vaginal lactobacillus acidophilus that inhibits gardnerella vaginalis.
objective: to isolate bacteriocin from a vaginal strain of lactobacillus acidophilus. methods: l. acidophilus 160 was grown on two media. the first was mrs broth for 18 hours; the cells were harvested, washed, and placed into a chemically defined medium. the second medium resembled vaginal fluid minus protein. bacteriocin was precipitated from both media using ammonium sulfate. the growth-inhibiting activity of bacteriocin was determined by a bioassay using nine different isolates of gardnerella vaginalis. results: mrs broth is not a suitable medium for extracting bacteriocin, because it binds with tween 80. bacteriocin was isolated, without contaminating constituents, from chemically defined medium and identified as a single band by electrophoresis. bacteriocin has a molecular weight of 3.8 kda. all nine isolates of gardnerella were inhibited by the bacteriocin isolated from l. acidophilus 160. conclusions: bacteriocin produced by l. acidophilus 160 was isolated from the chemically defined medium (starvation medium) in a partially pure form. l. acidophilus 160 bacteriocin inhibited growth of all nine isolates of gardnerella vaginalis.
effects of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate on the adherence of gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii, and lactobacillus acidophilus to vaginal epithelial cells.
background and objectives: a decreased concentration or total disappearance of lactobacillus acidophilus in the vagina constitutes a frequent observation in bacterial vaginosis. goal of the study: cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate has been evaluated in vitro to detect antiadhesive properties at subinhibitory concentrations for gardnerella vaginalis and mobiluncus curtisii to vaginal epithelial cells (vec). study design: bacterial strains 14c- and or 3h-labeled were tested for adherence and competition to binding sites in vecs before and after treatment at sub-mic with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate. results: in control tests of adherence, g. vaginalis and m. curtisii had their maximal adhesion at ph 5.4, l. acidophilus at ph 4.4. preincubation of g. vaginalis and m. curtisii with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate 2.5 mg/ml (subinhibitory concentration) at ph 5.4 reduced adherence to vecs respectively by 48.3% and 34.1%. the same treatment of l. acidophilus showed no statistically significant difference. treatment of vecs alone did not modify adherence. competition tests between l. acidophilus and g. vaginalis and between l. acidophilus and m. curtisii showed that, in small quantities, l. acidophilus could compete with g. vaginalis and m. curtisii for binding sites in vecs at ph 4.4, when pretreated with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate. at a higher ph (4.8 and 5.4), l. acidophilus in higher quantities did not compete for binding sites occupied by g. vaginalis and m. curtisii. conclusions: cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate at subinhibitory concentrations modifies the adhesiveness of g. vaginalis and m. curtisii to vecs, reducing it by 48.3% and 34.1%, respectively. adhesion of l. acidophilus to vecs is not impaired by pretreatment with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate at ph 4.4, even if they are in low number and compete for binding sites against pathogens. at higher ph levels, l. acidophilus did not compete for binding sites occupied by g. vaginalis and m. curtisii.
