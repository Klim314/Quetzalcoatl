TI  == coaggregation and biofilm growth of granulicatella spp. with fusobacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == background: members of fastidious granulicatella and aggregatibacter genera belong to normal oral flora bacteria that can cause serious infections, such as infective endocarditis. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans has long been implicated in aggressive periodontitis, whereas dna-based methods only recently showed an association between granulicatella spp. and dental diseases. as bacterial coaggregation is a key phenomenon in the development of oral and nonoral multispecies bacterial communities it would be of interest knowing coaggregation pattern of granulicatella species with a. actinomycetemcomitans in  comparison with the multipotent coaggregator fusobacterium nucleatum. the aim was to investigate coaggregation and biofilm formation of granulicatella elegans and  granulicatella adiacens with a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum strains. results: f. nucleatum exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) higher autoaggregation than all other test species, followed by a. actinomycetemcomitans sa269 and g. elegans. a. actinomycetemcomitans cu1060 and g. adiacens did not autoaggregate. g. elegans with f. nucleatum exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) higher coaggregation than most others, but failed to grow as biofilm together or separately. with f. nucleatum as partner, a. actinomycetemcomitans strains sa269, a rough-colony wild-type strain, and cu1060, a spontaneous smooth-colony laboratory variant, and g. adiacens were the next in coaggregation efficiency. these dual species combinations also were able to grow as biofilms. while both g. elegans and g. adiacens coaggregated with a. actinomycetemcomitans strain sa269,  but not with cu1060, they grew as biofilms with both a. actinomycetemcomitans strains. conclusions: g. elegans failed to form biofilm with f. nucleatum despite the strongest coaggregation with it. the ability of granulicatella spp. to coaggregate and/or form biofilms with f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans strains suggests that granulicatella spp. have the potential to integrate into dental plaque biofilms.

TI  == oral microbiota shift after 12-week supplementation with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289; a randomized control trial.
AB  == background: lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. methods and findings: oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna hypervariable region v3-v4 after 12 weeks of daily lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289 consumption. forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 cfu of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). presence of l. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific pcr. tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. a total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. after removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the human oral microbiome database. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. streptococcus was the most common genus and the s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group comprised the dominant species. the number of observed species was unaffected by l. reuteri exposure. however, subjects who had consumed l. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and pcr detected l. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. l. reuteri intake correlated with increased s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group and campylobacter concisus, granulicatella adiacens, bergeyella sp. hot322, neisseria subflava, and sr1 [g-1] sp. hot874 detection and reduced s. mutans, s. anginosus, n. mucosa, fusobacterium periodicum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, and prevotella maculosa detection. this effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. conclusions: l. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. the biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02311218.

TI  == microbial signature profiles of periodontally healthy and diseased patients.
AB  == aim: to determine microbial profiles that discriminate periodontal health from different forms of periodontal diseases. methods: subgingival biofilm was obtained from patients with periodontal health (27), gingivitis (11), chronic periodontitis (35) and aggressive periodontitis (24), and analysed for the presence of >250 species/phylotypes using homim. microbial differences among groups were examined by mann-whitney u-test. regression analyses were performed to determine microbial risk indicators of disease. results: putative and potential new periodontal pathogens were more prevalent in subjects with periodontal diseases than periodontal health. detection of porphyromonas endodontalis/porphyromonas spp. (or 9.5 [1.2-73.1]) and tannerella forsythia (or  38.2 [3.2-450.6]), and absence of neisseria polysaccharea (or 0.004 [0-0.15]) and prevotella denticola (or 0.014 [0-0.49], p < 0.05) were risk indicators of periodontal disease. presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (or 29.4 [3.4-176.5]), cardiobacterium hominis (or 14.9 [2.3-98.7]), peptostreptococcaceae sp. (or 35.9 [2.7-483.9]), p. alactolyticus (or 31.3 [2.1-477.2]), and absence of fretibacterium spp. (or 0.024 [0.002-0.357]), fusobacterium naviforme/fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii (or 0.015 [0.001-0.223]), granulicatella adiacens/granulicatella elegans (or 0.013 [0.001-0.233], p < 0.05) were associated with aggressive periodontitis. conclusion: there were specific microbial signatures of the subgingival biofilm that were able to distinguish between microbiomes of periodontal health and diseases. such profiles may be used to establish risk of disease.

TI  == microbiological diversity of peri-implantitis biofilm by sanger sequencing.
AB  == background and objective: to examine the microbial diversity associated with implants with or without peri-implantitis and to identify differences between the bacterial communities in these clinical conditions. material and methods: twenty  subjects were assigned to a control group consisting of subjects with healthy implants and a test group consisting of subjects with peri-implantitis sites, as  well as a healthy implant site (n = 10/group). in the test group, subgingival biofilm samples were taken from the deepest sites of the diseased implant. in both groups, samples were collected from one site around a healthy implant. dna was extracted and the 16s rrna gene was amplified and sequenced, and the phylotypes were identified by comparison with known 16s rrna sequences. results:  the phylogenetic identity of 1387 16s rrna gene clones was determined. healthy implants demonstrated higher proportions of actinomyces, atopobium, gemella, kingella and rothia and lower levels of campylobacter, desulfobulbus, dialister,  eubacterium, filifactor, mitsukella, porphyromonas and pseudoramibacter (mann-whitney u-test; p < 0.05). fusobacterium nucleatum, dialister invisus, streptococcus sp. human oral taxon (hot) 064, filifactor alocis and mitsuokella sp. hot 131 presented a higher mean proportion, while veillonella dispar, actinomyces meyeri, granulicatella adiacens showed lower mean proportions in the  peri-implantitis sites when compared with healthy implants in both the control and test groups (mann-whitney u-test; p < 0.05). conclusion: marked differences were observed in the composition of the subgingival biofilm between healthy and diseased implants. the biofilm associated with peri-implantitis harbored more pathogenic bacterial species from the orange complex and other "unusual" putative pathogens, such as f. alocis, d. invisus and mitsuokella sp. hot 131.

TI  == streptococci dominate the diverse flora within buccal cells.
AB  == previously, we reported that intracellular actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythensis were present within buccal  epithelial cells from human subjects, as lesser components of a polymicrobial flora. in this study, we further characterized that intracellular flora by using  the same double-labeling techniques to identify fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, oral campylobacter species, eikenella corrodens, treponema denticola, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, and total streptococci within buccal epithelial cells. all those species were found within buccal cells. in every case, species recognized by green-labeled species-specific probes were accompanied by other bacteria recognized only by a red-labeled universal probe. streptococci appeared to be a major component of the polymicrobial intracellular  flora, being present at a level from one to two logs greater than the next most common species (g. adiacens). this is similar to what is observed in oral biofilms, where diverse species interact in complex communities that often are dominated by streptococci.
