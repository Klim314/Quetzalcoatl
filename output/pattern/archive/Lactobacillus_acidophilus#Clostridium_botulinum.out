inhibition of nonproteolytic clostridium botulinum with lactic acid bacteria and  their bacteriocins at refrigeration temperatures.
nonproteolytic clostridium botulinum (strains 17b, beluga, and 202f) was found to be inhibited by lactobacillus, lactococcus, streptococcus, and pediococcus species in tests by the spot-on-the-lawn simultaneous-antagonism method at 10, 15, and 25 degrees c. c. botulinum 17b was the most resistant strain. inhibition zone size increased with decreasing incubation temperature. six strains of lactobacillus acidophilus and seven strains of bifidobacteria failed to produce an inhibition zone on buffered reinforced clostridium prussian blue agar seeded with spores of any of the selected c. botulinum strains. c. botulinum 17b was sensitive to 50 to 100 iu of nisin per ml and to 10 to 20 au of pediocin a per ml.
bacteriocin-mediated inhibition of clostridium botulinum spores by lactic acid bacteria at refrigeration and abuse temperatures.
the bacteriocinogenicity of lactococcus lactis atcc 11454, pediococcus pentosaceus atcc 43200, p. pentosaceus atcc 43201, lactobacillus plantarum bn, l. plantarum lb592, l. plantarum lb75, and lactobacillus acidophilus n2 against clostridium botulinum spores at 4, 10, 15, and 35 degrees c was investigated by modified deferred and simultaneous antagonism methods. all the strains, except l. acidophilus n2, produced inhibition zones on lawns of c. botulinum spores at 30 degrees c. l. plantarum bn, l. lactis atcc 11454, and p. pentosaceus atcc 43200 and 43201 were bacteriocinogenic at 4, 10, and 15 degrees c. supplementation of brain heart infusion agar with 0 to 5% nacl increased the radii of inhibition zones during simultaneous antagonism assays. detectable bacteriocin activities were extracted from freeze-thawed agar cultures of l. plantarum bn and l. lactis atcc 11454 which had been grown at 4 and 10 degrees c. these results suggest that low levels of l. plantarum bn or l. lactis atcc 11454, in the presence of 3 or 4% nacl, could be formulated into minimally processed refrigerated food products for protection against possible botulism hazards.
