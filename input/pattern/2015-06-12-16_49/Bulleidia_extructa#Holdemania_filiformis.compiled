TI  - Bulleidia extructa gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from the oral cavity.
AB  - Five strains of anaerobic non-sporing Gram-positive bacilli isolated from advanced periodontitis (four strains) and a dentoalveolar abscess (one strain) that did not correspond to existing species were subjected to phenotypic and genetic characterization. Following 16S rDNA sequence analysis, they were found to constitute a novel branch of the low G+C Gram-positive division of the phylogenetic tree related to Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae and Holdemania filiformis. A new genus Bulleidia, and the species Bulleidia extructa, are proposed. Growth of B. extructa in broth media was poor but was enhanced by the addition of fructose, glucose or maltose together with Tween 80. Glucose and maltose were fermented and arginine was hydrolysed. Acetate, lactate and trace amounts of succinate were the end products of glucose fermentation. The G+C content of the DNA of the type strain is 38 mol%. The type strain of Bulleidia extructa is DSM 13220T.
