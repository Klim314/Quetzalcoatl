TI  == dentipain, a streptococcus pyogenes ides protease homolog, is a novel virulence factor of treponema denticola.
AB  == treponema denticola is a major pathogen of chronic periodontitis. analysis of the t. denticola genome revealed a gene orthologous with a cysteine protease-encoding gene from streptococcus pyogenes (ides). ides interferes with igg-dependent opsonophagocytosis by specific cleavage of igg molecules. analysis of this gene (termed idet) revealed it to encode a two-domain protein whose n-terminus is composed of tandem immunoglobulin-like domains followed by a c-terminal ides-like protease domain. in this study we show that during secretion the idet protein is  processed into an n-terminal fragment which remains associated with the cell, and a c-terminal part released into the medium. although the secreted domain of idet, termed dentipain, shows only 25% identity to the ides protease, the putative catalytic cysteine and histidine residues are strongly conserved. recombinant dentipain cleaves the insulin beta-chain, an activity which is inhibited by e-64, a diagnostic inhibitor of cysteine proteases. apart from insulin no cleavage of other protein substrates was detected, suggesting that dentipain has oligopeptidase activity. a mutant strain was constructed expressing a modified idet variant, the dentipain domain of which was deleted. this strain was found to be significantly reduced in its abscess-forming activity compared with the parental strain in a murine abscess model, suggesting that dentipain contributes  to the virulence of t. denticola.
