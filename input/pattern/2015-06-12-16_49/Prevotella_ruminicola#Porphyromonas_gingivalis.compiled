TI  - Biochemical and mutational analysis of a gingipain-like peptidase activity from Prevotella ruminicola B(1)4 and its role in ammonia production by ruminal bacteria.
AB  - A chemical mutagenesis protocol was used with the ruminal bacterium Prevotella ruminicola strain B(1)4 to generate mutant strains defective in peptidase activity. Compared with the wild-type parent strain, the isolated mutants possessed 1/10 of the enzyme activity responsible for cleavage of glycine-arginine-4-methoxy-beta-naphthylamide (Gly-Arg-MNA). A concomitant loss in activity against arginine-arginine-4-methoxy-beta-naphthylamide (Arg-Arg-MNA) was also observed. Both activities were similarly affected by various proteinase inhibitors, suggesting that the same enzyme is responsible for the Arg-Arg-MNA peptidase and Gly-Arg-MNA peptidase activities. Growth rates of wild-type and mutant strains grown in batch culture with various nitrogen sources did not differ. However, a role for the Gly-Arg-MNA peptidase activity was demonstrated in coculture experiments with gram-positive, ammonia-producing ruminal bacteria. The rate and extent of ammonia production were reduced by approximately 25% in cocultures containing the mutants when compared with that of wild-type-containing cultures. These reductions could not be accounted for simply by the decrease in ammonia production by the mutant strain alone. To our knowledge, this paper reports the first successful use of chemical mutagenesis with ruminal microorganisms.
TI  - Phylogeny of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas spp. and related bacteria.
AB  - The phylogenetic structure of the bacteroides subgroup of the cytophaga-flavobacter-bacteroides (CFB) phylum was examined by 16S rRNA sequence comparative analysis. Approximately 95% of the 16S rRNA sequence was determined for 36 representative strains of species of Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Porphyromonas and related species by a modified Sanger sequencing method. A phylogenetic tree was constructed from a corrected distance matrix by the neighbor-joining method, and the reliability of tree branching was established by bootstrap analysis. The bacteroides subgroup was divided primarily into three major phylogenetic clusters which contained most of the species examined. The first cluster, termed the prevotella cluster, was composed of 16 species of Prevotella, including P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, and the ruminal species P. ruminicola. Two oral species, P. zoogleoformans and P. heparinolytica, which had been recently placed in the genus Prevotella, did not fall within the prevotella cluster. These two species and six species of Bacteroides, including the type species B. fragilis, formed the second cluster, termed the bacteroides cluster. The third cluster, termed the porphyromonas cluster, was divided into two subclusters. The first contained Porphyromonas gingivalis, P. endodontalis, P. asaccharolytica, P. circumdentaria, P. salivosa, [Bacteroides] levii (the brackets around genus are used to indicate that the species does not belong to the genus by the sensu stricto definition), and [Bacteroides] macacae, and the second subcluster contained [Bacteroides] forsythus and [Bacteroides] distasonis. [Bacteroides] splanchnicus fell just outside the three major clusters but still belonged within the bacteroides subgroup. With few exceptions, the 16 S rRNA data were in overall agreement with previously proposed reclassifications of species of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas. Suggestions are made to accommodate those species which do not fit previous reclassification schemes.
