TI  == cleanliness of linen and clothing items professionally laundered or dry-cleaned.
AB  == we asked 14 professional cleaners (laundry services) to clean various unused (new) linen and clothing items with a microbial contamination level of < 1 colony-forming units (cfu)/cm2 and then evaluated the bacterial/fungal contamination of the laundered or dry-cleaned items. after laundering, 6 (21.4%)  of 28 samples from 4 of the 14 cleaners (28.5%) were contaminated (1-1,200 cfu/cm2). after dry-cleaning, 2 (7.1%) of 28 samples from 2 (14.3%) of the 14 cleaners were contaminated (7-10 cfu/cm2). the main contaminant was bacillus cereus. no sample of the laundered or dry-cleaned items showed staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, or pseudomonas aeruginosa contamination. all 14 cleaners investigated in this study used batch-type washing machines. therefore,  batch-type washing machines can cause the contamination of linens and clothing items with b. cereus.

TI  == purification, crystallization and x-ray crystallographic studies of a bacillus cereus mepr-like transcription factor, bc0657.
AB  == transcription factors of the marr family respond to internal and external changes and regulate a variety of biological functions through ligand association with microorganisms. mepr belongs to the marr family, and its mutations are associated with the development of multidrug resistance in staphylococcus aureus, which has  caused a growing health problem. in this study, a bacillus cereus mepr-like transcription regulator, bc0657, was crystallized. the bc0657 crystals diffracted to 2.05 a resolution and belonged to either space group p6222 or p6422, with unit-cell parameters a = 110.57, b = 110.57, c = 67.29 a. there was one molecule  per asymmetric unit. future comparative structural studies on bc0657 would extend knowledge of ligand-induced transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in the marr family and would make a significant contribution to the design of antibiotic drugs against multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == a novel suicide plasmid for efficient gene mutation in listeria monocytogenes.
AB  == although several plasmids have been used in listeria monocytogenes for generating mutants by allelic exchange, construction of l. monocytogenes mutants has been inefficient due to lack of effective selection markers for first and second recombination events. to address this problem, we have developed a new suicide plasmid, phoss1, by using the pmad plasmid backbone and anhydrotetracycline selection marker (secy antisense rna) driven by an inducible pxyl/teto promoter.  expression of the secy antisense rna eliminates merodiploids and selects for the  loss of plasmid via a second allelic exchange, which enriches the number of mutants with deleted genes. to assess the effectiveness of phoss1 for the generation of stable in-frame deletion mutations, we deleted the ispg and isph genes of l. monocytogenes serotype 4b strain f2365. results showed that identification of the second allelic exchange mutants was very efficient with 80-100% of the colonies yielding desired deletion mutants. l. monocytogenes' intestinal cell attachment was not altered when ispg and isph genes were deleted. we expect that this new plasmid will be very useful for construction of marker-free deletion mutants in l. monocytogenes and in other gram-positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus.

TI  == kinetics of bacterial inactivation by 405nm and 520nm light emitting diodes and the role of endogenous coproporphyrin on bacterial susceptibility.
AB  == photodynamic inactivation studies of microbial pathogens have focused on the use  of an external photosensitizer or a precursor compound to eliminate bacteria. the present study investigated the inactivation kinetics of six bacterial pathogens by a 405nm light emitting diode (led) without the addition of any external compound. the role of endogenous coproporphyrin on the bacterial susceptibility to leds was also examined. pathogens were illuminated with leds at 25, 10 and 4 degrees c for 9h and the inactivation curves were modeled using six different equations. endogenous coproporphyrin was quantified using an hplc system equipped with a fluorescence detector. at a dose of 306j/cm2, the 405nm led brought about  4.0, 2.1 and 1.9 log reductions in the populations of staphylococcus aureus at 25, 10 and 4 degrees c, respectively. at all three temperatures, the population of bacillus cereus and listeria monocytogenes reduced by approximately 2.3 and 1.9 log respectively. salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli o157:h7 showed  moderate susceptibility to 405nm led while pseudomonas aeruginosa was most resistant. of the six models tested, hom model proved most suitable. this study demonstrated that 405nm leds can be useful in the inactivation of bacterial pathogens with the aid of endogenous coproporphyrin alone.

TI  == antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities from jatropha dioica roots.
AB  == the antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of organic extracts obtained from roots of the medicinal plant jatropha dioica (euphorbiaceae) were investigated. in order to evaluate their antimicrobial activity, the organic extracts were tested against clinical isolates of the human pathogens bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella typhimurium, cryptococcus neoformans, candida albicans, candida parapsilosis and sporothrix schenckii. results revealed that the hexane extract possess the stronger activity and a broader microbicide spectrum compared to the acetone and ethanol extracts. the activity of hexane extract may be attributed in part to the presence of beta-sitosterol, the major compound identified by bioautography. the hexane extract, as well as the bioactive fraction were not cytotoxic when assays were profiled against the normal cell lines chang, ok and llcpk-1 (ic50>1000 mug ml(-1)).

TI  == antibacterial activity of native california medicinal plant extracts isolated from rhamnus californica and umbellularia californica.
AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance (amr) is a major threat to global public health. medicinal plants have long been used as remedies for infectious diseases  by native cultures around the world and have the potential for providing effective treatments for antibiotic-resistant infections. rhamnus californica (rhamnaceae) and umbellularia californica (lauraceae) are two indigenous california plant species historically used by native americans to treat skin, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. this study aimed to assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity of methanolic extracts of leaves and bark of r. and  u. californica against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. methods: methanolic extracts of leaves and bark of r. and u. californica were prepared by soxhlet extraction and  evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against bacillus cereus, streptococcus pyogenes, mycobacterium smegmatis, staphylococcus aureus, mrsa, escherichia coli  and pseudomonas aeruginosa using disc diffusion and minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) assays. chemical profiling of the extracts was performed using standard methods. results: all extracts inhibited the growth of mrsa and other gram-positive bacteria with mics of 3.3-6.0 mg/ml. gram-negative organisms  were unaffected by these extracts. u. californica extracts (leaves and bark) had  the lowest mic values. chemical profiling detected the presence of quinones, alkaloids, flavonoids, cardenolides, tannins and saponins in these extracts. our  study is the first to report the antimicrobial properties of r. and u. californica and illustrates their promising anti-mrsa potential. conclusions: our results give scientific credence to the traditional medicinal uses of these plants by the indigenous peoples of california. further investigation of the secondary metabolites responsible for the antimicrobial activity of these extracts against mrsa is warranted.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activities and mechanism of sugar fatty acid esters against five food-related bacteria.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activities of sugar fatty acid esters, with different fatty acid and saccharide moieties, against five food-related bacteria including bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. sucrose monocaprate showed the strongest antibacterial activity against all tested bacteria, especially gram-positive bacteria. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria were  2.5 and 10mm, respectively. the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) for gram-positive bacteria were 10mm. time-kill assay also showed that sucrose monocaprate significantly inhibit the growth of tested bacteria. the permeability of the cell membrane and intracellular proteins were both changed by sucrose monocaprate according to cell constituents' leakage, sds-page and scanning electron microscope assays. it is suggested that sucrose monocaprate, with both emulsifying and antibacterial activities, have a potential to serve as a safe multifunctional food additive in food industries.

TI  == effect of uv-c light on the microbial and sensory quality of seasoned dried seafood.
AB  == this study investigated the effects of different doses of uv-c light at 253.7 nm  (0-18 kj/m2) on the reduction of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus in contaminated seasoned dried filefish (thamnaconus modestus) and sliced squid (todarodes pacificus) surfaces and sensory quality. the counts of all three bacteria were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced by the increase of uv-c dosage. e. coli, s. aureus and b. cereus on filefish with 18 kj/m2 of uv-c maximally reduced by 2.70, 2.55 and 2.57 log cfu/g, respectively; however, on the sliced squid using the same uv dose reduced the same bacteria by 1.35, 0.54 and 1.05 log cfu/g, respectively. however, the results suggest that 6 to 9 kj/m2 of uv-c could be used for the inactivation of e. coli and b. cereus in these dried fishery products without any changes in sensory quality. however, s. aureus levels on sliced squid will require a combination of uv-c light and chemical treatment.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial properties of 2,3-dideoxyglucosides of terpene alcohols and phenols.
AB  == essential oils and their oxygenated terpene constituents possess potent antimicrobial properties. in the present study, a facile synthetic route to the 2,3-dideoxy 1-o-glucosides of important phenols and terpene alcohols in excellent yields (85-96%) has been delineated. studies on their antimicrobial action against four food-borne pathogens - bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica - demonstrated that the zone of inhibition, in general, was higher for the 2,3-unsaturated 1-o-glucoside derivatives (1b-6b) and the corresponding saturated glucosides (1c-5c) when compared to the parent alcohols/phenols (1-6). the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) values for these derivatives too were generally lower than those of the parent compounds. furthermore, the time-kill and bacteriolysis assays too demonstrated the greater  antimicrobial potential of the derivatives. the 2,3-dideoxy 1-o-glucosides of phenols and terpene alcohols were more effective in their antimicrobial action than the corresponding parent compounds. the study indicated that these novel derivatives can find useful application in control of food-related pathogenic microbes in foods.

TI  == challenge study of the pathogen reduction capacity of the theraflex mb-plasma technology.
AB  == background and objectives: although most pathogen reduction systems for plasma primarily target viruses, bacterial contamination may also occur. this study aimed to investigate the bacterial reduction capacity of a methylene blue (mb) treatment process and its virus inactivation capacity in lipaemic plasma. materials and methods: bacterial concentrations in plasma units spiked with different bacterial strains were measured before and after the following steps of the theraflex mb-plasma procedure: leucocyte filtration, mb/light treatment and mb filtration. virus inactivation was investigated for three virus types in non-lipaemic, borderline lipaemic and highly lipaemic plasma. results: leucocyte  filtration alone efficiently eliminated most of the tested bacteria by more than  4 logs (staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus) or to the limit of  detection (lod) (>/= 4.8 logs; escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and klebsiella pneumoniae). mb/light and mb filtration further reduced staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus to below the lod. the small bacterium brevundimonas diminuta was reduced by 1.7 logs by leucocyte filtration alone, and to below the lod by additional mb/light treatment and mb filtration (>/= 3.7 logs). suid herpesvirus 1, bovine viral diarrhoea virus and human immunodeficiency virus 1 were efficiently inactivated by theraflex mb-plasma, independent of the degree of lipaemia. conclusion: theraflex mb-plasma efficiently reduces bacteria, mainly via the integrated filtration system. its virus inactivation capacity is sufficient to compensate for reduced light transparency due to lipaemia.

TI  == antimicrobial and immunomodulatory efficacy of extracellularly synthesized silver and gold nanoparticles by a novel phosphate solubilizing fungus bipolaris tetramera.
AB  == background: particulates of nanometers size have occupied a significant area in the field of medicinal and agricultural purposes due to their large surface-to-volume ratio and exceptional physicochemical, electronic and mechanical properties. myconanotechnology, an interface between mycology and nanotechnology is budding nowadays for nanoparticle-fabrication using fungus or its metabolites. in the present study, we have isolated and characterized a novel phosphate solubilizing fungus b. tetramera kf934408 from rhizospheric soil. this  phosphatase releasing fungus was subjected to extracellular synthesis of metal nanoparticles by redox reaction. results: silver (agnps) and gold nanoparticles (aunps) were characterized by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron  microscopic analysis. the formulated agnps were irregular shaped with a size ranging between 54.78 nm to 73.49 nm whereas aunps were spherical or hexagonal, with a size of 58.4 and 261.73 nm, respectively. the nanoparticles were assessed  for their antibacterial and antifungal efficacy. the results showed effective antimicrobial activity of agnps against bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter aeroginosa and trichoderma sp. at higher concentrations, however, aunps possessed only moderate antibacterial efficacy while they found no antifungal activity. cytotoxicity analysis of nanoparticles on j774 and thp1 alpha cell lines revealed the dose dependence in case of agnps, while aunps were  non-toxic at both low and high doses. furthermore, significant elevation of intracellular ros was observed after 4 h of incubation with both the nanoparticles. the capping of fungal proteins on the particulates might be involved in the activities demonstrated by these inert metal nanoparticles. conclusion: in conclusion, the findings showed that the metal nanoparticles synthesized by fungus b. tetramera could be used as an antimicrobial agents as well as cost effective and nontoxic immunomodulatory delivery vehicle.

AB  == background: zulu people living in the rural area of maputaland (kwazulu-natal, south africa) rely heavily on medicinal plants for the treatment of diarrhoea. abundant availability of medicinal plants in the study area offers low cost health care, but scientific validation is needed in order to lend credibility to  the traditional use against many ailments including diarrhoeal infections. with this in mind a study was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of  23 plant species which are used for the treatment of diarrhoea in rural maputaland. four 1:1 plant combinations were also evaluated to determine their interactive effects against seven diarrhoea-related bacterial pathogens. methods: minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) assays were undertaken on dichloromethane-methanol (ch2cl2: meoh) and aqueous crude extracts. the following micro-organisms were selected for this study and were tested based on their association with stomach ailments and diarrhoea; bacillus cereus (atcc 11778), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), escherichia coli (atcc 8739), proteus vulgaris (atcc 33420), salmonella typhimurium (atcc 14028), shigella flexneri (atcc 25875) and staphylococcus aureus (atcc 12600). the fractional inhibitory concentration index (sigmafic) was determined for plants traditionally used in combination. results: shigella flexneri proved to be the most susceptible pathogen, where the organic extract of terminalia sericea showed the most prominent noteworthy antibacterial activity (mean mic value of 0.04 mg/ml). the aqueous extracts generally showed poorer antimicrobial activity with some exceptions i.e. acacia burkei, brachylaena transvaalensis against b. cereus and b. transvaalensis against s. flexneri. in the combination studies, synergy was predominant with mean (across all pathogens) sigmafic values of 0.30 for acanthospermum glabratum with krauseola mosambicina; sigmafic values of 0.46 for  a. glabratum with psidium guajava; sigmafic values of 0.39 for b. transvaalensis  with p. guajava and sigmafic values of 0.88 (additive) for the combination of b.  transvaalensis with sclerocarya birrea. conclusion: this study provided some insight into the bacterial in vitro efficacies of plants traditionally used to treat diarrhoea by the people of northern maputaland. very little connection was  observed between frequency of use and efficacy. plant combinations demonstrated favourable efficacy with mostly synergistic effects noted, lending some credibility to their use in combination.

TI  == secondary metabolites of seseli rigidum: chemical composition plus antioxidant, antimicrobial and cholinesterase inhibition activity.
AB  == extracts of different polarity obtained from various plant parts (root, leaf, flower and fruit) of seseli rigidum were studied by different antioxidant assays: dpph and abts radical scavenging activity, by total reducing power method as well as via total content of flavonoids and polyphenols. essential oils of all plant parts showed weak antioxidant characteristics. the inhibitory concentration range of the tested extracts, against bacteria escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and fungi candida albicans and aspergillus niger was 0.01-1.50mg/ml and of a microbicidal 0.02-3.00mg/ml. in the interaction with cholinesterase, all essential oils proved effective as inhibitors. the highest percentage of inhibition versus human and horse cholinesterase was shown by root essential oil (38.20% and 48.30%, respectively)  among oils, and root hexane extract (40.56% and 50.65% respectively). essential oils and volatile components of all plant parts were identified by gc, gc-ms and  headspace/gc-ms. statistical analysis of the ensemble of results showed that the  root essential oil composition differed significantly from essential oils of other parts of the plant. taking into account all of the studied activities, the  root hexane extract showed the best overall properties. by means of high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry, the 30 most abundant constituents were identified in extracts of different polarity. the presence of identified constituents was linked to observed specific biological activities, thus designating compounds potentially responsible for each exhibited activity.

TI  == purification and characterization of a novel plantaricin, kl-1y, from lactobacillus plantarum kl-1.
AB  == three bacteriocins from lactobacillus plantarum kl-1 were successfully purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase hplc. the bacteriocin peptides kl-1x, -1y and -1z had molecular masses of 3053.82, 3498.16 and 3533.16 da, respectively. all three peptides were  stable at ph 2-12 and 25 degrees c and at high temperatures of 80 and 100 degrees c for 30 min and 121 degrees c for 15 min. however, they differed in their susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes and their inhibition spectra. kl-1y showed  broad inhibitory activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis dmst 17368, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 15442, p. aeruginosa atcc 9027, escherichia coli o157:h7 and e. coli atcc 8739. kl-1x and -1z inhibited only gram-positive bacteria. kl-1x, kl-1y and kl-1z exhibited synergistic activity. the successful amino acid sequencing of kl-1y had a hydrophobicity of approximately 30 % and no cysteine residues suggested its novelty, and it was designated "plantaricin kl-1y". plantaricin kl-1y exhibited bactericidal activity against bacillus cereus jcm 2152(t). compared to nisin, kl-1y displayed broad inhibitory activities of 200, 800, 1600, 800, 400 and 400 au/ml against the growth of bacillus coagulans jcm 2257(t), b. cereus jcm 2152(t), listeria innocua atcc 33090(t), staphylococcus aureus tistr 118, e. coli o157:h7 and e. coli atcc 8739, respectively, whereas nisin had similar activities against only b. coagulans jcm 2257(t) and b. cereus jcm 2152(t). therefore, the novel plantaricin kl-1y is a promising antimicrobial substance for food safety uses in the future.

TI  == antibiotic-resistant bacteria: prevalence in food and inactivation by food-compatible compounds and plant extracts.
AB  == foodborne antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria such as campylobacter jejuni,  bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica,  staphylococcus aureus, vibrio cholerae, and vibrio parahemolyticus can adversely  affect animal and human health, but a better understanding of the factors involved in their pathogenesis is needed. to help meet this need, this overview surveys and interprets much of our current knowledge of antibiotic (multidrug)-resistant bacteria in the food chain and the implications for microbial food safety and animal and human health. topics covered include the origin and prevalence of resistant bacteria in the food chain (dairy, meat, poultry, seafood, and herbal products, produce, and eggs), their inactivation by  different classes of compounds and plant extracts and by the use of chlorine and  physicochemical methods (heat, uv light, pulsed electric fields, and high pressure), the synergistic antimicrobial effects of combinations of natural antimicrobials with medicinal antibiotics, and mechanisms of antimicrobial activities and resistant effects. possible areas for future research are suggested. plant-derived and other safe natural antimicrobial compounds have the  potential to control the prevalence of both susceptible and resistant pathogens in various environments. the collated information and suggested research will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of approaches that could be used to minimize the presence of resistant pathogens in animal feed and human food, thus reducing adverse effects, improving microbial food safety, and helping to prevent or treat animal and human infections.

TI  == characterization of films based on chitosan lactate and its blends with oxidized  starch and gelatin.
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of chitosan lactate (chl) was tested against bacteria and phytopathogenic fungi. then, the structural, physicochemical and antimicrobial properties of films based on chl, oxidized potato starch (ops), and gelatin (gel) were investigated. with the exception of rhizopus nigricans, chl was effective against the target organisms. gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus) were more sensitive to chl than gram-negative bacteria (pectobacterium carotovorum and escherichia coli). cryo-sem images showed total miscibility between the polymers in the blends and the atr-ftir spectra revealed that there was an interaction among the polymeric components. pure chl films displayed the highest moisture content (25.51%), water vapor permeability (48.78gmmm(-2)d(-1)kpa(-1)), and the lowest tensile and puncture strength (2.00 and 1.45mpa, respectively) among the studied films. chl50/gel50 films had lower permeability, higher mechanical strength, and lower elongation compared to chl50/ops50 films. films obtained from chl and chl50/gel50 were completely water-soluble and did not show sorbitol recrystallization. the incorporation of chl into ops and gel films did not affect their transparency and improved uv-blocking capacity. chl films were the only ones that exhibited antibacterial efficiency. antifungal activities against alternaria alternata and  monilinia fructigena were detected for chl and chl50/gel50 films.

TI  == microbiological diversity and prevalence of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria in commercial fermented alcoholic beverages (beer, fruit wine, refined rice wine, and yakju).
AB  == the present study examined 469 commercially available fermented alcoholic beverages (fabs), including beer (draft, microbrewed, and pasteurized), fruit wine (grape and others), refined rice wine, and yakju (raw and pasteurized). samples were screened for escherichia coli and eight foodborne pathogens (bacillus cereus, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica), and the aerobic plate count, lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria, fungi, and total coliforms were also enumerated. microbrewed beer contained the highest number of microorganisms (average aerobic  plate count, 3.5; lactic acid bacteria, 2.1; acetic acid bacteria, 2.0; and fungi, 3.6 log cfu/ml), followed by draft beer and yakju (p < 0.05), whereas the  other fabs contained , 25 cfu/25 ml microorganisms. unexpectedly, neither microbial diversity nor microbial count correlated with the alcohol content (4.7  to 14.1%) or ph (3.4 to 4.2) of the product. despite the harsh conditions, coliforms (detected in 23.8% of microbrewed beer samples) and b. cereus (detected in all fabs) were present in some products. b. cereus was detected most frequently in microbrewed beer (54.8% of samples) and nonpasteurized yakju (50.0%), followed by pasteurized yakju (28.8%), refined rice wine (25.0%), other  fruit wines (12.3%), grape wine (8.6%), draft beer (5.6%), and pasteurized beer (2.2%) (p < 0.05). the finding that spore-forming b. cereus and coliform bacteria can survive the harsh conditions present in alcoholic beverages should be taken into account (alongside traditional quality indicators such as the presence of lactic acid-producing bacteria, acetic acid-producing bacteria, or both) when developing manufacturing systems and methods to prolong the shelf life of high-quality fab products. new strategic quality management plans for various fabs are needed.

TI  == expert elicitation as a means to attribute 28 enteric pathogens to foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, and person-to-person transmission routes in canada.
AB  == enteric illness contributes to a significant burden of illness in canada and globally. understanding its sources is a critical step in identifying and preventing health risks. expert elicitation is a powerful tool, used previously,  to obtain information about enteric illness source attribution where information  is difficult or expensive to obtain. thirty-one experts estimated transmission of 28 pathogens via major transmission routes (foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, person-to-person, and other) at the point of consumption. the elicitation consisted of a (snowball) recruitment phase; administration of a pre-survey to collect background information, an introductory webinar, an elicitation survey, a 1-day discussion, survey readministration, and a feedback exercise, and surveys were administered online. experts were prompted to quantify changes in contamination at the point of entry into the kitchen versus point of consumption. estimates were combined via triangular probability distributions, and medians and 90% credible-interval estimates were produced. transmission was attributed primarily to food for bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, cyclospora cayetanensis, trichinella spp., all three vibrio spp. categories explored, and yersinia enterocolitica. multisource pathogens (e.g., transmitted commonly through both water and food) such as campylobacter spp., four escherichia coli categories, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., and staphylococcus aureus were also estimated as mostly foodborne. water was the primary pathway for giardia spp. and cryptosporidium spp., and person-to-person transmission dominated for six enteric viruses and shigella spp. consideration of the point of attribution highlighted the importance of food handling and cross-contamination in the transmission pathway. this study provides source attribution estimates of enteric illness for canada, considering all possible transmission routes. further research is necessary to improve our understanding of poorly characterized pathogens such as sapovirus and e. coli subgroups in canada.

TI  == alternative modes of biofilm formation by plant-associated bacillus cereus.
AB  == the ability to form multicellular communities known as biofilms is a widespread adaptive behavior of bacteria. members of the bacillus group of bacteria have been found to form biofilms on plant roots, where they protect against pathogens  and promote growth. in the case of the model bacterium bacillus subtilis the genetic pathway controlling biofilm formation and the production of an extracellular matrix is relatively well understood. however, it is unclear whether other members of this genus utilize similar mechanisms. we determined that a plant-associated strain of bacillus cereus (905) can form biofilms by two  seemingly independent pathways. in one mode involving the formation of floating biofilms (pellicles) b. cereus 905 appears to rely on orthologs of many of the genes known to be important for b. subtilis biofilm formation. we report that b.  cereus 905 also forms submerged, surface-associated biofilms and in a manner that resembles biofilm formation by the pathogen staphylococcus aureus. this alternative mode, which does not rely on b. subtilis-like genes for pellicle formation, takes place under conditions of glucose fermentation and depends on a  drop in the ph of the medium.

TI  == bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis cbmdc3f with antimicrobial activity against gram-positive foodborne pathogenic bacteria: uv-maldi-tof ms analysis of its bioactive compounds.
AB  == in this work a new bacillus sp. strain, isolated from honey, was characterized phylogenetically. its antibacterial activity against three relevant foodborne pathogenic bacteria was studied; the main bioactive metabolites were analyzed using ultraviolet matrix assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry (uv-maldi ms). bacillus cbmdc3f was phylogenetically characterized as bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis after rrna analysis of the 16s subunit and the gyra gene (access codes genbank jx120508 and jx120516, respectively). its antibacterial potential was evaluated against listeria monocytogenes (9 strains), b. cereus (3  strains) and staphylococcus aureus atcc29213. its cell suspension and cell-free supernatant (cfs) exerted significant anti-listeria and anti-s. aureus activities, while the lipopeptides fraction (lf) also showed anti-b. cereus effect. the uv-maldi-ms analysis revealed surfactin, iturin and fengycin in the cfs, whereas surfactin predominated in the lf. the cfs from cbmdc3f contained surfactin, iturin and fengycin with four, two and four homologues per family, respectively, whereas four surfactin, one iturin and one fengycin homologues were identified in the lf. for some surfactin homologues, their uv-maldi-tof/tof (ms/ms; laser induced decomposition method, lid) spectra were also obtained. mass spectrometry analysis contributed with relevant information about the type of lipopeptides that bacillus strains can synthesize. from our results, surfactin would be the main metabolite responsible for the antibacterial effect.

TI  == [specific bacterial diversity in bats of different food guilds in southern sierra oaxaca, mexico].
AB  == specific bacterial diversity in bats of different food guilds in southern sierra  oaxaca, mexico. bats have different ecologic roles in variable ecosystems that have been already described. they have been linked to several zoonoses, however little is known about the relationship between bat microbiota and their diet, and studies on the bacterial ecology of the microbiota in bats are limited. to contribute with the description of this important interaction between microbiota  and host, the aim of this work was to characterize the composition and bacterial  diversity in the oral and anal regions of 10 species of bats, in relation to food guild. for this monthly samplings were conducted using four mist nets (19:00-24:00h) from february to october 2012; nets were reviewed every 45 minutes. each captured organism was sampled in the oral and anal cavities with sterile swabs; these were placed in pre-enrichment media and stored at 4 degrees  c. bacterial samples were studied which through selective media, chromogenic and  biochemical tests. we obtained samples from 502 frugivorous, 29 hematophagous and 11 nectivorous bats. we found a total of 26 bacterial species, with the predominant phylum proteobacteria and the family enterobacteriaceae. statistically significant differences were observed between oral and anal microhabitats: frugivorous (t = -3.516, g.1 = 14.761, p = 0.003), hematophagous (t = -3.320, g.l = 19.262, p = 0.003), and nectivorous (t = -2.497, g.l = 11.933, p = 0.026), and in some guilds [frugivorous and nectivorous in the anal region (t = 2.274, g.l = 29.660, p = 0.030), hematophagous and nectivorous anal region (t = 2.077, g.l = 29.904, p = 0.049)]. it was also shown that there is bacteria specificity in some guilds such as nectivorous and frugivorous with bacillus cereus, b. sp. x. sp., as well as, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermis, aeromonas hydrophyla in hematophagous. bacterial presence can be explained by the type of diet and/or by transfer of bacteria from their preys. these bacteria may be indigenous to these bats and play the role of mutual benefit, providing the host with stable growth conditions and supplemental nutrients, while the microbiota contributes to host nutrition, development of the immune system, stabilization of the microbial population and to avoid pathogens colonization. by understanding the importance of the relation- ship between host and its bacterial populations, the conservation efforts being made to protect species such as bats may be improved.

TI  == characterisation of antimicrobial extracts from dandelion root (taraxacum officinale) using lc-spe-nmr.
AB  == plant extracts have traditionally been used as sources of natural antimicrobial compounds, although in many cases, the compounds responsible for their antimicrobial efficacy have not been identified. in this study, crude and dialysed extracts from dandelion root (taraxacum officinale) were evaluated for their antimicrobial properties against gram positive and gram negative bacterial  strains. the methanol hydrophobic crude extract (dre3) demonstrated the strongest inhibition of microbial growth against staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus and bacillus cereus strains. normal phase (np) fractionation of dre3 resulted in two fractions (npf4 and npf5) with enhanced antimicrobial activity. further np fractionation of npf4 resulted in two fractions (npf403 and npf406) with increased antimicrobial activity. further isolation and characterisation of compounds in npf406 using liquid chromatography solid phase extraction nuclear magnetic resonance lc-spe-nmr resulted in the identification of 9-hydroxyoctadecatrienoic acid and 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, while the phenolic compounds vanillin, coniferaldehyde and p-methoxyphenylglyoxylic acid were also identified respectively. the molecular mass of these compounds was confirmed by lc mass spectroscopy (ms)/ms. in summary, the antimicrobial efficacy of dandelion root extracts demonstrated in this study support the use of dandelion root as a source of natural antimicrobial compounds. copyright (c) 2015 john wiley & sons, ltd.

TI  == quantitative and qualitative evaluation of bio-aerosols in surgery rooms and emergency department of an educational hospital.
AB  == background: bio-aerosols are a potential hazard in hospitals and are mostly produced by hospital staff, patients and visitors. bio-aerosols are solid or liquid particles pending in the air and they consist of aerosols accompanying micro-organisms or organic compounds of micro-organisms such as endotoxin, metabolite, toxin and other parts of organism. those are a potential hazard in hospitals and are mostly produced by hospital staff, patients and visitors. objectives: this study aimed to determine the types and amount of bacterial contamination in operating rooms and emergency department of an educational hospital in zahedan, south-east of iran. materials and methods: in this study, 72 samples were collected from three operating rooms and three rooms in the emergency department of an educational hospital during 2012. on the first day of  every month, a sample was taken from each room during the morning shift; active sampling was done on plates consisting of blood agar and brain-heart infusion agar (bhi) for 10 minutes in the axis of a one-story anderson impactor (flow rate 28.1 litter per minutes) and sibata air pump sip 32-l and samples were then placed in a 35 degrees c incubator. bacterial colonies were counted; warm coloring and differential tests were done and the data were analyzed using mann-whitney u and kruskal-wallis tests. results: seventeen types of bacteria were detected including staphylococcus, micrococcus, viridians, pneumococcus, escherichia coli, streptococcus, bacillus cereus, b. subtilis, klebsiella, pseudomonas, diphtheroid, citrobacter and enterobacter. quantitative bacterial results showed that the number of observed bacteria in the emergency department with an average of 103.88 +/- 33.84 cfu/m(3) was more than that of the surgery rooms with an average of 63.32 +/- 32.94 cfu/m(3). furthermore, the highest average number of all counted colonies (106 +/- 28.45 cfu/m(3)) was determined in autumn. in all samples, s. aureus and micrococcus were the most detected bacteria. conclusions: the world health organization (who) has suggested relatively relaxed limits of 100 cfu/m(3) for bacteria and 50 cfu/m(3) for fungi  in the hospital air. therefore, quantitative and qualitative outcomes of this study demonstrate that contamination level and bacterial variety in surgery rooms and emergency departments is high and effective measures must be taken to control the possible health risks.

TI  == an outbreak of gastroenteritis linked to a buffet lunch served at a canberra restaurant.
AB  == in 2013, an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness occurred following a buffet lunch at a restaurant in canberra. an investigation was conducted to identify the cause of illness and to implement appropriate public health measures to prevent further disease. we conducted a retrospective cohort study via telephone interviews, using a structured questionnaire developed from the restaurant buffet menu. a case was defined as someone who ate the buffet lunch at the restaurant on the implicated date and developed any symptoms of gastrointestinal illness (such  as diarrhoea, abdominal pain and nausea) following the consumption of food. a total of 74% (225/303) of known attendees were interviewed, of whom 56% (125/225) had become ill. the median incubation period and duration of illness were 13 and  19 hours respectively. the most commonly reported symptoms were diarrhoea (94%, 118/125) and abdominal pain (82%, 103/125). a toxin-mediated gastrointestinal illness was suspected based on the incubation period, duration of illness and the symptoms. the environmental health investigation identified a lack of designated  hand washing facilities in the kitchen, an absence of thermometers for measuring  food temperatures and several maintenance and minor cleaning issues. a number of  food samples were taken for microbiological analysis. multivariable analysis showed that illness was significantly associated with consuming curried prawns (or 18.4, 95% ci 8.6-39.3, p < 0.001) and caesar salad (or 3.6, 95% ci 1.8-7.5, p 0.001). enterotoxin-producing staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus were identified in leftover samples of cooked buffet food, but this food was not epidemiologically implicated. the investigation suggested that a breakdown in cleanliness, temperature control and food handling practices may have resulted in contamination of the buffet food. in order to prevent such outbreaks in the future, caterers and restaurateurs need to ensure they have the appropriate facilities and procedures in place if planning to cater for large groups.

TI  == evaluation of haccp system implementation on the quality of mixed fresh-cut salad prepared in a university canteen: a case study.
AB  == the increasing awareness that foods can represent vehicles for health risk factors has caused scientists and public authorities to multiply their efforts to reduce these risks to within acceptable limits. nevertheless, some challenging issues still remain unsolved and new ones have recently emerged, such as the increase in outbreaks of foodborne diseases originating from the consumption of meals at catering facilities. the study described in this article was aimed at evaluating the microbiological quality of mixed fresh-cut salads at an italian university canteen operating in conformity with the hazard analysis and critical  control point (haccp) system. the effectiveness of the preventive and corrective  measures taken was also assessed with respect to the frequency of unsatisfactory  salad samples. during the investigation, e. coli, salmonella spp., and listeria monocytogenes were never detected. by contrast, a high number of samples exceeded the mandatory or suggested limits for food processing hygiene (in terms of mesophilic aerobes, coliforms, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and sulfite-reducing clostridia counts). despite the introduction of a series of preventive and corrective actions, the results were only partially satisfactory;  this was most likely due to the impossibility of having available an adequate level of human resources that are indispensable to correctly putting the haccp procedures into daily practice.

TI  == effects of climate change on the persistence and dispersal of foodborne bacterial pathogens in the outdoor environment: a review.
AB  == abstract according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc), warming of the climate system is unequivocal. over the coming century, warming trends such as increased duration and frequency of heat waves and hot extremes are expected in some areas, as well as increased intensity of some storm systems. climate-induced trends will impact the persistence and dispersal of foodborne pathogens in myriad ways, especially for environmentally ubiquitous and/or zoonotic microorganisms. animal hosts of foodborne pathogens are also expected to be impacted by climate change through the introduction of increased physiological stress and, in some cases, altered geographic ranges and seasonality. this review article examines the effects of climatic factors, such as temperature, rainfall,  drought and wind, on the environmental dispersal and persistence of bacterial foodborne pathogens, namely, bacillus cereus, brucella, campylobacter, clostridium, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio and yersinia enterocolitica. these relationships are then used to  predict how future climatic changes will impact the activity of these microorganisms in the outdoor environment and associated food safety issues. the  development of predictive models that quantify these complex relationships will also be discussed, as well as the potential impacts of climate change on transmission of foodborne disease from animal hosts.

TI  == propidium monoazide combined with real-time pcr for selective detection of viable staphylococcus aureus in milk powder and meat products.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is a spherical, gram-positive, pathogenic bacterium commonly associated with bovine mastitis and clinical infections. it is also recognized as a pathogen that causes outbreaks of food poisoning. the objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a rapid and reliable technique that combines propidium monoazide (pma) staining with real-time quantitative (q)pcr to detect and quantify viable cells of staph. aureus in milk powder and meat products. the inclusivity and exclusivity of the assay were evaluated using 58 strains belonging to 14 species. serial dilutions of staph. aureus cells were used to establish a standard curve and to confirm the effect of pma treatment. milk powder and meat products were used as the spiked foods, and the ability of pma-qpcr to eliminate nonviable cells was determined in milk powder. furthermore, meat products were inoculated with different concentrations of staph. aureus and  10(5) cfu/g of bacillus cereus and salmonella enterica to test the interference by nontarget microorganisms. when pma treatment was applied before dna extraction, we were able to eliminate false-positive results with little effect on viable cells. the pma-qpcr assay was specific and more sensitive than conventional pcr, and the level of detection was 3.0x10(2) cfu/g in spiked milk powder. additionally, we observed no significant interference for the detection of viable staph. aureus from other nontarget bacteria. the pma-qpcr protocol is an effective and rapid method to quantify viable cells of staph. aureus in food samples. the pma-qpcr assay is specific and reliable, offering a valuable diagnostic tool for routine analysis in food and clinical diagnostic research at  a reasonable cost.

TI  == the cyclic antibacterial peptide enterocin as-48: isolation, mode of action, and  possible food applications.
AB  == enterocin as-48 is a circular bacteriocin produced by enterococcus. it contains a 70 amino acid-residue chain circularized by a head-to-tail peptide bond. the conformation of enterocin as-48 is arranged into five alpha-helices with a compact globular structure. enterocin as-48 has a wide inhibitory spectrum on gram-positive bacteria. sensitivity of gram-negative bacteria increases in combination with outer-membrane permeabilizing treatments. eukaryotic cells are bacteriocin-resistant. this cationic peptide inserts into bacterial membranes and causes membrane permeabilization, leading ultimately to cell death. microarray analysis revealed sets of up-regulated and down-regulated genes in bacillus cereus cells treated with sublethal bacteriocin concentration. enterocin as-48 can be purified in two steps or prepared as lyophilized powder from cultures in whey-based substrates. the potential applications of enterocin as-48 as a food biopreservative have been corroborated against foodborne pathogens and/or toxigenic bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica) and spoilage bacteria (alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, bacillus spp., paenibacillus spp., geobacillus stearothermophilus, brochothrix thermosphacta, staphylococcus carnosus, lactobacillus sakei and other spoilage lactic acid bacteria). the efficacy of enterocin as-48 in food systems increases greatly in combination with chemical preservatives, essential oils, phenolic compounds, and physico-chemical treatments such as sublethal heat, high-intensity pulsed-electric fields or high  hydrostatic pressure.

TI  == microbiological quality of seasoned roasted laver and potential hazard control in a real processing line.
AB  == microbiological quality of laver, one of the edible seaweeds, has not been reported in a real processing line. laver or supplements were collected from six  manufacturers (a to f) to assess potential microbiological hazards and the critical control points in commercial processing lines. aerobic plate counts (apc), coliform counts, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, and vibrio parahaemolyticus were enumerated, and the presence of b. cereus, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, s. aureus, and v. parahaemolyticus were confirmed during processing. the raw material, i.e., dried laver, had a high initial apc level (4.4 to 7.8 log cfu/g), which decreased gradually during processing (final  products, 1.3 to 5.9 log cfu/g). coliforms and b. cereus were not detected in any of the final products, but they were present in some raw materials and semiprocessed products in quantitative analysis. after enrichment for recovery of stress-injured cells, e. coli and foodborne pathogens were not detected in any samples, with the exception of b. cereus. heat-injured and spore-forming b. cereus isolates were occasionally obtained from some of the raw materials and products after enrichment, thus b. cereus may be a potential microbiological hazard that should be controlled using strategic intervention measures. secondary roasting (260 to 400 degrees c, 2 to 10 s) significantly reduced the apc (maximum log reduction, 4.7 log cfu/g), and this could be a key intervention step for controlling microbiological hazards during processing (critical control point). when this step was performed appropriately, according to the processing guide for each plant, the microorganisms were inactivated more successfully in the products. this study provides scientific evidence that may facilitate the development of strategies for microbiological hazard control and hygienic management guidelines for real manufacturing plants.

AB  == antimicrobial preservative compounds are added to foods to target specific pathogens and spoilage organisms. white mustard essential oil (wmeo) is an extract that contains 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate, a compound which has been demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity in limited studies. the objective of  this research was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of wmeo against gram-positive and gram-negative spoilage and pathogenic bacteria and determine the effect of food components on the antimicrobial activity. the bacteria escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, enterobacter  aerogenes, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, and lactobacillus fermentum, as well as the acid- and preservative-resistant yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe, were evaluated. all microorganisms were inhibited by wmeo at 8.3 g/liter (equivalent to 1,000 mg/liter 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate). in general, wmeo was more effective against gram-negative than against gram-positive bacteria. salmonella enteritidis and s. pombe were the most sensitive, with inhibition at as low as 2.1 g/liter. the effects on growth profiles varied but included increased lag phases and lethality, indicating both  bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity. soybean oil had a negative effect on the efficacy of wmeo against l. monocytogenes, and at 5% soybean oil, the antimicrobial activity against salmonella enteritidis was eliminated after 48 h.  sodium caseinate at 1% also negated the antimicrobial effect of wmeo against salmonella enteritidis and decreased its effectiveness against l. monocytogenes.  the presence of starch had no significant effect on the antimicrobial activity of wmeo against l. monocytogenes and salmonella enteritidis. thus, wmeo is effective against a wide range of microorganisms and has potential to be used in foods, depending upon the target microorganism and food components present.

TI  == antibacterial and cytotoxic potential of silver nanoparticles synthesized using latex of calotropis gigantea l.
AB  == the present study aimed to synthesis silver nanoparticles (agnps) in a greener route using aqueous latex extract of calotropis gigantea l. toward biomedical applications. initially, synthesis of agnps was confirmed through uv-vis spectroscopy which shows the surface plasmonic resonance peak (spr) at 420 nm. fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) analysis provides clear evidence that protein fractions present in the latex extract act as reducing and stabilizing bio agents. energy dispersive x-ray (edax) spectroscopy confirms the  presence of silver as a major constituent element. x-ray diffractograms displays  that the synthesized agnps were biphasic crystalline nature. electron microscopic studies such as field emission scanning electron microscopic (fe-sem) and transmission electron microscope (tem) reveals that synthesized agnps are spherical in shape with the size range between 5 and 30 nm. further, crude latex  aqueous extract and synthesized agnps were evaluated against different bacterial  pathogens such as bacillus cereus, enterococci sp, shigella sp, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. compared to the crude latex aqueous extract, biosynthesized agnps exhibits a remarkable antimicrobial activity. likewise in vitro anticancer study manifests the cytotoxicity value of synthesized agnps against tested hela cells. the output of this study clearly suggesting that biosynthesized agnps using latex of c. gigantea can be used as promising nanomaterial for therapeutic application in context with nanodrug formulation.

TI  == antibacterial activity and genotypic-phenotypic characteristics of bacteriocin-producing bacillus subtilis kku213: potential as a probiotic strain.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity and probiotic properties of bacillus subtilis strain kku213, isolated from local soil, were investigated. the cell-free supernatant (cfs) of a kku213 culture containing crude bacteriocins exhibited inhibitory effects on gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus. the antibacterial activity of the cfs precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate (as) remained even after treatment at 60 and 100 degrees c, at ph 4 and 10 and with proteolytic enzymes, detergents and heavy metals. when analyzed by sds-page and overlaid with the indicator strains b. cereus and s. aureus, the 40% as precipitate exhibited inhibitory activity on proteins smaller than 10 kda. however, proteins larger than 25 kda and smaller than 10 kda were still observed on a native protein gel.  purified subtilosin a was prepared by amberlite xad-16 bead extraction and hplc and analyzed by nano-lc-qtof-ms. its molecular mass was found to be 3.4 kda, and  it retained its antibacterial activity. these results are consistent with the detection of the anti-listerial subtilosin a gene of the sbo/alb cluster in the kku213 strain, which is 100% identical to that of b. subtilis subsp. subtilis 168. in addition to stable and cyclic subtilosin a, a mixture of many extracellular antibacterial peptides was also detected in the kku213 culture. the kku213 strain produced extracellular amylase, cellulase, lipase and protease, is  highly acid-resistant (ph 2) when cultured in inulin and promotes health and reduces infection of intestinally colonized broiler chickens. therefore, we propose that bacteriocin-producing b. subtilis kku213 could be used as a potential probiotic strain or protective culture.

TI  == pharmacological basis for the medicinal use of linum usitatissimum (flaxseed) in  infectious and non-infectious diarrhea.
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: linum usitatissimum, commonly known as flaxseed has traditionally been used for the management of diarrhea and gastrointestinal infections. this study was planned to assess pharmacological basis for the medicinal use of flaxseed in infectious and non-infectious diarrhea. materials and methods: the crude aqueous-methanolic extract of flaxseed was studied using the in vivo castor oil-induced diarrhea, gut motility and enteropooling assays. mechanistic basis was further elucidated by testing the inhibitory effect on spontaneously contracting isolated rabbit jejunum preparations, suspended in a 10ml tissue bath containing tyrode solution, maintained at 37 degrees c and aerated with carbogen. antibacterial efficacy of the flaxseed extract was tested  against different enteric and non-enteric pathogenic bacteria using in vitro antibacterial assays. results: flaxseed extract reduced the diarrheal score in mice, by 39%, 63.90% and 68.34% at the respective doses of 100, 300 and 500mg/kg. intestinal secretions were reduced by 24.12%, 28.09% and 38.80%, whereas the intestinal motility was reduced by 31.66%, 46.98% and 56.20% at respective doses  of 100, 300 and 500mg/kg. when tested on isolated rabbit jejunum preparations, flaxseed extract produced a dose-dependent inhibition of both spontaneous and high k(+) (80mm)-induced contractions, and shifted the concentration-response curves of ca(++) to the right with suppression of the maximum response, similar to that caused by verapamil. flaxseed extract was found to possess bactericidal activity at the tested concentrations of 12.5mg/ml, against vancomycin-resistant  enterococcus faecalis (100%), escherichia coli k1 (88.88%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (98.76%), bacillus cereus (92.64%), pseudomonas aeruginosa  (76.83%) and salmonella typhi (26.91+/-3.35%). the concentration of 10mg/ml showed bactericidal effects against all the aforementioned pathogens except escherichia coli k1, whereas for pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhi, it  was bacteriostatic at this concentration. conclusions: our results indicate that  linum usitatissimum (flaxseed) extract exhibits antidiarrheal and antispasmodic activities by virtue of its antimotility and antisecretory effects which are mediated possibly through inhibition of ca(++) channels, though additional mechanism(s) cannot be ruled out. flaxseed extract proved effective against both  enteric and non-enteric pathogens causing diarrhea, thus ensuring wide coverage and rationalizing its medicinal use in both the infectious and non-infectious diarrhea.

TI  == kawasaki disease-specific molecules in the sera are linked to microbe-associated  molecular patterns in the biofilms.
AB  == background: kawasaki disease (kd) is a systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology. the innate immune system is involved in its pathophysiology at the acute phase. we have recently established a novel murine model of kd coronary arteritis by oral administration of a synthetic microbe-associated molecular pattern (mamp). on the hypothesis that specific mamps exist in kd sera, we have searched them to  identify kd-specific molecules and to assess the pathogenesis. methods: we performed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (lc-ms) analysis of fractionated serum samples from 117 patients with kd and 106 controls. microbiological and lc-ms evaluation of biofilm samples were also performed. results: kd samples elicited proinflammatory cytokine responses from human coronary artery endothelial cells (hcaecs). by lc-ms analysis of kd serum samples collected at 3 different periods, we detected a variety of kd-specific molecules  in the lipophilic fractions that showed distinct m/z and ms/ms fragmentation patterns in each cluster. serum kd-specific molecules showed m/z and ms/ms fragmentation patterns almost identical to those of mamps obtained from the biofilms formed in vitro (common mamps from bacillus cereus, yersinia pseudotuberculosis and staphylococcus aureus) at the 1st study period, and from the biofilms formed in vivo (common mamps from bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis/bacillus cereus/yersinia pseudotuberculosis and staphylococcus aureus) at the 2nd and 3rd periods. the biofilm extracts from bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, yersinia pseudotuberculosis and staphylococcus aureus also induced proinflammatory cytokines by hcaecs. by the experiments with igg affinity chromatography, some of these serum kd-specific molecules bound to igg. conclusions: we herein conclude that serum kd-specific molecules were mostly derived from biofilms and possessed molecular structures common to mamps from bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, yersinia pseudotuberculosis and staphylococcus aureus. discovery of these kd-specific molecules might offer novel insight into the diagnosis and management of kd as well as its pathogenesis.

TI  == prevalence and characterization of foodborne pathogens from australian dairy farm environments.
AB  == the ability of foodborne pathogens to gain entry into food supply systems remains an ongoing concern. in dairy products, raw milk acts as a major vehicle for this  transfer; however, the sources of pathogenic bacteria that contaminate raw milk are often not clear, and environmental sources of contamination or the animals themselves may contribute to the transfer. this survey examined the occurrence of 9 foodborne pathogens in raw milk and environments of 7 dairy farms (3 bovine, 3  caprine, and 1 ovine farm) in summer and autumn, in victoria, australia. a total  of 120 samples were taken from sampling points common to dairy farms, including pasture, soil, feed, water sources, animal feces, raw milk, and milk filters. the prevalence of the bacillus cereus group, campylobacter, clostridium perfringens,  cronobacter, shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli, listeria, salmonella, coagulase-positive staphylococci (cps), and yersinia enterocolitica across the farms was investigated. the 2 most prevalent bacteria, which were detected on all farms, were the b. cereus group, isolated from 41% of samples, followed by cl. perfringens, which was isolated from 38% of samples. the highest occurrence of any pathogen was the b. cereus group in soil, present in 93% of samples tested. fecal samples showed the highest diversity of pathogens, containing 7 of the 9 pathogens tested. salmonella was isolated from 1 bovine farm, although it was found in multiple samples on both visits. out of the 14 occurrences where any pathogen was detected in milk filters, only 5 (36%) of the corresponding raw milk samples collected at the same time were positive for the same pathogen. all of the cps were staphylococcus aureus, and were found in raw milk or milk filter samples from 6 of the 7 farms, but not in other sample types. pathogenic listeria species were detected on 3 of the 7 farms, and included 4 l. ivanovii-positive samples, and 1 l. monocytogenes-positive water sample. shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli were identified in fecal samples from 3 of the 7 farms and in a  single raw milk sample. cronobacter species were identified on 4 of the 7 farms,  predominantly in feed samples. no y. enterocolitica was detected. results of this study demonstrate high standards of pathogen safety across the 7 farms, with a low incidence of pathogens detected in raw milk samples. monitoring feed contamination levels may help control the spread of bacterial species such as cl. perfringens and b. cereus through the farm environment, which is a natural reservoir for these organisms.

AB  == screening of biopolymeric gel beads containing silver nanoparticles (ag-nps) stabilized in guar gum alkyl amine (ggaa) and ciprofloxacin (cip) was carried out in order to obtain a novel nanocomposite with controlled release profile of both  antimicrobians. the selected matrix composed of alginate/high methoxyl pectin (hmp)/ggaa (4:4:1) was able to co-incorporate ag-nps and cip with encapsulation efficiency higher than 70%. sem images revealed good cohesivity and compatibility between the biopolymers and the cargos. beads provided protection against ag-nps  degradation at acidic phs and hmp would played a key role providing hydrophobic regions. while cip release profile showed a ph independent diffusional process, ag-nps release was restricted to matrix erodability. calcium quelating agents and/or alginate degrading enzymes could modulate the release profile. the bactericidal activity of beads was tested in liquid medium, showing cooperative effects between the antimicrobials against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus. tem images confirmed interaction of ag-nps with bacterial surfaces followed by membrane damage. results suggested  the nanocomposite matrix as a promising system for oral treatment of intestinal infectious diseases caused by multidrug resistant and unknown microorganisms, since both cip and ag-nps would be able to reach intestine in the active form.

AB  == in the current work, in vitro antioxidant, antibacterial, and antifungal activites of the needle terpenes of three taxa of pinus nigra from serbia (ssp. nigra, ssp. pallasiana, and var. banatica) were analyzed. the black pine essential oils showed generally weak antioxidative properties tested by two methods (dpph and abts scavenging assays), where the highest activity was identified in p. nigra var. banatica (ic50=25.08 mg/ml and vitc=0.67 mg (vitamin  c)/g when tested with the dpph and abts reagents, respectively). in the antimicrobial assays, one fungal (aspergilus niger) and two bacterial strains (staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus) showed sensitivity against essential  oils of all three p. nigra taxa. the tested oils have been shown to possess inhibitory action in the range from 20.00 to 0.62 mg/ml, where var. banatica exhibited the highest and ssp. nigra the lowest antimicrobial action. in order to determine potential compounds that are responsible for alternative mode of action, molecular docking simulations inside ftsz (a prokaryotic homolog of tubulin) were performed. tested compounds were the most abundant terpenoid (germacrene d-4-ol) and its structurally similar terpene (germacrene d), both present in all three essential oils. it was determined that the oxygenated form of the molecule creates stable bonds with investigated enzyme ftsz, and that this compound, through this mechanism of action participates in the antimicrobial activity.

TI  == reducing pathogens by using zinc oxide nanoparticles and acetic acid in sheep meat.
AB  == practical applications of different concentrations (0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 mm) of zinc oxide (zno) suspensions containing 1 % acetic acid were investigated against the pathogenic bacteria listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus, and bacillus cereus. zno suspensions (0, 1, 3, 6, and 8 mm) containing acetic acid had a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of l. monocytogenes, e. coli, and s. aureus during 12 h of incubation, and the 8 mm suspensions of zno were the most effective against all the strains. these data suggested that the antibacterial activity of zno was concentration dependent. thus, 6 and 8 mm zno were selected for further studies in meat. zno nanoparticles reduced initial growth of all inoculated strains in meat. to our knowledge, this  is the first report describing the antibacterial activity of zno nanoparticles in meat and indicates the potential of these nanoparticles as an antibacterial agent in the food industry.

TI  == bacteriological quality of vegetables from organic and conventional production in different areas of korea.
AB  == foods grown in organic production systems have been described as representing an  increased risk to public health compared with foods from conventional production. leafy vegetables (spinach, romaine lettuce, and green sesame leaves) grown in organic and conventional systems were collected from various areas in korea and examined using standard culture methods to compare the microbiological quality of the produce grown in the two agricultural systems. the 354 samples of these leafy vegetables were analyzed for levels of indicator bacteria (aerobic bacteria, coliforms, and escherichia coli) and the prevalence of the pathogens staphylococcus aureus, e. coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus,  and salmonella. aerobic bacteria and coliforms were detected in all vegetable types, but nonpathogenic e. coli was below the limit of detection in all samples. b. cereus was the most prevalent pathogen, found on 7 (11.1%) of the 63 organic spinach samples. the prevalence of s. aureus was highest in organic sesame leaves; it was found on 5 (8.0%) of the 63 samples. the prevalence of l. monocytogenes was highest on organic romaine lettuce and spinach; it was found in 4 (6.4%) of 63 samples of each type of vegetable. e. coli o157:h7 found on only 1 (1.58%) of 55 conventional spinach samples. these results suggest that farming type at most only slightly affects the hygienic quality of leafy vegetables, and  no effect was found for sample collection area. salmonella was not isolated from  any of the conventional or organic leafy vegetables. these results do not support the hypothesis that organic produce poses a substantially greater risk of pathogen contamination than does conventional produce.

TI  == unsaturated fatty acid, cis-2-decenoic acid, in combination with disinfectants or antibiotics removes pre-established biofilms formed by food-related bacteria.
AB  == biofilm formation by food-related bacteria and food-related pathogenesis are significant problems in the food industry. even though much disinfection and mechanical procedure exist for removal of biofilms, they may fail to eliminate pre-established biofilms. cis-2 decenoic acid (cda), an unsaturated fatty acid messenger produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa, is reportedly capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms by multiple types of microorganisms. however, whether cda has potential to boost the actions of certain antimicrobials is unknown. here, the activity of cda as an inducer of pre-established biofilms dispersal, formed by four main food pathogens; staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, salmonella enterica and e. coli, was measured using both semi-batch and continuous cultures bioassays. to assess the ability of cda combined biocides treatments to remove pre-established biofilms formed on stainless steel discs, cfu counts were performed for both treated and untreated cultures. eradication of the biofilms by cda combined antibiotics was evaluated using crystal violet staining. the effect of cda combined treatments (antibiotics and disinfectants) on biofilm surface area and bacteria viability was evaluated using fluorescence microscopy, digital image analysis and live/dead staining. mics were also determined to assess the probable inhibitory effects of cda combined treatments on the growth of tested microorganisms' planktonic cells. treatment of pre-established biofilms with only 310 nm cda resulted in at least two-fold increase in the number of planktonic cells in all cultures. while antibiotics or  disinfectants alone exerted a trivial effect on cfu counts and percentage of surface area covered by the biofilms, combinational treatments with both 310 nm cda and antibiotics or disinfectants led to approximate 80% reduction in biofilm  biomass. these data suggests that combined treatments with cda would pave the way toward developing new strategies to control biofilms with widespread applications in industry as well as medicine.

TI  == development of 23 individual taqman(r) real-time pcr assays for identifying common foodborne pathogens using a single set of amplification conditions.
AB  == most of the acute intestinal diseases are caused by foodborne pathogens with infants and elderly people being at major risk. the aim of this study was to develop a procedure to simultaneously detect 20 foodborne pathogens in complex alimentary matrices such as milk, cheese and meat. the list of targets include, among the others, listeria spp., salmonella spp., shigella spp., escherichia coli spp., campylobacter spp., clostridium spp. and staphylococcus aureus. the accuracy of detection was determined by using atcc strains as positive and negative controls. the achieved sensitivity of each of assays was 1 pg of genomic dna, which was equivalent to approximately 1 cfu. the working ranges of the taqman((r)) real-time pcr assays, when used quantitatively on cheese and meat samples inoculated with serial dilution of listeria spp., listeria monocytogenes, s. aureus, salmonella enterica, shigella boydii, e. coli o157:h7, bacillus cereus, campylobacter coli, yersinia enterocolitica, enterobacter sakazakii and pseudomonas aeruginosa was 10(8) cfu/g to 10(4) cfu/g. no matrix interferences were observed.

TI  == evaluation of indirect impedance for measuring microbial growth in complex food matrices.
AB  == the suitability of indirect impedance to accurately measure microbial growth in real food matrices was investigated. a variety of semi-solid and liquid food products were inoculated with bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus plantarum, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella enteriditis, candida tropicalis or zygosaccharomyces rouxii and co2 production was monitored using a conductimetric (don whitely r.a.b.i.t.) system. the majority (80%) of food and microbe combinations produced  a detectable growth signal. the linearity of conductance responses in selected food products was investigated and a good correlation (r(2) >/= 0.84) was observed between inoculum levels and times to detection. specific growth rate estimations from the data were sufficiently accurate for predictive modeling in some cases. this initial evaluation of the suitability of indirect impedance to generate microbial growth data in complex food matrices indicates significant potential for the technology as an alternative to plating methods.

TI  == influence of acetylation degree and molecular weight of homogeneous chitosans on  antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  == the results given in the literature are conflicting when considering the relationship between antimicrobial activity and chitosan characteristics. to be able to clarify, we prepared fifteen homogeneous chitosans with different acetylation degrees (da) and molecular weights (mw) by reacetylation of a fully deacetylated chitin under homogeneous conditions. they were tested at different ph values for their antimicrobial activities against four gram-negative bacteria  (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhi), four gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis and micrococcus luteus) and three fungi (aspergillus niger, fusarium oxysporum and alternaria solani). chitosans markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria and fungi tested, although the inhibitory effect depends on the type of microorganism and on the chitosan characteristics (da and mw) with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.001 to 0.1 w%. considering chitosan efficiency on bacteria, our series of data clearly show that the lower da and the lower ph give the larger efficiency. antibacterial activity was further enhanced for gram-negative bacteria with decreasing mw, whereas, opposite effect was observed with the gram-positive. concerning the antifungal activity, the influence of chitosan characteristics was dependent on the particular type of fungus. fungal growth decreased with increasing mw for f. oxysporum and decreasing da for a. solani, but no mw or da dependences were observed with a. niger.

TI  == biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using acacia leucophloea extract and their antibacterial activity.
AB  == the immense potential of nanobiotechnology makes it an intensely researched field in modern medicine. green nanomaterial synthesis techniques for medicinal applications are desired because of their biocompatibility and lack of toxic byproducts. we report the toxic byproducts free phytosynthesis of stable silver nanoparticles (agnps) using the bark extract of the traditional medicinal plant acacia leucophloea (fabaceae). visual observation, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (tem) were used to characterize the synthesized agnps. the visible yellow-brown color formation and  surface plasmon resonance at 440 nm indicates the biosynthesis of agnp. the tem images show polydisperse, mostly spherical agnp particles of 17-29 nm. fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that primary amines, aldehyde/ketone, aromatic, azo, and nitro compounds of the a. leucophloea extract may participate  in the bioreduction and capping of the formed agnps. x-ray diffraction confirmed  the crystallinity of the agnps. the in vitro agar well diffusion method confirmed the potential antibacterial activity of the plant extract and synthesized agnps against the common bacterial pathogens staphylococcus aureus (mtcc 737), bacillus cereus (mtcc 1272), listeria monocytogenes (mtcc 657), and shigella flexneri (mtcc 1475). this research combines the inherent antimicrobial activity of silver metals with the a. leucophloea extract, yielding antibacterial activity-enhanced  agnps. this new biomimetic approach using traditional medicinal plant (a. leucophloea) barks to synthesize biocompatible antibacterial agnps could easily be scaled up for additional biomedical applications. these polydisperse agnps green-synthesized via a. leucophloea bark extract can readily be used in many applications not requiring high uniformity in particle size or shape.

TI  == cyclic lipodepsipeptides produced by pseudomonas spp. naturally present in raw milk induce inhibitory effects on microbiological inhibitor assays for antibiotic residue screening.
AB  == two pseudomonas strains, identified as closely related to pseudomonas tolaasii, were isolated from milk of a farm with frequent false-positive delvotest results  for screening putative antibiotic residues in raw milk executed as part of the regulatory quality programme. growth at 5 to 7 degrees c of these isolates in milk resulted in high lipolysis and the production of bacterial inhibitors. the two main bacterial inhibitors have a molecular weight of 1168.7 and 1140.7 da respectively, are heat-tolerant and inhibit geobacillus stearothermophilus var. calidolactis, the test strain of most of the commercially available microbiological inhibitor tests for screening of antibiotic residues in milk. furthermore, these bacterial inhibitors show antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus and b. subtilis and also interfere negatively with yoghurt production. following their isolation and purification with rp-hplc, the inhibitors were identified by nmr analysis as cyclic lipodepsipeptides of the viscosin group. our findings bring to light a new challenge for quality control in the dairy industry. by prolonging the refrigerated storage of raw milk, the keeping quality of milk is influenced by growth and metabolic activities of psychrotrophic bacteria such as pseudomonads.  besides an increased risk of possible spoilage of long shelf-life milk, the production at low temperature of natural bacterial inhibitors may also result in  false-positive results for antibiotic residue screening tests based on microbial  inhibitor assays thus leading to undue production loss.

(1)h and (13)c shielding tensors for crystal structure were calculated with giao/dft/b3lyp/6-311++g(d,p) methods in cdcl3. the complexes were found to have general composition [ml2]. the results of elemental analysis showed 1:2 (metal/ligand) stoichiometry for all the complex. magnetic and spectral data indicate a square planar geometry for pd(ii) complex and a distorted tetrahedral  geometry for co(ii) complexes. the ligand and its metal chelates have been screened for their antimicrobial activities using the disk diffusion method against the selected gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus,  staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, gram negative bacteria: eschericha  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia. the inhibition activities of  these compounds on carbonic anhydrase ii (ca ii) and carbonic anhydrase i (ca i)  have been investigated by comparing ic50 and ki values and it has been found that pd(ii) complex have more enzyme inhibition efficiency than salptsmh and co(ii) complex.

AB  == water-based chitosans in the forms of oligochitosan (oligocs) and nanowhisker chitosan (cswk) are proposed as a novel food preservative based on a minced pork  model study. the high surface area with a positive charge over the neutral ph range (ph 5-8) of oligocs and cswk lead to an inhibition against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and bacillus cereus) and gram-negative microbes (salmonella enteritidis and escherichia coli o157:h7). in  the minced pork model, oligocs effectively performs a food preservative for shelf-life extension as clarified from the retardation of microbial growth, biogenic amine formation and lipid oxidation during the storage. oligocs maintains almost all myosin heavy chain protein degradation as observed in the electrophoresis. the present work points out that water-based chitosan with its unique morphology not only significantly inhibits antimicrobial activity but also maintains the meat quality with an extension of shelf-life, and thus has the potential to be used as a food preservative.

AB  == only limited information is available on the microbiological safety of fermented  alcoholic beverages because it is still a common belief that such beverages do not provide a favorable environment for bacterial growth and survival. thus, in this study, we examined the survival of major foodborne pathogens and spores in fermented alcoholic beverages. foodborne pathogens (bacillus cereus, escherichia  coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus) and b. cereus spores (initial population, 3 to 4 log cfu/ml) were inoculated separately into three types of beer and refined rice wine, which were then stored at 5 and 22 degrees c. bacterial counts were assayed periodically for up to 28 days. vegetative b. cereus counts decreased rapidly, whereas b. cereus spore counts remained constant (p > 0.05) for a long period of  time in all beverages. vegetative b. cereus cells formed spores in beer at 5 and  22 degrees c, and the spores survived for long periods. among vegetative cells, e. coli o157:h7 had the highest survival (only 1.49 to 1.56 log reduction during  28 days in beer at 5 degrees c). beer and refined rice wine supported microbial survival from several days to several weeks. our results appear to contradict the common belief that pathogens cannot survive in alcoholic beverages. long-term survival of pathogens (especially b. cereus and e. coli o157:h7) in beer and refined rice wine should be taken into consideration by the manufacturers of these beverages. this study provides basic information that should help further research into microbial survival in alcoholic beverages and increase the microbiological safety regulation of fermented alcoholic beverages.

AB  == background: despite existing strategies, bacterial contamination of platelets (plts) remains a problem, and reliable testing near the time of use is needed. we evaluated the bactx assay (immunetics, inc.), a rapid colorimetric assay for detection of bacterial peptidoglycan, for this purpose. study design and methods: apheresis- and whole blood-derived plt units, the latter tested in 6-unit pools,  inoculated with 10 representative bacterial species (eight aerobic, two anaerobic), were tested with the bactx assay at two sites to determine analytic sensitivity and time to detection. specificity on sterile plts and reproducibility across different plt units and assay kit lots was also determined. results: analytical sensitivity for the 10 bacterial species ranged from 6.3 x 10(2) to 7.6 x 10(4) colony-forming units (cfus)/ml. in time-to-detection studies after inoculation of plts with 0.7 to 5.3 cfus/ml, 10 replicates of all eight aerobic species were positive when bacterial titers were  above the analytic sensitivity detection limit, which occurred at 48 hours for 60 plt units and at 72 hours for the remaining 4 units, as well as at 7 days for all units. specificity was 99.8% and reproducibility was 100%. conclusions: the bactx assay had an analytical sensitivity below the 10(5) cfus/ml threshold of clinical significance, detected all eight aerobic bacterial species 48 to 72 hours after inoculation as well as at 7 days, and had high specificity and reproducibility. these findings suggest that the bactx assay will be a valuable test for detection of clinically relevant levels of bacterial contaminants in plt units and pools near time of use.

TI  == crystal and solution structure analysis of fhud2 from staphylococcus aureus in multiple unliganded conformations and bound to ferrioxamine-b.
AB  == iron acquisition is a central process for virtually all organisms. in staphylococcus aureus, fhud2 is a lipoprotein that is a high-affinity receptor for iron-bound hydroxamate siderophores. in this study, fhud2 was crystallized bound to ferrioxamine-b (fxb), and also in its ligand-free state; the latter structures are the first for hydroxamate-binding receptors within this protein family. the structure of the fhud2-fxb conformation shows that residues w197 and  r199 from the c-terminal domain donate hydrogen bonds to the hydroxamate oxygens, and a ring of aromatic residues cradles the aliphatic arms connecting the hydroxamate moieties of the siderophore. the available ligand-bound structures of fhud from escherichia coli and yfiy from bacillus cereus show that, despite a high degree of structural conservation, three protein families have evolved with  critical siderophore binding residues on either the c-terminal domain (s. aureus), the n-terminal domain (e. coli), or both (b. cereus). unliganded fhud2 was crystallized in five conformations related by rigid body movements of the n-  and c-terminal domains. small-angle x-ray scattering (saxs) indicates that the solution conformation of unliganded fhud2 is more compact than the conformations  observed in crystals. the ligand-induced conformational changes for fhud2 in solution are relatively modest and depend on the identity of the siderophore. the crystallographic and saxs results are used to discuss roles for the liganded and  unliganded forms of fhud2 in the siderophore transport mechanism.

TI  == diffusible signal factor (dsf) quorum sensing signal and structurally related molecules enhance the antimicrobial efficacy of antibiotics against some bacterial pathogens.
AB  == background: extensive use of antibiotics has fostered the emergence of superbugs  that are resistant to multidrugs, which becomes a great healthcare and public concern. previous studies showed that quorum sensing signal dsf (diffusible signal factor) not only modulates bacterial antibiotic resistance through intraspecies signaling, but also affects bacterial antibiotic tolerance through interspecies communication. these findings motivate us to exploit the possibility of using dsf and its structurally related molecules as adjuvants to influence antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial pathogens. results: in this study, we have demonstrated that dsf signal and its structurally related molecules could be used to induce bacterial antibiotic susceptibility. exogenous addition of dsf signal (cis-11-methyl-2-dodecenoic acid) and its structural analogues could significantly increase the antibiotic susceptibility of bacillus cereus, possibly through reducing drug-resistant activity, biofilm formation and bacterial fitness. the synergistic effect of dsf and its structurally related molecules with antibiotics on b. cereus is dosage-dependent. combination of dsf with gentamicin showed an obviously synergistic effect on b. cereus pathogenicity in an in vitro model. we also found that dsf could increase the antibiotic susceptibility of other bacterial species, including bacillus thuringiensis, staphylococcus aureus, mycobacterium smegmatis, neisseria subflava and pseudomonas aeruginosa. conclusion: the results indicate a promising potential of using dsf and its structurally related molecules as novel adjuvants to conventional antibiotics for treatment of infectious diseases caused by bacterial pathogens.

AB  == polyaniline colloids rank among promising application forms of this conducting polymer. cytotoxicity, antibacterial activity, and neutrophil oxidative burst tests were performed on cells treated with colloidal polyaniline dispersions. the antibacterial effect of colloidal polyaniline against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was most pronounced for bacillus cereus and escherichia coli, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 3,500 mug ml(-1). the data recorded on human keratinocyte (hacat) and a mouse embryonic fibroblast (nih/3t3) cell lines using an mtt assay and flow cytometry indicated a concentration-dependent cytotoxicity of colloid, with the absence of cytotoxic effect at around 150 mug ml(-1). the neutrophil oxidative burst test then showed  that colloidal polyaniline, in concentrations <150 mug ml(-1), was not able to stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species in neutrophils and whole human blood. however, it worked efficiently as a scavenger of those already formed.

TI  == cerecidins, novel lantibiotics from bacillus cereus with potent antimicrobial activity.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified antimicrobial peptides that are widely produced by gram-positive bacteria, including many species of the bacillus group. in the present study, one novel gene cluster coding lantibiotic cerecidins was unveiled in bacillus cereus strain as 1.1846 through genomic mining and pcr screening. the designated cer locus is different from that of conventional class ii lantibiotics in that it included seven tandem precursor cera genes, one modification gene (cerm), two processing genes (cert and cerp), one orphan regulator gene (cerr), and two immunity genes (cerf and cere). in addition, one unprecedented quorum sensing component, comqxpa, was inserted between cerm and cerr. the expression of cerecidins was not detected in this strain of b. cereus, which might be due to repressed transcription of cerm. we constitutively coexpressed cera genes and cerm in escherichia coli, and purified precerecidins were proteolytically processed with  the endoproteinase gluc and a truncated version of putative serine protease cerp. thus, two natural variants of cerecidins a1 and a7 were obtained which contained  two terminal nonoverlapping thioether rings rarely found in lantibiotics. both cerecidins a1 and a7 were active against a broad spectrum of gram-positive bacteria. cerecidin a7, especially its mutant dhb13a, showed remarkable efficacy  against multidrug-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mdrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre), and even streptomyces.

AB  == in the present work, a series of 0, 1 and 7 wt% silver nano-particles (ag nps) incorporated poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (plga) nano-fibers were synthesized by  the electrospinning process. the plga/ag nano-fibers sheets were characterized using sem, tem and dsc analyses. the three synthesized plga/silver nano-fiber composites were screened for anticancer activity against liver cancer cell line using mtt and ldh assays. the anticancer activity of plga nano-fibers showed a remarkable improvement due to increasing the concentration of the ag nps. in addition to the given result, plga nano-fibers did not show any cytotoxic effect. however, plga nano-fibers that contain 1 % nano silver showed anticancer activity of 8.8 %, through increasing the concentration of the nano silver to 7 % onto plga nano-fibers, the anticancer activity was enhanced to a 67.6 %. furthermore,  the antibacterial activities of these three nano-fibers, against the five bacteria strains namely; e.coli o157:h7 atcc 51659, staphylococcus aureus atcc 13565, bacillus cereus emcc 1080, listeria monocytogenes emcc 1875 and salmonella typhimurium atcc25566 using the disc diffusion method, were evaluated. sample with an enhanced inhibitory effect was plga/ag nps (7 %) which inhibited all strains (inhibition zone diameter 10 mm); plga/ag nps (1 %) sample inhibited only one strain (b. cereus) with zone diameter 8 mm. the plga nano-fiber sample has not shown any antimicrobial activity. based on the anticancer as well as the antimicrobial results in this study, it can be postulated that: plga nanofibers containing 7 % nano silver are suitable as anticancer- and antibiotic-drug delivery systems, as they will increase the anticancer as well as the antibiotic  drug potency without cytotoxicity effect on the normal cells. these findings also suggest that ag nps, of the size (5-10 nm) evaluated in the present study, are appropriate for therapeutic application from a safety standpoint.

TI  == antibacterial activity of 2-alkynoic fatty acids against multidrug-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the first study aimed at determining the structural characteristics needed to prepare antibacterial 2-alkynoic fatty acids (2-afas) was accomplished by synthesizing several 2-afas and other analogs in 18-76% overall yields. among all the compounds tested, the 2-hexadecynoic acid (2-hda) displayed the best overall  antibacterial activity against gram-positive staphylococcus aureus (mic=15.6 mug/ml), staphylococcus saprophyticus (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and bacillus cereus (mic=31.3 mug/ml), as well as against the gram-negative klebsiella pneumoniae (7.8 mug/ml) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic=125 mug/ml). in addition, 2-hda displayed significant antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) atcc 43300 (mic=15.6 mug/ml) and clinical isolates of mrsa (mic=3.9 mug/ml). no direct relationship was found between the antibacterial activity of 2-afas and their critical micelle concentration (cmc) suggesting that the antibacterial properties of these fatty acids are not mediated by micelle formation. it was demonstrated that the presence of a triple bond at c-2 and the  carboxylic acid moiety in 2-afas are important for their antibacterial activity.  2-hda has the potential to be further evaluated for use in antibacterial formulations.

TI  == characterization of amylolysin, a novel lantibiotic from bacillus amyloliquefaciens ga1.
AB  == background: lantibiotics are heat-stable peptides characterized by the presence of thioether amino acid lanthionine and methyllanthionine. they are capable to inhibit the growth of gram-positive bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus or bacillus cereus, the causative agents of food-borne diseases or nosocomial infections. lantibiotic biosynthetic machinery is encoded  by gene cluster composed by a structural gene that codes for a pre-lantibiotic peptide and other genes involved in pre-lantibiotic modifications, regulation, export and immunity. methodology/findings: bacillus amyloliquefaciens ga1 was found to produce an antimicrobial peptide, named amylolysin, active on an array of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin resistant s. aureus. genome characterization led to the identification of a putative lantibiotic gene cluster that comprises a structural gene (amla) and genes involved in modification (amlm), transport (amlt), regulation (amlkr) and immunity (amlfe). disruption of  amla led to loss of biological activity, confirming thus that the identified gene cluster is related to amylolysin synthesis. maldi-tof and lc-ms analysis on purified amylolysin demonstrated that this latter corresponds to a novel lantibiotic not described to date. the ability of amylolysin to interact in vitro with the lipid ii, the carrier of peptidoglycan monomers across the cytoplasmic membrane and the presence of a unique modification gene suggest that the identified peptide belongs to the group b lantibiotic. amylolysin immunity seems  to be driven by only two amlf and amle proteins, which is uncommon within the bacillus genus. conclusion/significance: apart from mersacidin produced by bacillus amyloliquefaciens strains y2 and hil y-85,544728, reports on the synthesis of type b-lantibiotic in this species are scarce. this study reports on a genetic and structural characterization of another representative of the type b lantibiotic in b. amyloliquefaciens.

TI  == a large outbreak of salmonellosis associated with sandwiches contaminated with multiple bacterial pathogens purchased via an online shopping service.
AB  == food sold over the internet is an emerging business that also presents a concern  with regard to food safety. a nationwide foodborne disease outbreak associated with sandwiches purchased from an online shop in july 2010 is reported. consumers were telephone interviewed with a structured questionnaire and specimens were collected for etiological examination. a total of 886 consumers were successfully contacted and completed the questionnaires; 36.6% had become ill, with a median incubation period of 18 h (range, 6-66 h). the major symptoms included diarrhea (89.2%), abdominal pain (69.8%), fever (47.5%), headache (32.7%), and vomiting (17.3%). microbiological laboratories isolated salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, salmonella virchow, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli from the contaminated sandwiches, salmonella enteritidis and salmonella virchow from the patients, and salmonella enteritidis  and staphylococcus aureus from food handlers. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis genotyping suggested a common origin of salmonella bacteria recovered from the patients, food, and a food handler. among the pathogens detected, the symptoms and incubation period indicated that salmonella, likely of egg origin, was the probable causative agent of the outbreak. this outbreak illustrates the importance of meticulous hygiene practices during food preparation and temperature control during food shipment and the food safety challenges posed by  online food-shopping services.

TI  == physicochemical properties of gelatin/silver nanoparticle antimicrobial composite films.
AB  == active nanocomposite films were prepared by blending aqueous solutions of gelatin with different concentrations of silver nanoparticles (agnps) using a solvent casting method. formation of silver nanoparticles in the solution and films was confirmed with the surface plasmon resonance (spr) band at 400-450 nm, measured by uv-vis absorption spectroscopy. the incorporation of agnps slightly affected the physical and mechanical properties of the films. increase in the concentration of agnps resulted in a substantial decrease in water vapour permeability (wvp) and tensile strength (ts) of the gelatin films. energy dispersive x-ray (edx) spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction (xrd) analysis confirmed the presence of elemental silver and crystalline structure of the agnps in the gelatin film. microscopic surface structure and thermal properties of the  films were also examined by fe-sem and thermogravimetric analysis. gelatin/agnps  nanocomposite films exhibited strong antibacterial activity against food-borne pathogens. gelatin/agnps nanocomposite films are expected to have high potential  as an active food packaging system to maintain food safety and to extend the shelf-life of packaged foods.

TI  == effects of a skin neuropeptide (substance p) on cutaneous microflora.
AB  == background: skin is the largest human neuroendocrine organ and hosts the second most numerous microbial population but the interaction of skin neuropeptides with the microflora has never been investigated. we studied the effect of substance p  (sp), a peptide released by nerve endings in the skin on bacterial virulence. methodology/principal findings: bacillus cereus, a member of the skin transient microflora, was used as a model. exposure to sp strongly stimulated the cytotoxicity of b. cereus (+553+/-3% with sp 10(-6) m) and this effect was rapid  (<5 min). infection of keratinocytes with sp treated b. cereus led to a rise in caspase1 and morphological alterations of the actin cytoskeleton. secretome analysis revealed that sp stimulated the release of collagenase and superoxide dismutase. moreover, we also noted a shift in the surface polarity of the bacteria linked to a peel-off of the s-layer and the release of s-layer proteins. meanwhile, the biofilm formation activity of b. cereus was increased. the thermo  unstable ribosomal elongation factor (ef-tu) was identified as the sp binding site in b. cereus. other gram positive skin bacteria, namely staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis also reacted to sp by an increase of virulence. thermal water from uriage-les-bains and an artificial polysaccharide (teflose(r)) were capable to antagonize the effect of sp on bacterial virulence.  conclusions/significance: sp is released in sweat during stress and is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of numerous skin diseases through neurogenic inflammation. our study suggests that a direct effect of sp on the skin microbiote should be another mechanism.

TI  == potential cellular targets and antibacterial efficacy of atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma.
AB  == atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (apntp) has been gaining increasing interest as a new alternative antibacterial approach. although this approach has  demonstrated promising antibacterial activity, its exact mechanism of action remains unclear. mechanistic elucidation of the antimicrobial activity will facilitate development and rational optimisation of this approach for potential medical applications. in this study, the antibacterial efficacy of an in-house-built apntp jet was evaluated alongside an investigation of the interactions between apntp and major cellular components in order to identify the potential cellular targets involved in plasma-mediated bacterial destruction mechanisms. the investigated plasma jet exhibited excellent, rapid antibacterial  activity against a selected panel of clinically significant bacterial species including bacillus cereus, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, all of which were completely inactivated within 2 min of plasma exposure. plasma-mediated damaging effects were observed, to varying degrees, on all of the investigated cellular components including dna, a model protein enzyme, and lipid membrane integrity and permeability. the antibacterial efficacy of apntp appears to involve a multiple-target mechanism, which potentially reduces the likelihood of emergence  of microbial resistance towards this promising antimicrobial approach. however, cellular membrane damage and resulting permeability perturbation was found to be  the most likely rate-determining step in this mechanism.

AB  == an effective antimicrobial packaging or food contact surface should be able to kill or inhibit micro-organisms that cause food-borne illnesses. setting up such  systems, by nisin adsorption on hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces, is still a  matter of debate. for this purpose, nisin was adsorbed on two types of low-density polyethylene: the hydrophobic native film and the hydrophilic acrylic acid-treated surface. the antibacterial activity was compared for those two films and it was highly dependent on the nature of the surface and the nisin-adsorbed amount. the hydrophilic surfaces presented higher antibacterial activity and higher amount of nisin than the hydrophobic surfaces. the effectiveness of the activated surfaces was assessed against listeria innocua and the food pathogens listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, and staphylococcus aureus. s. aureus was more sensitive than the three other test bacteria toward both nisin-functionalized films. simulation tests to mimic refrigerated temperature showed that the films were effective at 20 and 4 degrees c with no significant difference between the two temperatures after 30 min of exposure to culture media.

TI  == structure of the nhea component of the nhe toxin from bacillus cereus: implications for function.
AB  == the structure of nhea, a component of the bacillus cereus nhe tripartite toxin, has been solved at 2.05 a resolution using selenomethionine multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion (mad). the structure shows it to have a fold that is similar to the bacillus cereus hbl-b and e. coli clya toxins, and it is therefore a member of the clya superfamily of alpha-helical pore forming toxins (alpha-pfts), although its head domain is significantly enlarged compared with those of clya or hbl-b. the hydrophobic beta-hairpin structure that is a characteristic of these toxins is replaced by an amphipathic beta-hairpin connected to the main structure via a beta-latch that is reminiscent of a similar structure in the beta-pft staphylococcus aureus alpha-hemolysin. taken together these results suggest that, although it is a member of an archetypal alpha-pft family of toxins, nhea may be  capable of forming a beta rather than an alpha pore.

TI  == durable contact active antimicrobial materials formed by a one-step covalent modification of polyvinyl alcohol, cellulose and glass surfaces.
AB  == in this work we have applied a direct covalent linkage of quaternary ammonium salts (qas) to prepare a series of contact active antimicrobial surfaces based on widely utilized materials. formation of antimicrobial polyvinyl alcohol (pva-qas), cellulose (cellulose-qas) and glass (glass-qas) surfaces was achieved  by one step synthesis with no auxiliary linkers. the x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) revealed tridentate binding mode of the antimicrobial agent. the antimicrobial activity of the prepared materials was tested on bacillus cereus, alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. active site density of the modified materials was examined and found  to correlate with their antimicrobial activity. stability studies at different ph values and temperatures confirmed that the linkage of the bioactive moiety to the surface is robust and resistant to a range of ph and temperatures. prolonged long-term effectiveness of the contact active materials was demonstrated by their repeated usage, without loss of the antimicrobial efficacy.

TI  == a product of heme catabolism modulates bacterial function and survival.
AB  == bilirubin is the terminal metabolite in heme catabolism in mammals. after deposition into bile, bilirubin is released in large quantities into the mammalian gastrointestinal (gi) tract. we hypothesized that intestinal bilirubin  may modulate the function of enteric bacteria. to test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of bilirubin on two enteric pathogens; enterohemorrhagic  e. coli (ehec), a gram-negative that causes life-threatening intestinal infections, and e. faecalis, a gram-positive human commensal bacterium known to be an opportunistic pathogen with broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance. we demonstrate that bilirubin can protect ehec from exogenous and host-generated reactive oxygen species (ros) through the absorption of free radicals. in contrast, e. faecalis was highly susceptible to bilirubin, which causes significant membrane disruption and uncoupling of respiratory metabolism in this  bacterium. interestingly, similar results were observed for other gram-positive bacteria, including b. cereus and s. aureus. a model is proposed whereby bilirubin places distinct selective pressure on enteric bacteria, with gram-negative bacteria being protected from ros (positive outcome) and gram-positive bacteria being susceptible to membrane disruption (negative outcome). this work suggests bilirubin has differential but biologically relevant effects on bacteria and justifies additional efforts to determine the role of this neglected waste catabolite in disease processes, including animal models.

TI  == enhanced antimicrobial activity of peptide-cocktails against common bacterial contaminants of ex vivo stored platelets.
AB  == bacterial contamination of blood components such as ex vivo-stored platelets is a major safety risk in transfusion medicine. we have recently shown that synthetic  antimicrobial peptides named pd1-pd4 derived from the thrombin-induced human platelet-derived antimicrobial proteins, and repeats of arg-trp (rw1-rw5) demonstrate microbicidal activity against selected bacteria and viruses. in the present study, we selected pd3, pd4, rw2, rw3 and rw4 and evaluated each individual peptide and their various combinations to see whether the cocktail regimen enhances the antimicrobial activity above and over the individual peptides. stored platelet or plasma samples spiked with known titres of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and bacillus cereus were treated with either individual peptides or with peptides in various combinations. analyses revealed that individual peptides show moderate microbicidal activity (10- to 100-fold reduction) against the tested bacteria relative to their combined regimen. the peptide combinations (rw2 + rw4, rw2 + rw3 + rw4 and pd4 + rw3 + rw4) on the other hand enhanced the microbicidal activity (c.10 000-fold reduction) and revealed a minimal inhibitory concentration of 5 mum. time-kill kinetics indicated that these three peptide combinations exhibited enhanced antimicrobial  activity bringing about a 100-fold reduction of bacterial titres within 20 min of incubation. the present study therefore demonstrates the synergistic effect of antimicrobial peptides when used in combinations and provides a proof-of-concept  of its potential application as a molecular tool towards pathogen reduction and further extends the possibility of using peptide combinatorial therapeutics as broad-spectrum antibiotics or as alternatives to combat drug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and phytochemical constituents of leaf extracts of cassia  auriculata.
AB  == plants produce a wide variety of phytochemical constituents, which are secondary  metabolites and are used either directly or indirectly in the pharmaceutical industry. 'for centuries, man has effectively used various components of plants or their extracts for the treatment of many diseases, including bacterial infections. in the present study methanol, chloroform and aqueous extracts of cassia auriculata leaf were subjected for antimicrobial activity by well-diffusion method against six bacterial strains namely bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. the results revealed that the methanol and chloroform extracts exhibited strong inhibitory activity against all the tested organisms (zone of inhibition of 12-20 mm), except pseudomonas aeruginosa (zone of inhibition 10 mm or nil). the aqueous extracts showed moderate activity by 'zone of inhibition </=12 or nil). the extracts were screened for their phytochemical constituents by standard protocols' and were shown to contain carbohydrates, proteins, alkaloids, flavonoids, steroids, saponins and tannins. the antibacterial activity of these extracts is possibly linked to the presence of flavonoids, steroid, saponins and/or tannins. further studies are needed to determine the precise active principles from cassia auriculata.

TI  == effects of lipid emulsion and multivitamins on the growth of microorganisms in peripheral parenteral nutrition solutions.
AB  == background: blood stream infections caused by bacillus cereus or serratia marcescens in patients receiving peripheral parenteral nutrition (ppn) have occasionally been reported in japan, but these microorganisms are not major causes of blood stream infections in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition via a central venous catheter. in japan, commercially available ppn solutions contain amino acids, glucose, and electrolytes, but not contain lipid emulsion (le) and multivitamins (mv). in this study, the effects of le and mv on  the growth of microorganisms such as bacillus cereus, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, and candida albicans in ppn solutions were investigated. methods: a commercial 3% amino acid and 7.5% glucose solution with electrolytes (af) was used as the base solution to prepare test solutions (laf, afv, and lafv) containing le, mv, or both. specifically, 20% le was added to af in a ratio of 1:9 to prepare laf. mv was added to af and laf to prepare afv and lafv, respectively. a specified number of each microorganism was added to each 100 ml of af, laf, afv, and lafv in sterile plastic flasks, and all flasks were allowed  to stand at room temperature. the number of colony forming units per ml of each microorganism was counted at 0, 24, and 48 hours after the addition of each microorganism. results: both bacillus cereus and serratia marcescens increased rapidly in af as well as in laf, afv, and lafv. staphylococcus aureus did not increased in af, but increased slightly in laf and increased rapidly in afv and lafv. candida albicans increased slightly in af and increased rapidly in laf, afv, and lafv. conclusions: the results suggest the followings: if microbial contamination occurs, 1) bacillus cereus and serratia marcescens can grow rapidly in ppn solutions consisting of amino acids, glucose and electrolytes; 2) staphylococcus aureus cannot grow without le and mv, but can grow rapidly with mv; 3) candida albicans can grow slowly without le and mv, and the addition of le or mv accelerates its growth.

TI  == evolutionary dynamics of the accessory genome of listeria monocytogenes.
AB  == listeria monocytogenes, a foodborne bacterial pathogen, is comprised of four phylogenetic lineages that vary with regard to their serotypes and distribution among sources. in order to characterize lineage-specific genomic diversity within l. monocytogenes, we sequenced the genomes of eight strains from several lineages and serotypes, and characterized the accessory genome, which was hypothesized to  contribute to phenotypic differences across lineages. the eight l. monocytogenes  genomes sequenced range in size from 2.85-3.14 mb, encode 2,822-3,187 genes, and  include the first publicly available sequenced representatives of serotypes 1/2c, 3a and 4c. mapping of the distribution of accessory genes revealed two distinct regions of the l. monocytogenes chromosome: an accessory-rich region in the first 65 degrees adjacent to the origin of replication and a more stable region in the  remaining 295 degrees . this pattern of genome organization is distinct from that of related bacteria staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus. the accessory genome of all lineages is enriched for cell surface-related genes and phosphotransferase systems, and transcriptional regulators, highlighting the selective pressures faced by contemporary strains from their hosts, other microbes, and their environment. phylogenetic analysis of o-antigen genes and gene clusters predicts that serotype 4 was ancestral in l. monocytogenes and serotype 1/2 associated gene clusters were putatively introduced through horizontal gene transfer in the ancestral population of l. monocytogenes lineage  i and ii.

TI  == skin-associated bacillus, staphylococcal and micrococcal species from the house dust mite, dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and bacteriolytic enzymes.
AB  == dust mites produce bacteriolytic enzymes, one of which belongs to the nlpc/p60 superfamily comprising bacterial and fungal proteins. whether this enzyme is derived from the mite or from mite-associated microbes is unclear. to this end, the bacteriology of mites per se, and carpet and mattress dust from a group of asthmatic children and their parents was investigated. dust from parents' and children's mattresses yielded significantly more colony forming units compared with dust from their corresponding carpets. zymography demonstrated some dusts contained bacteriolytic enzymes, and in nine of the twelve dust samples from three of five houses examined, a prominent bacteriolytic band was obtained that corresponded to the mite band, although in one home, other lytic bands were detected. fifty bacterial isolates were obtained from surface-sterilised, commercially obtained dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. 16s rrna, tuf and rpob gene sequencing of nine gram-positive isolates identified them as bacillus cereus, b.  licheniformis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. capitis and micrococcus  luteus, known human skin commensals. 16s rrna sequence homologies of four of the  nine isolates identified as b. licheniformis formed a distinct phylogenetic cluster. all species secreted lytic enzymes during culture although the lytic profiles obtained differed between the rods and the cocci, and none of the bands  detected corresponded to those observed in dust or mites. in conclusion, mites harbour a variety of bacterial species often associated with human skin and house dusts contain bacteriolytic enzymes that may be mite-derived. the identification  of a novel cluster of b. licheniformis isolates suggests an ecological adaptation to laboratory-reared d. pteronyssinus. it remains to be determined whether the previously described mite-associated 14 k lytic enzyme is derived from a microbial source.

TI  == nucleation of platelets with blood-borne pathogens on kupffer cells precedes other innate immunity and contributes to bacterial clearance.
AB  == through the use of intravital imaging of the liver, we demonstrate a collaborative role for platelets with kupffer cells (kcs) in eradicating blood-borne bacterial infection. under basal conditions, platelets, via the platelet-adhesion receptor gpib, formed transient 'touch-and-go' interactions with von willebrand factor (vwf) constitutively expressed on kcs. bacteria such as bacillus cereus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were rapidly caught by kcs and triggered platelets to switch from 'touch-and-go' adhesion to sustained gpiib-mediated adhesion on the kc surface to encase the bacterium. infected gpibalpha-deficient mice had more endothelial and kc damage than did their wild-type counterparts, which led to more fluid leakage, substantial polycythemia and rapid mortality. our study identifies a previously unknown surveillance mechanism by which platelets survey macrophages that rapidly converts to a critical host response to blood-borne bacteria.

AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == potential applications for annona squamosa leaf extract in the treatment and prevention of foodborne bacterial disease.
AB  == foodborne disease is a major public health problem. the present study examined annona squamosa leaves, which are traditionally used to treat diarrhea and other  infections, for their potential to be used in modern food safety or medicine. active constituents were partially purified by ethanol extraction and column chromatography. mics of the extract were 62.5 to 125 microg/ml against bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus, and 250 microg/ml against campylobacter jejuni. in time-kill assays, 500 microg/ml of the extract reduced colony forming unit numbers of c. jejuni almost 10 000-fold within 12 hours. similar decreases were seen against b. cereus, but over a longer time-frame. lc-ms analysis indicated the presence of reticuline and oxophoebine.  assessment of stability by mic assay showed activity was heat-labile, with loss of activity greatest following high temperature treatments. activity was relatively stable at refrigeration temperature. these results indicate a. squamosa has broad-spectrum but heat-labile activity against foodborne bacterial  pathogens, and bactericidal activity against b. cereus and c. jejuni. this bactericidal activity is not sufficiently rapid for a. squamosa to be used as a food sanitizer, but the extract could potentially be developed as an additive for refrigerated foods, or a modern treatment for foodborne illness.

TI  == effects of nisin-incorporated films on the microbiological and physicochemical quality of minimally processed mangoes.
AB  == the aim of this study is to examine the effects of nisin-incorporated cellulose films on the physicochemical and microbiological qualities of minimally processed mangoes. the use of antimicrobial films did not affect the physicochemical characteristics of mangoes and showed antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris and bacillus cereus. the mango slices were inoculated with s. aureus and l. monocytogenes (10(7)cfu/g), and the viable cell numbers remained at 10(5) and 10(6)cfu/g, respectively, after 12days. in samples packed with antimicrobial films, the viable number of l. monocytogenes cells was reduced below the detection level after 4days. after 6days, a reduction of six log units was observed for s. aureus. in conclusion, nisin showed antimicrobial activity in mangoes without interfering with the organoleptic characteristics of the fruit. this result suggests that nisin could potentially be used in active packing to improve the safety of minimally processed mangoes.

TI  == synergized antimicrobial activity of eugenol incorporated polyhydroxybutyrate films against food spoilage microorganisms in conjunction with pediocin.
AB  == biopolymers and biopreservatives produced by microorganisms play an essential role in food technology. polyhydroxyalkanoates and bacteriocins produced by bacteria are promising components to safeguard the environment and for food preservation applications. polyhydroxybutyrate (phb)-based antimicrobial films were prepared incorporating eugenol, from 10 to 200 mug/g of phb. the films were  evaluated for antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens, spoilage bacteria, and fungi such as staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, bacillus cereus, aspergillus flavus, aspergillus niger, penicillium  sp., and rhizopus sp. the synergistic antimicrobial activity of the films in the  presence of crude pediocin was also investigated. the broth system containing pediocin (soluble form) as well as antimicrobial phb film demonstrated an extended lag phase and a significant growth reduction at the end of 24 h against  the bacteria. crude pediocin alone could not elicit antifungal activity, while inhibition of growth and sporulation were observed in the presence of antimicrobial phb film containing eugenol (80 mug/g) until 7 days in the case of  molds, i.e., a. niger, a. flavus, penicillium sp., and rhizopus sp. in potato dextrose broth. in the present study, we identified that use of pediocin containing broth in conjunction with eugenol incorporated phb film could function in synergized form, providing effective hurdle toward food contaminating microorganisms. furthermore, tensile strength, percent crystallinity, melting point, percent elongation to break, glass transition temperature, and seal strength of the phb film with and without eugenol incorporation were investigated. the migration of eugenol on exposure to different liquid food simulants was also analyzed using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. the study is expected to provide applications for pediocin in conjunction with eugenol containing phb film to enhance the shelf life of foods in the food industry.

TI  == evaluation of the haccp system in a university canteen: microbiological monitoring and internal auditing as verification tools.
AB  == food safety is essential in mass catering. in europe, regulation (ec) no. 852/2004 requires food business operators to put in place, implement and maintain permanent procedures based on hazard analysis and critical control point (haccp)  principles. each haccp plan is specifically implemented for the processing plant  and processing methods and requires a systematic collection of data on the incidence, elimination, prevention, and reduction of risks. in this five-year-study, the effectiveness of the haccp plan of a university canteen was  verified through periodic internal auditing and microbiological monitoring of meals, small equipment, cooking tools, working surfaces, as well as hands and white coats of the canteen staff. the data obtained revealed no safety risks for  the consumers, since escherichia coli, salmonella spp. and listeria monocytogenes were never detected; however, a quite discontinuous microbiological quality of meals was revealed. the fluctuations in the microbial loads of mesophilic aerobes, coliforms, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and sulphite-reducing clostridia were mainly ascribed to inadequate handling or processing procedures,  thus suggesting the need for an enhancement of staff training activities and for  a reorganization of tasks. due to the wide variety of the fields covered by internal auditing, the full conformance to all the requirements was never achieved, though high scores, determined by assigning one point to each answer which matched with the requirements, were achieved in all the years.

TI  == reactive oxygen species and the bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects of isoconazole nitrate.
AB  == bacterial superinfections often occur in dermatomycoses, resulting in greatly inflamed or eczematous skin. the objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of isoconazole nitrate (isn), a broad-spectrum antimicrobial imidazole, commonly used to treat dermatomycoses. several gram-positive bacteria minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for isn (isn solution or isn-containing creams: travogen or corticosteroid-containing travocort) and ampicillin were obtained using the broth-dilution method. speed of onset of the bactericidal effect was determined with bacterial killing curves. reactive oxygen species (ros) were visualised by staining cells with singlet oxygen detector stain. compared with ampicillin mics, isn mics for bacillus cereus, staphylococcus haemolyticus and staphylococcus hominis were lower and isn mics for corynebacterium tuberculostearicum and streptococcus salivarius were similar. incubation with isn led to a 50% kill rate for staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant strains (mrsa). post-isn incubation, 36% (30 min) and 90% (60 min) of s. aureus cells were positive for ros. isoconazole nitrate has a broad bacteriostatic and bactericidal action, also against a mrsa strain that was not reduced by the corticosteroid in the travocort cream. data suggest that the antibacterial effect of isn may be ros dependent. an antifungal agent with robust antibacterial activity can provide a therapeutic advantage in treating dermatomycoses with suspected bacterial superinfections.

TI  == biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using actinobacterium streptomyces albogriseolus and its antibacterial activity.
AB  == an eco-friendly approach to the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (agnps) by extracellular components of streptomyces albogriseolus has been reported. the isolated actinobacteria were genotypically identified by 16s rrna sequencing analysis, and the morphology was observed by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy. the preliminary characterization of synthesized nanoparticles was carried out using ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer. the maximum absorption spectra were found to be 409 nm at the 48th hour of incubation. the yield of agnps was found to be 72.64% as quantified by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. the average size of agnps determined by the dynamic light scattering technique was 16.25 +/- 1.6 nm. the results from transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction confirmed the formation of spherical shaped and  crystalline agnps. the interaction of protein with agnps was confirmed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis. the biosynthesized agnps inhibited the  growth of food pathogens (bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus). hence, the synthesis of agnps by s. albogriseolus could be employed as a probable antimicrobial agent to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms. this approach employed for the synthesis of nanoparticles paves a path for new biomaterial interfaces, which could be applied in different biomedical fields.

TI  == antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities of mycelia of a medicinal mushroom from taiwan, taiwanofungus salmoneus (higher basidiomycetes).
AB  == taiwanofungus salmoneus (t.t. chang et w.n. chou) sheng h. wu et al. (shiang-shan-chih), is a medicinal fungus indigenous to taiwan. the mycelium was  prepared from submerged culture and its ethanolic and hot-water extracts were used to study its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. gram-positive species (bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus) and  gram-negative species (escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium) of bacteria were used. in addition to the inhibitory zone, minimum inhibitory concentrations  (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) also were determined. the ethanolic extracts showed higher inhibitory and bactericidal activities (mic and  mbc: 6.25-12.50 mg/ml) than the hot-water extracts (mic and mbc: 25-50 mg/ml). in the anti-inflammatory test, the extracts were tested on lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor- alpha production in raw 264.7 cells. the values of the inhibition concentration at 50%  of nitric oxide production were 18.2 and 14.2 mug/ml for the hot-water and ethanolic extracts, respectively. the 50% inhibitory concentration values of tumor necrosis factor- alpha production were 4.99 and 7.13 mug/ml for the hot-water and ethanolic extracts, respectively. on the basis of the results obtained, the mycelia could be used as an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory supplement.

TI  == co-production of surfactin and a novel bacteriocin by bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis h4 isolated from bikalga, an african alkaline hibiscus sabdariffa seed fermented condiment.
AB  == bikalga is a hibiscus sabdariffa seed fermented condiment widely consumed in burkina faso and neighboring countries. the fermentation is dominated by bacillus subtilis group species. ten b. subtilis subsp. subtilis (six isolates) and bacillus licheniformis (four isolates) isolated from traditional bikalga were examined for their antimicrobial activity against a panel of 36 indicator organisms including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. the bacillus spp. isolates showed variable inhibitory abilities depending on the method used. both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were inhibited in the  agar spot assay while only gram-positive pathogens were inhibited in the agar well diffusion assay. cell free supernatants (cfs) of pure cultures of 3 b. subtilis subsp. subtilis (g2, h4 and f1) strains inhibited growth of listeria monocytogenes, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus, while cfs of 2 b. licheniformis (e3 and f9) strains only inhibited m. luteus. the antimicrobial substance(s) produced by b. subtilis subsp. subtilis h4 was further characterized. the antimicrobial substance(s) produced by h4 was detected from mid-exponential growth phase. the activity was sensitive to protease and trypsin, but resistant to the proteolytic action of proteinase k and papain. treatment with alpha-amylase and lipase ii resulted in a complete loss of antimicrobial effect, indicating that a sugar moiety and lipid moiety are necessary for the activity. treatment with mercapto-ethanol resulted in a significant loss, indicative of the presence of disulfide bridges. the antimicrobial activity of h4 was heat resistant and active at ph3-10. pcr detection of yiwb, sboa, spox, alba  and spas, etns genes and genes coding for surfactins and plipastatins (fengycins) indicated a potential for subtilosin, subtilin and lipopeptide production, respectively. sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) was carried out and a single band of approximately 4kda had antimicrobial activity. ultra high performance liquid chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (uhplc-tofms) analysis of the 4kda band allowed identification of surfactin and a protein with a monoisotopic mass of 3346.59da,  which is dissimilar in size to subtilosin and subtilin. surfactin is a cyclic lipoheptapeptide, which contains a beta-hydroxy fatty acid, but no di-sulfide bridges or sugar residues. the complete loss of activity upon amylase treatment indicates that surfactin was not responsible for the observed antimicrobial effect. however, it cannot completely be ruled out that surfactin acts synergistically with the detected protein, though further investigations are needed to confirm this.

TI  == airborne microbial composition in a high-throughput poultry slaughtering facility.
AB  == a high-throughput chicken slaughtering facility in beijing was systematically investigated for numbers of airborne microorganisms. samples were assessed for counts of aerobic bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, total coliforms, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, and salmonella. during a 4-month period (september to december 2011), samples were collected for 10 min three times daily (preproduction, production, and postproduction). samples were collected for three consecutive days of each month  with an fa-1 sampler from six sampling sites: receiving-hanging, soaking-scalding and defeathering, evisceration, precooling, subdividing, and packing. humidity, temperature, wind velocity, and airborne particulates also were recorded at each  sampling site and time. the highest counts of microorganisms were recorded in the initial stages of processing, i.e., the receiving-hanging and defeathering areas, with a definite decline toward the evisceration, prechilling, subdividing, and packing areas; the prechilling area had the lowest microbial counts of 2.4 x 10(3) cfu/m(3). mean total coliforms counts ranged from 8.4 x 10(3) to 140 cfu/m(3). maximum e. coli counts were 6.1 x 10(3) cfu/m(3) in the soaking-scalding and defeathering area. b. cereus, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus represented only a small proportion of the microbial population (1,900 to 20 cfu/m(3)). l. monocytogenes and salmonella were rarely detected in evisceration,  precooling, subdividing, and packing areas. our study identified the levels of bioaerosols that may affect chicken product quality. this finding could be useful for improved control of microbial contamination to ensure product quality.

TI  == microbial contamination associated with consumption and the growth in plastic bottled beverage.
AB  == plastic bottles enable the storage of unfinished beverages, and most of microbial contamination has occurred in the unfinished beverage that was left. therefore, we investigated microorganisms in various beverages contaminated by pouring and drinking directly by mouth from the bottle, and analyzed the growth of microorganisms in the beverages at room temperature. in the pouring test, microbial growth was detected in 60 of 320 samples, and 13 bacterial strains, 49  mold strains, and 8 yeast strains were isolated. molds including cladosporium spp., tramets spp., bjerkandera spp., and penicillium spp. accounted for the majority of isolated microorganisms. in the drinking test, microbial growth was detected in 181 of 352 samples, and 225 bacterial strains, 27 mold strains and 77 yeast strains were isolated. bacteria including streptococcus spp. such as s. salivarius and staphylococcus spp. such as s. aureus accounted for the majority of isolated microorganisms. enterotoxin-producing s. aureus and bacillus cereus were also isolated. the ph of the beverage influenced the growth of bacteria. the brix values of the beverage did not correlate with the growth of microorganisms.  these results revealed that various microorganisms including foodborne pathogens  were able to grow in numerous types of beverages and that the storage of unfinished beverage in inappropriate condition, such as the storage at room temperature led microorganism to grow easily in beverage. therefore, it is necessary to consume beverages as soon as possible after opening the bottle.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of essential oils from mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar  diffusion method. the essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against gram-positive (listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus epidermidis) and  gram-negative strains (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for most essential oils examined, s. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while p. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. in general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.

TI  == sterility testing of apheresis hematopoietic progenitor cell products using an automated blood culture system.
AB  == background: aabb standards require monitoring of hematopoietic progenitor cell (hpc) products for microbial contamination. to date, there is no automated blood  culture system cleared by the food and drug administration for this application.  our objective was to validate the versatrek system (trek diagnostic systems) for  sterility testing of apheresis hpc products. study design and methods: four aerobic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, and bacillus cereus), five anaerobic bacteria (fusobacterium necrophorum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella loescheii, and propionibacterium acnes), and one fungus (candida albicans) were spiked into  apheresis hpc products at concentrations of 10, 10(2) , 10(3) , and 10(4) colony-forming units (cfus)/ml. aerobic and anaerobic bottles were incubated until positive or for up to 5 days. dna was simultaneously extracted for polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. results: all aerobic bacteria grew in both bottles at all concentrations tested within 24 hours, and the time to positivity (ttp) was significantly shorter with  aerobic bottles. c. albicans grew in the aerobic media at all concentrations within 30 hours. anaerobes grew in the anaerobic bottle at all concentrations within 5 days. no bacteria were detected by using 16s rrna gene amplification at  10(4) cfus/ml. conclusion: compared to culture, 16s rrna gene amplification of hpcs does not improve sensitivity or turnaround time for hpc sterility testing. the versatrek system is a reliable tool for detecting microbial contamination of  apheresis hpc products with a limit of detection of less than or equal to 10 cfus/ml. inclusion of both the aerobic and the anaerobic culture bottles achieves the shortest ttp for all species tested.

TI  == endophthalmitis.
AB  == endophthalmitis means bacterial or fungal infection inside the eye involving the  vitreous and/or aqueous humors. most cases are exogenous and occur after eye surgery, after penetrating ocular trauma, or as an extension of corneal infection. an increasing number of cases are occurring after intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) medications. endophthalmitis may also be endogenous, arising from bacteraemic or fungaemic seeding of the eye. the infected eye never serves as a source of bacteraemia or fungaemia, however. the most common pathogens in endophthalmitis vary by category. coagulase-negative staphylococci are the most common causes of post-cataract endophthalmitis, and these bacteria and viridans streptococci cause most cases of post-intravitreal anti-vegf injection endophthalmitis, bacillus cereus is a major cause of post-traumatic endophthalmitis, and staphylococcus aureus and streptococci are important causes of endogenous endophthalmitis associated with endocarditis. in taiwan and other east asian nations, klebsiella  pneumoniae causes most cases of endogenous endophthalmitis, in association with liver abscess. endogenous fungal endophthalmitis in hospitalized patients is usually caused by candida species, particularly candida albicans. acute endophthalmitis is a medical emergency. the most important component of treatment is the intravitreal injection of antibiotics, along with vitrectomy in severe cases. systemic antibiotics should be used in cases of endogenous endophthalmitis and exogenous fungal endophthalmitis, but their role in exogenous bacterial endophthalmitis is uncertain. repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics may be necessary if there is no response to the initial therapy. many eyes that receive prompt and appropriate treatment will recover useful vision.

TI  == microbiological quality and risk factors related to sandwiches served in bakeries, cafes, and sandwich bars in south korea.
AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the microbiological quality of sandwiches produced on site and served in bakeries, cafes, and sandwich bars in south korea and to determine the major risk factors affecting the sanitation level in each store (n = 1,120). the microbiological quality of the sandwiches was analyzed, and the sanitation level of each store was evaluated as satisfactory or unsatisfactory based on sanitation guidelines. total coliforms were detected in 906 samples (80.9%), but only 3 samples (0.3%) contained confirmed escherichia coli contamination. the detection rate was highest for bacillus cereus (10.0%), followed by staphylococcus aureus (1.3%) and salmonella  (0.2%). vibrio parahaemolyticus was not detected in any samples. the microbial contamination level was significantly lower in winter (p < 0.05) and in stores with a higher sanitation grade. factors related to the microbiological quality of sandwiches were evaluated as the relative risk (rr) of coliform contamination, and the higher risk factors for sandwich contamination were improper holding temperature (rr = 8.75), cross-contamination (rr = 6.30), lack of proper ventilation systems (rr = 6.16), and the absence of clean and/or suitable outer garments (rr = 5.73). most factors were related to the failure of food handlers to adhere to sanitation guidelines rather than to unsanitary environments. this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between the microbiological quality of sandwiches served on-site and various risk factors. these results will help researchers establish guidelines for the sanitary management of sandwich shops.

TI  == a nanoporous membrane-based impedimetric immunosensor for label-free detection of pathogenic bacteria in whole milk.
AB  == we introduce a nanoporous membrane based impedimetric immunosensor for the label-free detection of bacterial pathogens in whole milk. a simple and rapid method to modify a commercially available alumina nanoporous membrane with hyaluronic acid (ha) effectively reduced the non-specific binding of biomolecules and other cells, and permitted successful immobilization of antibodies. escherichia coli o157:h7, one of the most harmful food-borne pathogenic bacteria, was tested as a model pathogen in this study. the ionic impedance of electrolytes through nanopores, due to antibody-pathogen interactions, was monitored by impedance spectra and analyzed by normalized impedance change (nic). the regression equation for the nic at 1 khz versus concentration of e. coli o157:h7  (10-10(5)cfu/ml) was obtained, and the detection limit found to be as low as 10 cfu/ml. in addition, the proposed immunosensor was successfully used for the detection of e. coli o157:h7 in whole milk samples with the detection limit as low as 83.7 cfu/ml with 95% probability. the specificity of the immunosensor was  also demonstrated using non-target bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and non pathogenic e. coli dh5alpha. this study shows that a ha-functionalized nanoporous membrane-based impedimetric sensor is capable of detecting pathogenic bacteria in whole milk without any pretreatment. this is a significant step for evaluating the safety of food and environmental samples and  other medical diagnostics.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a new preservative for multiuse ophthalmic solutions.
AB  == purpose: the aim of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity and the  preservative efficacy of a novel preservative solution containing sodium hydroxymethyl glycinate (shmg) and edetate disodium (edta), which is used for preservation of some commercial ophthalmic formulations. methods: in vitro susceptibility assays were performed against several gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and bacillus cereus) and gram-negative (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria representative of the microbial flora of epithelial surfaces or colonizing the conjunctiva, as well as against candida albicans and aspergillus niger. using different concentrations of shmg alone or in combination with edta, the minimal inhibitory and microbicidal concentrations against these organisms were assessed. in addition, 8 brands of multidose eye drops containing 0.002% shmg and 0.1% edta as preservative were tested for antimicrobial activity using the antimicrobial effectiveness test recommended by the international pharmacopoeias. results: the  minimal inhibitory and bactericidal/fungicidal concentration values of shmg ranged from 0.0025% to 0.0125% for bacteria and from 0.125% to 0.50% for mold and yeast. susceptibility testing demonstrated that the addition of edta substantially increased the shmg activity against all bacterial and fungal strains. the preservative effectiveness test was applied to commercial eye drops. all the drop solutions met the criteria reported by the u.s. pharmacopeia for parenteral and ophthalmic preparations. all products also satisfied the major acceptance criteria of the european pharmacopeia with respect to the antifungal activity. with regard to the antibacterial activity, the less-stringent criteria  of the european pharmacopeia were fulfilled. conclusions: the present study demonstrates the efficacy of a novel preservative for ophthalmic solutions (shmg/edta) and its activity in protecting selected commercial artificial tears against microbial contamination.

TI  == [analysis of bactericidal material generated by electrical devices advertising bactericidal ability against bacteria on the agar gel plates].
AB  == several japanese companies sell electrical devices advertised as effective in inactivating viruses and killing bacteria by releasing special materials, e.g., plasmacluster ions, nanoe particle and minus ions, into the air. these companies  claim that their devices killed bacteria on plates in their own experiments. we tested device effectiveness using the same experiments from the plasmacluster ioniser sharp co., japan, the nanoe generator panasonic co., japan, and the vion  king jim co., japan, to test their advertising claims. bactericidal ability on agar plate was tested, using staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis as follows: the medium containing a certain amount of each bacterium was put onto an agar plate and smeared. plates were kept in a closed chamber (inner volume 14.4 m3) or a glove box (inner volume 0.2 m), with one of the devices run for 2 hours. plates not exposed to any device were used as controls. each plate was retrieved and put in an incubator to count  the number of bacterial colonies formed on the plate. there was no significant difference in the number of colonies on plates exposed to devices compared to control, in the number for all devices, or in all bacteria tested in experiments  in the 14.4 m3 chamber. these results strongly suggest that these devices have almost no bactericidal effect, at least in space exceeding this volume. colony formation was suppressed in the glove box in all devices and in all bacteria tested except p. aeruginosa, although the degree of suppression differed among experiments. the colony formation suppression mechanism was analyzed, and indicated that:colony formation did not change even after the removal of plasmacluster ions, nanoe particles, or negative ions from the air, while colony  formation was decreased drastically by the removal of ozone from space, which was revealed to be generated inevitably during device operation. these results strongly suggest that the bactericidal effect seen only on the agar plate in narrow space was explained by ozone released in space as a by-product, not by special materials as advertising claimed. it is thus important to analyze the effect of special materials such as those done in this study and to suggest the involvement of ozone as the true cause, as have been done in this study, in evaluating bactericidal effect or viral inactivation as advertised by these companies.

AB  == there has been an increasing interest in the use of natural plant materials as alternative food preservatives. we examined the antimicrobial effects of natural  plant materials used as additives against foodborne pathogens in laboratory media and sulgidduk, oriental-style rice cakes. cinnamon, mugwort, and garlic powder solutions (3%) were tested for their antimicrobial activities against pathogens in laboratory media. sulgidduk prepared with different amounts of cinnamon powder (1, 3, and 6%) was inoculated with a staphylococcus aureus or bacillus cereus cocktail. the samples were air or vacuum packaged and stored at 22 +/- 1 degrees  c for 72 h, and microbial growth was determined. cinnamon powder showed more inhibitory properties against pathogens such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, s. aureus, and b.  cereus than did mugwort or garlic powder. the populations of s. aureus and b. cereus in sulgidduk containing cinnamon powder were significantly lower than in the control during storage time. different packaging methods did not result in a  significant difference in pathogen growth. in a sensory evaluation, sulgidduk containing 1 and 3% cinnamon powder did not significantly differ from the control sample in any of the attributes tested other than flavor. these results indicate  that natural plant materials such as cinnamon powder could be used as food additives to improve the microbiological stability of rice cakes.

TI  == changes in microbial contamination levels of porcine carcasses and fresh pork in  slaughterhouses, processing lines, retail outlets, and local markets by commercial distribution.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in microbial contamination levels of each porcine carcass and fresh pork in a general distribution process. a total of 100 commercial pigs were sampled (six sampling sites per individual, total 600 samples) at four sequential stages: slaughterhouse (after carcass grading and boning), processing line, retail outlet, and local market. no significant differences were observed in the contaminant percentages among sampling sites and sample collection years (p>0.05) with the exception of bacillus cereus. the contaminant percentage of b. cereus at 1st collection year was higher than these of 2nd collection year (28.31% vs. 12.26%, p<0.05). b. cereus and listeria monocytogenes were the most frequently detected pathogenic bacteria in the slaughterhouse and markets, respectively. on  the other hand, escherichia coli o157:h7 and yersinia enterocolitica were not detected in carcasses or pork collected from any carcass sites and pork samples.  however, the frequency of pathogenic bacteria in end-products at local markets was not highly related to the initial contamination of porcine carcasses in the slaughterhouse. thus, the improvement of microbial safety for pork end-products requires hygienic control of porcine carcasses and meat cutting during all operations in the slaughterhouse, processing line, retail outlet, and local market.

TI  == the insect galleria mellonella as a powerful infection model to investigate bacterial pathogenesis.
AB  == the study of bacterial virulence often requires a suitable animal model. mammalian models of infection are costly and may raise ethical issues. the use of insects as infection models provides a valuable alternative. compared to other non-vertebrate model hosts such as nematodes, insects have a relatively advanced  system of antimicrobial defenses and are thus more likely to produce information  relevant to the mammalian infection process. like mammals, insects possess a complex innate immune system(1). cells in the hemolymph are capable of phagocytosing or encapsulating microbial invaders, and humoral responses include  the inducible production of lysozyme and small antibacterial peptides(2,3). in addition, analogies are found between the epithelial cells of insect larval midguts and intestinal cells of mammalian digestive systems. finally, several basic components essential for the bacterial infection process such as cell adhesion, resistance to antimicrobial peptides, tissue degradation and adaptation to oxidative stress are likely to be important in both insects and mammals(1). thus, insects are polyvalent tools for the identification and characterization of microbial virulence factors involved in mammalian infections. larvae of the greater wax moth galleria mellonella have been shown to provide a useful insight  into the pathogenesis of a wide range of microbial infections including mammalian fungal (fusarium oxysporum, aspergillus fumigatus, candida albicans) and bacterial pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, serratia marcescens pseudomonas aeruginosa, listeria monocytogenes or enterococcus faecalis(4-7). regardless of the bacterial species, results obtained with galleria larvae infected by direct injection through the cuticle consistently correlate with those of similar mammalian studies: bacterial strains that are attenuated in mammalian models demonstrate lower virulence in galleria, and strains causing severe human infections are also highly virulent in the galleria  model(8-11). oral infection of galleria is much less used and additional compounds, like specific toxins, are needed to reach mortality. g. mellonella larvae present several technical advantages: they are relatively large (last instar larvae before pupation are about 2 cm long and weight 250 mg), thus enabling the injection of defined doses of bacteria; they can be reared at various temperatures (20 degrees c to 30 degrees c) and infection studies can be  conducted between 15 degrees c to above 37 degrees c(12,13), allowing experiments that mimic a mammalian environment. in addition, insect rearing is easy and relatively cheap. infection of the larvae allows monitoring bacterial virulence by several means, including calculation of ld50(14), measurement of bacterial survival(15,16) and examination of the infection process(17). here, we describe the rearing of the insects, covering all life stages of g. mellonella. we provide a detailed protocol of infection by two routes of inoculation: oral and intra haemocoelic. the bacterial model used in this protocol is bacillus cereus, a gram positive pathogen implicated in gastrointestinal as well as in other severe local or systemic opportunistic infections(18,19).

TI  == bacterial quorum sensing: its role in virulence and possibilities for its control.
AB  == quorum sensing is a process of cell-cell communication that allows bacteria to share information about cell density and adjust gene expression accordingly. this process enables bacteria to express energetically expensive processes as a collective only when the impact of those processes on the environment or on a host will be maximized. among the many traits controlled by quorum sensing is the expression of virulence factors by pathogenic bacteria. here we review the quorum-sensing circuits of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio cholerae. we outline these canonical quorum-sensing mechanisms and how each uniquely controls virulence factor production. additionally, we examine recent efforts to inhibit quorum sensing in these pathogens with the goal of designing novel antimicrobial therapeutics.

AB  == the present study served to gain further insight into the bactericidal effects of ellagitannins from acalypha wilkesiana var. macafeana hort. against pathogenic bacteria. ellagitannins from the aerial parts of a. wilkesiana var. macafeana hort. (eaw) inhibited the growth of bacillus cereus (atcc 11778), bacillus subtilis (atcc 6633), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 11632) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) clinical strain with inhibition zones equal to 11.01 +/- 1.53 mm, 16.63 +/- 0.11 mm, 11.40 +/- 1.10 mm and 8.22 +/- 0.19 mm, respectively. the minimal inhibition concentration and the  minimal bactericidal concentration of ellagitannins from a. wilkesiana var. macafeana hort. (eaw) against mrsa were 750 microg/ml and 3000 microg/ml, respectively. we then examined the synergistic effect of eaw with three antibiotics, i.e. ampicillin, streptomycin and tetracycline, via the checkerboard assay and time-kill assay and observed that eaw is synergistic with ampicillin against s. aureus (atcc 11632). environmental electron scanning microscopy analysis showed cell lysis against s. aureus (atcc 11632) upon treatment with the ellagitannin fraction. the ellagitannin fraction from a. wilkesiana var. macafeana hort. is bactericidal against gram-positive bacteria tested and works synergistically with ampicillin against s. aureus. morphology analysis of the cell suggests that the bactericidal property of the ellagitannin fraction mechanism involves lysis of the cell wall. in summary, our studies demonstrate that a. wilkesiana var. macafeana hort. produces bactericidal ellagitannins of clinical and/or cosmetological value.

AB  == the possibility of increasing the aggregated value of the huge amount of residues generated by wineries around the world foment studies using the grape pomace - the residue from the wine production, composed by seed, skin and stems - to obtain functional ingredients. nowadays, consumers in general prefer natural and  safe products mainly for food and cosmetic fields, where the supercritical fluid  extraction is of great importance due to the purity of the extracts provided. therefore, the objective of this work is to evaluate the global extraction yield, the antimicrobial activity and the composition profile of merlot and syrah grape  pomace extracts obtained by supercritical co2 (sc-co2) and co2 added with co-solvent at pressures up to 300 bar and temperatures of 50 and 60 degrees c. the results were compared with the ones obtained by soxhlet and by ultrasound-assisted leaching extraction methods. the main components from the extracts, identified by hplc, were gallic acid, p-oh-benzoic acid, vanillic acid  and epicatechin. the antibacterial and antifungal activities of the extracts were evaluated using four strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and three fungi strains (candida albicans, candida parapsilosis, candida krusei). despite lower extraction yield results, the supercritical fluid extracts presented the highest antimicrobial effectiveness compared to the other grape pomace extracts due to the presence of  antimicrobial active compounds. syrah extracts were less efficient against the microorganisms tested and merlot extracts were more active against gram-positive  bacteria.

TI  == synthesis of bacillithiol and the catalytic selectivity of fosb-type fosfomycin resistance proteins.
AB  == bacillithiol (bsh) has been prepared on the gram scale from the inexpensive starting material, d-glucosamine hydrochloride, in 11 steps and 8-9% overall yield. the bsh was used to survey the substrate and metal-ion selectivity of fosb enzymes from four gram-positive microorganisms associated with the deactivation of the antibiotic fosfomycin. the in vitro results indicate that the preferred thiol substrate and metal ion for the fosb from staphylococcus aureus are bsh and ni(ii), respectively. however, the metal-ion selectivity is less distinct with fosb from bacillus subtilis, bacillus anthracis, or bacillus cereus.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria from naturally-fermented manzanilla alorena green table olives.
AB  == manzanilla alorena (or alorena) table olives are naturally fermented traditional  green olives with a denomination of protection (dop). the aim of this study was to search for lactic acid bacteria (lab) with technological properties of interest for possible inclusion in a starter or protective culture preparation or also as probiotics. a collection of 144 lab obtained from alorena green table olives naturally-fermented by four small-medium enterprises (smes) from malaga (spain), including lactobacilli (81.94%), leuconostocs (10.42%) and pediococci (7.64%) were studied. rep-pcr clustering and further identification of strains by sequencing of phes and rpo genes revealed that all lactobacilli from the different smes were lactobacillus pentosus. pediococci were identified as pediococcus parvulus (sme1) and leuconostocs as leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (sme1 and sme4). genotyping revealed that strains were not clonally related and exhibited a considerable degree of genomic diversity specially for lactobacilli and also for leuconostocs. some strains exhibit useful technological properties such as production of antimicrobial substances active against pathogenic bacteria such as listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans and salmonella enterica, utilization of raffinose and stachyose, production of bile salt hydrolase, phytase and haeme-dependent catalase activities, growth at 10 degrees c and in the presence of 6.5% nacl, good acidifying capacity and also resistance to freezing. however, none of the isolates showed protease or amylase activity, and also did not exhibit biogenic amine production from histidine, ornithine, cysteine or tyrosine. on the basis of data obtained, selected strains with potential traits were tested for their survival at low ph and their tolerance to bile salts, and the survival capacity demonstrated by some of the analysed strains are encouraging to further study their potential as probiotics.

TI  == comparison of sample preparation methods for the recovery of foodborne pathogens  from fresh produce.
AB  == sample preparation methods (pummeling, pulsifying, sonication, and shaking by hand) were compared for achieving maximum recovery of foodborne pathogens from iceberg lettuce, perilla leaves, cucumber, green pepper, and cherry tomato. antimicrobial and dehydration effects also were examined to investigate causes of poor recovery of pathogens. each produce type was inoculated with escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus at 6.0 log cfu/cm(2), and samples were prepared using the four methods. bacterial populations recovered from the five types of produce  were significantly different (p < 0.05) according to sample preparation methods and produce type. the bacterial populations recovered from pummeled and pulsified samples were higher (p < 0.05) than those recovered from sonicated and hand-shaken samples, except for cherry tomato. the number of bacteria recovered from produce was reduced (p < 0.05) from that of the inoculum by 0.16 to 2.69 log cfu/cm(2). although extracts of iceberg lettuce, perilla leaves, cucumber, and green pepper had no antimicrobial activity, the populations of e. coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, b. cereus, and l. monocytogenes in cherry tomato extract  were slightly reduced after these treatments (p < 0.05). the pathogen populations on perilla leaves and cherry tomatoes decreased by >2 log cfu/cm(2) after exposure to 40% relative humidity for 1 h. no reduction was observed when the five pathogens were exposed to 90% relative humidity. these data suggest that pummeling and pulsifying are optimal sample preparation methods for detection of  microorganisms. acidic produce such as cherry tomato should be treated with a method that does not cause sample breakdown so that acid stress on the bacteria can be minimized. dehydration stress also affects recovery of pathogens from produce.

TI  == phytochemical profiles of volatile constituents from centaurea ragusina leaves and flowers and their antimicrobial effects.
AB  == the volatile oils obtained from the leaves and flowers of the croatian endemic plant centaurea ragusina l. were evaluated for antimicrobial activity. the chemical compositions, determined by gc and gc-ms, were complex, with sesquiterpenes the most abundant class of compound. nonterpene hydrocarbons were  also identified in high quantities, while acids and ketones were found in high quantities only in the leaf volatile oil. aldehydes, alcohols, esters and other compounds were identified in lower quantities. antimicrobial effects of the volatile samples were investigated by using the disc diffusion and microdilution  assays. they were found to inhibit a wide range of bacteria and fungi, causing in vitro growth inhibition at a concentration of 250 microg/ml. the volatile oils displayed great antibacterial potential with mic values ranging from 16 to 128 microg/ml against the gram-positive bacteria bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus, and lesser activity against the gram-negative bacteria cronobacter sakazakii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as fungal strains (mic  = 32-128 microg/ml).

TI  == [the changes of ocular bacterial isolates and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility in the past six years].
AB  == objective: to analyze the changes of ocular bacterial isolates and their susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin and tobramycin in henan province in the past six years. methods: retrospective study  of ocular bacterial isolates and their in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility test results of henan eye institute in the past six years. results: a total of 2044 bacterial isolates were classified into 39 kinds in the past six years, which were mainly from the conjunctival sac. staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common, followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus. all kinds of the ocular bacteria had the highest susceptibility to gatifloxacin (92.3%) among the tested drugs. rods were more sensitive to quinolone drugs than cocci and gram-positive rods were more sensitive to tobramycin than the other types of germs. the drug's susceptibility of the four kinds of quinolone except ciprofloxacin decreased year by year with a decreasing  ladder fashion every two years in the susceptibility change of levofloxacin in the past six years, while the susceptibility of tobramycin increased slowly from  2004 to 2008 and then decreased. staphylococcus epidermidis susceptibility to every drug had the similar trend with the general changes in the past six years,  that is, their susceptibility to ofloxacin decreased significantly since 2008, their susceptibility to gatifloxacin and tobramycin reduced significantly in 2009. although pseudomonas aeruginosa susceptibility to all the drugs had no significant change, for all gram-negative rods, their susceptibility to the four  kinds of quinolone drugs were higher than their susceptibility to tobramycin while their susceptibility to levofloxacin and gatifloxacin reduced significantly as time passed by, especially from the year 2008 to 2009. conclusions: the most common ocular bacterial isolates were staphylococcus epidermidis, followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa. ocular bacterial isolates' susceptibility to gatifloxacin in vitro was significantly higher than to other drugs in every year but decreased significantly in 2009 while their susceptibility to ofloxacin and levofloxacin decreased significantly since 2008. their susceptibility to tobramycin increased  slowly from 2004 to 2008 and then decreased.

TI  == antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  == the aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella enterica ser. enteritidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. the tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. in the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the ph values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. the inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. phosphates obviously made the development of most gram-positive bacteria impossible. especially micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. on the other  hand, gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. the exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. it should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates hexa68 and hexa70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. by comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be  concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on ph values.

TI  == exposure to anacardiaceae volatile oils and their constituents induces lipid peroxidation within food-borne bacteria cells.
AB  == the chemical composition of the volatile oils from five anacardiaceae species and their activities against gram positive and negative bacteria were assessed. the peroxidative damage within bacterial cell membranes was determined through the breakdown product malondialdehyde (mda). the major constituents in anacardium humile leaves oil were (e)-caryophyllene (31.0%) and alpha-pinene (22.0%), and in anacardium occidentale oil they were (e)-caryophyllene (15.4%) and germacrene-d (11.5%). volatile oil from astronium fraxinifolium leaves were dominated by (e)-beta-ocimene (44.1%) and alpha-terpinolene (15.2%), whilst the oil from myracrodruon urundeuva contained an abundance of delta-3-carene (78.8%). however, schinus terebinthifolius leaves oil collected in march and july presented different chemical compositions. the oils from all species, except the one from a. occidentale, exhibited varying levels of antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus and escherichia coli. oil extracted in july from s. terebinthifolius was more active against all bacterial strains than  the corresponding oil extracted in march. the high antibacterial activity of the  m. urundeuva oil could be ascribed to its high delta-3-carene content. the amounts of mda generated within bacterial cells indicate that the volatile oils induce lipid peroxidation. the results suggest that one putative mechanism of antibacterial action of these volatile oils is pro-oxidant damage within bacterial cell membrane explaining in part their preservative properties.

AB  == cationic cross-linked starch (ccs)-iodine complexes containing different amounts  of quaternary ammonium groups (different degrees of substitution (ds)) and iodine have been obtained by iodine adsorption on ccs from aqueous iodine potassium iodide solution. equilibrium adsorption studies showed that with an increase of ds the amount of iodine adsorbed on ccs and the affinity of iodine to ccs increased linearly. the influences of the ds of ccs and the amount of adsorbed iodine on the stability of ccs-iodine complexes in a solution of 0.02m sodium acetate and reactivity toward l-tyrosine have been investigated. at the same ds,  the stability of ccs-iodine complexes decreased with an increase of the amount of adsorbed iodine. with increasing the ds, the stability of ccs-iodine complexes increased. the iodine consumption in the reaction with l-tyrosine increased significantly with an increase of the amount of adsorbed iodine. the influence of ds on iodine consumption was lower and depended on the amount of adsorbed iodine. the antibacterial activity of ccs-iodine complexes against bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli was determined by the broth-dilution and spread-plate methods. the obtained results have demonstrated that an appropriate selection of the ccs-iodine complex composition  (the ds of ccs and the amount of adsorbed iodine) could ensure good antimicrobial properties by keeping a low concentration of free iodine in the system. the main  advantage of using ccs-iodine complexes as antimicrobial agents is the biodegradability of the polymeric matrix.

AB  == it remains challenging to detect unknown pathogenic bacteria in diagnostic, clinical and environmental fields. this work describes the approach to the development of a sensitive, broad-range genosensing assay targeting the conserved 16s rdna region existing in most bacteria, by monitoring the aggregation level of gold nanorods (gnrs)-based nanoprobes through their localized surface plasmon resonance (lspr) property. in the quantitative detection of artificial sequence,  the limit of detection (lod) of such a bioassay is demonstrated to reach the 5 pm level. this pair of universal gnrs-based nanoprobes can further identify at least 6 species of bacteria that were most prevalent in platelet concentrates (pcs) and have no cross-reaction with other pathogens. moreover, it also exhibits higher sensitivity than other broad-range methods in analysing serratia marcescens-spiked pcs. therefore, the presented strategy not only provides a novel and effective dna analysis method to detect multiple bacterial contaminations in pcs, but also opens up possibilities for its future use of detecting unknown bacteria in other systems, such as food and water, even at ultralow levels.

TI  == antibacterial activity of pseudoalteromonas in the coral holobiont.
AB  == corals harbor diverse and abundant prokaryotic populations. bacterial communities residing in the coral mucus layer may be either pathogenic or symbiotic. some species may produce antibiotics as a method of controlling populations of competing microbial species. the present study characterizes cultivable pseudoalteromonas sp. isolated from the mucus layer of different coral species from the northern gulf of eilat, red sea, israel. six mucus-associated pseudoalteromonas spp. obtained from different coral species were screened for antibacterial activity against 23 tester strains. five of the six pseudoalteromonas strains demonstrated extracellular antibacterial activity against gram-positive-but not gram-negative-tester strains. active substances secreted into the cell-free supernatant are heat-tolerant and inhibit growth of bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, and of ten endogenous gram-positive marine bacteria isolated from corals. the pseudoalteromonas spp. isolated from red sea corals aligned in a phylogenetic tree with previously isolated pseudoalteromonas spp. of marine origin that demonstrated antimicrobial activity. these results suggest that coral mucus-associated pseudoalteromonas may play a protective role in the coral holobiont's defense against potential gram-positive  coral pathogens.

TI  == inhibition of macrophage migration by c. botulinum exoenzyme c3.
AB  == c3-like exoenzymes are produced by various microorganism including clostridium botulinum (c3bot), bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus. c3bot is the prototype of c3-like exoenzymes that specifically adp-ribosylates and thereby inactivates rho(a/b/c). c3-like exoenzymes are not yet regarded as virulence factors, as the lack of cell entry domains results in a poor accessibility of the c3-like exoenzymes to cells. in this study, the sensitivity of various cell lines to c3bot has been reinvestigated. primary monocytes as well as cultured macrophage-like cells including j774a.1 cells and raw macrophages exhibit a tenfold higher sensitivity to c3bot than fibroblasts and epithelial cells. rhoa adp-ribosylation by c3bot resulted in the formation of pronounced bipolar protrusions based on defective tail retraction. the formation of bipolar protrusion resulted in inhibited macrophage migration. these findings suggested that macrophages appear to be target cells of c3bot. migration of macrophage is a prerequiste for their recruitment to the site of pathogen invasion or tissue damage. inhibition of macrophage migration likely preserves the survival of c3-producing microorganisms. the observations of this study reinforce the paradigm of a role of c3-like exoenzymes as virulence factors.

TI  == sequence analysis of inducible prophage phis3501 integrated into the haemolysin ii gene of bacillus thuringiensis var israelensis atcc35646.
AB  == diarrheic food poisoning by bacteria of the bacillus cereus group is mostly due to several toxins encoded in the genomes. one of them, cytotoxin k, was recently  identified as responsible for severe necrotic syndromes. cytotoxin k is similar to a class of proteins encoded by genes usually annotated as haemolysin ii (hlyii) in the majority of genomes of the b. cereus group. the partially sequenced genome of bacillus thuringiensis var israelensis atcc35646 contains several potentially induced prophages, one of them integrated into the hlyii gene. we determined the complete sequence and established the genomic organization of this prophage-designated phis3501. during induction of excision of this prophage with mitomycin c, intact hlyii gene is formed, thus providing to cells a genetic ability to synthesize the active toxin. therefore, this prophage, upon its excision, can be implicated in the regulation of synthesis of the active toxin and thus in the virulence of bacterial host. a generality of selection for  such systems in bacterial pathogens is indicated by the similarity of this genetic arrangement to that of staphylococcus aureus beta-haemolysin.

TI  == invariant gly residue is important for alpha-defensin folding, dimerization, and  function: a case study of the human neutrophil alpha-defensin hnp1.
AB  == the human alpha-defensins (hnp) are synthesized in vivo as inactive prodefensins, and contain a conserved glycine, gly(17), which is part of a beta-bulge structure. it had previously been shown that the glycine main chain torsion angles are in a d-configuration, and that d-amino acids but not l-alanine could be substituted at that position to yield correctly folded peptides without the help of a prodomain. in this study, the glycine to l-alanine mutant defensin was  synthesized in the form of a prodefensin using native chemical ligation. the ligation product folded correctly and yielded an active peptide upon cnbr cleavage. the l-ala(17)-hnp1 crystal structure depicted a beta-bulge identical to wild-type hnp1. however, dimerization was perturbed, causing one monomer to tilt  with respect to the other in a dimerization model. inhibitory activity against the anthrax lethal factor showed a 2-fold reduction relative to wild-type hnp1 as measured by the inhibitory concentration ic(50). self-association was slightly reduced, as detected by surface plasmon resonance measurements. according to the  results of the virtual colony count assay, the antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus exhibited a less than 2-fold reduction in virtual lethal dose values. prodefensins with two other  l-amino acid substitutions, arg and phe, at the same position did not fold, indicating that only small side chains are tolerable. these results further elucidate the factors governing the region of the beta-bulge structure that includes gly(17), illuminating why glycine is conserved in all mammalian alpha-defensins.

TI  == antimicrobial effects of silver nanoparticles against bacterial cells adhered to  stainless steel surfaces.
AB  == given the increasing number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the need to synthesize new antimicrobials, silver has attracted interest in the scientific community because of its recognized antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of silver nanoparticles (np) obtained by a new method and tested at concentrations of 6 mug/ml and 60 mug/ml against the species staphylococcus aureus, listeria innocua, salmonella choleraesuis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and bacillus cereus. the ability of these nanoparticles to remove or kill vegetative cells adhered to stainless steel surfaces was also evaluated. we observed that the np obtained with the new method, concentrated silver nanoparticles (cnp), and silver nanoparticles with added sodium chloride (npnacl) had high antimicrobial activities (p < 0.05). we also verified that the most effective condition for the removal of p. aeruginosa  cells on stainless steel coupons (10 by 10 mm) was immersion of the surfaces in cnp. the cnp treatment produced a 5-log reduction of the microbial population after 30 to 60 min of immersion. the cnp treatment also performed better than water and sodium carbonate, a compound commonly applied in clean-in-place procedures in the food industry, in removing adherent b. cereus cells from stainless steel cylinders. therefore, these results suggest that np synthesized by a new procedure may be used as antimicrobials in the food industry, for example, for the sanitization of utensils that come into contact with foods.

TI  == a comparative study of the bactericidal activity and daily disinfection housekeeping surfaces by a new portable pulsed uv radiation device.
AB  == daily cleaning and disinfecting of non-critical surfaces in the patient-care areas are known to reduce the occurrence of health care-associated infections. however, the conventional means for decontamination of housekeeping surfaces of sites of frequent hand contact such as manual disinfection using ethanol wipes are laborious and time-consuming in daily practice. this study evaluated a newly  developed portable pulsed ultraviolet (uv) radiation device for its bactericidal  activity in comparison with continuous uv-c, and investigated its effect on the labor burden when implemented in a hospital ward. pseudomonas aeruginosa, multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, amikacin and ciprofloxacin-resistant a. baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus and bacillus cereus were irradiated with pulsed uv or continuous uv-c. pulsed uv and continuous uv-c required 5 and 30 s of irradiation, respectively, to attain bactericidal activity with more than 2log growth inhibition of all the species. the use of pulsed uv in daily disinfection  of housekeeping surfaces reduced the working hours by half in comparison to manual disinfection using ethanol wipes. the new portable pulsed uv radiation device was proven to have a bactericidal activity against critical nosocomial bacteria, including antimicrobial-resistant bacteria after short irradiation, and was thus found to be practical as a method for disinfecting housekeeping surfaces and decreasing the labor burden.

TI  == substituted salicylaldehydes as potential antimicrobial drugs: minimal inhibitory and microbicidal concentrations.
AB  == substituted salicylaldehydes are potent antibacterial and antifungal agents and may have chemotherapeutic potential. in the clinical setting, the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) as well as the minimal bactericidal and fungicidal concentrations (mbc and mfc, respectively) are of fundamental interest. therefore, we have now, using a panel of five microbial species (bacillus cereus, candida albicans, escherichia coli, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and staphylococcus  aureus), determined the mic and mbc/mfc values of a total of 22 aromatic aldehydes, including 19 substituted salicylaldehydes and the unsubstituted parent compounds benzaldehyde and salicylaldehyde (2-hydroxybenzaldehyde). the results clearly indicate that both of the yeasts studied are remarkably sensitive to various salicylaldehydes and, especially, to halogenated ones. some congeners clearly merit consideration as potential therapeutic agents for candida infections. the mic values of the most potent congeners are of roughly the same magnitude as that of amphotericin b, and the results of the mfc measurements indicate that the compounds are fungicidal. all of the bacteria studied are also  sensitive to at least some of the compounds tested but, clearly, this class of antimicrobials has superior activity against yeasts. structure-activity relationships are discussed for each microbial species and compared with each other. the comparison of the results of mic and mbc/mfc measurements with those of agar diffusion tests revealed aspects that are of interest concerning the methodology of antimicrobial activity screening. unexpectedly, it was found that  some compounds that are completely devoid of activity in agar diffusion tests had potent activity in mic tests, indicating that if only agar diffusion methodology  is used in drug discovery, some highly active compounds may be missed.

TI  == novel bacterial lipoprotein structures conserved in low-gc content gram-positive  bacteria are recognized by toll-like receptor 2.
AB  == bacterial lipoproteins/lipopeptides inducing host innate immune responses are sensed by mammalian toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2). these bacterial lipoproteins are structurally divided into two groups, diacylated or triacylated lipoproteins, by  the absence or presence of an amide-linked fatty acid. the presence of diacylated lipoproteins has been predicted in low-gc content gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasmas based on the absence of one modification enzyme in their genomes; however, we recently determined triacylated structures in low-gc gram-positive staphylococcus aureus, raising questions about the actual lipoprotein structure in other low-gc content gram-positive bacteria. here, through intensive ms analyses, we identified a novel and unique bacterial lipoprotein structure containing an n-acyl-s-monoacyl-glyceryl-cysteine (named the lyso structure) from low-gc gram-positive enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, streptococcus sanguinis, and lactobacillus bulgaricus. two of the purified native lyso-form lipoproteins induced proinflammatory cytokine production from mice macrophages in a tlr2-dependent and tlr1-independent manner but with a different dependence on tlr6. additionally, two other new lipoprotein structures were identified. one is  the "n-acetyl" lipoprotein structure containing n-acetyl-s-diacyl-glyceryl-cysteine, which was found in five gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus subtilis. the n-acetyl lipoproteins induced the proinflammatory cytokines through the tlr2/6 heterodimer. the other was identified in a mycoplasma strain and is an unusual diacyl lipoprotein structure  containing two amino acids before the lipid-modified cysteine residue. taken together, our results suggest the existence of novel tlr2-stimulating lyso and n-acetyl forms of lipoproteins that are conserved in low-gc content gram-positive bacteria and provide clear evidence for the presence of yet to be identified key  enzymes involved in the bacterial lipoprotein biosynthesis.

TI  == salt sensitivity of minimal twin arginine translocases.
AB  == bacterial twin arginine translocation (tat) pathways have evolved to facilitate transport of folded proteins across membranes. gram-negative bacteria contain a tatabc translocase composed of three subunits named tata, tatb, and tatc. in contrast, the tat translocases of most gram-positive bacteria consist of only tata and tatc subunits. in these minimal tatac translocases, a bifunctional tata  subunit fulfils the roles of both tata and tatb. here we have probed the importance of conserved residues in the bifunctional tatay subunit of bacillus subtilis by site-specific mutagenesis. a set of engineered tatay proteins with mutations in the cytoplasmic hinge and amphipathic helix regions were found to be inactive in protein translocation under standard growth conditions for b. subtilis or when heterologously expressed in escherichia coli. nevertheless, these mutated tatay proteins did assemble into tatay and tataycy complexes, and they facilitated membrane association of twin arginine precursor proteins in e. coli. interestingly, most of the mutated tataycy translocases were salt-sensitive in b. subtilis. similarly, the tatac translocases of bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus were salt-sensitive when expressed in b. subtilis. taken together, our present observations imply that salt-sensitive electrostatic interactions have critical roles in the preprotein translocation activity of certain tatac type translocases from gram-positive bacteria.

AB  == there is little published evidence regarding whether heparin lock solutions containing preservatives prevent catheter-related infections. however, adverse effects from preservative-containing flushes have been documented in neonates, leading many hospitals to avoid their use altogether. infection control records from 1982 to 2008 at st. jude children's research hospital (sjcrh) were reviewed  regarding the incidence of catheter-related infections and the use of preservative-containing intravenous locks. in addition, the antimicrobial activities of heparin lock solution containing the preservatives parabens (0.165%) or benzyl alcohol (0.9%), and 70% ethanol were examined against staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans, and compared with preservative-free saline with and without heparin. growth was assessed after exposure to test solutions for 0, 2, 4 and 24h at 35 degrees c. the activities of preservatives were assessed against both planktonic (free-floating) and sessile (biofilm-embedded) micro-organisms using the mbec assay. infection control records revealed two periods of increased catheter-related infections, corresponding with two intervals when preservative-free heparin was used at sjcrh. heparin solution containing preservatives demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against both planktonic and sessile forms of all six microbial species. ethanol demonstrated the greatest antimicrobial activity, especially following short incubation periods. heparin lock solutions containing  the preservatives parabens or benzyl alcohol, and 70% ethanol demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against both planktonic and sessile micro-organisms commonly responsible for catheter-related infections. these findings, together with the authors' historical infection control experience, support the use of preservatives in intravenous lock solutions to reduce catheter related infections in patients beyond the neonatal period.

TI  == protection activity of a novel probiotic strain of bacillus subtilis against salmonella enteritidis infection.
AB  == the activity of 240 bacterial isolates screened from the gastrointestinal tracts  of native chickens were evaluated for use as a potential probiotic in food animal production in order to protect against animal diseases and reduce pathogenic contamination of human food products. in observing the antagonistic activity of 117 bacilli isolates, 10 of these isolates exhibited higher growth inhibition of  seven foodborne pathogens, including salmonella enteritidis, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and vibrio cholerae. beneficial probiotic criteria from these isolates - which included non-pathogenicity, acid and bile salt tolerance, hydrophobicity, and adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells - exhibited that one  isolate of nc11 had the most potential as a probiotic. 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that this nc11 isolate was bacillus subtilis. this b. subtilis nc11 was sensitive to all antibiotics and was not cytotoxic to intestinal epithelial cells. reduction of s. enteritidis attachment to the surfaces of intestinal epithelial cells via action of a cultured medium from b. subtilis nc11 was observed by scanning electron microscopy. b. subtilis nc11 cells, as well as the  bacterial cultured medium or the cultured medium adjusted to ph 7, significantly  inhibited s. enteritidis invasion (p<0.01) of intestinal epithelial cells. this study indicates that b. subtilis nc11 has characteristics of a potential probiotic, and exhibits strong inhibition activity against s. enteritidis infection to intestinal epithelial cells.

TI  == chitosan and silver nanoparticles as pudding with raisins with antimicrobial properties.
AB  == chitosan nanoparticles (cs-np) containing small silver nanoparticles are reported (ag@cs-np). cs-np was synthesized using tripolyphosphate (tpp) as a polyanionic template. tpp also served to electrostatically attract ag(+) inside cs-np, where  it was reduced by the terminal glucosamine units of the biopolymer. this procedure is environmental friendly, inexpensive, and permits the synthesis of very small agnp (0.93-1.7 nm), with only a discrete dependence from the amount of silver nitrate used (5-200mg). the obtained hybrid nanocomposites ag@cs-np were characterized by dls, hrtem, and haadf-stem presenting a mean hydrodynamic diameter of 78 nm. the antimicrobial activity of ag@cs-np against candida glabrata, sacharomyces cerevisiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus corresponded to mic values lower than for agno(3).

TI  == a novel pathogen-binding gc1qr homolog, fcgc1qr, in the chinese white shrimp, fenneropenaeus chinensis.
AB  == in vertebrates, the globular "head" of complement component c1q receptor (gc1qr)  is a versatile, multiligand binding protein. however, research on its function in invertebrates is limited. in the present study, a full-length cdna sequence of a  novel gc1qr homolog, fcgc1qr, from the chinese white shrimp fenneropenaeus chinensis was cloned. semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detected  fcgc1qr in all examined tissues, with the highest level detected in the intestine. western blot assay further revealed that the fcgc1qr protein was distributed in all tested tissues except the cell-free hemolymph of normal chinese white shrimp. in the expression pattern study, quantitative real-time pcr demonstrated that the transcripts of fcgc1qr were up-regulated when challenged with bacteria (vibrio anguillarum or staphylococcus aureus) and white spot syndrome virus. subsequently, fcgc1qr was over-expressed in escherichia coli, and the polyclonal antibody was prepared with the purified recombinant protein. microorganism binding was examined using western blot assay, and revealed that fcgc1qr could bind to bacillus cereus, bacillus thuringiensis, s. aureus, v. anguillarum, vibrioharveyi, and candida albicans. fcgc1qr was also proven able to bind to s. aureus in a concentration-dependent manner, and this binding activity  was partly inhibited by the polyclonal antibody. these results suggest that fcgc1qr may be involved in defending against bacterial infections in the chinese  white shrimp.

TI  == antibacterial activity of three medicinal thai plants against campylobacter jejuni and other foodborne pathogens.
AB  == leaves of adenanthera pavonina, moringa oleifera and annona squamosa are used in  traditional thai medicine to treat dysentery and other diseases. this study investigated the antibacterial activity of these plants against six species of foodborne pathogen. methods and solvents employed to extract active constituents  were optimised using the disc diffusion assay. phytochemical analysis of the optimised extracts was performed by thin layer chromatography (tlc). minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) were determined by broth microdilution. a. pavonina contained flavonoids, terpines and tannins, and was the most active extract against campylobacter jejuni, inhibiting growth at 62.5-125 microg ml(-1). the a. squamosa extract contained flavonoids, terpines, tannins and alkaloids, and had the broadest spectrum of antibacterial activity, inhibiting bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus and c. jejuni between 62.5 and 500 microg ml(-1). mbcs were 2- to 4-fold higher than mics against c. jejuni and b. cereus,  suggesting the extracts are bactericidal against these species. negligible activity was detected from m. oleifera. the data presented here show that a. pavonina and a. squamosa could potentially be used in modern applications aimed at the treatment or prevention of foodborne diseases.

TI  == natural resistance of rose petals to microbial attack.
AB  == petals of red, yellow and white roses (rosa damascene mill.) of the family rosaceae were extracted with (1:1) methylene chloride/methanol and tested for their antimicrobial activities against four species of gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus and staphylococcus aureus), five species of gram-negative bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens) and five species of fungi (penicillium notatum, aspergillus niger, rhizopus stolonifer, saccharomyces cerevisiae and fusarium oxysporum). all of the crude extracts showed a wide range of antimicrobial activities according to the tested organism and rose's type. micrococcus luteus was found to be the most susceptible bacteria to all crude extracts. red and yellow petal extracts showed  much higher antibacterial activity than the white petals extract. bacillus subtilis was found to be the least susceptible to all extracts. the fungus, penicillium notatum was found to be the most susceptible with white petal extract being the most effective. saccharomyces cerevisiae and fusarium oxysporum were the least susceptible to all extracts. white roses extract showed much higher antifungal activities against penicillium notatum than red or yellow roses, therefore, it was subjected to several bioassay guided chromatographic fractionations and purification to isolate the active chemical(s) responsible for the antifungal activity. chemical structure of the isolated antifungal compounds  were identified by spectroscopy techniques and found to be a gamma-sitosterol and (z,z)-9,12-octadecadienoic acid. antibacterial activity of the various types of rose extracts were due to complex mixtures of organic compounds which are still under chemical investigation and will be published later.

TI  == antibacterial peptides derived from caprine whey proteins, by digestion with human gastrointestinal juice.
AB  == peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. the digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (ph 2.5) and human duodenal juice (ph 8) at 37 degrees c. after digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. from these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised  and antibacterial activity examined. strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against escherichia coli k12, bacillus cereus rt inf01 and listeria monocytogenes, less activity against staphylococcus aureus atcc 25 923 and no effect on lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. the pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. when comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, beta-lactoglobulin f(92-100) and beta-casein f(191-205) matched. no peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14-42) or lactoferrampin c f(268-284). human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence ltpvpelk. in such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. the present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.

TI  == occurrence of microorganisms of public health and spoilage significance in fruit  juices sold in retail markets in greece.
AB  == fruit juices are an important part of the modern diet in many countries. however, few data are available concerning the microbiological quality of the fruit juices sold in greece. using standard microbiological procedures, we conducted a bacteriological survey of commercially sold, pasteurized, shelf-stable fruit juices from retail markets. a total of 120 samples of fruit juices sold in various retail markets were examined for their bacteriological quality. the ph of the tested juices was 2.4-4.8. bacteria were isolated from 51 samples (42.5%) and fungi from 78 samples (65%). escherichia coli o157:h7 was detected in four of the analyzed samples (3.34%), and staphylococcus aureus was detected in four different samples (3.34%). in 11 samples (9.1%), the total number of microorganisms detected was as high as 125 colony-forming units (cfu). acidophilic microorganisms were isolated from 26 samples (21.7%) and blastomyces  was detected in 46 samples (38.3%). all samples were negative for lactobacillus,  clostridium perfrigens, salmonella spp., bacillus cereus, total coliforms, e. coli, and listeria monocytogenes. many of the microorganisms detected may cause disease in humans; thus, a number of the tested samples did not meet the greek guidelines for the microbiological quality of juices. use of a hazard analysis critical control point (haccp) system should be generally introduced into the juice industry sector to improve the quality of fruit juices, as well as other manufactured foods.

TI  == comparative analysis of antimicrobial activities of valinomycin and cereulide, the bacillus cereus emetic toxin.
AB  == cereulide and valinomycin are highly similar cyclic dodecadepsipeptides with potassium ionophoric properties. cereulide, produced by members of the bacillus cereus group, is known mostly as emetic toxin, and no ecological function has been assigned. a comparative analysis of the antimicrobial activity of valinomycin produced by streptomyces spp. and cereulide was performed at a ph range of ph 5.5 to ph 9.5, under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. both compounds display ph-dependent activity against selected gram-positive bacteria, including  staphylococcus aureus, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus subtilis, and bacillus cereus atcc 10987. notably, b. cereus strain atcc 14579 and the emetic b. cereus strains f4810/72 and a529 showed reduced sensitivity to  both compounds, with the latter two strains displaying full resistance to cereulide. both compounds showed no activity against the selected gram-negative bacteria. antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria was highest at alkaline ph values, where the membrane potential (deltapsi) is the main component of the proton motive force (pmf). furthermore, inhibition of growth was observed  in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. determination of the deltapsi, using the membrane potential probe dioc(2)(3) (in the presence of 50 mm kcl) in combination with flow cytometry, demonstrated for the first time the ability of cereulide to dissipate the deltapsi in sensitive gram-positive bacteria. the putative role of cereulide production in the ecology of emetic b. cereus is discussed.

AB  == this study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-o-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were gram-negative bacteria. the mics of gallotannins against bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, clostridium botulinum, campylobacter jejuni,  listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. the use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of s. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. supplementation of lb medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of s. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. hepta-o-galloylglucose sensitized lactobacillus plantarum tmw1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (mdr) transporter hora. carbohydrate metabolism of lactococcus lactis mg1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-o-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. in conclusion, the  inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.

AB  == this study was performed to evaluate the effects of korean propolis against foodborne pathogens and spores of bacillus cereus and to investigate the antimicrobial activity against b. cereus structure by transmission electron microscopy (tem). the antimicrobial effects of the korean propolis were tested against foodborne pathogens including gram-positive (b. cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative (salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli and pseudomonas fluorescence) bacteria by agar diffusion assay. gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive than were gram-negative bacteria. the vegetative cells of b. cereus were the most sensitive among the pathogens tested with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 0.036 mg/mul of propolis on agar medium. based on mic, sensitivity of vegetative cells  of b. cereus and its spores was tested in a nutrient broth with different concentrations of propolis at 37 degrees c. in liquid broth, treatment with 1.8 mg/ml propolis showed bactericidal effect against b. cereus. b. cereus vegetative cells exposed to 7.2mg/ml of propolis lost their viability within 20 min. against spores of b. cereus, propolis inhibited germination of spores up to 30 hours, compared to control at higher concentration than vegetative cells yet acted sporostatically. the bactericidal and sporostatic action of propolis were dependent on the concentration of propolis used and treatment time. electron microscopic investigation of propolis-treated b. cereus revealed substantial structural damage at the cellular level and irreversible cell membrane rupture at a number of locations with the apparent leakage of intracellular contents. the antimicrobial effect of propolis in this study suggests potential use of propolis in foods.

TI  == synergistic effects of sodium hypochlorite and ultraviolet radiation in reducing  the levels of selected foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine whether combined treatment would produce synergistic effects to facilitate the sterilization of food products during production relative to single treatment. to assess this hypothesis, we investigated the bactericidal effects of ultraviolet (uv) irradiation and a commercial chemical disinfectant, sodium hypochlorite (naclo), on bacillus cereus f4810/72, cronobacter sakazakii kctc 2949, staphylococcus aureus atcc 35556, escherichia coli atcc 10536, and salmonella typhimurium novobiocin/nalidixic acid in vitro. various concentrations of naclo (20, 60, 100, and 200 ppm naclo) were tested along with exposure to uv radiation at various doses (6, 96, 216, 360, and 504 mw s/cm(2)). the combined naclo/uv treatments resulted in greater reductions  in bacterial counts than either treatment alone. the synergy values against b. cereus, c. sakazakii, s. aureus, salmonella typhimurium, and e. coli were 0.25-1.17, 0.33-1.97, 0.42-1.72, 0.02-1.44, and 0.01-0.85 log(10) cfu/ml, respectively. the results of this study suggest that a significant synergistic benefit results from combined naclo/uv processing against food-borne pathogenic bacteria in vitro.

TI  == microbiological assessment in strawberry production and recommendations to establish a good agricultural practice system.
AB  == this study conducted microbiological assessment in tunnel style strawberry greenhouses and packaging centers and suggested recommendations to establish a good agricultural practice for strawberry production. the samples from irrigation water, workers' gloves, harvest bins, soil, strawberry leaves and strawberries in greenhouses, packers' gloves, conveyor belts, packaging tables, and door knobs of entrances in packaging centers were collected. bacterial cell counts of aerobic plate counts, coliforms, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, salmonella, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus were then enumerated on appropriate selective media. in general, bacterial populations were similar (p >/= 0.05) among strawberry greenhouses but not among packaging houses. e. coli and e. coli  o157:h7 were negative in all samples, and low levels of salmonella and b. cereus  were detected. however, high bacterial cell counts of aerobic plate counts, coliforms, and s. aureus were found in most samples. these results suggest that food safety practice in strawberry greenhouses and packaging centers should be improved, and the results may be useful in the establishment of a good agricultural practice system for strawberry production.

TI  == a subtractively optimized dna microarray using non-sequenced genomic probes for the detection of food-borne pathogens.
AB  == in this study, we present the successful detection of food-borne pathogens using  randomly selected non-sequenced genomic dna probes-based dna microarray chips. three food-borne pathogens, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium (s. typhimurium), and bacillus cereus, were subjected for the preparation of the dna microarray probes. initially, about 50 dna probes selected randomly from non-sequenced genomic dna of each pathogen were prepared by using a set of restriction enzyme pairs. the proto-type of dna microarray chip for detecting three different pathogens simultaneously was fabricated by using those dna probes prepared for each pathogen. this proto-type  dna microarray has been tested with three target pathogens and additional seven bacteria, and successfully verified with a few cross-hybridized probes. after this primary verification of the dna microarray hybridization, this proto-type dna microarray chip was redesigned and successfully optimized by eliminating a few cross-hybridized probes. the specificity of this redesigned dna microarray chip to each pathogen was confirmed without any serious cross-hybridizations, and its multiplexing capability in its pathogen detection was found to be possible. this randomly selected non-sequenced genomic dna probes-based dna microarray was  successfully proved to be the high-throughput simultaneous detection chip for the detection of food-borne pathogens, without knowing the exact sequence information of the target bacteria. this could be the first fabrication of dna microarray chip for the simultaneous detection of different kinds of food-borne pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of bacillus amyloliquefaciens lbm 5006 is enhanced in the  presence of escherichia coli.
AB  == increased antimicrobial activity was observed when bacillus amyloliquefaciens lbm 5006 strain was cultivated in the presence of thermally inactivated cells of escherichia coli, but not with staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, or  bacillus cereus. e. coli also enhanced the antimicrobial activity when it was added to the medium in the form of living cells or as cell debris after cellular  fractionation. no inducing activity was observed with addition of cell-free supernatant of e. coli cultures, suggesting that inducing factor is associated to the cells. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that additional peptide bands are secreted when b. amyloliquefaciens was cultivated in the presence of cell debris of e. coli. these results suggest that the presence of intact or inactivated e. coli enhanced the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides by b. amyloliquefaciens lbm 5006.

AB  == 4-benzoyl-1-(4-methyl-imidazol-5-yl)-carbonylthiosemicarbazide (1) was synthesized, and its antibacterial and type iia topoisomerase (dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv) activity evaluated. (1) was found to have high therapeutic potential against opportunistic gram-positive bacteria, and inhibitory activity against topoisomerase iv (ic(50)=90 mum) but not against dna gyrase. an increase  in activity against topoisomerase iv (ic(50)=14 mum) was observed when the imidazole moiety of (1) was replaced with the indole group in 4-benzoyl-1-(indol-2-yl)-carbonylthiosemicarbazide (2). however, (2) showed only  weak antibacterial activity. although the results of the bacterial type iia topoisomerases inhibition study did not parallel antibacterial activities, our observations strongly imply that a 4-benzoylthiosemicarbazide scaffold can be developed into an efficient gram-positive antibacterial targeting topoisomerase iv. the difference in activity against type iia topoisomerases between (1) and (2) was further investigated by docking studies, which suggested that these compounds target the atp binding pocket.

TI  == a large foodborne outbreak on a small pacific island.
AB  == on march 25, 2009, the ebeye leroj kitlang memorial health center on the island of ebeye in the republic of the marshall islands was overwhelmed with over 100 patients presenting for vomiting and diarrhea. epidemiologic investigation revealed that there were 174 cases among 187 attendees at a local funeral earlier in the day. most cases had eaten served sandwiches containing egg products that had undergone severe time-temperature abuse. while no causal agents were identified, the epidemiology and clinical presentation is compatible with foodborne toxins, most likely enterotoxins of either staphylococcus aureus or bacillus cereus. mitigation measures undertaken by public health centered on education of food preparers and the general public regarding safe food preparation practices. this large outbreak serves to remind us that, while there  are simple and highly effective measures to prevent such foodborne disease outbreaks, we in the public health sector have a duty to improve the community's  knowledge and understanding of these measures.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  == this study assessed potential probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. five lactobacillus isolates identified as lactobacillus reuteri  f03, lactobacillus paracasei f08, lactobacillus rhamnosus f14, lactobacillus plantarum c06, and lactobacillus acidophilus c11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. all the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to caco-2 cells, particularly, strain l. plantarum c06 and l. reuteri f03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain l. rhamnosus gg. the strains l. paracasei f08 and l. acidophilus c11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. all the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both gram-positive (bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (escherichia coli and salmonella enterica) pathogens. moreover, the strains l. reuteri f03, l. paracasei f08, and l. plantarum c06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/ml after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees c. the viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/ml after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees c. in the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. technologically interesting lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.

TI  == characterization and antimicrobial activity of 4-(beta-d-glucopyranosyl-1-->4-alpha-l-rhamnopyranosyloxy)-benzyl thiocarboxamide; a novel bioactive compound from moringa oleifera seed extract.
AB  == antimicrobial activity of crude seed extract of moringa oleifera was investigated by thin layer chromatography bioassay against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, cladosporium cladosporioides, and penicillium  sclerotigenum; most of them were prominently inhibited by an isolate with r(f) 0.92-0.96. characterization and identification of the extract revealed the occurrence of three bioactive compounds: 4-(alpha-l-rhamnopyranosyloxy)benzyl isothiocyanate, methyl n-4-(alpha-l-rhamnopyranosyloxy) benzyl carbamate (both known compounds), and 4-(beta-d-glucopyranosyl-1-->4-alpha-l-rhamnopyranosyloxy)-benzyl thiocarboxamide, existence of which in any moringa spp. or plant is reported for  the first time. the uv spectrum of the novel compound showed maximum absorption at 273 and 225 nm in meoh while the ir spectrum revealed several characteristic bands at 3100, 2900, 1700, 1500, 1300, 1100 and 1000 cm(-1). the (1)h-nmr showed  signals at 1.2 and 3.77 ppm and the (13)c-nmr presented signals at 155, 122, 91.7 and 98.4 ppm. all the compounds at 5 mg/l had very high bactericidal activity against some of test pathogens even at contact period 1-2 h. 4-(beta-d-glucopyranosyl-1-->4-alpha-l-rhamnopyranosyloxy)benzyl thiocarboxamide  was the most potent, with 99.2 % inhibition toward shigella dysenteriae and 100 % toward bacillus cereus, e. coli and salmonella typhi within 4 h of contact.

TI  == potential interaction between the volatile and non-volatile fractions on the in vitro antimicrobial activity of three south african pelargonium (geraniaceae) species.
AB  == previous studies have reported promising antimicrobial efficacy for the essential oils and solvent extracts of several indigenous pelargonium species. this study aimed to determine if any pharmacological interaction (e.g. synergism or antagonism) exists between the volatile and non-volatile components when the different fractions were investigated. the antimicrobial activity of the following fractions were tested; the essential oil prepared by hydrodistillation  (eo), non-volatile fraction (nv), prepared by extraction of plant material remaining in the distilling apparatus (having no or negligible volatile constituents) and solvent extracts prepared from fresh (fc) and dried (dc) plant  material containing both volatile and non-volatile constituents. pelargonium quercifolium oil was dominated by p-cymene (42.1%) and viridiflorol (16.9%), while p. graveolens and p. tomentosum oil had high levels of isomenthone (84.0 and 58.8%, respectively). menthone was noted as a major constituent in the p. tomentosum eo sample. it was evident from the results that the presence of volatile constituents in the three species; p. graveolens, p. quercifolium and p. tomentosum is generally not a pre-requisite for antimicrobial activity. the most  significant variations of antimicrobial activity were noted for p. tomentosum where poorer activity was noted for the fc and eo fractions against bacillus cereus and candida albicans. studies on staphylococcus aureus, however, showed the converse, where best activity was noted for the fc fraction (3.0 mg/ml). for  p. quercifolium, the dc fraction indicated a notable increase in anti-staphylococcal activity (2.0 mg/ml) when compared with the fc (8.0 mg/ml) and eo (16.0 mg/ml) fractions. for p. tomentosum, the fc fraction indicated much  lower antimicrobial activity (against both b. cereus and c. albicans) when compared with all other fractions, suggesting that the essential oils may impact  negatively on the antimicrobial activity when tested against these two pathogens.

AB  == using radix imperatoriae (the root of masterwort) as an example, we describe an efficient approach for the isolation, identification and evaluation of bioactive  plant components on an analytical scale. the extraction of radix imperatoriae with ethyl acetate was enhanced by the application of ultrasound oscillations. this rhizome extract was applied to three pathogenic bacteria (bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus) to determine its antimicrobial activity. disk diffusion was utilized to determine susceptibility. the extract components were separated using a series of chromatography approaches (semi-preparative rp-hplc, or rp-hplc on an analytical scale), followed by testing. all fractions were analyzed by lc-uv-esi-ms and 600 mhz microcoil (1)h nmr spectroscopy. among other findings, in the fraction with the highest antibacterial activity we were able to identify oxypeucedanin and oxypeucedanin hydrate. subsequent analysis revealed that only oxypeucedanin hydrate had antibacterial activity, whereas oxypeucedanin itself was inactive at the concentrations applied. furthermore, oxypeucedanin hydrate appears to be largely, or exclusively, a by-product of sample preparation, since it is either not synthesized by the plant as a second metabolite or is produced by it in only very small quantities.

TI  == aureocins 4185, bacteriocins produced by staphylococcus aureus 4185: potential application in food preservation.
AB  == in the present study, the bacteriocins produced by staphylococcus aureus 4185, a  strain isolated from bovine mastitis, were purified and partially characterized.  after purification by ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography, and five runs of high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc), antimicrobial activity was recovered with 40% and 80% isopropanol, suggesting that more than one antimicrobial peptide, named aureocins 4185, is produced by s. aureus 4185. mass spectrometry analyses revealed three peptides eluted with 40% isopropanol: peptide a (2,305.3 +/-1.5 da), peptide b (2,327.3 +/-1.5 da), and peptide c (3,005.5 +/-1.5 da), and two peptides eluted with 80% isopropanol: peptide d (6,413.5 +/-1.5 da) and peptide e (12,834.5 +/-1.5 da). although five peptides have been detected, only four small peptide sequences were obtained by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (maldi-tof)/tof mass spectrometry analyses: slleqftgk (eluted with 40% isopropanol), allyder, nntshnlplgwfnvk, and nnlaqgtfnatk (eluted with 80% isopropanol). the sequences slleqftgk and allyder revealed identity with hypothetical peptides with unknown function. the sequences nntshnlplgwfnvk and nnlaqgtfnatk showed similarity to a segment of a precursor of staphylococcal autolysins. the antimicrobial activity detected in the supernatant of strain 4185 proved to be resistant to heat treatment at 65 degrees c; however, treatment at 80 degrees c abolished completely its antimicrobial properties. the concentrated supernatant containing  aureocins 4185 exhibited a strong bacteriolytic activity toward micrococcus luteus atcc 4698. additionally, aureocins 4185 exhibited antagonistic activity against important foodborne pathogens, including listeria monocytogenes, thus showing a potential application in food preservation.

TI  == [clinical relevance of time-to-positivity in bactec9240 blood culture system].
AB  == background: continuous monitoring systems have allowed determination of the time-to-positivity (ttp). we evaluated the clinical relevance of ttp in the bactec9240 system (becton-dickinson, usa). methods: a total of 2,354 vials of positive blood cultures were evaluated over 2 months. ttp was monitored from each of bactec plus aerobic/f (bd) or pediatric plus/f and lytic anaerobic/f bottles,  and the differential time-to-positivity (dtp) for blood samples drawn simultaneously via catheter and a peripheral site was determined. results: the average ttp of the positive vials was 17.4 hr, and 79.9% and 95.2% of the vials showed positivity within 24 and 48 hr, respectively. while the average ttp values for aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, acinetobacter baumannii, and streptococcus pneumoniae were less than 10 hr, those for candida spp., anaerobes, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium spp, bacillus spp. other than cereus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were 35.3, 27.0, 56.8, 45.8, 23.0, and 26.3  hr, respectively. the negative predictive values of ttp over 24 hr to predict staphylococcus aureus among staphylococci and s. pneumoniae among alpha-hemolytic streptococci were 76.7% and 100%, respectively. enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus faecalis showed shorter ttp in anaerobic vials than in aerobic vials. dtp of more than 2 hr was observed for 27.8%, 72.2%, and 45.5% of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and candida spp. conclusions: ttp can be used to discriminate pathogens and contaminants. the shorter ttp in anaerobic vials of certain enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus spp. would facilitate further identification. dtp is useful for diagnosing catheter-related bloodstream infection by s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and candida spp.

TI  == cell-based biosensor for rapid screening of pathogens and toxins.
AB  == development and validation of a mammalian cell-based biosensor for application in food defense and food safety was investigated. three prototypes of the biosensor  capable of handling different sample types were developed and tested with food and beverages. the sensing element is a b lymphocyte ped-2e9 cell-line, encapsulated in collagen matrix in 3d scaffold. the uniqueness of this biosensor  is that it detects analyte interaction with mammalian cells and is able to distinguish pathogenic from non-pathogenic and active from inactive toxins, rendering accurate estimation of the risk associated with the agents. this sensor gave positive signal for a broad range of bacterial pathogens; listeria monocytogenes, enterotoxigenic bacillus, vibrio, micrococcus and serratia, and toxins; alpha-hemolysin from staphylococcus aureus, phospholipase c from clostridium perfringens, cytolysin from sea anemone stoichactis helianthus, listeriolysin o from l. monocytogenes, and enterotoxin from bacillus. detection limit for toxins was 10-40 ng in 2 h while for a model bacterial pathogen, l. monocytogenes, 10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml in 4-6 h, even in the presence of a mixture of  higher concentrations of non-pathogenic species of the same genera or common background microflora. with inoculated food and beverage, the sensor detected l.  monocytogenes and bacillus cereus at a low initial concentration of 10(2)-10(4) cfu/g from ready-to-eat meat and rice, and only active toxins at nanogram quantities from rice, milk and water samples. though all the three prototypes performed well with beverages, devices ii & iii are most suitable for testing particulate foods. these data present promising evidence for possible application of this biosensor for rapid detection of multiple pathogens or toxins for food defense and food safety application.

TI  == growth of microorganisms in total parenteral nutrition solutions containing lipid.
AB  == background: to identify the microorganisms that can grow rapidly in total parenteral nutrition (tpn) solutions, we investigated the growth of the major causes of catheter-related blood stream infection (staphylococcus aureus, serratia marcescens, bacillus cereus, and candida albicans) in tpn solutions containing lipid. methods: the ph value of a tpn solution containing lipid (ph 6.0, containing 20 ppm of nahso(3)) was adjusted by the addition of hcl to 5.7, 5.4, or 4.9. the ph value of another tpn solution (ph5.5, containing 400 ppm of nahso(3)) was adjusted by the addition of naoh to 5.9, 6.3, or 6.8. a specific number of each microorganism was added to 10 ml of each test solution and incubated at room temperature. the number of microorganisms was counted as colony forming units at 0, 24, and 48 hrs later. results: c albicans increased similarly at any ph values in the tpn solution. the bacterial species also increased rapidly at ph6.0 in the solution containing 20 ppm of nahso(3), but growth was suppressed as the ph value was reduced, with growth halted at ph4.9. however, these bacterial species did not increase, even at ph5.9, in the other solution containing 400 ppm of nahso(3). conclusions: these results suggest that candida species can grow rapidly in almost all tpn solutions regardless of the acidity, lipid, and nahso(3); also, some bacterial species may grow in tpn solutions containing lipid unless the ph value is 5.0 or less. therefore, each tpn solution should be examined whether or not the bacterial species can proliferate.

TI  == novel family of antimicrobial peptides from the skin of rana shuchinae.
AB  == so far numerous antimicrobial peptides have been characterized from amphibians. in this work, a new family of antimicrobial peptides, named shuchin, was purified and characterized from skin secretions of the frog, rana shuchinae that lives in  freezing mountains. totally two members of shuchin (shuchin 1 and 2) were identified with the amino acid sequence of nalsmprnkcnralmcfg and nalssprnkcdrasscfg, respectively. cdnas encoding shuchins were cloned from the skin cdna library of r. shuchinae. the precursors of shuchin are composed of 62 amino acid residues including the conserved signal peptides, acidic propieces, and mature antimicrobial peptides. synthetic shuchins showed strong and broad antimicrobial activities against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus; mics<12.5 microg/ml), gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, bacillus dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa; most mics from 3.1 to 12.5 microg/ml), and yeast (candida albicans; mics of 6.25 microg/ml), but no hemolytic activity under the effective concentration, thereby provide more leading templates for designing novel anti-infection agents.

TI  == isolation and characterization of a novel analyte from bacillus subtilis sc-8 antagonistic to bacillus cereus.
AB  == in this study, an effective substance was isolated from bacillus subtilis sc-8, which was obtained from traditionally fermented soybean paste, cheonggukjang. the substance was purified by hplc, and its properties were analyzed. it had an adequate antagonistic effect on bacilluscereus, and its spectrum of activity was  narrow. when tested on several gram-negative and gram-positive foodborne pathogenic bacteria such as salmonella enterica, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria monocytogenes, no antagonistic effect was observed. applying the derivative from b. subtilis sc-8 within the same genus did not inhibit the growth of major soybean-fermenting bacteria such as bacillus subtilis, bacillus licheniformis, and bacillus amyloquefaciens. the range of ph stability of the purified antagonistic substance was wide (from 4.0 to >10.0), and the substance was thermally stable up to 60 degrees c. in the various enzyme  treatments, the antagonistic activity of the purified substance was reduced with  proteinase k, protease, and lipase; its activity was partially destroyed with esterase. spores of b. cereus did not grow at all in the presence of 5mug/ml of the purified antagonistic substance. the isolated antagonistic substance was thought to be an antibiotic-like lipopeptidal compound and was tentatively named  bsap-254 because it absorbed to uv radiation at 254nm.

TI  == rapid analysis of gram-positive bacteria in water via membrane filtration coupled with nanoprobe-based maldi-ms.
AB  == matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (maldi) mass spectrometry (ms) is challenging when it is directly applied to identify bacteria in water. this study demonstrates a rapid, sensitive, and selective technique for detection of gram-positive bacteria in water. it involves a combination of membrane filtration (mf) and vancomycin-conjugated magnetite nanoparticles (vnps) to selectively separate and concentrate gram-positive bacteria in tap water and reservoir water, followed by rapid analysis of the isolates using whole-cell maldi-ms. vnps specifically recognize cells of gram-positive bacteria, which serves as a basis for affinity capture of target gram-positive bacteria. a two-step procedure of surface modification of bare magnetite nanoparticles was applied to synthesize vnps. mf prior to vnp-based magnetic separation can effectively increase the enrichment factor and detection sensitivity and reduce time-consuming culture steps and the matrix effect for analysis of bacteria in maldi-ms. the enrichment  factor for the mf-vnp technique is about 6 x 10(4). a variety of bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecium, were successfully analyzed from aqueous solutions and their mixtures with gram-negative bacteria. the optimal conditions of the vnp/maldi-ms  technique, including selection of the maldi matrix, the choice of cell-washing solution, and the vnp concentration, were also investigated. the capture efficiencies of gram-positive bacteria with vnps were 26.7-33.3%. the mass variations of characteristic peaks of the captured bacteria were within +/-5 da,  which indicated good reproducibility of the proposed technique. the technique was applied to detect gram-positive bacteria in tap water and reservoir water with an analysis time of around 2 h. the detection limit for bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecium, and staphylococcus aureus was 5 x 10(2) cfu/ml for 2.0-l water samples.

TI  == an assessment of the antibacterial activity in larval excretion/secretion of four species of insects recorded in association with corpses, using lucilia sericata meigen as the marker species.
AB  == the relative antibacterial activities of excretion/secretion (es) from two carrion-feeding insects, calliphora vicina robineau-desvoidy and dermestes maculatus degeer, and a detritivore, tenebrio molitor linnaeus, were compared to  that of lucilia sericata meigen, a species with es of known antibacterial capacity, in order to explore the antimicrobial potential of other carrion and detritivore species. viable counts were used to assess time-kill of es against five bacterial species, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. antibacterial activity was recorded in all four insect species although t. molitor and d. maculatus were the most effective in controlling growth of p. mirabilis. the blowflies were more effective in controlling a wider range of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the larval es from all species was shown to reduce bacterial growth rate although differences in antibacterial spectrum were noted and the degree of  potency varied between the four species. these differences may be explained ecologically by the different colonisation times of each insect species on the corpse. overall, this study demonstrates that research into other carrion-feeding insect species has potential to provide an increased source of antimicrobial chemicals to broaden the range of bacterial species beyond that currently controlled using l. sericata.

TI  == synergistic effects of ethanol and uv radiation to reduce levels of selected foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine whether combined treatments would produce synergistic disinfection effects on food products during food processing  compared with single treatments. we investigated the bactericidal effects of a commercial chemical disinfectant (ethanol) and of uv radiation on bacillus cereus f4810/72, cronobacter sakazakii kctc 2949, staphylococcus aureus atcc 35556, escherichia coli atcc 10536, and salmonella enterica typhimurium no/na in vitro.  various concentrations of ethanol (10, 30, 40, and 50%) were tested with various  exposure doses of uv radiation (6, 96, 216, 360, and 504 mws/cm(2)) with a uv lamp. the combined ethanol-uv treatments resulted in greater reductions in bacterial counts than did either treatment alone. the synergistic effect values for b. cereus, c. sakazakii, s. aureus, s. enterica typhimurium no/na, and e. coli were 0.40 to 1.52, 0.52 to 1.74, 0.20 to 2.32, 0.07 to 1.14, and 0.02 to 1.75 log cfu/ml, respectively. the results of this study suggest that a significant synergistic benefit results from combining ethanol and uv treatments  against foodborne pathogens in vitro.

TI  == evaluation of diffusion and dilution methods to determine the antibacterial activity of plant extracts.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate diffusion and dilution methods for determining the antibacterial activity of plant extracts and their mixtures. several methods for measurement of the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of  a plant extract are available, but there is no standard procedure as there is for antibiotics. we tested different plant extracts, their mixtures and phenolic acids on selected gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and listeria monocytogenes) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella infantis, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter coli) with the disk diffusion, agar dilution, broth microdilution and macrodilution methods. the disk diffusion method was appropriate only as a preliminary screening test prior to quantitative mic determination with dilution methods. a comparison of the results for mic obtained by agar dilution and broth microdilution was possible only for gram-positive bacteria, and indicated the latter as the most accurate way of assessing the antimicrobial effect. the microdilution method with ttc (2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride) or int (2-p-iodophenyl-3-p-nitrophenyl-5-phenyl tetrazolium chloride) to indicate the viability of aerobic bacteria was found to be the best alternative approach, while only atp determination was appropriate for microaerophilic campylobacter spp. using survival curves the kinetics of bacterial inactivation on plant extract exposure was followed for 24h and in this way the mic values determined by the microdilution method were confirmed as the concentrations of extracts that inhibited bacterial growth. we suggest evaluation of the antibacterial activity of plant extracts using the broth microdilution method as a fast screening method for mic determination and the macrodilution method at selected mic values to confirm bacterial inactivation. campylobacter spp. showed a similar sensitivity to plant extracts as the tested gram-positive bacteria, but s. infantis and e. coli o157:h7 were more resistant.

TI  == synthesis, spectroscopic and biological studies on the new symmetric schiff base  derived from 2,6-diformyl-4-methylphenol with n-aminopyrimidine.
AB  == a phenol based novel schiff base polydentate symmetric ligand was prepared. the complexes were prepared by reacting ligand and the metal chlorides of cu (ii), ni(ii), co(ii) and fe(ii) in methanol to get a series of mononuclear complexes. the complexes were characterized by elemental analyses, conductivity measurements, magnetic susceptibility data, ir, uv-vis, nmr and api-es mass spectral data. the mononuclear structure of the complexes was confirmed on the basis of elemental analyses, magnetic susceptibility and api-es mass spectral data. the ligand and all the metal complexes were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against four gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, s. aureus atcc 25923, bacillus cereus atcc 7064 and micrococcus luteus atcc 9345), one gram-negative bacterium (escherichia coli atcc 4230), and three yeast (candida albicans atcc 14053, candida krusei atcc 6258 and candida parapsilosis atcc 22019) strains. therefore, newly synthesized the ligand and two complexes [(cu(ii) and co(ii)] showed good biological activity against all tested bacteria and yeast strains.

TI  == the swaposin-like domain of potato aspartic protease (stasp-psi) exerts antimicrobial activity on plant and human pathogens.
AB  == plant-specific insert domain (psi) is a region of approximately 100 amino acid residues present in most plant aspartic protease (ap) precursors. psi is not a true saposin domain; it is the exchange of the n- and c-terminal portions of the  saposin like domain. hence, psi is called a swaposin domain. here, we report the  cloned, heterologous expression and purification of psi from stasp 1 (solanum tuberosum aspartic protease 1), called stasp-psi. results obtained here show that stasp-psi is able to kill spores of two potato pathogens in a dose-dependent manner without any deleterious effect on plant cells. as reported for staps (s. tuberosum aspartic proteases), the stasp-psi ability to kill microbial pathogens  is dependent on the direct interaction of the protein with the microbial cell wall/or membrane, leading to increased permeability and lysis. additionally, we demonstrated that, like proteins of the saplip family, stasp-psi and staps are cytotoxic to gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in a dose dependent manner. the amino acid residues conserved in sp_b (pulmonary surfactant protein b) and stasp-psi could explain the cytotoxic activity exerted by stasp-psi and staps against gram-positive bacteria. these results and data previously reported suggest that the presence of the psi domain in mature staps could be related to their antimicrobial activity.

TI  == antibacterial activity of carvacrol and 2-nitro-1-propanol against single and mixed populations of foodborne pathogenic bacteria in corn flour dough.
AB  == cereal doughs are an important part of human diet, but at the same time can act as vehicles for the transmission of human pathogenic bacteria. in the present study, four pathogenic or toxinogenic bacteria (escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus) were inoculated in a dough made from corn flour in combination with the single antimicrobial compounds carvacrol and 2-nitro-1-propanol (2npoh). survival of single and mixed populations in the treated doughs incubated at 37 degrees c was followed by culture-dependent and independent methods (ttge). all strains were completely inactivated within 24 h by the tested compounds at 5% final concentration, but showed variable inhibition at lower concentrations of 0.5% and 2%. sensitivity to antimicrobial compounds was in general modified when strains were tested in cocultures compared with single cultures. b. cereus was more sensitive to carvacrol (minimum bactericidal concentration, mbc, 0.5%) in coculture with s. aureus. it was also more sensitive to 2npoh in cocultures with  s. aureus and with s. enterica (mbc, 2% in both cases). s. aureus was more resistant to carvacrol (mbc, 5%) in cocultures with b. cereus, e. coli, as well as s. enterica. however, sensitivity to 2npoh was not modified in any of the coculture experiments (mbc, 2%). e. coli was more resistant to carvacrol (mbc, 5%) in cocultures with s. aureus and with s. enterica. resistance of e. coli to 2npoh also increased in cocultures with b. cereus (mbc, 5%) and with s. aureus (mbc, 2%), but not with s. enterica (mbc, 0.5%). s. enterica was more resistant to carvacrol (mbc, 5%) in cocultures with e. coli, but it was more sensitive to 2npoh in cocultures with b. cereus as well as with s. aureus (mbc, 2% in both cases). ttge analysis of survivors from cocultures treated with 2npoh or carvacrol allowed a good estimation of the identity of survivors according to their dna band patterns. results from this study indicate that the efficacy of antimicrobials such as carvacrol and 2npoh is greatly influenced by the complexity of the microbial populations under target and the relationships between individual populations.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of tapioca starch/decolorized hsian-tsao leaf gum coatings containing green tea extracts in fruit-based salads, romaine hearts and  pork slices.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of edible coatings based on a tapioca starch/decolorized hsian-tsao leaf gum (dhg) matrix with various green tea extracts (gtes) were evaluated. its effect on the shelf-life extension of fruit-based salads, romaine hearts, and pork slices were investigated as well. three types of gtes from hot water (80 degrees c) (w), 40% (e4) and 80% (e8) ethanol were prepared. it was found that all gtes showed pronounced inhibition on gram positive bacteria in agar media, including staphylococcus aureus bcrc 10781, bacillus cereus bcrc 11778 and listeria monocytogenes bcrc 14848, but not on gram negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli dh10beta and salmonella enteria bcrc  10747. the antimicrobial activities increased with increasing gtes concentration  (1, 2 and 5%), but did not differentiate significantly in terms of the effect of  extraction solvents. when various gtes (1%) were added to an edible coating formulation based on 1.35% tapioca starch +0.15% dhg +0.225% glycerol, pronounced antimicrobial activity on gram positive bacteria was also observed as evaluated by using cylinder diffusion and antimicrobial migration tests. it was believed that the active compounds in green tea extracts could leave the coating matrix and migrate to increase the non-growth area. when being sprayed on various real food models, all tapioca starch/dhg coatings containing gtes could successfully reduce the aerobic counting and growth of yeasts/molds by 1 to 2 log cycles in fruit-based salads, as compared to the control sample. furthermore, during refrigerated storage of romaine hearts and pork slices for 48h, tapioca starch/dhg coatings with e4 extracts demonstrated pronounced antimicrobial activity against gram positive bacteria (4-6 log cycles reduction), followed by w extracts and e8 extracts in a decreasing order. such results implied the high efficacy of antimicrobial migration of tapioca starch/dhg coatings containing gtes and their application potentials on foods.

TI  == growth of microorganisms in total parenteral nutrition solutions without lipid.
AB  == background: to identify the microorganisms that can grow rapidly in total parenteral nutrition (tpn) solutions, we investigated the growth of the major causes of catheter-related blood stream infection (staphylococcus aureus, serratia marcescens, bacillus cereus, and candida albicans) in tpn solutions without lipid. methods: experiment 1: a commercial tpn solution without lipid containing multivitamins (ph5.6) was used. a specific number of each test microorganism was added to each 10 ml of the tpn solution and incubated at room temperature. an aliquot of test solution was sampled and inoculated to scd agar plates at 0, 24, and 48 hrs after the addition of the microorganisms. the number  of microorganisms was counted as colony forming units. experiment 2: the other 2  commercial tpn solutions without lipid (ph5.5) were supplemented with multivitamins. the ph values of the solutions were adjusted to about 6.0, 6.5, or 7.0 using 0.5 mol/l naoh. the addition of microorganisms, incubation, and counting were performed in the same manner. results: experiment 1: s. aureus, s.  marcescens, and b. cereus did not increase in the tpn solution without lipid containing multivitamins (ph5.6), but c. albicans increased rapidly. experiment 2: the 3 bacterial species did not increase even at ph6.0, but increased at ph6.5 and increased rapidly at ph7.0 in both tpn solutions. c. albicans increased similarly at any ph. conclusion: these results suggest that bacterial species cannot grow in tpn solutions without lipid due to the acidity (ph5.6 or lower), but candida species can grow regardless of the acidity.

TI  == a pilot study of the microbiological quality of culturally diverse, ready-to-eat  foods from selected retail establishments in melbourne, australia.
AB  == in recent years, there has been an increasing number of foodborne outbreaks linked to the consumption of culturally diverse foods. this appears to be because of the increasing quantity of culturally diverse foods available and a preference to store these foods, some of which are considered potentially hazardous, at ambient temperature. this practice may contravene temperature requirements defined by the food standards code. a lack of understanding of the hazardous nature of some culturally prepared foods also poses difficulties in applying the  australian food safety legislation by regulators. this pilot study examined the normal microbiota of four culturally diverse foods: nem chua, che dau trang, kueh talam, and banh tet nhan man, which are traditionally stored and consumed at ambient temperature. challenge testing was conducted to investigate the ability of these foods to support the growth of foodborne bacterial pathogens. two of the products (kueh talam and che dau) were found to be microbiologically unsatisfactory because of the high standard plate counts. challenge testing indicated that kueh talam, che dau, and banh tet nhan man were able to support the growth of bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and salmonella (1-2 log increases over 6 hours at 25 degrees c), suggesting that these foods may require temperature control during storage. however, nem chua was unable to support the growth of test bacteria, probably because of its acidic nature (ph 4.5), suggesting that ambient storage of this food may be safe. this study provided some preliminary evidence to support the need for further sampling and challenge testing of these products.

TI  == synergistic effects of the lactobacillus acidophilus surface layer and nisin on bacterial growth.
AB  == we have previously described a murein hydrolase activity for the surface layer (s-layer) of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356. here we show that, in combination with nisin, this s-layer acts synergistically to inhibit the growth of pathogenic gram-negative salmonella enterica and potential pathogenic gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus. in addition, bacteriolytic effects were observed for the gram-positive species tested. we postulate that the s-layer enhances the access of nisin into the cell membrane by enabling it to cross the cell wall, while nisin provides the sudden ion-nonspecific dissipation of the proton motive force required to enhance the s-layer murein hydrolase activity.

TI  == study on the antibiotic activity of microcapsule curcumin against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == curcumin as an edible natural pigment has several biological activities but its use as a food colorant and preservative is restricted due to low stability and insolubility in water. stabilizing it with microencapsulation to obtain microcapsule curcumin can improve its stability and solubility. the microcapsule  curcumin was studied for their antibacterial and antifungal activities against some foodborne pathogens and spoilage microbe such as escherichia coli, yersinia  enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, aspergillus niger, penicllium notatum, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. it exhibited broad spectrum inhibitory effect against all organisms by oxford cup methods, and its minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined by agar dilution method and ranged from 15.7 to 250 microg/ml. for the selected microorganisms, its antibacterial activity was more pronounced against gram-positive bacteria than gram-negative bacteria. furthermore, its antifungal activity is much better  than antibacterial activity. microcapsule curcumin remains in antibacterial and antifungal activities after microencapsulation, which can be potential colorant and preservative in food industry.

TI  == evaluation of antimicrobial peptides as novel bactericidal agents for room temperature-stored platelets.
AB  == background: a single cost-effective pathogen inactivation approach would help to  improve the safety of our nation's blood supply. several methods and technologies are currently being studied to help reduce bacterial contamination of blood components. there is clearly need for simple and easy-to-use pathogen inactivation techniques specific to plasma, platelets (plts), and red blood cells. study design and methods: in this report, we introduce a novel proof of concept: using known therapeutic antimicrobial peptides (amps) as bactericidal agents for room temperature-stored plt concentrates (pcs). nine synthetic amps, four from plt microbicidal protein-derived peptides (pd1-4) and five arg-trp (rw) repeat peptides containing one to five repeats, were tested for bactericidal activity in plasma and pc samples spiked with staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacillus cereus. a 3-log reduction of viable bacteria was considered as the bactericidal activity of a given peptide. results: in both plasma alone and pcs,  rw3 peptide demonstrated bactericidal activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and k. pneumoniae; pd4 and rw2 against p. aeruginosa; and rw4 against k. pneumoniae. the activity of each of these four peptides against the remaining bacterial species in the test panel resulted in less than a 3-log reduction in the number of viable bacteria and hence considered ineffective. conclusions: these findings suggest a new approach to improving the safety of blood components, demonstrating the potential usefulness of screening therapeutic amps against selected bacteria to identify suitable bactericidal agents for stored plasma, pcs, and other blood products.

TI  == assay of enterocin as-48 for inhibition of foodborne pathogens in desserts.
AB  == enterocin as-48 was tested against staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and listeria monocytogenes in different kinds of desserts. the highest activity against s. aureus was detected in baker cream. however, in yogurt-type soy-based  desserts and in gelatin pudding, as-48 (175 arbitrary units [au]/g) reduced viable cell counts of s. aureus by only 1.5 to 1.8 log units at most. the efficacy of as-48 in puddings greatly depended on inoculum size, and viable s. aureus counts decreased below detection levels within 24 h for inocula lower than 4 to 5.5 log cfu/g. for l. monocytogenes, bacteriocin concentrations of 52.5 to 87.5 au/g reduced viable counts below detection levels and avoided regrowth of survivors. the lowest activity was detected in yogurt-type desserts. for b. cereus, viable cell counts were reduced below detection levels for bacteriocin concentrations of 52.5 au/g in instant pudding without soy or by 175 au/g in the  soy pudding. in gelatin pudding, as-48 (175 au/g) reduced viable cell counts of b. cereus below detection levels after 8 h at 10 degrees c or after 48 h at 22 degrees c. bacteriocin addition also inhibited gelatin liquefaction caused by the proteolytic activity of b. cereus.

TI  == simultaneous detection of pathogenic b. cereus, s. aureus and l. monocytogenes by multiplex pcr.
AB  == three important foodborne pathogens, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and  staphylococcus aureus are of major concern for food safety in terms of frequency  and seriousness of the disease. the occurrence these three important pathogens and their coexistence in food matrices are predominant. moreover, symptoms associated with b. cereus and s. aureus food poisoning not only closely resembles each other but can also be overlapping with other foodborne infections. in this context, detection of these three pathogens simultaneously in food samples by a single multiplex pcr (mpcr) would have advantages in terms of rapidity and cost saving, when compared with single organism specific pcrs. mpcr has been standardized by targeting three major diarrheal enterotoxin genes hbl a, cyt k and nhe a of b. cereus, virulence associated nuc and ent b genes of s. aureus and virulence associated hly and iap genes of l. monocytogenes along with internal amplification control (iac). the results showed that mpcr accurately identified all the three organisms individually or in combination without non-specificity. the mpcr was able to detect as low as 10 to 100 organisms per ml of growth following overnight enrichment of spiked food samples (vegetable biriyani and milk) and their presence in naturally contaminated samples also. the high throughput and cost effective multiplex pcr method developed in this study could  provide a powerful tool for simultaneous, rapid and reliable detection of b. cereus, s. aureus and l. monocytogenes in food samples.

TI  == effect of mixed antimicrobial agents and flavors in active packaging films.
AB  == active packaging is an emerging food technology to improve the quality and safety of food products. many works have been developed to study the antimicrobial activity of essential oils. essential oils have been traditionally used as flavorings in food, so they have an important odor impact but they have as well antimicrobial properties that could be used to protect the food. recent developments in antimicrobial active packaging showed the efficiency of essential oils versus bread and bakery products among other applications. however, one of the main problems to face is the odor and taste they could provide to the packaged food. using some aromas to mask the odor could be a good approach. that  is why the main objective of this paper is to develop an antimicrobial packaging  material based on the combination of the most active compounds of essential oils  (hydrocinnamaldehyde, oregano essential oil, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol) together with some aromas commonly used in the food industry. a study  of the concentration required to get the antimicrobial properties, the organoleptic compatibility with typical aroma present in many food systems (vanilla, banana, and strawberry), and the right combination of both systems has  been carried out. antimicrobial tests of both the mentioned aromas, the main components of some essential oils, and the combination of both groups were carried out against bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella choleraesuis, yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli), yeasts (candida albicans, debaryomyces hansenii, zygosaccharomyces rouxii), and molds (botrytis cinerae, aspergillus flavus, penicillium roqueforti, eurotium repens, penicillium islandicum, penicillium commune, penicillium nalgiovensis). the sensory properties of the combinations were evaluated with a triangular test and classification was by an order test; the odor threshold of the aroma compounds was also studied. the results reveal that none of the aromas had antimicrobial properties. the most antimicrobial compounds are thymol, carvacrol, and cinnamaldehyde, but none of them could be combined with banana aroma, whereas only thymol with strawberry aroma gave the right combined organoleptic profile. all of the antimicrobials under study could be combined with vanilla aroma, providing both antimicrobial property and the odor expected.

TI  == differential transfer dynamics of paw63 plasmid among members of the bacillus cereus group in food microcosms.
AB  == aim: to assess the dynamics of plasmid transfer between bacillus thuringiensis and b. cereus in various food microcosms using the b. thuringiensis paw63 and staphylococcus aureus pub110 plasmids as models. methods and results: the conjugative behaviour of paw63, which resembles the b. anthracis virulence plasmid pxo2, and the mobilization of pub110 were investigated using kinetics studies performed in reference lb (lysogeny broth) medium, full-cream and skimmed milks, soya milk and rice milk. transfers of paw63 and pub110 were found to occur in the five tested media, with higher frequencies observed in food matrices, most notably in full-cream milk, skimmed milk and soya milk, where the mean transfer frequencies reached 10(-3) transconjugants per recipient cell. the most notable observations were that the higher transfer frequencies obtained in foodstuffs compared to those observed in lb were because of an earlier onset of conjugation  in combination with a higher transfer rate and/or a longer mating period. conclusion: these results indicate that not only the potential for plasmid transfer but also the overall timing of conjugation is affected by each of these  food matrices. significance and impact of the study: this new approach to study plasmid transfer provides insights for a better understanding of conjugation in food microcosms from both animal and vegetable origins among members of the b. cereus group.

TI  == growth and gaseous emissions of pure and mixed small intestinal bacterial cultures: effects of bile and vancomycin.
AB  == simultaneous cultivations in anaerobiosis, aerobiosis and with microaerobic gas mixture were used to clarify the bile (oxgall) effects on the pure and mixed cultures of enterobacterial strains in simulations in portable microbe enrichment unit (pmeu) linked with chempro100i((r)) gas detector. the effects of vancomycin  were evaluated in aerobic cultures. growth and metabolic activity of cultures were also followed by measuring sugar consumption, ph alterations, and colony counts on bd chromagar orientation plates. results showed that the two fermentatively different strains of facultative anaerobes, escherichia coli e 17  and klebsiella mobilis atcc 13048 grew in balance regardless of oxygen level, bile acid concentration or other components of the mixed cultures, bacillus cereus or staphylococcus aureus. when the evaporations of the mixed cultures of e. coli, k. mobilis and s. aureus were compared with the emissions of the corresponding pure cultures by chempro100i((r)) gas sensing detector, the pure cultures of bile resistant e. coli and k. mobilis produced more gaseous components than the mixed culture indicating that these organisms cooperate and use the substrate more effectively together than separately. a survey of the aseptic bacterial isolations from the bile tract in a big university hospital, (salzburg, austria) during 3 years, showed that these bacterial groups dominated. only 13.24% of the 287 patient samples were sterile, and around 180 strains of both e. coli and klebsiella/enterobacter groups were found amongst 973 isolates from 249 patients (together 35.57%). enterococcus sp. accounted for 246 isolates  being the largest group of strains (24.25% of all the isolates). in anaerobiosis  it was shown that klebsiella neutralized the acids produced in the mixed acid fermentation of the e. coli. the ethanol produced from both groups evaporated in  the gas stream of the pmeu culturing step and its formation also removes excess acidity from the cultures. the synergistic behaviour and symbiotic function between e. coli and klebsiella/enterobacter strains is suggested.

TI  == detection of enterobacter sakazakii and other pathogens associated with infant formula powder by use of a dna microarray.
AB  == pathogen detection is critical to the process of generating and testing powdered  infant formula (pif). an obstacle associated with pif microbial surveillance is that most current procedures are time-consuming and labor-intensive. we have developed a rapid, dna microarray-based detection technique to identify 10 different pathogenic bacteria associated with pif contamination based on the 16s-23s rrna gene internal transcribed spacer (its) sequences and wzy (o antigen  polymerase) gene. using this procedure, enterobacter sakazakii, salmonella enterica, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus  aureus, and escherichia coli o157 were identified. one hundred eighty-five strains were used to validate the microarray assay (including 134 target pathogen strains and 51 closely related bacteria). twenty-seven probes reproducibly detected multiple pathogens with high specificity and sensitivity (0.100 ng genomic dna or 10(4) cfu/ml). twenty-one real pif samples were tested by the microarray with 100% accuracy. the data presented reveal that the designed oligonucleotide microarray is a promising method for basic microbiology, clinical diagnosis, food safety, and epidemiological surveillance.

TI  == bacteriocin production by staphylococcus aureus involved in bovine mastitis in brazil.
AB  == in the present study, 257 staphylococcus spp. strains were isolated from bovine mastitis cases in 56 different brazilian dairy herds located in the southeast region of the country and tested for antimicrobial substance (ams) production. forty-six strains (17.9%) exhibited ams production and their identification as staphylococcus aureus was based on the presence of gram-positive cocci and on positive results in tests for the ability to coagulate rabbit plasma, to ferment  mannitol, and to produce acetoin. the ams were characterized as bacteriocins (bac) by their sensitivity to proteolytic enzymes. the bac(+) strains were tested for resistance to 14 antimicrobial agents showing different profiles. eighteen strains (39.0%) expressed a multiple antibiotic resistance phenotype. forty-five  strains exhibited at least one plasmid dna. cross-immunity analysis against strain s. aureus a70, which produces aureocin a70, amplification of the aurabcd operon (which encodes aureocin a70) or detection of this same operon by dna/dna hybridization revealed that 34 strains produce bacteriocins either identical or similar to aureocin a70. the remaining 12 bac(+) strains produce antimicrobial peptides that seem to be distinct from the best characterized staphylococcal bacteriocins described thus far. the bacteriocin produced by strain 4185 may possess potential practical applications, since it was able to inhibit important  pathogens such as bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus spp. isolated from nosocomial infections.

AB  == infection is a major cause of death in patients with aplastic anemia (aa). there  are differences between the immunocompromised state of a patient with aa and the  patient who is neutropenic due to chemotherapy and this leads to a difference in  the infections that they incur. prolonged neutropenia is one of the largest risk  factors for the development of infections with the invasive mycoses and bacteria. recovery from neutropenia is directly related to survival, and supportive care plays a large role in protection while the patient is in a neutropenic state. the most common invasive mycoses include the aspergillus species, zygomycetes, candida spp., and fusarium spp. bacterial infections that are seen in patients with aa include gram-positive coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, enterococcus, staphylococus aureus, clostridium spp., micrococcus, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, and bacillus cereus. gram-negative infections including gram-negative bacilli, escherichia coli, salmonella, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumonia, aeromonas hydrophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio vulnificus. viral infections are much less common but include those that belong to the herpesviridae family, community-acquired respiratory viral infection, and the viral hepatitides a, b, and c. evidence of the parasite strongyloides stercoralis has also been documented. this review discusses the major invasive fungal infections, bacterial pathogens, parasites, and viral infections that are found in patients with aa who are treated with immunosuppressive therapy. the specific  immune impairment and current treatment parameters for each of these classes of infection will also be discussed.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of benzophenones and extracts from the fruits of garcinia  brasiliensis.
AB  == the pericarp and seeds from fruits of garcinia brasiliensis were subjected to extraction with hexane and ethanol. the pericarp hexane extract (phe) and seed ethanol extract (see) were purified by silica gel column chromatography, which permitted isolation of the prenylated benzophenones 7-epiclusianone (1) and guttiferone-a (2), respectively. the antimicrobial activity of phe, see, and compounds 1 and 2 were evaluated against candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and bacillus cereus cultures. the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration were established. the substances presented activity against s. aureus and b. cereus as follows: phe, 4.0 microg/ml and 2.4 microg/ml; see, 10.0 microg/ml and 12.6 microg/ml; 7-epiclusianone, 1.2 microg/ml and 0.6 microg/ml; and guttiferone-a, 2.4 microg/ml and 2.4 microg/ml, respectively. the direct relationship between the lipophilic character of the structure and activity in gram-positive bacteria was  specifically observed. therefore these extracts and prenylated benzophenones represent an interesting topic for further studies and open possibilities for an  alternative control of diseases associated with gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == interventions for control of salmonella: clearance of microbial growth from rubber picker fingers.
AB  == a study was conducted to determine if a surface material with antimicrobial properties combined with an effective disinfectant could achieve total clearance  of bacterial contamination. before beginning the project, new rubber picker fingers collected from 3 processing facilities were tested for endogenous microflora. five species of bacteria common to soil and human handling were present: bacillus amyloliquefaciens, bacillus cereus/thuringiensis, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus hominis ssp. novobiosepticus, and staphylococcus intermedius. in separate experiments, new (unused) rubber picker fingers from 3 manufacturers were exposed to broiler carcass rinses, and the kinetics of bacterial attachment to finger material was determined. turbidity of  the bacterial suspensions at varying dilutions containing picker finger sections  was compared hourly with controls to evaluate inhibition. new rubber finger material from the 3 manufacturers significantly inhibited bacterial growth (p < 0.05), without the aid of antibacterial additives. we improved an assay for screening disinfectants against growth of pathogens and determined the activity of 5 disinfectant compounds. two of the compounds were most effective against pseudomonas aeruginosa, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enteritidis, and escherichia coli, and one of the compounds was selected for further study with salmonella enteritidis. scanning electron microscopy confirmed the levels of salmonella enteritidis before and after treatment. the most effective compound was nontoxic and completely cleared salmonella enteritidis contamination from the rubber picker finger surface.

TI  == antibacterial protection by enterocin as-48 in sport and energy drinks with less  acidic ph values.
AB  == the low ph and acid content found in sports and energy drinks are a matter of concern in dental health. raising the ph may solve this problem, but at the same  time increase the risks of spoilage or presence of pathogenic bacteria. in the present study, commercial energy drinks were adjusted to ph 5.0 and challenged with listeria monocytogenes (drinks a to f), staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and bacillus licheniformis (drink a) during storage at 37 degrees c. l. monocytogenes was able to grow in drink a and survived in drinks d and f for at least 2 days. addition of enterocin as-48 (1 microg/ml final concentration) rapidly inactivated l. monocytogenes in all drinks tested. s. aureus and b. cereus also survived quite well in drink a, and were completely inactivated by 12.5 microg/ml enterocin as-48 after 2 days of storage or by 25 microg/ml bacteriocin after 1 day. b. licheniformis was able to multiply in drink a, but it was completely inactivated by 5 microg/ml enterocin as-48 after 2 days of storage or by 12.5 microg/ml bacteriocin after 1 day. results from the present study suggest that enterocin as-48 could be used as a natural preservative against these target bacteria in less acidic sport and energy drinks.

TI  == synthesis, spectral characterization, in-vitro microbiological evaluation and cytotoxic activities of novel macrocyclic bis hydrazone.
AB  == a macrocyclic hydrazone schiff base was synthesized by reacting 1,4-dicarbonyl phenyl dihydrazide with 2,6-diformyl-4-methyl phenol and a series of metal complexes with this new schiff base were synthesized by reaction with co(ii), ni(ii) and cu(ii) metal salts. the schiff base and its complexes have been characterized by elemental analyses, ir, (1)h nmr, uv-vis, fab mass, esr spectra, fluorescence, thermal, magnetic and molar conductance data. the analytical data reveal that the co(ii), ni(ii) and cu(ii) complexes possess 2:1 metal-ligand ratios. all the complexes are non-electrolytes in dmf and dmso due to their low molar conductance values. infrared spectral data suggest that the hydrazone schiff base behaves as a hexadentate ligand with non non donor sequence towards the metal ions. the esr spectral data shows that the metal-ligand bond has considerable covalent character. the electrochemical behavior of the copper(ii) complex was investigated by cyclic voltammetry. the schiff base and its complexes have also been screened for their antibacterial (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, shigella dysentery, micrococcus, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and antifungal activities (aspergillus niger, penicillium and candida albicans) by mic method. the brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in-vitro cytotoxic properties.

TI  == an overlap between the control of programmed cell death in bacillus anthracis and sporulation.
AB  == the staphylococcus aureus cid and lrg operons have been shown to control cell death and lysis in a manner thought to be analogous to programmed cell death (apoptosis) in eukaryotic organisms. although orthologous operons are present in  a wide variety of bacterial species, members of the bacillus cereus group are unique in that they have a total of four cid-/lrg-like operons. two of these operons are similar to the s. aureus cid and lrg operons, while the other two (designated clhab(1) and clhab(2)) are unique to this group. in the present study, the functions and regulation of these loci were examined. interestingly, the bacillus anthracis lrgab mutant displayed decreased stationary-phase survival, whereas the clhab(2) mutant exhibited increased stationary-phase survival compared to the parental and complementation strains. however, neither mutation had a dramatic effect on murein hydrolase activity or autolysis. furthermore, a quantitative analysis of the sporulation efficiency revealed that  both mutants formed fewer spores than did the parental strain. similar to s. aureus, b. anthracis lrgab transcription was shown to be induced by gramicidin and cccp, agents known to dissipate the proton motive force, in a lytsr-dependent manner. northern blot analyses also demonstrated a positive role for lytsr in the clhab(2) transcription. taken together, the results of the present study demonstrate that b. anthracis lrgab and clhab(2) play important roles in the control of cell death and lysis and reveal a previously unrecognized role of this system in sporulation.

TI  == disinfection methods used in decontamination of bottles used for feeding powdered infant formula.
AB  == infant susceptibility and the risks posed by infections associated with bottle-fed powdered infant formula (pif) have received increased attention in recent years. intrinsic contamination of pif with pathogens has been reported and extrinsic contamination can be introduced from the handler or the environment during reconstitution. recommended disinfection advice and bottle decontamination have changed in recent years and the aim of this study was to validate the efficacy of four current disinfection methods using bottles that had contained reconstituted pif spiked with either a representative mixed bacterial culture or  specific pathogens. initially, bottles (n = 6) of reconstituted formula were spiked with 10(5) cfu/ml representative mixed culture. for subsequent experiments, reconstituted formula was spiked with either 10(2) and 10(4) cfu/ml  of enterobacter sakazakii (cronobacter), bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus. before disinfection, bottles were cleaned according to recommended guidelines. disinfection procedures tested included a hypochlorite-based chemical solution and three heat-based methods. bottles were sampled in four sites. before cleaning and disinfection, the inner screw cap and inner-teat were the most heavily contaminated sites with 1.6-7.4 x 10(3) cfu/per-area-sampled; the bottle  interior was more contaminated overall with 1.2 x 10(4) cfu/per-area-sampled. after disinfection, adherence to recommended procedures (combined with good hygiene) enabled effective decontamination to be achieved using all methods. small differences in disinfection ability were not significant (p > 0.05). cumulatively, 800 sites were sampled and no b. cereus or e. sakazakii were isolated. s. aureus was isolated from 0.1% of sites with one site exceeding 1 cfu/ml. findings indicate the potential for bottle contamination and that strict  adherence to four currently used methods allowed effective decontamination. this  highlights the importance of effective consumer education by health care professionals.

TI  == construction of a recombinant intergenus multidomain chimeric protein for simultaneous expression of haemolysin bl of bacillus cereus, listeriolysin o of listeria monocytogenes and enterotoxin b of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == haemolysin bl (hbl) of bacillus cereus, listeriolysin o (llo) of listeria monocytogenes and enterotoxin b (seb) of staphylococcus aureus are among the major toxin components contributing to the pathogenicity of these organisms in foodborne illnesses. in this study, an intergenus non-toxic multidomain fusion protein (r-hle) was generated with specificity for hbl, llo and seb. the fusion gene (r-hle) comprising the conserved regions of hbld and the hly and entb genes  was codon-optimized for expression in escherichia coli and encoded a 50 kda recombinant multidomain chimeric protein (r-hle). hyperimmune antiserum raised against r-hle specifically reacted with the l1 (38 kda) component of the hbl complex of b. cereus, llo (58 kda) of l. monocytogenes and seb (28 kda) of s. aureus during western blot analysis when tested on standard strains. during testing on isolates, the antiserum again identified the appropriate toxin molecules and was highly specific to the relevant bacterial species. the antigenicity of the seb component of the r-hle protein was also confirmed using a commercially available tecra kit. the described procedure of creating a single antigenic molecule carrying components of three different toxins whilst still retaining the original antigenic determinants of individual toxins will be highly advantageous in the development of rapid, reliable and cost-effective immunoassays.

TI  == engineered sers substrates with multiscale signal enhancement: nanoparticle cluster arrays.
AB  == defined nanoparticle cluster arrays (ncas) with total lateral dimensions of up to 25.4 microm x 25.4 microm have been fabricated on top of a 10 nm thin gold film using template-guided self-assembly. this approach provides precise control of the structural parameters in the arrays, allowing a systematic variation of the average number of nanoparticles in the clusters (n) and the edge-to-edge separation (lambda) between 1 < n < 20 and 50 nm < or = lambda < or = 1000 nm, respectively. investigations of the rayleigh scattering spectra and surface-enhanced raman scattering (sers) signal intensities as a function of n and lambda reveal direct near-field coupling between the particles within individual clusters, whose strength increases with the cluster size (n) until it  saturates at around n = 4. our analysis shows that strong near-field interactions between individual clusters significantly affect the sers signal enhancement for  edge-to-edge separations lambda < 200 nm. the observed dependencies of the raman  signals on n and lambda indicate that ncas support a multiscale signal enhancement which originates from simultaneous inter- and intracluster coupling and |e|-field enhancement. the ncas provide strong and reproducible sers signals  not only from small molecules but also from whole bacterial cells, which enabled  a rapid spectral discrimination between three tested bacteria species: escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, and staphylococcus aureus.

AB  == the influence of conjugated linoleic acid (cla) on the growth of some foodborne and pathogenic bacteria was examined. a potassium salt of cla (cla-k) was tested  against three gram-positive strains ( bacillus cereus , staphylococcus aureus , and streptococcus mutans ) and five gram-negative strains ( pseudomonas aeruginosa , salmonella typhimurium , vibrio parahemolyticus , klebsiella pneumoniae , and proteus mirabilis ). cla-k-mediated growth inhibition was evident for all tested strains, particularly the gram-positive strains. the ic(50) value of cla-k was 0.3 mm for b. cereus, 1.2 mm for s. aureus, and 0.3 mm  for s. mutans, whereas the value was 1.2 mm for k. pneumoniae, 1.2 mm for p. aeruginosa, 1.8 mm for s. typhimurium, 1.8 mm for v. parahemolyticus, and 2.4 mm  for p. mirabilis. the cla-k delayed the growth of all the tested strains at lower cla-k concentrations, but completely inhibited the growth at higher concentrations. all cells grown in the medium containing cla-k contained cla in their membranes and exhibited irregular cell surface and cell disruption, which were greater in gram-positive than gram-negative strains. higher lactic dehydrogenase activity (ldh), protein content, and malondialdehyde (mda) content  were evident in gram-positive strains than in gram-negative strains. these results suggest that the broad spectrum of growth inhibition by cla mediated through the lipid peroxidation of cla in the membranes and in the medium.

TI  == the diterpenoid ent-16-kauren-19-oic acid acts as an uncoupler of the bacterial respiratory chain.
AB  == ent-16-kauren-19-oic acid is a bacteriolytic diterpenoid present in the resin of  the medicinal plant pseudognaphalium vira vira. the compound and its methyl ester showed strong activity against gram-positive bacteria, whereas the derivative 3beta-hydroxy-ent-kauren-19-oic acid was inactive against all assayed bacteria at the maximal concentration used (250 microg/ml). the bacteriolytic effect of ent-16-kauren-19-oic acid (5 microg/ml) was confirmed with cultures of bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus, whereas the methyl derivative (12 microg/ml) showed only a bacteriostatic effect. both compounds stimulated oxygen consumption and proton conduction of whole cells, as reflected by an abrupt increase in the extracellular ph. these results indicate that ent-16-kauren-19-oic acid acts as a respiratory chain uncoupler, and that this function is strongly affected by minor structural substitutions, suggesting a tight activity-structure relationship. the ultimate effect of the uncoupling mechanism demonstrated by ent-16-kauren-19-oic  acid is bacterial lysis. the disruption of the bacterial membrane integrity caused by the diterpenoid compound was determined using sytox green stain and visualized by fluorescence microscopy.

TI  == [diarrhea from the infectologist's point of view].
AB  == gastroenteritis is a nonspecific term for various pathologic states of the gastrointestinal tract. gastroenteritis causing pathogens are the second leading  cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. in the developed countries diarrhea is the most common reason for missing work, while in the developing world, it is  a leading cause of death. internationally, the mortality rate is 5-10 million deaths each year. "traveller's diarrhea" is a polyetiologic common health problem of international travellers which affects travellers generally for days, but it can result in chronic postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome as well. infectious agents usually cause acute gastroenteritis either by adherence of the intestinal  mucosa, or by mucosal invasion, enterotoxin production, and/or cytotoxin production. the incubation period can often suggest the cause of etiology. when symptoms occur within 6 hours of eating, ingestion of preformed toxin of s. aureus or bacillus cereus should be suspected. the incidence of hypervirulent c.  difficile associated colitis is an emerging problem as a healthcare system associated infection. while infectious agents do not commonly cause chronic diarrhea, those that do include c. difficile, giardia lamblia, entamoeba histolytica, cryptosporidium, aeromonas and yersinia . amoebiasis is the second to malaria as a protozoal cause of death. infection with hiv is also a common cause of diarrhea.

TI  == spontaneous fermentation of traditional sago starch in papua new guinea.
AB  == sago starch is an important dietary carbohydrate in lowland papua new guinea (png). an investigation was conducted to determine whether microbes play a role in its preservation using traditional methods. in 12 stored sago samples collected from png villages, lactic acid bacteria (lab) were present (> or = 3.6  x 10(4)cfu/g) and ph ranged from 6.8 to 4.2. acetic and propionic acids were detected in all samples, while butyric, lactic and valeric acids were present in  six or more. in freshly prepared sago, held in sealed containers in the laboratory at 30 degrees c, spontaneous fermentation by endogenous microflora of  sago starch was observed. this was evident by increasing concentrations of acetic, butyric and lactic acids over 4 weeks, and ph reducing from 4.9 to 3.1: both lab and yeasts were involved. survival of potential bacterial pathogens was  monitored by seeding sago starch with approximately 10(4)/g of selected organisms. numbers of bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus  aureus fell to < 30/g within 7 days. salmonella sp. was present only in low numbers after 7 days (< 36/g), but escherichia coli was still detectable after three weeks (> 10(2)/g). fermentation appeared to increase the storability and safety of the product.

TI  == the science of salsa: antimicrobial properties of salsa components to learn scientific methodology.
AB  == most ethnic foods and cooking practices have incorporated the use of spices and other food additives. many common spices have crossed cultural boundaries and appear in multiple ethnic cuisines. recent studies have demonstrated that many of these ingredients possess antimicrobial properties against common food spoilage microorganisms. we developed a laboratory exercise that promotes the use of scientific methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of salsa components at inhibiting the growth of undesirable microorganisms. tomato, onion, garlic, cilantro, and jalapeno were tested for antimicrobial properties against a representative fungus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the common food spoilage bacteria staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and escherichia coli. each component was ethanol extracted and a modification of the kirby-bauer method of antimicrobial sensitivity was employed. garlic demonstrated the greatest inhibitory effects against all organisms tested. onion demonstrated a slight inhibition of all four organisms, while cilantro showed some inhibition of all three bacteria but no effect against the fungus. jalapeno may have slightly inhibited e. coli and s. aureus, as evidenced by a consistently measured increase in the zone of inhibition that was not statistically significant when compared to that of the control. following the initial exercise, students were given the opportunity to repeat the exercise using other spices such as cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, and coriander. student learning outcomes were evaluated using preliminary and secondary surveys, mainly focusing on definitions of science and hypothesis as well as the process of science. students enjoyed this exercise and met the learning goals of understanding the process and methodology of science, as well as the interdisciplinarity inherent in the sciences. student learning was evidenced by an increase in the number of correct responses on the secondary survey in comparison to the preliminary.

TI  == antibacterial effects of roselle calyx extracts and protocatechuic acid in ground beef and apple juice.
AB  == the antibacterial effects of roselle calyx aqueous and ethanol extracts and protocatechuic acid against food spoilage bacteria salmonella typhimurium dt104,  escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus were examined. minimal inhibitory concentrations of roselle calyx aqueous and ethanol extracts and protocatechuic acid against these bacteria were  in the range of 112-144, 72-96, and 24-44 microg/ml, respectively. protocatechuic acid content in roselle calyx aqueous and ethanol extracts was 2.8 +/- 0.7 and 11.9 +/- 1.2 mg/g, respectively. antibacterial activity of roselle calyx ethanol  extract and protocatechuic acid was not affected by heat treatments from 25 degrees to 75 degrees c and 25 degrees to 100 degrees c, respectively. after 3 days storage at 25 degrees c, the addition of roselle calyx extracts and protocatechuic acid exhibited dose-dependent inhibitory effects against test bacteria in ground beef and apple juice, in which the roselle calyx ethanol extract showed greater antibacterial effects than the aqueous extract. these data suggest that roselle calyx ethanol extract and protocatechuic acid might be potent agents as food additives to prevent contamination from these bacteria.

TI  == characterization of anti-listeria bacteriocins isolated from shellfish: potential antimicrobials to control non-fermented seafood.
AB  == this work had as main objectives to characterize two bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria (lab) previously isolated from non-fermented seafood, in order to evaluate their potential as new food protective agents. the two bacteriocinogenic isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using genus- and species-specific primers, and confirmed by 16s rdna sequencing,  as enterococcus faecium and pediococcus pentosaceus. the antimicrobial spectrum of each strain included several indicator microorganisms, some of them also isolated from seafood. growth of listeria innocua, l. monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus and other lab species were inhibited, although no inhibition of gram-negative microorganisms was observed. proteolytic, but not lipolytic or glycolytic enzymes, completely inactivated the antimicrobial effect of both cell-free supernatants confirming the proteinaceous nature of the  inhibitors. the antimicrobial activity was maintained after treatment with nacl,  sds, triton x-100, tween 20, tween 80 and edta after 2 h or 5 h of exposure and both bacteriocins were stable over a wide range of ph and temperatures. production of bacteriocin by e. faecium (bacalp7) was detected initially at exponential phase and reached a maximum activity of 25,600 au/ml in the early stationary phase, whereas bacteriocin production by p. pentosaceus alp57 (bacalp57) reached the maximum at exponential phase with 12,800 au/ml. the bacteriocins did not kill l. monocytogenes esb54 nor l. innocua 2030c however, cellular growth was reduced. the partially purified bacteriocins, bacalp7 and bacalp57, were below 6.5 kda in size as determined by tricine-sds gel electrophoresis. e. faecium and p. pentosaceus contained dna fragments corresponding in size to those recorded for enterocin b and pediocin pa-1, respectively. sequencing of the fragments from both bacteriocins confirmed the homology. to our knowledge, for the first time two lab producing bacteriocins similar to pediocin pa-1 and enterocin b, were isolated from non-fermented shellfish. the adaptation of the cultures to seafood matrices may be advantageous in terms of application as a biopreservation strategy for reduction of l. monocytogenes levels in seafood products.

TI  == crystal structure and enantiomer selection by d-alanyl carrier protein ligase dlta from bacillus cereus.
AB  == ubiquitous d-alanylation of lipoteichoic acids modulates the surface charge and ligand binding of the gram-positive cell wall. disruption of the bacterial dltabcd gene involved in teichoic acid alanylation, as well as inhibition of the  dlta protein, has been shown to increase a gram-positive bacterium's susceptibility to antibiotics. the dlta d-alanyl carrier protein ligase promotes  a two-step process starting with adenylation of d-alanine. we have determined the 2.0 a resolution crystal structure of a dlta protein from bacillus cereus in complex with the d-alanine adenylate intermediate of the first reaction. despite  the low level of sequence similarity, the dlta structure resembles known structures of adenylation domains such as the acetyl-coa synthetase. the enantiomer selection appears to be enhanced by the medium-sized side chain of cys-269. the ala-269 mutant protein shows marked loss of such selection. the network of noncovalent interactions between the d-alanine adenylate and dlta provides structure-based rationale for aiding the design of tight-binding dlta inhibitors for combating infectious gram-positive bacteria such as the notorious  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == the in vitro pharmacological activities of 12 south african hermannia species.
AB  == hermannia species are widely used in traditional medicine in southern africa, however no extensive study has been conducted on this genus. the acetone extracts of 12 indigenous hermannia species (flowers, stems and leaves combined) were evaluated for various pharmacological activities. all investigated species displayed promising antimicrobial activity, with hermannia saccifera being the most active against staphylococcus aureus (mic=19.5 microg/ml), bacillus cereus (mic=19.5 microg/ml) and enterococcus faecalis (mic=125 microg/ml). time-kill studies on h. saccifera against s. aureus indicated bacteriostatic activity at 1.25, 2.5 and 5.0%, and a concentration of 7.5% achieved complete bactericidal activity after 4h. ten of the 12 species indicated good free radical scavenging activity, with h. cuneifolia demonstrating the most promising activity in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph():ic(50)=10.26 microg/ml) and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (abts(+)/teac: ic(50)=10.32 microg/ml) assays. in addition, all species exhibited moderate anti-inflammatory activity in the 5-lipoxygenase assay with the exception of h. cuneifolia (ic(50)=15.32 microg/ml). overall, the selected species were low in cytotoxicity, except for h. saccifera and h. trifurca. several hermannia species  indicated promising in vitro biological activity which relate to their traditional use in treating a number of disease states.

TI  == bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  == thirty one bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. using species-specific pcr  and 16s rrna gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as l. plantarum and l. fermentum, respectively. cluster analysis of rapd-pcr fingerprints revealed two main groups (g1 and g2) plus the l. fermentum isolate c4-13. group g1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (g1-1, g1-2) each with several branches, plus the l. plantarum isolate c11. group g2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. using pcr amplification with specific  primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in l. plantarum c11 were  identified in the isolates. the number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. the l. fermentum isolate ec11 also contained the plndefg genes. pcr  amplification of dna from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with dna from the control strain l. plantarum wcfs1. amplification  products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with hindiii, ecori and kpni in separate reactions. cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for ecori and hindii digest profiles, and an  identical profile for all kpni digests. the l. fermentum ec11 isolate clustered with l. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. the results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. however, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may  present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, enterobacter aerogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could  be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.

TI  == risk profiles of pork and poultry meat and risk ratings of various pathogen/product combinations.
AB  == risk profiles of pork and poultry meat were carried out using an excel-based software program, risk ranger. it is a semi-quantitative risk estimator answering various questions relating to the probability of exposure to a hazard, susceptibility of the population of interest, severity of the illness caused by the hazard if present and probability of food containing an infectious dose. therefore, qualitative and quantitative inputs were used to estimate and rank the risk of various hazards/food combinations. risk scores provided by the tool were  characterized as low, medium and high. also, health risk was estimated separately, where needed, for low and high risk populations. low risk scores were obtained for salmonella spp., listeria monocytogenes and enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) for low risk population. high risk scores were obtained for hepatitis e virus (hev) in raw pork products (both low and high risk populations). moderate risk scores for salmonella spp. and l. monocytogenes in processed pork or poultry-meat products (ready-to-eat or to be reheated) and partially cooked pork products were also obtained (low risk population). scores for staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens and bacillus cereus and various product types were mostly in the "medium" risk category, except for s. aureus/ready-to-eat pork products able to support growth of the organism, which fell into the high risk category. campylobacter spp. gave moderate risk scores with one exception (raw poultry products), whereas y. enterocolitica showed combinations of low risk and few of medium risk. high risk pathogen/product combinations identified were: 1) temperature abused, ready-to-eat pork and/or poultry-meat products with extended shelf life and cross-contaminated by l. monocytogenes (high risk population), ehec (high risk population) or s. aureus (all population), 2) partially cooked or processed intended to be reheated pork products cross-contaminated by l. monocytogenes, served undercooked and receiving improper cooling or reheating (high risk population), and 3) all people consuming undercooked meals cross-contaminated with campylobacter spp. (e.g. from raw poultry and raw poultry-meat products) and hev (e.g. from raw pork and raw pork-meat products). salmonellae gave high risk scores in all food categories (except preserved meat products) for high risk population. preserved meats (mainly pork) such as dry fermented sausages gave low risk scores. only salmonella spp., l. monocytogenes and e. coli ehec gave moderate risk ratings in  case of ingredients likely to be contaminated at an early stage of processing (e.g. animal at slaughter) and inadequate fermentation process. these results may constitute a source of information for hazard assessment during application of a  food safety management system.

AB  == the risk of food poisoning and growth of spoilage bacteria in awa-uirou, a sticky rice cake containing sweet red bean paste, was evaluated. toxin-producing bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus are the main causes of food poisoning linked to this kind of food. the water activity in this product is in the range suitable for growth of s. aureus, b. cereus, and b. subtilis. the viable count of s. aureus or b. cereus spore cocktail was significantly reduced to 2.3 log colony-forming units (cfu)/g after 70 minutes steaming treatment at 100 degrees c. however, the heat-resistant endospores of b. subtilis germinated during storage at 30 degrees c to cause appreciable syneresis of the starch gel matrix in 4 days. the addition of 0.5% glycine before steaming treatment was found to effectively suppress the growth of b. cereus but was not effective in controlling s. aureus throughout the 7 days incubation period at 30 degrees c. on the other hand, s. aureus and b. cereus could grow > 5.0 log cfu/g in an inoculated sample without glycine within 3 days when stored at 30 degrees c. moreover, addition of 0.5% glycine before the steaming process did not have any significant effect on color, texture, or taste of sticky rice cake. therefore, results of this study demonstrated that the addition of 0.5% glycine before the steaming process could inhibit b. cereus and b. subtilis multiplication in the steamed rice confection which in turn may help reduce the risk of food poisoning  or quality loss.

TI  == method for evaluation of the efficacy of antimicrobial preservatives in cosmetic  wet wipes.
AB  == many cosmetic formulations are now available in the form of wet wipes packaged in sealed sachets or packets. like the majority of cosmetic products having an aqueous phase, wipes are susceptible to microbial contamination and require the addition of preservatives. the efficacy of such preservatives can be evaluated using a standard challenge test performed on the wetting liquid but this test cannot be regarded as representative for this new type of formulation. the method presented here evaluates the efficacy of preservatives used in wet wipes kept in  their original packaging. dried inoculums were prepared by membrane filtration followed by drying in an incubator. the method is applicable to bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis), bacillus cereus spores and fungi (candida albicans and aspergillus niger). these inoculated carriers were inserted between two wipes in the original package, which was then re-sealed immediately. the test requires one dry inoculum per packet and one packet for each control or test. after incubation at 22.5 degrees c for 1, 2, 7, 14 or 28 days and, for the control, immediately after insertion of the membrane (time 0), microorganism counts were performed on the germ-carrier membranes as well as on adjacent wipes, after transfer into a suitable neutralizing agent. the membranes were shaken in the presence of glass beads and microorganisms were dissociated from the wipes by means of a stomacher. the supernatants recovered after being left to stand for 20 min are counted by pour plate method or membrane filtration. the feasibility of the method was demonstrated for each of the seven above-mentioned strains. the repeatability and reproducibility of the results obtained is similar to that obtained for preservative efficacy tests in the pharmacopoeias. the lethal rate of microorganisms during the preparation of dry inoculums ranges from 50 to 90% depending on the strain and the test (generally, a spontaneous reduction of about 1 log up to a maximum of 2 log). the recovery rate for microorganisms from dry inoculums (on membranes) at time 0 (control = t(0)) is around 90%, regardless of  the strain or the test. the number of microorganisms recovered from the wipes (w(0)) is between 2 and 10% of the number recovered from membranes (t(0)) and may be considered negligible. application of this method to different types of wipes  demonstrates that the efficacy of preservatives, expressed as the logarithmic reduction in the number of microorganisms at each time point, depends on the type of wipe and on the strain tested. the results obtained are considerably different from those found with the standard challenge tests applied to wetting liquids for wipes. the differences found confirm the need for a specific method applicable to wipes.

TI  == absolute configuration and antimicrobial activity of acylhomoserine lactones.
AB  == (s)-n-heptanoylhomoserine lactone is an uncommon acyl odd-chain natural product employed by many gram-negative bacteria as a signaling substance in chemical communication mechanisms known as quorum sensing. the absolute configuration determination of the metabolite produced by the phytopathogen pantoea ananatis serrano is reported herein. as with all other substances of this class, the lactone moiety possesses s configuration, corroborating the hypothesis that it shares the same biosynthetic pathway as the (s)-n-hexanoylhomoserine lactone and  also that some luxi homologues can accept both hexanoyl- and heptanoyl-acp as precursors. evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of enantiomeric acylhomoserine lactones against three gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus, b. subtilis, and staphylococcus aureus) revealed important features between absolute configuration and antimicrobial activity. the n-heptanoylhomoserine lactone was considerably less active than the 3-oxo derivatives. surprisingly, non-natural (r)-n-(3-oxo-octanoyl)homoserine lactone was as active as the s enantiomer against b. cereus, while the synthetic racemic product was less active than either enantiomer.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of stuffed mussels.
AB  == stuffed mussel is a traditional food, sold by street vendors in coastal parts of  turkey and other mediterranean countries. in the present study, the microbiological quality of not only the stuffing mixture, but also the outer surface of the stuffed mussels was evaluated for 1 year, and the effect of the ambient temperatures on the prevalence and the count levels of the microorganisms were evaluated. fifty samples (750 stuffed mussels in total) were collected periodically, and microbiological analyses were performed by standard procedures  for aerobic plate count, coliforms, fecal coliforms, enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and vibrio spp. aerobic plate counts above 5 log cfu/g were obtained in 16 and 72% of stuffing mixture samples at high and low ambient temperatures, respectively, and average aerobic plate counts of outer surface samples at high and low ambient temperatures were 3.21 and 4.34 log cfu/ml, respectively. the prevalence and the count levels of coliforms, fecal coliforms, enterobacteriaceae, and vibrio spp. (except for the prevalence of vibrio spp. in stuffing mixture samples) in the samples at high ambient temperatures were considerably higher compared with those at low ambient temperatures (p < 0.05). high frequencies of pathogens s. aureus and b. cereus were found in stuffing mixture samples at high ambient temperatures, with averages of 2.84 and 2.94 log cfu/g, respectively (p < 0.05). the result of this  investigation indicates that stuffed mussels as a street food may constitute a potential health hazard, especially at high ambient temperatures, depending on contamination level and lack of sanitary practices, and therefore, handling practices should require more attention and improvement.

TI  == iron(iii) complexes: preparation, characterization, antibacterial activity and dna-binding.
AB  == iron(iii) have been combined to well known quinolones (ciprofloxacin) and some schiff bases with the help of coordination approach. characterization of these compounds have been done using elemental analysis, magnetic measurements, thermogravimetric analysis, ir, uv-vis, (1)h nmr and (13)c nmr spectral investigation. analytical studies suggest that the iron(iii)-quinolone complexes  assume a six-coordinated dimeric distorted octahedral geometry. all the compounds show a good antibacterial activity against broad range of bacteria like bacillus  cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, salmonella typhi and serratia marcescens, whereas no significant inhibition towards growth of fungal strains like aspergillus niger, aspergillus flavus and lasiodiplodia theobromae. analyses of all these compounds show effective sperm herring dna inhibition.

TI  == the effect of silver ions and chlorine on the survival of staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus in dishwater.
AB  == this paper investigates the effect of chlorine and silver ion solutions on the survival of bacillus cereus (vegetative phase) and staphylococcus aureus in batch cultures, representing dishwater. dishwater contains organic matter and bacteria  and bacterial activities are partly reduced by high ph (11-12) and temperature (55-65 degrees c) in professional and domestic dishwashers. in manual dishwashing, temperature and ph are kept lower (45 degrees c and ph 7), which is  less sufficient for the reduction of bacteria. in a broth, organic loaded in order to mimic dishwater, solutions of ag or hypochlorite were added at 45 degrees c and ph 7 and samples were withdrawn for a period of 40 minutes. 1 ppm ag+ was required to obtain a 1 to 2 log unit reduction of b. cereus and s. aureus in 10 minutes. an addition of 160 ppm hypochlorite reduced b. cereus and s. aureus by 4 log units in two minutes, whereas 16 ppm of hypochlorite had no effect on the survival of s. aureus. the level of free residual chlorine varied with the cod value of the cultured solutions. we found that both silver and hypochlorite can be used as antibacterial agents in dishwater. the disadvantage with the use of hypochlorite is that the cod value determines the antibacterial effect. using ag+ solutions to reduce bacteria has the drawback that they are toxic to water-living organisms and are considered to develop ag+ resistant bacteria. to reduce the risk of cross-contamination from dishwater to dishware high temperature and detergent with high ph is to be preferred.

TI  == insecticidal properties and microbial contaminants in a spodoptera exigua multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (baculoviridae) formulation stored at different temperatures.
AB  == the spodoptera exigua (hubner) multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (semnpv) is currently being tested as a biological insecticide for use in greenhouse crops in southern spain. we performed a study in which semipurified semnpv occlusion bodies (obs) were formulated in phosphate-buffered saline, ph 6.5, with 5% (vol:vol) glycerol and 0.15% (wt:vol) sorbic acid, and they were stored at -20, 4, or 25 degrees c during 18 mo. initial aerobic counts (+/-se) averaged 1.4 (+/-0.17) x 10(7) colony-forming units/ml after 17-h incubation at 37 degrees c.  aerobic counts of microorganisms that contaminated ob formulations stored at 250c decreased markedly over the period of the study, whereas only small decreases were observed in counts from obs stored at 4 or -20 degrees c. the principal microbial contaminants of ob suspensions were enterococcus spp., enterobacteriaceae, and yeasts. potential human pathogens (salmonella, shigella,  and vibrio species) were not detected, and populations of staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus were extremely low. compared with newly formulated obs, the estimated ld50 values of obs stored at 25 degrees c increased by >16,666-fold over the 18 mo of storage, whereas ld50 values were not greatly affected by storage at 4 or -20 degrees c. significant changes over time in ob concentrations were only observed in the 25 degrees c treatment. complete degradation of viral dna was observed at 25 degrees c but not in refrigerated or frozen obs. we conclude that ob formulation with bacteriostatic or antioxidant additives, together with storage and distribution in refrigerated conditions, will likely result in an semnpv biopesticide shelf life that exceeds 18 mo.

TI  == growth inhibitory effects of kimchi (korean traditional fermented vegetable product) against bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == kimchi is a unique korean traditional vegetable product that is fermented by lactic acid bacteria (lab) and is mainly consumed as a side dish with boiled rice. its main ingredients are brined chinese cabbage, red pepper powder, and fermented fish sauce, and these are combined with many spices such as garlic, green onion, ginger, and some seaweed. the relationship between the concentration of lab or the ph and the growth of three gram-positive foodborne pathogens (bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus) was evaluated. heat treatment (ht; 85 degrees c for 15 min) or neutralization treatment (nt; ph 7.0) was conducted on day 0 (0-d group) and day 3 (3-d group) of incubation. the ph in the control group and the nt group dropped sharply to 4.12 to 4.30 after 2 days of incubation and slightly decreased thereafter, whereas the ph in the control group and ht group stayed at 7.0 during incubation. lab were not detected in the ht kimchi during incubation. b. cereus in the nt-0-d, nt-3-d, and ht-3-d groups was reduced by 1.5 to 3.1 log cfu/ml but increased slightly in the ht-0-d group. l. monocytogenes in ht-3-d and nt-3-d groups disappeared after 5 days of incubation, and s. aureus in the nt-0-d group  disappeared after 4 days. these findings indicate that growth of all the foodborne pathogens was inhibited by nt-0-d, ht-3-d, and nt-3-d, but b. cereus was not inhibited by ht-0-d. thus, growth of lab in kimchi is an important factor in the control of foodborne pathogens.

TI  == succession of dominant and antagonistic lactic acid bacteria in fermented cucumber: insights from a pcr-based approach.
AB  == the goal of the investigation was to study the succession of major groups of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and their antagonism in salt-fermented cucumber using  pcr. in a direct detection method as well as a short enrichment process, pcr enabled detection of leuconostoc and lactobacillus during early hours of fermentation. subsequently, lactobacillus and pediococcus emerged as the dominant genera. nucleic acid sequence of culture-independent clones confirmed the detection of pediococcus as a dominant genera emerging during late stages of fermentation. pcr also revealed time-dependent emergence of mesentericin, pediocin and plantaricin a producers and accounted for the lab succession in the  fermenting samples. a total of 328 lab isolates were obtained collectively from 30 cucumber samples, of which pcr could identify an overwhelming 186 lactobacillus isolates followed by 113 pediococcus and 29 leuconostoc isolates, respectively. based on antimicrobial assay against target strain leuconostoc mesenteroides nrrl b640, 28% of the lab were bacteriocin producers, of which pediocin producers were substantial, followed by plantaricin a and mesentericin producers. the bacteriocins elaborated by the isolates were active against a large number of gram-positive target lab strains and pathogenic bacteria including bacillus cereus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus.

AB  == carnobacterium divergens clinical isolates bm4489 and bm4490 were resistant to penicillins but remained susceptible to combinations of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and piperacillin-tazobactam. cloning and sequencing of the responsible determinant from bm4489 revealed a coding sequence of 912 bp encoding a class a beta-lactamase named cad-1. the bla(cad-1) gene was assigned to a chromosomal location in the two strains that had distinct pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. cad-1 shared 53% and 42% identity with beta-lactamases from bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus, respectively. alignment of cad-1 with other class a beta-lactamases indicated the presence of 25 out of the 26 isofunctional  amino acids in class a beta-lactamases. escherichia coli harboring bla(cad-1) exhibited resistance to penams (benzylpenicillin and amoxicillin) and remained susceptible to amoxicillin in combination with clavulanic acid. mature cad-1 consisted of a 34.4-kda polypeptide. kinetic analysis indicated that cad-1 exhibited a narrow substrate profile, hydrolyzing benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, and piperacillin with catalytic efficiencies of 6,600, 3,200, and 2,900 mm(-1) s(-1), respectively. the enzyme did not interact with oxyiminocephalosporins, imipenem, or aztreonam. cad-1 was inhibited by tazobactam (50% inhibitory concentration [ic(50)] = 0.27 microm), clavulanic acid (ic(50) = 4.7 microm), and sulbactam (ic(50) = 43.5 microm). the bla(cad-1) gene is likely to have been acquired by bm4489 and bm4490 as part of a mobile genetic element, since it was not found in the susceptible type strain cip 101029 and was adjacent to a gene for a resolvase.

TI  == human chitotriosidase is expressed in the eye and lacrimal gland and has an antimicrobial spectrum different from lysozyme.
AB  == chitotriosidase is a chitinolytic enzyme expressed by maturing macrophages and preformed in neutrophil granules, suggesting a role in antimicrobial defence. although available evidence supports a role in anti-fungal immunity, there is a lack of an obvious phenotype in humans homozygous for a mutation which renders chitotriosidase inactive. this may be explained by compensatory effects of enzymes co-expressed with chitotriosidase, such as lysozyme. we have found that chitinase is highly expressed in mouse and human eye, particularly in lacrimal glands. chitotriosidase is the only member of the chitinase/chilectin gene cluster expressed in the murine eye. as lacrimal glands also produce lysozyme, we have asked whether chitotriosidase, in addition to its documented anti-fungal effects, has synergistic anti-bacterial properties with lysozyme. the effect of recombinant chitotriosidase on the growth of five gram-positive (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus aureus oata(+/-)) and two gram-negative strains (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa), were tested in a luminometric assay. recombinant chitotriosidase did not inhibit bacterial growth and did not synergize with lysozyme. though the expression of chitotriosidase in the eye supports a role in innate immunity, the  antimicrobial spectrum appears to be complementary to lysozyme and may indeed be  limited to fungi.

TI  == antibacterial activity of guava (psidium guajava l.) and neem (azadirachta indica a. juss.) extracts against foodborne pathogens and spoilage bacteria.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of guava (psidium guajava) and neem (azadirachta indica) extracts against 21 strains of foodborne pathogens were determined--listeria monocytogenes (five strains), staphylococcus aureus (four strains), escherichia coli o157:h7 (six strains), salmonella enteritidis (four strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus, and bacillus cereus, and five food spoilage bacteria: pseudomonas aeroginosa, p. putida, alcaligenes faecalis, and aeromonas  hydrophila (two strains). guava and neem extracts showed higher antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria compared to gram-negative bacteria except for v. parahaemolyticus, p. aeroginosa, and a. hydrophila. none of the extracts showed antimicrobial activity against e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella enteritidis. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of ethanol extracts of guava showed the highest inhibition for l. monocytogenes jcm 7676 (0.1 mg/ml), s. aureus jcm 2151 (0.1 mg/ml), s. aureus jcm 2179 (0.1 mg/ml), and v. parahaemolyticus ifo 12711 (0.1 mg/ml) and the lowest inhibition for alcaligenes faecalis ifo 12669, aeromonas hydrophila nfri 8282 (4.0 mg/ml), and a. hydrophila nfri 8283 (4.0 mg/ml). the mic of chloroform extracts of neem showed similar inhibition for l. monocytogenes atcc 43256 (4.0 mg/ml) and l. monocytogenes atcc 49594 (5.0 mg/ml). however, ethanol extracts of neem showed higher inhibition for s. aureus jcm 2151 (4.5 mg/ml) and s. aureus ifo 13276 (4.5 mg/ml) and the lower inhibition for other microorganisms (6.5 mg/ml). no significant effects of temperature and ph were found on guava and neem extracts against cocktails of l. monocytogenes and s. aureus. the results of the present study suggest that guava and neem extracts  possess compounds containing antibacterial properties that can potentially be useful to control foodborne pathogens and spoilage organisms.

TI  == potential and limitation of uvc irradiation for the inactivation of pathogens in  platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: pathogen contamination, causing transfusion-transmitted diseases, is  an ongoing concern in transfusion of cellular blood products. in this explorative study, the pathogen-inactivating capacity of uvc irradiation in platelet (plt) concentrates was investigated. the dose dependencies of inactivation of several viruses and bacteria were compared with the effect on plt quality. study design and methods: the potential of uvc irradiation was studied with a range of lipid-enveloped (le) and non-lipid-enveloped viruses (nle) and bacteria. le viruses were bovine viral diarrhea virus (bvdv), human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), pseudorabies virus (prv), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev), and  vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv). nle viruses were canine parvovirus (cpv) and simian virus 40 (sv40). bacteria were staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus  aureus, escherichia coli, and bacillus cereus. after spiking and irradiation, samples were tested for residual infectivity and reduction factors (rfs) were calculated. furthermore, the effect of uvc irradiation on plt quality was determined by measuring in vitro quality variables. results: a uvc dose of 500 j  per m(2) resulted in acceptable plt quality (as measured by ph, lactate production, cd62p expression, and exposure of phosphatidylserine) and high rfs (>4 log) for cpv, tgev, vsv, s. epidermidis, s. aureus, and e. coli. intermediate rfs (approx. 3 log) were observed for bvdv, prv, and b. cereus. low rfs (approx.  1 log) were found for hiv and sv40. no differences in virus reduction were observed between cell-free and cell-associated virus. conclusion: uvc irradiation is a promising pathogen-reducing technique in plt concentrates, inactivating bacteria, and a broad range of viruses (with the exception of hiv) under conditions that have limited effects on plt quality. further optimization of the  uvc procedure, however, is necessary to deal with blood-borne viruses like hiv.

TI  == production of nisin z by lactococcus lactis isolated from dahi.
AB  == lactococcus lactis cm1, an isolate from homemade "dahi," a traditional fermented  milk from india, used maltose as carbon source to produce a high level of bacteriocin. the bacterial cell mass and the bacteriocin production correlated with the initial ph of the medium and were highest when the initial ph was 11.0.  the level of bacteriocin reached its peak at the late log phase with concomitant  reduction of culture ph to 4.2, regardless of the initial ph of the medium. a combination of maltose and an initial medium ph of 11 resulted in the highest bacteriocin production. the antibacterial spectrum of the bacteriocin was closely similar to that of nisin and it inhibited a number of food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria. upon sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the compound migrated close to the position of nisin (3.5 kda).  however, it had higher stability than nisin at a wide range of ph and temperature. pcr amplification using nisin gene-specific primers and sequencing of the amplified dna revealed the structural gene for the bacteriocin to be identical to that of nisz.

TI  == sphingomyelinase generation of ceramide promotes clustering of nanoscale domains  in supported bilayer membranes.
AB  == the effects of ceramide incorporation in supported bilayers prepared from ternary lipid mixtures which have small nanoscale domains have been examined using atomic force and fluorescence microscopy. both direct ceramide incorporation in vesicles used to prepare the supported bilayers and enzymatic hydrolysis of sm by sphingomyelinase were compared for membranes prepared from 5:5:1 dopc/sphingomyelin/cholesterol mixtures. both methods of ceramide incorporation resulted in enlargement of the initial small ordered domains. however, enzymatic  ceramide generation led to a much more pronounced restructuring of the bilayer to give large clusters of domains with adjacent areas of a lower phase. the individual domains were heterogeneous with two distinct heights, the highest of which is assigned to a ceramide-rich phase which is hypothesized to occur via ceramide flip-flop to the lower leaflet with formation of a raised domain due to  negative membrane curvature. a combination of afm and fluorescence showed that the bilayer restructuring starts rapidly after enzyme addition, with formation of large clusters of domains at sites of high enzyme activity. the clustering of domains is accompanied by redistribution of fluid phase to the periphery of the domain clusters and there is a continued slow evolution of the bilayer over a period of an hour or more after the enzyme is removed. the relevance of the observed clustering of small nanoscale domains to the postulated coalescence of raft domains to form large signaling platforms is discussed.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of two antitumour agents and ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and the acetate form of its copper(ii) chelate.
AB  == some copper chelates have potent antitumour activity, and in some cases also the  free ligands have activity in vivo. yet, little is known about their antimicrobial properties. copper(ii) chelates of the thiosemicarbazones of a-n-heterocyclic carboxaldehydes constitute one important group of such agents, also their ligands having marked antitumour activity. both the ligands and chelates inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. some ligands have been or are under clinical trials as antineoplastic agents. i report here a study on the antimicrobial properties of the prototype compounds of this group, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and its copper(ii) chelate. they were tested against nine microbes, including bacteria (bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus lactis), yeasts (candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisiae) and one mold (aspergillus niger). two clinical isolates of bacillus sp. and one reference strain were also studied. both the ligand and the chelate had marked activity. the ligand displayed considerable activity against all bacteria except  for s. lactis, and its activity against e. coli and p. aeruginosa was that high that practical applications might be considued. it was highly active against a. niger and moderately active against c. albicans. the chelate was highly active against s. epidermidis and s. cerevisiae. both compounds inhibited the clinical isolates markedly. since some related ligands have been or are in clinical trials on humans or are entering them, their route to clinical use, also as antimicrobials, might be much more straightforward than that of substances, whose toxicity in humans is wholly unexplored.

AB  == filtered samples of monogalacturonic (ga) and monoglucuronic acids (gl) that were prepared using millipore filter (pore size=0.2 microm) slightly inhibited the growth of escherichia coli while the autoclaved (at 121 degrees c for 20 min) samples of ga and gl completely inhibited the growth of e. coli. the most effective substance generated upon autoclave treatment was isolated and characterized as trans-4,5-dihydroxy-2-cyclopenten-1-one (dhcp). the optimal conditions for dhcp generation were also established by autoclaving ga (ph 2.3) at 121 degrees c for 3h. dhcp completely inhibited the growth of e. coli. however, the growth of e. coli was restored when superoxide dismutase and catalase were added to the culture broth that contained dhcp. it was thought that dhcp might have induced the release of active oxygen, which resulted in the inhibition of microbial growth. in the case of gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus) and yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida brassicae), dhcp inhibited the cell growth. based on our results, methods for preparation of food preservatives that contained pectin degraded products (oligo-galacturonic acid and monogalacturonic acid) and dhcp were developed. the preservatives were very effective in inhibiting the growth of e. coli and s. cerevisiae.

TI  == structure and biological activities of beta toxin from staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == beta toxin is a neutral sphingomyelinase secreted by certain strains of staphylococcus aureus. this virulence factor lyses erythrocytes in order to evade the host immune system as well as scavenge nutrients. the structure of beta toxin was determined at 2.4-a resolution using crystals that were merohedrally twinned. this structure is similar to that of the sphingomyelinases of listeria ivanovii and bacillus cereus. beta toxin belongs to the dnase i folding superfamily; in addition to sphingomyelinases, the proteins most structurally related to beta toxin include human endonuclease hap1, escherichia coli endonuclease iii, bovine  pancreatic dnase i, and the endonuclease domain of tras1 from bombyx mori. our biological assays demonstrated for the first time that beta toxin kills proliferating human lymphocytes. structure-directed active site mutations show that biological activities, including hemolysis and lymphotoxicity, are due to the sphingomyelinase activity of the enzyme.

TI  == a systematic review of the clinical, public health and cost-effectiveness of rapid diagnostic tests for the detection and identification of bacterial intestinal pathogens in faeces and food.
AB  == objectives: to determine the diagnostic accuracy of tests for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial food poisoning in clinical and public health practice and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of these assays in a hypothetical population in order to inform policy on the use of these tests. data sources: studies evaluating diagnostic accuracy of rapid tests were retrieved using electronic databases and handsearching reference lists and key journals. hospital laboratories and test manufacturers were contacted for cost data, and clinicians  involved in the care of patients with food poisoning were invited to discuss the  conclusions of this review using the nominal group technique. review methods: a systematic review of the current medical literature on assays used for the rapid  diagnosis of bacterial food poisoning was carried out. specific organisms under review were salmonella, campylobacter, escherichia coli o157, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens and bacillus cereus. data extraction was undertaken using standardised data extraction forms. where a sufficient number of studies evaluating comparable tests were identified, meta-analysis was performed. a decision analytic model was developed, using effectiveness data from the review and cost data from hospitals and manufacturers, which contributed to an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of rapid tests in a hypothetical uk population. finally, diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness results were presented to a focus group of gps, microbiologists and consultants in communicable disease control, to assess professional opinion on the use of rapid  tests in the diagnosis of food poisoning. results: good test performance levels were observed with rapid test methods, especially for polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays. the estimated levels of diagnostic accuracy using the area under the curve of the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was very high. indeed, although traditional culture is the natural reference test to use for comparative statistical analysis, on many occasions the rapid test outperforms culture, detecting additional 'truly' positive cases of food-borne illness. the significance of these additional positives requires further investigation. economic modelling suggests that adoption of rapid tests in combination with routine culture is unlikely to be cost-effective, however, as the cost of rapid technologies decreases; total replacement with rapid technologies may be feasible. conclusions: despite the relatively poor quality of reporting of studies evaluating rapid detection methods, the reviewed evidence shows that pcr  for campylobacter, salmonella and e. coli o157 is potentially very successful in  identifying pathogens, possibly detecting more than the number currently reported using culture. less is known about the benefits of testing for b. cereus, c. perfringens and s. aureus. further investigation is needed on how clinical outcomes may be altered if test results are available more quickly and at a greater precision than in the current practice of bacterial culture.

AB  == melastoma candidum d. don, a taiwanese folk medicinal plant, has high levels of antibacterial and bactericidal activity. our aim was to determine whether and to  what extent an acetone extract of this plant inhibits the growth of foodborne pathogenic bacteria. m. candidum acetone extract had marked inhibitory effect on  test bacteria introduced into sliced pork, which was then stored at 4 degrees c.  at the end of storage (day 12), the bacterial concentrations dropped by 1.59 to 2.91 log cfu/g compared with the control. in steamed rice stored at 30 degrees c, a 0.2% extract decreased initial (before storage) concentrations of bacillus cereus from 2.01 log cfu/g to an undetectable level, which remained for at least  24 h. after 72 to 168 h of storage, test bacterial concentrations were reduced by 2.59 to 5.66 log cfu/g. in fresh noodles stored at 30 degrees c, both initial and final bacterial concentrations were decreased. at the end of storage (72 to 168 h), test bacteria concentrations were reduced by 1.85 to 2.88 log cfu/g. overall, m. candidum acetone extract had an inhibitory effect on foodborne pathogenic bacteria in different food model systems.

TI  == broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of the reactive compounds generated in vitro by manduca sexta phenoloxidase.
AB  == although quinone production and melanin formation are widely recognized as an integral part of the insect defense system, experimental evidence is lacking that the proteolytic activation of prophenoloxidase participates in the direct killing of invading microbes-active phenoloxidase generates quinones that polymerize to form melanin. here, we report the antimicrobial effect of reactive intermediates  produced in phenoloxidase-catalyzed reactions. after being treated with manduca sexta phenoloxidase and dopamine, escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis ceased to grow, whereas the growth of pichia pastoris was slightly affected. microscopic analysis showed melanin deposition on cell surface, aggregation of bacteria, and  loss of cell mobility. viability tests revealed major decreases in the bacterial  colony counts and, since the decrease remained significant after dispersion of the cell clumps, the reactive compounds were surmised to have aggregated and killed e. coli and b. subtilis cells. under the experimental conditions, 60-94% of the gram-negative bacteria (e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium) and 52-99% of the gram-positive bacteria  (bacillus cereus, b. subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) were killed. in the presence of phenoloxidase, dopamine or 5,6-dihydroxyindole (dhi) exhibited much higher antibacterial activity than l-dopa, n-acetyldopamine  (nada) or n-beta-alanyldopamine (nbad) did, suggesting that dhi and its oxidation products were cytotoxic. the antifungal activity of dhi was detected using p. pastoris, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida albicans, and beauveria bassiana. these results established that prophenoloxidase activation is an integral component of the insect defense system involving a multitude of enzymes (e.g. proteinases, oxidases, and dopachrome conversion enzyme (dce)), which immobilizes and kills invading microorganisms.

TI  == the contribution of gc1qr/p33 in infection and inflammation.
AB  == human gc1qr/p33 is a multi-compartmental and multi-functional cellular protein expressed on a wide range of tissues and cell types including lymphocytes, endothelial cells, dendritic cells, and platelets. although originally isolated as a receptor for c1q by virtue of its affinity (k(d)=15-50 nm), and specificity  for the globular heads of this molecule, a large body of evidence has now been accumulated which shows that in addition to c1q, gc1qr can serve as a receptor for diverse proinflammatory ligands including proteins of the plasma kinin-forming system, most notably high molecular weight kininogen (hk; k(d)=9 nm). in addition, gc1qr has been reported to recognize and bind a number of functional antigens of viral and bacterial origin. it is its ability to interact  with microbial antigens and its potential to serve as a cellular protein for bacterial attachment and/or entry that has been the focus of our laboratory in the past few years. on the surface of activated platelets, gc1qr has been shown to serve as a binding site for staphylococcus aureus and this binding is mediated by protein a. since the binding of s. aureus to platelets is postulated to play a major role in the pathogenesis of endocarditis, gc1qr may provide a suitable surface for the initial adhesion of the bacterium. recent data also demonstrate that the exosporium of bacillus cereus, a member of a genus of aerobic, gram-positive, spore-forming rod-like bacilli, which includes the deadly bacillus anthracis, contains a binding site for gc1qr. therefore, by virtue of its ability to recognize plasma proteins such as c1q and hk, as well as bacterial and viral antigens, cell-surface gc1qr not only is able to generate proinflammatory byproducts from the complement and kinin/kallikrein systems, but also can be an efficient vehicle and platform for a plethora of pathogenic microorganisms.

TI  == antibacterial activity of extract, fractions and four compounds extracted from piper solmsianum c. dc. var. solmsianum (piperaceae).
AB  == piper solmsianum c. dc. var. solmsianum (piperaceae) is a shrub commonly found in areas with wet tropical soils. other piper species have been used in folk medicine as antitumoral and antiseptic agents. we studied the crude methanolic extract, some organic fractions and compounds isolated from this plant for possible antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the bioautographic assays disclosed three inhibition zones. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) were  determined showing excellent activity, particularly against the gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus saprophyticus and streptococcus agalactiae). it appears that the antimicrobial activity of piper solmsianum is related mainly to the presence of conocarpan and eupomatenoid-5 (neolignans). however another, as yet unidentified, active compound could also be extracted from the plant.

AB  == the aim of the study presented here was to gain knowledge about the vapor-phase antimicrobial activity of selected essential oils and their major putatively active constituents against a range of foodborne bacterial and fungal strains. in a first step, the vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of three commercially available essential oils (eos)-cinnamon (cinnamomum zeylanicum), thyme (thymus vulgaris), and oregano (origanum vulgare)-were evaluated against a wide range of  microorganisms, including gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella choleraesuis), gram-positive bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis), molds (penicillium islandicum and aspergillus flavus), and a yeast (candida albicans). the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were generally lower for oregano eo than for the thyme and cinnamon eos, especially against the relatively resistant gram-negative. the persistence of the eos' antimicrobial activities over time was assessed, and changes in the composition of the atmosphere they generated over time were determined using single-drop microextraction (sdme) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) and subsequent analysis of the data by principal component analysis (pca). more relevant chemicals were selected. in addition, the vapor-phase activities of putatively key constituents of the oils were screened against representative gram-positive (l. monocytogenes) and gram-negative (s. choleraesuis) bacteria, a mold (a. flavus), and a yeast (c. albicans). of the tested compounds, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol showed the strongest antimicrobial effectiveness, so their mics, defined as the minimum vapor concentrations that completely inhibited detectable growth of the microorganisms, were calculated. to check for possible interactions between components present in the eos, cinnamon eo was fortified with cinnamaldehyde and thyme eo with thymol,  and then the antimicrobial activities of the fortified oils were compared to those of the respective unfortified eos using fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) indices and by plotting inhibition curves as functions of the vapor-phase concentrations. synergistic effects were detected for cinnamaldehyde on a. flavus and for thymol on l. monocytogenes, s. choleraesuis, and a. flavus. in all other  cases the fortification had additive effects, except for cinnamaldehyde's activity against s. choleraesuis, for which the effect was antagonistic. finally, various microorganisms were found to cause slight changes over time to the atmospheres generated by all of the eos (fortified and unfortified) except the fortified cinnamon eo.

TI  == identification of the sigmab regulon of bacillus cereus and conservation of sigmab-regulated genes in low-gc-content gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the alternative sigma factor sigma(b) has an important role in the acquisition of stress resistance in many gram-positive bacteria, including the food-borne pathogen bacillus cereus. here, we describe the identification of the set of sigma(b)-regulated genes in b. cereus by dna microarray analysis of the transcriptome upon a mild heat shock. twenty-four genes could be identified as being sigma(b) dependent as witnessed by (i) significantly lower expression levels of these genes in mutants with a deletion of sigb and rsby (which encode the alternative sigma factor sigma(b) and a crucial positive regulator of sigma(b) activity, respectively) than in the parental strain b. cereus atcc 14579 and (ii) increased expression of these genes upon a heat shock. newly identified  sigma(b)-dependent genes in b. cereus include a histidine kinase and two genes that have predicted functions in spore germination. this study shows that the sigma(b) regulon of b. cereus is considerably smaller than that of other gram-positive bacteria. this appears to be in line with phylogenetic analyses where sigma(b) of the b. cereus group was placed close to the ancestral form of sigma(b) in gram-positive bacteria. the data described in this study and previous studies in which the complete sigma(b) regulon of the gram-positive bacteria bacillus subtilis, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were determined enabled a comparison of the sets of sigma(b)-regulated genes in the different gram-positive bacteria. this showed that only three genes (rsbv, rsbw,  and sigb) are conserved in their sigma(b) dependency in all four bacteria, suggesting that the sigma(b) regulon of the different gram-positive bacteria has  evolved to perform niche-specific functions.

TI  == a detailed analysis of 16s ribosomal rna gene segments for the diagnosis of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == bacterial 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) genes contain nine "hypervariable regions" (v1-v9) that demonstrate considerable sequence diversity among different bacteria. species-specific sequences within a given hypervariable region constitute useful targets for diagnostic assays and other scientific investigations. no single region can differentiate among all bacteria; therefore, systematic studies that compare the relative advantage of each region for specific diagnostic goals are needed. we characterized v1-v8 in 110 different bacterial species including common blood borne pathogens, cdc-defined select agents and environmental microflora. sequence similarity dendrograms were created for hypervariable regions v1-v8, and for selected combinations of regions or short segments within individual hypervariable regions that might be appropriate  for dna probing and real-time pcr. we determined that v1 best differentiated among staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative staphylococcus sp. v2 and v3 were most suitable for distinguishing all bacterial species to the genus level except for closely related enterobacteriaceae. v2 best distinguished among mycobacterium species and v3 among haemophilus species. the 58 nucleotides-long v6 could distinguish among most bacterial species except enterobacteriaceae. v6 was also noteworthy for being able to differentiate among all cdc-defined select  agents including bacillus anthracis, which differed from b. cereus by a single polymorphism. v4, v5, v7 and v8 were less useful targets for genus or species-specific probes. the hypervariable sequence-specific dendrograms and the  "megalign" files provided online will be highly useful tools for designing specific probes and primers for molecular assays to detect pathogenic bacteria, including select agents.

AB  == the genotypic and phenotypic variability of 40 lactococcus lactis isolates obtained from three cheese-making trials of batzos cheese made one in each, winter, spring and summer was investigated. rapd-pcr, plasmid profiling and pfge  were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. results showed a high degree of heterogeneity among strains. according  to pfge data, all strains except one were clustered together (at a similarity level of approximately 50%) with the l. lactis subsp. lactis reference strain and eleven groups of isolates consisting of 2-8 strains each were distinguished. plasmid profiling results revealed that there were eight isolates lacking plasmids and nine having unique plasmids. twenty-three isolates were allocated into six groups. there was an interesting similarity between the plasmid profiling groups and those formed according to pfge. clustering of strains according to rapd-pcr was in agreement with results obtained by both plasmid profiling and pfge for the majority of the strains. in addition, results obtained by molecular methods indicate a grouping of most of the strains according to the  season of cheese production. all strains inhibited the growth of escherichia coli o157:h7. their ability to affect the growth of yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus faecalis was strain dependent. in 42.5% of the isolates high acidifying ability in milk after 24 h was recorded and these were isolates, mainly, from fresh cheese. the 75% of the isolates from winter cheese exhibited higher lys- than leu-aminopeptidase activity while the approximately 67% of the isolates from summer cheese showed higher leu- than lys-aminopeptidase activity. their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for 24 h was significant with preference for alpha(s)-casein degradation. the majority (90%) of the strains formed methanethiol from methionine and this ability was strain dependent. these  results suggest that among the wild lactococcal population from batzos cheese there are interesting strains appropriate to be used as starters for the dairy industry.

TI  == antimicrobial and cytotoxic knotwood extracts and related pure compounds and their effects on food-associated microorganisms.
AB  == knotwood or bark extracts prepared from 30 species of hard and soft wood trees as well as selected pure compounds (lignans, stilbenes and flavonoids) were assayed  for their antimicrobial activity against a battery of both gram positive and negative bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi (bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, lactobacillus plantarum, escherichia coli, salmonella infantis, pseudomonas fluorescens, candida albicans, saccharomyces cerevisiae, aspergillus fumigatus and penicillium brevicompactum). by far the most consistent antibacterial and antifungal properties were associated with extracts of pinus species. these extracts showed also cytotoxicity against a mouse hepatoma cell line. both antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties correlated  with the stilbene content of the extracts. purified stilbenes showed the most consistent antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities, while purified lignans had marginal effects, only. the results suggest that stilbenes account both for the antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties of pinus knotwood extracts.

TI  == survival and growth of foodborne pathogens during cooking and storage of oriental-style rice cakes.
AB  == fresh cooked rice cakes for retail sale are typically held at room temperature because refrigeration dramatically reduces their quality. room temperature, high  water activity, and a ph of > 4.6 provided an environment conducive to pathogen growth. to date, no studies have been published regarding survival and growth of  foodborne pathogens in fresh cooked rice cakes. this study was undertaken to investigate the effect of steam cooking on foodborne pathogens and their subsequent growth in five varieties of rice cakes made from flours of regular rice, sweet rice, white rice, tapioca, and mung bean. bacillus cereus spores were detected in white rice, tapioca, and mung bean samples. the rice cake flours were inoculated with non-spore-forming foodborne pathogens (escherichia coli o157:h7,  salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus) or spore-forming bacteria (bacillus cereus) and steam cooked (100 degrees c) for 30 min. steam cooking significantly reduced (> 6 log cfu/g) non-spore-forming foodborne pathogens in all samples and inactivated spores of b. cereus by 1 to 2 log cfu/g. although spores of b. cereus survived steam cooking and germinated during 3 days of storage at room temperature, populations in most rice cakes remained below 106 cfu/g, which is the threshold for producing toxin. rice cakes made from mung bean flour supported growth and germination of b. cereus spores above that critical level. in mung bean rice cakes, enterotoxin production was detected by the second day, when b cereus cell  populations reached about 6.9 log cfu/g. the toxin concentration increased with storage time. however, our results suggest that rapid growth of total mesophilic  microorganisms by more than 7 to 8 log cfu/ml during the first day of storage produced off flavors and spoilage before b. cereus was able to grow enough to produce toxins. therefore, steam-cooked rice cakes made from a variety of flours  including mung bean flour are safe for sale for up to 1 day after storage at room temperature and are free of b. cereus toxins.

AB  == the microbial composition of the air in various areas of a high-throughput chicken-slaughtering facility was investigated. over a 4-mo period, 6 processing  areas were sampled, and the influence of environmental factors was monitored. the highest counts of microorganisms were recorded in the initial stages of processing, comprising the receiving-killing and defeathering areas, whereas counts decreased toward the evisceration, air-chilling, packaging, and dispatch areas. maximum microbial counts were as follows: coliforms, 4.9 x 10(3) cfu/m(3); escherichia coli 3.4 x 10(3) cfu/m(3); bacillus cereus, 5.0 x 10(4) cfu/m(3); staphylococcus aureus, 1.6 x 10(4) cfu/m(3); pseudomonas aeruginosa, 7.0 x 10(4)  cfu/m(3); presumptive salmonella spp., 1.5 x 10(4) cfu/m(3); listeria monocytogenes, 1.6 x 10(4) cfu/m(3); and fungi, 1.4 x 10(4) cfu/m(3). higher counts of airborne microorganisms found in the receiving-killing and defeathering areas indicate the importance of controlling microbial levels before processing to prevent the spread of organisms downstream. this should limit the risk of carrying over contaminants from areas known to generate high counts to areas where the final food product is exposed to air and surface contamination.

TI  == computer aided boar semen motility analysis for cereulide detection in different  food matrices.
AB  == computer aided semen analysis (casa) study of the boar semen motility has been demonstrated to be an appropriate assay for detection of cereulide (bacillus cereus emetic toxin). application of the boar semen bio-assay to detect cereulide directly in foods requires investigation of potential interference of food components, preservatives and other microbial and chemical food contaminants with the bio-assay. current study provides evidence that none of included staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins a, b, c and d nor b. cereus hemolysin bl (hbl) and non-hemolytic enterotoxin (nhe) and three mycotoxins (sterigmatocystin, fumonisin b1 and patulin) exhibited a toxic impact on semen progressive motility. aflatoxin m1, m3 and zearalenone impaired semen motility only at concentrations (0.004 mg ml(-1), 0.1 mg ml(-1) and 10 mg ml(-1), respectively) much higher than  those found in foods and those permitted by legislation, in comparison to cereulide which induces motility cease at concentrations lower than 20 ng ml(-1). ten commonly used preservatives, namely potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, (dl)  malic acid, citric acid, (l+) tartaric acid, acetic acid, (dl) lactic acid, (l+)  ascorbic acid, sodium chloride and sucrose induced no cease in spermatozoa motility even at preservative concentrations higher than permitted by legislation. dioxins, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (tcdd), and acrylamide  had no acute effect on spermatozoa motility at concentrations of 500 and 10,000 mg ml(-1), respectively. robustness of computer aided boar semen motility analysis, tested with 14 different foods inoculated with cereulide producing b. cereus, showed distinct cereulide production in seven samples (although b. cereus growth to counts higher than 8 log cfu g(-1) was noted in 11 samples), in amounts close to those reported in foodborne outbreaks. test evaluation in 33 samples suspected to hold cereulide showed actual cereulide presence in ten samples and no interference of food matrix with the assay.

TI  == microflora of minimally processed frozen vegetables sold in gaborone, botswana.
AB  == two hundred samples of minimally processed, frozen, and prepacked potato chips, peas, corn, and a variety of combined vegetables from supermarkets in gaborone, botswana, were examined microbiologically. determination of aerobic mesophilic plate count, aerobic psychrotrophic plate count, lactic acid bacteria, yeasts and molds, coliforms, listeria spp., and staphylococcus aureus were done. chips had the lowest mean log values for all of the microorganisms enumerated except yeasts and molds. the mean log values for single vegetables ranged from 3.6 to 9.1, 3.4  to 8.9, 2.9 to 5.6, and 2.1 to 6.5 log cfu/ g aerobic mesophilic plate count, aerobic psychrotrophic plate count, lactic acid bacteria, and yeasts and molds, respectively. the microbial profiles of peas and corn were almost similar (p < 0.001). the mean values for combined vegetables were clustered within 4.6 and 5.4 and 4.2 and 5.2 log cfu/g aerobic mesophilic plate count and aerobic psychrotrophic plate count, respectively. all of the vegetables had a coliform population distribution ranging from 0 to < 10(4) most probable number per g. the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated included members of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae (86.2%). escherichia coli was not detected  in all of the samples. the organisms isolated included those responsible for spoilage in frozen vegetables, namely pseudomonas, klebsiella, corynebacterium, lactic acid bacteria, and flavobacterium. the predominant lactic acid bacteria were lactobacillus spp. (55.9%). other spoilage organisms were yeasts, and cryptococcus spp. (55.4%) was predominant. pathogens, namely listeria monocytogenes, were also isolated at a rate of 2 to 10%, of which 4% was from corn, 2% each from peas and country crop, and 10% from stir-fry. bacillus cereus  was also isolated and accounted for 7.7% of the microorganisms from corn. s. aureus was isolated from all of the vegetables. enterotoxigenic strains were from corn, peas, mixed vegetables, and stir-fry, and all of them produced enterotoxin  a. in addition, the isolates from stir-fry vegetables also produced enterotoxins  b and c. the study reveals the presence of pathogens and emerging opportunistic pathogens in the ready-to-use or ready-to-eat vegetables. if e. coli is the only  indicator for safety and acceptability, consumers may be exposed to foodborne diseases. inclusion of other groups as indicator organisms is suggested. retailers are urged to invest in standby generators to maintain the cold chain.

TI  == the effect of lemon, orange and bergamot essential oils and their components on the survival of campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli o157, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus in vitro and in food systems.
AB  == aims: to investigate the effectiveness of oils and vapours of lemon (citrus limon), sweet orange (citrus sinensis) and bergamot (citrus bergamia) and their components against a number of common foodborne pathogens. methods and results: the disc diffusion method was used to screen the oils and vapours against listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli  o157 and campylobacter jejuni. the survival of each species, demonstrated to be susceptible in the in vitro studies, was tested on cabbage leaf for 60 s by direct contact and on chicken skin for 10 min by direct contact and 24 h by vapour. the results indicate that bergamot was the most inhibitory essential oil  (eo) and citral and linalool mimicked its effect (p > 0.001). citral and linalool vapours produced 6 log reductions in l. monocytogenes, staph. aureus and b. cereus populations on cabbage leaf after 8-10 h exposure but bergamot vapour exposure, while producing a similar reduction in l. monocytogenes and b. cereus populations, had no effect on staph. aureus. conclusions: bergamot was the most effective of the oils tested and linalool the most effective anti-bacterial component. gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible than gram-negative bacteria in vitro, although camp. jejuni and e. coli o157 were inhibited by bergamot and linalool oils and by linalool vapour. all bacteria tested were less  susceptible in food systems than in vitro. of the gram-positive bacteria tested staph. aureus was the least susceptible to both the oils and the components tested. significance and impact of the study: results suggest the possibility that citrus eos, particularly bergamot, could be used as a way of combating the growth of common causes of food poisoning.

AB  == buoyant density gradient centrifugation has been used to separate bacteria from complex food matrices, as well as to remove compounds that inhibit rapid detection methods, such as pcr, and to prevent false-positive results due to dna  originating from dead cells. applying a principle of buoyant density gradient centrifugation, we developed a method for rapid separation and concentration following filtration and low- and high-speed centrifugation, as well as flotation and sedimentation buoyant density centrifugation, for 12 food-borne pathogens (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, campylobacter jejuni, vibrio cholerae o139, vibrio parahaemolyticus o3k6, vibrio vulnificus, providencia alcalifaciens, aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus  aureus, and clostridium perfringens) in 13 different food homogenates. this method can be used prior to real-time quantitative pcr (rti-qpcr) and viable-cell counting. using this combined method, the target organisms in the food samples theoretically could be concentrated 250-fold and detected at cell concentrations  as low as 10(1) to 10(3) cfu/g using the rti-qpcr assay, and amounts as small as  10(0) to 10(1) cfu/g could be isolated using plate counting. the combined separation and concentration methods and rti-qpcr confirmed within 3 h the presence of 10(1) to 10(2) cfu/g of salmonella and c. jejuni directly in naturally contaminated chicken and the presence of s. aureus directly in remaining food items in a poisoning outbreak. these results illustrated the feasibility of using these assays for rapid inspection of bacterial food contamination during a real-world outbreak.

TI  == bacillus spp. among hospitalized patients with haematological malignancies: clinical features, epidemics and outcomes.
AB  == between april 2000 and may 2005, 350 bacteraemic episodes occurred among patients treated in our haematology unit. two hundred and twenty-eight of these episodes were caused by gram-positive pathogens, most commonly coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus. one hundred and twenty-two episodes were due to gram-negative pathogens, with a predominance of escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. bacillus bacteraemias constituted 12 of these episodes occurring in 12 patients, and accounted for 3.4% of all bacteraemic episodes. of the 12 strains evaluated, seven were bacillus licheniformis, three were bacillus cereus and two were bacillus pumilus. seven episodes presented with bloodstream infection, three with pneumonia, one with severe abdominal pain and deterioration of liver function, and one with a catheter-related bloodstream infection. b. licheniformis was isolated from five patients who had been hospitalized at the same time. this outbreak was related to non-sterile cotton wool used during skin disinfection. b. cereus and b. licheniformis isolates were susceptible to cefepime, carbapenems, aminoglycosides and vancomycin, but b. pumilus isolates were resistant to all antibiotics except  for quinolones and vancomycin. two deaths were observed. in conclusion, bacillus  spp. may cause serious infections, diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas, and high  morbidity and mortality in patients with haematological malignancies. both b. cereus and b. licheniformis may be among the 'new' gram-positive pathogens to cause serious infection in patients with neutropenia.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of silver-doped phosphate-based glasses.
AB  == in this study a range of phosphate-based glasses (pbg) doped with silver have been investigated for their antimicrobial activities. in disk diffusion assays, these compositions demonstrated microbistatic effects against a range of organisms including staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and candida  albicans. the data obtained from the above studies allowed for an additional range of pbg containing lower amounts of silver to be studied for their effects on the growth and viability of s. aureus, e. coli, and c. albicans. pbg containing 3 and 5 mol % ag were bactericidal for s. aureus and e. coli and significantly decreased the growth rate of c. albicans. a decrease in the dissolution rates of the glasses was seen with increasing ag content over the range of concentrations investigated. overall, 3 mol % ag incorporated into the pbg investigated was sufficient to mount a potent antibacterial effect against the test organisms, and these compositions also gave excellent long-term release  of ag ions into the medium.

TI  == berry phenolics: antimicrobial properties and mechanisms of action against severe human pathogens.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and mechanisms of phenolic extracts of 12 nordic berries were studied against selected human pathogenic microbes. the most sensitive bacteria on berry phenolics were helicobacter pylori and bacillus cereus. campylobacter jejuni and candida albicans were inhibited only with phenolic extracts of cloudberry, raspberry, and strawberry, which all were rich in ellagitannins. cloudberry extract gave strong microbicidic effects on the basis of plate count with all studied strains. however, fluorescence staining of liquid cultures of virulent salmonella showed viable cells not detectable by plate count adhering to cloudberry extract, whereas staphylococcus aureus cells adhered to berry extracts were dead on the basis of their fluorescence and plate count. phenolic extracts of cloudberry and raspberry disintegrated the outer membrane of examined salmonella strains as indicated by 1-n-phenylnaphthylamine (npn) uptake  increase and analysis of liberation of [14c]galactose- lipopolysaccharide. gallic acid effectively permeabilized the tested salmonella strains, and significant increase in the npn uptake was recorded. the stability of berry phenolics and their antimicrobial activity in berries stored frozen for a year were examined using escherichia coli and nonvirulent salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium. the amount of phenolic compounds decreased in all berries, but their antimicrobial activity was not influenced accordingly. cloudberry, in particular, showed constantly strong antimicrobial activity during the storage.

TI  == bioassay-guided purification and identification of antimicrobial components in chinese green tea extract.
AB  == the chinese green tea extract was found to strongly inhibit the growth of major food-borne pathogens, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium dt104, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and a diarrhoea food-poisoning pathogen bacillus cereus, by 44-100% with the highest activity found against s. aureus and lowest against e. coli o157:h7. a bioassay-guided fractionation technique was used for identifying the principal active component. a simple and efficient reversed-phase high-speed counter-current chromatography (hsccc) method was developed for the separation and purification of four bioactive polyphenol compounds, epicatechin gallate (ecg), epigallocatechin gallate (egcg), epicatechin (ec), and caffeine (cn). the structures of these polyphenols were confirmed with mass spectrometry. among the four compounds, ecg and egcg were the most active, particularly egcg against s. aureus. egcg had the lowest mic90 values against s. aureus (mssa) (58 mg/l) and its methicilin-resistant s. aureus  (mrsa) (37 mg/l). scanning electron microscopy (sem) studies showed that these two compounds altered bacterial cell morphology, which might have resulted from disturbed cell division. this study demonstrated a direct link between the antimicrobial activity of tea and its specific polyphenolic compositions. the activity of tea polyphenols, particularly egcg on antibiotics-resistant strains of s. aureus, suggests that these compounds are potential natural alternatives for the control of bovine mastitis and food poisoning caused by s. aureus.

TI  == elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: the prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (pcs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. which key  steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was  investigated. study design and methods: ten bacteria species were used. blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees c for 8 hours. the buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. pcs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. at each preparation step and during pc storage, bacteria contents were measured.  in additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees c for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. results: enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. bacillus cereus, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the pcs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. with the exception of p. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the pcs. remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. conclusions: bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor pcs. also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for  most species. when buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.

TI  == evolution of surveillance methods for detection of bacterial contamination of platelets in a university hospital, 1991 through 2004.
AB  == background: platelet (plt) bacterial contamination (pbc) is the most common transfusion-associated infection. it is important to understand the impact of interventions addressing this problem. study design and methods: pbc was studied  by prospective (active) and transfusion-reaction triggered (passive) surveillance from july 1991 to december 2004. active surveillance, utilized for 10 years, included bacterial culture of all or 4- and 5-day-old plts at issue and intermittent use of gram stain, ph measurements, and early (24-hr) culture of single-donor plateletpheresis (sdp) units. results: active surveillance detected  38 instances of pbc, 7 in sdp units (1:2213) and 31 in random-donor plt units (1:2090 units, p = 0.89; or 1:418 pools of 5 units, p < 0.001). contaminants were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; n = 27), staphylococcus aureus (4), bacillus cereus (1), serratia marcescens (2), streptococci (2 s. bovis, 1 s. uberis), and cons with viridans group streptococcus (1). only one instance of contamination, caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, was detected by passive surveillance, with fatal outcome. colony counts of contaminants ranged from 0.5 x 10(2) to 4 x 10(11) colony-forming units per ml at time of issue. pbc was interdicted before transfusion in 6 cases through gram stain screening. transfusion reactions occurred in 13 of 32 recipients (41%), with 9 severe reactions (28%) and 3 deaths (9%). ph testing failed to detect 5 contaminated units and resulted in discard of nearly 2 percent of units, whereas culture of sdp units at 24 hours failed to identify a contaminated unit. conclusion: improved active surveillance methods for detecting pbc are needed to improve the  safety of plt transfusions.

TI  == [laboratory-based evaluation of a selective x-sa agar medium supplemented with chromogenic substrate for staphylococcus aureus].
AB  == the newly developed culture medium, x-sa agar medium (nissui pharmaceuticals co., ltd., tokyo) selective for staphylococcus aureus was evaluated for its ability to detect clinical isolates of s. aureus. besides s. aureus, x-sa agar media allowed the growth of coagulase-negative staphylococci, bacillus cereus and some isolates of corynebacteria. however, those species were easily distinguishable from the blue and convex colonies of s. aureus. when compared to the traditional egg yolk  mannitol salt agar, selectivity for the species other than s. aureus was more specific, and growth support for s. aureus was more comparable to sheep blood agar. also, when various phenotypic variants of s. aureus were inoculated, visible colonies of mucoid colony variants and attenuated growth variants on mueller-hinton agar appeared on x-sa agar plates after 24 hour-incubation, but it required 48 hour-incubation for small colony variants. the fully automated microbiology system, raisus (nissui pharmaceuticals co., ltd.) gave comparable species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results when cell suspension directly prepared from x-sa agar media was tested. however, species-identification for phenotypic variants of s. aureus was more complicated  for raisus testing and detection of coagulase. with these results, it could be concluded that the x-sa agar medium supplemented with chromogenic substrate is superior to the traditional selective media for the detection of s. aureus, and is widely applicable for clinical microbiology as well as food microbiology.

AB  == background: in general the bacterial count in freshly donated blood is low and even lower in the corresponding platelet concentrates (pcs). by use of flow cytometry (facs) for sterility testing, the reliability of early versus later sampling times was evaluated. study design and methods: blood donations were spiked with various numbers of staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and klebsiella pneumoniae. the corresponding pcs were prepared by the buffy-coat method and stored at 22 degrees c. a 20-ml sample was collected from each pc directly after preparation and after 8 hours. samples were stored at 35 degrees c. sterility testing of both pcs and samples was by facs analysis at different time points. results: all stored pcs were found positive by facs analysis, with detection times ranging between 8 and 24 hours (k. pneumoniae, b.  cereus), 8 and 91 hours (s. aureus), and 144 hours (s. epidermidis). in the samples incubated at 35 degrees c, bacteria were detected after 8 to 19 hours (k. pneumoniae, b. cereus), 8 to 67 hours (s. aureus), and 19 to 43 hours (s. epidermidis). some of the samples did not contain bacteria. conclusion: detection times for slow-growing bacteria are significantly shortened when pc samples are incubated at 35 degrees c: the numbers of bacteria in freshly prepared pcs may, however, be so low that the samples drawn for sterility testing do not contain a  single bacterium. our results do not support a shortening of the 24-hour or greater sampling time recommended by the manufacturers of established test systems, because also for consistent detection by facs, bacteria need to grow in  the pcs to sufficient numbers.

AB  == background: it has been recently reported that major pathogens staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa accelerate a normal process of cell surface syndecan-1 (synd1) ectodomain shedding as a mechanism of host damage due to the production of shedding-inducing virulence factors. we tested if acceleration of synd1 shedding takes place in vitro upon treatment of epithelial cells with b. anthracis hemolysins, as well as in vivo during anthrax infection in mice. results: the isolated anthrax hemolytic proteins anlb (sphingomyelinase) and anlo (cholesterol-binding pore-forming factor), as well as clna (b. cereus homolog of  b. anthracis phosphatidyl choline-preferring phospholipase c) cause accelerated shedding of synd1 and e-cadherin from epithelial cells and compromise epithelial  barrier integrity within a few hours. in comparison with hemolysins in a similar  range of concentrations, anthrax lethal toxin (lt) also accelerates shedding albeit at slower rate. individual components of lt, lethal factor and protective  antigen are inactive with regard to shedding. inhibition experiments favor a hypothesis that activities of tested bacterial shedding inducers converge on the  stimulation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases of the syk family, ultimately leading to activation of cellular sheddase. both lt and anlo modulate erk1/2 and p38 mapk signaling pathways, while jnk pathway seems to be irrelevant to accelerated shedding. accelerated shedding of synd1 also takes place in dba/2 mice challenged with bacillus anthracis (sterne) spores. elevated levels of shed ectodomain are readily detectable in circulation after 24 h. conclusion: the concerted acceleration of shedding by several virulence factors could represent a new pathogenic mechanism contributing to disruption of epithelial or endothelial integrity, hemorrhage, edema and abnormal cell signaling during anthrax infection.

TI  == detection and identification of intestinal pathogenic bacteria by hybridization to oligonucleotide microarrays.
AB  == aim: to detect the common intestinal pathogenic bacteria quickly and accurately.  methods: a rapid (<3 h) experimental procedure was set up based upon the gene chip technology. target genes were amplified and hybridized by oligonucleotide microarrays. results: one hundred and seventy strains of bacteria in pure culture belonging to 11 genera were successfully discriminated under comparatively same conditions, and a series of specific hybridization maps corresponding to each kind of bacteria were obtained. when this method was applied to 26 divided cultures, 25 (96.2%) were identified. conclusion: salmonella sp., escherichia coli, shigella sp., listeria monocytogenes, vibrio parahaemolyticus, staphylococcus aureus, proteus sp., bacillus cereus, vibrio cholerae, enterococcus faecalis, yersinia enterocolitica, and campylobacter jejuni can be detected and identified by our microarrays. the accuracy, range, and discrimination power of this assay can be continually improved by adding further  oligonucleotides to the arrays without any significant increase of complexity or  cost.

TI  == exchange of glutamine-217 to glutamate of clostridium limosum exoenzyme c3 turns  the asparagine-specific adp-ribosyltransferase into an arginine-modifying enzyme.
AB  == c3-like adp-ribosyltransferaseses are produced by clostridium species, bacillus cereus, and various staphylococcus aureus strains. the exoenzymes modify the low-molecular-mass gtpases rhoa, b, and c. in structural studies of c3-like exoenzymes, an artt-motif (adp-ribosylating turn-turn motif) was identified that  appears to be involved in substrate specificity and recognition (han, s., arvai,  a. s., clancy, s. b., tainer, j. a. (2001) j. mol. biol. 305, 95-107). exchange of gln217, which is a key residue of the artt-motif, to glu in c3 from clostridium limosum results in inhibition of adp-ribosyltransferase activity toward rhoa. the mutant protein is still capable of nad-binding and possesses nad+ glycohydrolase activity. whereas recombinant wild-type c3 modifies rho proteins specifically at an asparagine residue (asn41), gln217glu-c3 is capable of adp-ribosylation of poly-arginine but not poly-asparagine. soybean trypsin inhibitor, a model substrate for many arginine-specific adp-ribosyltransferases,  is modified by the gln217glu-c3 transferase. also in c3 adp-ribosyltransferases from clostridium botulinum and b. cereus, the exchange of the equivalent gln residue to glu blocked asparagine modification of rhoa but elicited arginine-specific adp-ribosylation. moreover, the gln217glu-c3lim transferase was able to adp-ribosylate recombinant wild-type c3lim at arg86, resulting in decrease in adp-ribosyltransferase activity of the wild-type enzyme. the data indicate that the exchange of one amino acid residue in the artt-motif turns the  asparagine-modifying adp-ribosyltransferases of the c3 family into arginine-adp-ribosylating transferases.

TI  == basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: flow cytometry (facs) is a common technique in blood banking. it is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. it was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (pcs).  study design and methods: plasma-reduced pcs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees c for various times. the following 10 species were used: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica. bacterial dna was stained with thiazole orange. after the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by facs. results: all bacteria species used were detectable by facs. the lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microl, that is, 10(5) per ml. in general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. in one  case (k. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with  that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. when pc samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per ml of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees c, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. exceptions were e. cloacae and p. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. at 20 to 24 degrees c, the detection times were strongly prolonged. conclusion: sterility testing of pcs by facs is a feasible approach. the present  data suggest incubating pc samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees c before testing. for slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1  to 2 days.

TI  == purification and cytotoxic properties of bacillus cereus hemolysin ii.
AB  == the hemolysin ii from bacillus cereus, hlyii, is a member of the beta-barrel pore-forming toxin family of secreted microbial proteins that includes the staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin. compared with other proteins of the family, hemolysin ii has 90 extra amino acids at its c-terminus. to examine more closely  the cytotoxic and pore-forming properties of the protein, we have cloned and expressed it in escherichia coli. we developed a purification procedure for the matured hlyii protein from both culture media and cell extracts using a combination of cation exchange and affinity chromatography together with gel-filtration. in both cases, the fully processed hlyii protein was purified as  confirmed by n-terminal sequence analysis. the hlyii protein exhibits cytolytic activity of different extent on erythrocytes from various kinds of mammals. the results presented here show for the first time that two types of human cells are  sensitive to hlyii action. in view of its broad cytotoxic activity as well as the ability to interact with artificial membranes, we assume that hlyii needs no specific receptor to bind to cell membranes.

TI  == efficient growth inhibition of bacillus anthracis by knocking out the ribonucleotide reductase tyrosyl radical.
AB  == bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, is a worldwide problem because of the need for effective treatment of respiratory infections shortly after exposure. one potential key enzyme of b. anthracis to be targeted by antiproliferative drugs is ribonucleotide reductase. it provides deoxyribonucleotides for dna synthesis needed for spore germination and growth of the pathogen. we have cloned, purified, and characterized the tyrosyl radical-carrying nrdf component of b. anthracis class ib ribonucleotide reductase. its epr spectrum points to a hitherto unknown three-dimensional geometry of the radical side chain with a 60 degrees rotational angle of c(alpha)-(c(beta)-c(1))-plane of the aromatic ring. the unusual relaxation behavior of the radical signal and its apparent lack of line broadening at room temperature suggest a weak interaction with the nearby diiron site and the presence of a water molecule plausibly bridging the phenolic oxygen of the radical to a ligand of the diiron site. we show that b. anthracis cells are surprisingly resistant to the radical scavenger hydroxyurea in current use as an  antiproliferative drug, even though its nrdf radical is efficiently scavenged in  vitro. importantly, the antioxidants hydroxylamine and n-methyl hydroxylamine scavenge the radical several orders of magnitude faster and prevent b. anthracis  growth at several hundred-fold lower concentrations compared with hydroxyurea. phylogenetically, the b. anthracis nrdf protein clusters together with nrdfs from the pathogens bacillus cereus, bacillus thuringiensis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. we suggest the potential use of n-hydroxylamines in combination therapies against infections by b. anthracis and closely related pathogens.

AB  == a lectin isolated from the red alga solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). the lectin (500 microg/ml) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus sp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/ml but the lectin (10-1000 microg/ml) had no effect on  the growth of the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and b. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. it is possible that the interaction of s. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium b. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml. the stimulation of the growth of b.  cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/ml), its hapten. thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. the present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.

TI  == use of oligonucleotide array for identification of six foodborne pathogens and pseudomonas aeruginosa grown on selective media.
AB  == identification of presumptive foodborne pathogens grown on selective media may take one to several days and requires a different battery of biochemical tests for each microorganism. a molecular identification method was developed in which  universal primers were used to amplify the 16s to 23s rdna intergenic spacer of target microorganisms, and pcr products were hybridized to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides that were immobilized on a nylon membrane. the  seven target microorganisms were bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella, staphylococcus aureus, and vibrio parahaemolyticus. after testing a large collection of target bacteria (29  to 51 strains) and nontarget bacteria (> 500 strains), the performances (sensitivity and specificity) of the oligonucleotide array were as follows: b. cereus (100 and 77%), e. coli (100 and 100%), l. monocytogenes (100 and 90%), p.  aeruginosa (100 and 100%), salmonella (100 and 100%), s. aureus (100 and 100%), and v. parahaemolyticus (100 and 94.2%). other species in the b. cereus group cross-hybridized to the probes used for identification of b. cereus, and positive results should be confirmed by additional morphological observation of colonies.  listeria innocua cross-reacted with probes used to identify l. monocytogenes, but a simple hemolysis test was used to differentiate the two species. some strains of vibrio harveyi and vibrio mimicus cross-hybridized with probes used for identification of v. parahaemolyticus and caused false-positive reactions. the advantage of the array is that a common protocol was used to identify the seven target microorganisms and multiple different microorganisms could be simultaneously identified on a single array.

TI  == stability of enterocin as-48 in fruit and vegetable juices.
AB  == enterocin as-48 is a candidate bacteriocin for food biopreservation. before addressing application of as-48 to vegetable-based foods, the interaction between as-48 and vegetable food components and the stability of as-48 were studied. enterocin as-48 had variable interactions with fruit and vegetable juices, with complete, partial, or negligible loss of activity. for some juices, loss of activity was ameliorated by increasing the bacteriocin concentration, diluting the juice, or applying a heat pretreatment. in juices obtained from cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce, green beans, celery, and avocado, as-48 was very stable for the first 24 to 48 h of storage under refrigeration, and decay of activity was markedly influenced by storage temperature. in fresh-made fruit juices (orange, apple, grapefruit, pear, pineapple, and kiwi) and juice mixtures, as-48 was very  stable for at least 15 days at 4 degrees c, and bacteriocin activity was still detectable after 30 days of storage. gradual and variable loss of activity occurred in juices stored at 15 and 28 degrees c; inactivation was faster at higher temperatures. in commercial fruit juices (orange, apple, peach, and pineapple) stored at 4 degrees c, the bacteriocin was completely stable for up to 120 days, and over 60% of initial activity was still present in juices stored at  15 degrees c for the same period. commercial fruit juices stored at 28 degrees c  for 120 days retained between 31.5% (apple) and 67.71% (peach) of their initial bacteriocin activity. solutions of as-48 in sterile distilled water were stable (120 days at 4 to 28 degrees c). limited loss of activity was observed after mixing as-48 with some food-grade dyes and thickening agents. enterocin as-48 added to lettuce juice incubated at 15 degrees c reduced viable counts of listeria monocytogenes cect 4032 and bacillus cereus lwl1 to below detection limits and markedly reduced viable counts of staphylococcus aureus cect 976.

TI  == the impact of homologous recombination on the generation of diversity in bacteria.
AB  == the imprint of demographic and selective processes on bacterial population structure needs to be evaluated as deviation from the expectations of an appropriate null neutral model. we explore the impact of varying the population mutation and recombination rates theta and rho on ideal populations, using a recently developed model of neutral drift at multiple loci. this model may be fitted to experimental data to provide estimates of these parameters, and we do so for seven bacterial species (neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, helicobacter pylori, burkholderia  pseudomallei and bacillus cereus), illustrating that bacterial species vary extensively in these fundamental parameters. historically, the influence of recombination has often been estimated through its influence on the index of association i(a). we show that this may be relatively insensitive to changes in either mutation or recombination rates. it is known that biased sampling can lead to artificially high estimates of i(a). we therefore provide a method of precisely separating the effects of such bias and true linkage between alleles. we also demonstrate that by fitting the neutral model to experimental data, more  informative and precise estimates of the relative roles of recombination and mutation may be obtained.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of essential oils (eos) of cinnamon (cinnamon zeylanicum), clove (syzygium aromaticum), basil (ocimum basillicum), rosemary (rosmarinus officinalis), dill (anethum graveolens), and ginger (zingiber officinalis) was evaluated over a range of concentrations in two types of contact tests (solid and vapor diffusion). the eos were tested against an array of four gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes), four gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella choleraesuis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three fungi (a yeast, candida albicans, and two molds, penicillium islandicum and aspergillus flavus). the rationale for this work was to test the possibility of creating a protective atmosphere by using natural compounds that could extend the shelf life of packaged foodstuffs while minimizing organoleptic alterations. in the solid diffusion tests, cinnamon and clove gave the strongest (and very similar) inhibition, followed by basil and rosemary, with dill and ginger giving the weakest inhibition. the fungi were the  most sensitive microorganisms, followed by the gram-positive bacterial strains. the gram-negative strain p. aeruginosa was the least inhibited. the composition of the atmosphere generated by the eos, and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), were determined using a disk volatilization method, in which no inhibition from rosemary or basil was observed. cinnamon and clove, once again, gave similar results for every microorganism. as a general rule, mic (fungi) << mic (bacteria) with no clear differences between gram-positive or -negative strains except for p. aeruginosa, which was not inhibited by any of the eos in the vapor phase. the atmosphere generated from the eos was analyzed by means of solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry. differences among the volatiles in the eos, which may be responsible for the differences in their antimicrobial performances, were found.

TI  == the assessment of biological activities associated with the major constituents of the methanol extract of 'wild carrot' (daucus carota l) seeds.
AB  == daucus carota l. (family: apiaceae alt. umbelliferae), commonly known as 'wild carrot' or 'queen anne's-lace,' is an ecologically invasive erect biennial naturalized to scotland. the ethnobotanical uses of this species include applications in the treatment of cough, diarrhea, dysentery, cancer, malaria and  tumors, and as an antiseptic, abortifacient, aphrodisiac, carminative, stimulant, stomachic and tonic. the major constituents isolated from the methanol extract of d. carota seeds by reversed-phase preparative high performance chromatography were luteolin, luteolin 3'-o-beta-d-glucopyranoside and luteolin 4'-o-beta-d-glucopyranoside, three flavones. the constituents were assessed for their antibacterial and free radical scavenging activities, as well as toxicity towards brine shrimp. among these three flavones, luteolin showed the highest degree of free radical scavenging activity (rc50 = 4.3 x 10(-4) mg/ml) in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) assay. both luteolin and its 4'-o-glucoside  demonstrated bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic] = 5.0 x 10(-2) - 1.0 x 10(-1) mg/ml). luteolin also demonstrated antibactericidal activity against bacillus cereus and citrobacter freundii (mic = 5.0 x 10(-2) mg/ml). luteolin 3'-o-glucoside showed bactericidal activity against bacillus cereus and lactobacillus plantarum (mic = 2.5 x 10(-1) mg/ml and 5 x 10(-1) mg/ ml, respectively). in the brine shrimp lethality assay, the ld50 value of luteolin was 5.3 x 10(-2) mg/ml, and that of its 3'-o-glucoside and 4'-o-glucoside were >  1.0 mg/ml.

TI  == microbiological quality of ready-to-eat foods: results from a long-term surveillance program (1995 through 2003).
AB  == the coordination of food sampling activities across wales, a part of the united kingdom with a population of approximately 3 million, led to the establishment in 1995 of a coordinated food-sampling program designed to monitor on a long-term basis the microbiological quality and safety of specific ready-to-eat products. this surveillance system has been ongoing for 9 years and has generated a database of microbiological and associated demographic results for 15,228 ready-to-eat food samples. the food types that had the poorest overall results were sliced meats, unsliced poultry, sandwiches made without salad, and cakes made without dairy cream. for all food types, the overall unsatisfactory rate was 17% for aerobic colony counts, 1.6% for escherichia coli, and 0.5% for listeria spp. overall unsatisfactory or unacceptable rates for pathogens such as clostridium perfringens, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, and staphylococcus aureus were all below 0.5%. no campylobacter-positive samples and  only one salmonella-positive sample were found. the analysis of the results show  that the ready-to-eat food types sampled over the 9 years of the program were generally of good microbiological quality when compared with current united kingdom guidelines. the information contained in the database provides a baseline measurement of the microbial quality of a variety of ready-to-eat foods and allows environmental health officers and food microbiologists to generate hypotheses for targeted surveys or research work.

TI  == in-house validation of the bactec 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: at present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the fda for the purpose of quality control (qc) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates: the bact/alert blood culture system (biomerieux) and the pall ebds (pall corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived plts. after the decision of the aabb to institute universal qc testing of plt concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the  performance of our current blood culture system, the bactec 9240, was carried out for this purpose. study design and methods: serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with plt contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis plt unit per organism. four ml of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (cfus) per ml was inoculated into blood culture bottles (standard 10 aerobic/f, becton-dickinson diagnostic systems) and incubated in a bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to  insure the identity of bacterial growth. results: with the exception of streptococcus mitis, the bactec system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 cfus per ml for staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the limit of detection for the  s. mitis test strain was 61 cfus per ml. detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis plt products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. conclusion: this study validates the use of the bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis plts in  less than 24 hours.

AB  == phloxine b (d&c red no. 28) is a color additive for food, drugs, and cosmetics. it has been previously shown to have anti-staphylococcus aureus activities. in this work, the effect of phloxine b on various gram-negative bacteria and other gram-positive bacteria including bacillus cereus, bacillus thuringiensis, bacillus mycoides, bacillus subtilis, bacillus aureus, salmonella, escherichia coli and shigella was studied, along with the mechanism of anti-microbial activity. in the presence of fluorescent light, the viable count for gram-positive bacteria, (bacillus spp. and s. aureus) decreased in a dose and time dependent manner when incubated with phloxine b. the viability of gram-positive bacteria was reduced by 99.99% in 40 min, while there was no effect on gram-negative bacteria (salmonella choleraesuis, e. coli and shigella flexneri). however, the use of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) expands the spectrum of activity for phloxine b to include gram-negative bacteria. edta increased membrane-permeability by releasing lipopolysaccharide. overall, in an agar diffusion test the light-dependent bactericidal activity of 1 microg of phloxine b had a potency of 0.64 units of chloramphenicol and 0.5 units of tetracycline when tested on b. cereus, and had a potency of 0.7 units of chloramphenicol and 0.2 units of tetracycline when tested on s. aureus. the data  suggest that the dye may have some potential anti-microbial applications.

TI  == the role of sigmab in the stress response of gram-positive bacteria -- targets for food preservation and safety.
AB  == the alternative sigma factor sigmab modulates the stress response of several gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus subtilis and the food-borne human pathogens bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus. in all these bacteria, sigmab is responsible for the transcription of genes that can confer stress resistance to the vegetative cell. recent findings indicate that sigmab also plays an important role in antibiotic resistance, pathogenesis and cellular differentiation processes such as biofilm formation and sporulation. although there are important differences in the regulation of sigmab and in the set of genes regulated by sigmab in b. subtilis, b. cereus, l. monocytogenes and  s. aureus, there are also some conserved themes. a mechanistic understanding of the sigmab activation processes and assessment of its regulon could provide tools for pathogen control and inactivation both in the food industry and clinical settings.

TI  == molecular recognition of an adp-ribosylating clostridium botulinum c3 exoenzyme by rala gtpase.
AB  == c3 exoenzymes (members of the adp-ribosyltranferase family) are produced by clostridium botulinum (c3bot1 and -2), clostridium limosum (c3lim), bacillus cereus (c3cer), and staphylococcus aureus (c3stau1-3). these exoenzymes lack a translocation domain but are known to specifically inactivate rho gtpases in host target cells. here, we report the crystal structure of c3bot1 in complex with rala (a gtpase of the ras subfamily) and gdp at a resolution of 2.66 a. rala is not adp-ribosylated by c3 exoenzymes but inhibits adp-ribosylation of rhoa by c3bot1, c3lim, and c3cer to different extents. the structure provides an insight  into the molecular interactions between c3bot1 and rala involving the catalytic adp-ribosylating turn-turn (artt) loop from c3bot1 and helix alpha4 and strand beta6 (which are not part of the gdp-binding pocket) from rala. the structure also suggests a molecular explanation for the different levels of c3-exoenzyme inhibition by rala and why rhoa does not bind c3bot1 in this manner.

TI  == quantitative analysis of cereulide, an emetic toxin of bacillus cereus, by using  rat liver mitochondria.
AB  == an emetic toxin cereulide, produced by bacillus cereus, causes emetic food poisonings, but a method for quantitative measurement of cereulide has not been well established. a current detection method is a bioassay method using the hep-2 cell vacuolation test, but it was unable to measure an accurate concentration. we established a quantitative assay for cereulide based on its mitochondrial respiratory uncoupling activity. the oxygen consumption in a reaction medium containing rat liver mitochondria was rapid in the presence of cereulide. thus uncoupling effect of cereulide on mitochondrial respiration was similar to those  of uncouplers 2,4-dinitrophenol (dnp), carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (cccp), and valinomycin. this method gave constant results over a wide range of cereulide concentrations, ranging from 0.05 to 100 microg/ml. the minimum cereulide concentration to detect uncoupled oxygen consumption was 50 ng/ml and increased dose-dependently to the maximum level. semi-log relationship between the oxygen consumption rate and the cereulide concentration enables this method to quantify cereulide. the results of this method were highly reproducible as compared with the hep-2 cell vacuolation test and were in good agreement with those of the hep-2 cell vacuolation test. the enterotoxin of b. cereus or staphylococcus aureus did not show any effect on the oxygen consumption, indicating this method is specific for the identification of cereulide as a causative agent of emetic food poisonings.

TI  == penetration pharmacokinetics of topically administered 0.5% moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution in human aqueous and vitreous.
AB  == objective: to investigate the penetration of 0.5% moxifloxacin hydrochloride into the aqueous and vitreous after topical administration in humans. methods: a prospective, nonrandomized study of 20 patients scheduled for vitrectomy surgery  between september 1 and december 31, 2003. aqueous and vitreous samples were obtained and analyzed after topical administration of 0.5% moxifloxacin hydrochloride, every 2 hours (q2h) or every 6 hours (q6h), for 3 days before surgery. assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: mean +/- sd moxifloxacin concentrations in the q2h group for the aqueous (n = 9) and vitreous (n = 10) were 2.28 +/- 1.23 and 0.11 +/- 0.05 microg/ml, respectively. mean +/- sd moxifloxacin concentrations in the q6h group for the aqueous (n = 10) and vitreous (n = 9) were 0.88 +/- 0.88 and 0.06 +/- 0.06 microg/ml, respectively. the minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of isolates (mic(90)) was far exceeded in the aqueous for a wide spectrum of key pathogens, whereas it was not exceeded in the vitreous for several organisms. however, the minimum inhibitory concentration for 50% of the isolates was exceeded in the q2h  vitreous group for staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, bacillus cereus, and other gram-negative pathogens. conclusions: the endophthalmitis vitrectomy study revealed that 94.2% of isolates from postoperative endophthalmitis are gram-positive pathogens. moxifloxacin has a spectrum of coverage that appropriately encompasses the most common organisms in endophthalmitis. the pharmacokinetic findings of this investigation show that relatively high aqueous  levels can be achieved after topical administration. further studies will help define the precise role of 0.5% moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution in the treatment of or prophylaxis against intraocular infections.

TI  == characterization and antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin 217 produced by natural isolate lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei bgbuk2-16.
AB  == the strain lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei bgbuk2-16. which was isolated from traditionally homemade white-pickled cheese, produces bacteriocin 217 (bac217; approximately 7 kda). the onset of bac217 biosynthesis was observed in the logarithmic phase of growth, and the production plateau was reached after 9 or 12 h of incubation at 37 and 30 degrees c, respectively, when culture entered  the early stationary phase. biochemical characterization showed that bac217 retained antimicrobial activity within the range of ph 3 to 12 or after treatment at 100 degrees c for 15 min. bac217 antimicrobial activity also remained unchanged after storage at 4 degrees c for 6 months or -20 degrees c for up to 12 months. however, bac217 activity was completely lost after treatment with different proteolytic enzymes. bgbuk2-16 contains only one plasmid about 80 kb in size. plasmid curing indicated that genes coding for bac217 synthesis and immunity seem to be located on this plasmid. bac217 exhibited antimicrobial activity against some pathogenic bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus. interestingly, bac217 showed activity against salmonella sp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc27853. the inhibitory effect of bgbuk2-16 on the growth of s. aureus in mixed culture was observed. s. aureus treatment with bac217 led to a considerable decrease (cfu/ml) within a short period of time. the mode of bac217 action on s. aureus was identified as bactericidal. it should be noted that the strain bgbuk2-16 was shown to be resistant to bacteriocin nisin, which is otherwise widely used as a food additive for fermented dairy products.

TI  == antibacterial activity and specificity of the six human {alpha}-defensins.
AB  == we developed a kinetic, 96-well turbidimetric procedure that is capable of testing the antimicrobial properties of six human alpha-defensins concurrently on a single microplate. the defensins were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis and tested against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus) and gram-negative bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes and escherichia coli). analysis of the growth curves provided virtual lethal doses (vlds) equivalent to  conventional 50% lethal doses (ld(50)s), ld(90)s, ld(99)s, and ld(99.9)s obtained from colony counts. on the basis of their respective vld(90)s and vld(99)s, the relative potencies of human myeloid alpha-defensins against s. aureus were hnp2 > hnp1 > hnp3 > hnp4. in contrast, their relative potencies against e. coli and e.  aerogenes were hnp4 > hnp2 > hnp1 = hnp3. hd5 was as effective as hnp2 against s. aureus and as effective as hnp4 against the gram-negative bacteria in our panel.  hd6 showed little or no activity against any of the bacteria in our panel, including b. cereus, which was highly susceptible to the other five alpha-defensins. the assay described provides a quantitative, precise, and economical way to study the antimicrobial activities of host-defense peptides. its use has clarified the relative potencies of human alpha-defensins and raised  intriguing questions about the in vivo function(s) of hd6.

TI  == [interaction of neomycin with other antibiotics on selected bacterial strains].
AB  == antimicrobial combinations are used most frequently to provide broad-spectrum empirical coverage in the treatment of bacterial infections. however, combination of two antibiotics may not influence their activity, may lead to synergy or antagonism in the activity. neomycin may be combined with one of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, procaine penicillin, gramicidin, bacitracin, polymyxin b, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, and erythromycin in some human and veterinary multiantibiotic drugs distributed in poland. the checkerboard method has been one of the traditional assays for the measurement of antibiotic interactions. the aim of this study was to analyse the activity interaction of neomycin with second antibiotic in multiantibiotic drugs distributed in poland on standards and clinical bacterial strains. checkerboard results for all strains demonstrated synergism for 2.5% of combinations, only for standards strains. in one case salmonella enteritidis, in combination of neomycin with bacitracin, inhibition effect was observed. additive effects were predominant--49%. in 18% neutral effects were shown, but in 26% of combinations fic indexes were not possible to calculate, because of the resistance of clinical strains to the highest concentration of at least one antibiotic. in combination of aminoglycoside (neomycin) with beta-lactams antibiotics (ampicillin, procaine penicillin) in vitro, no synergy was observed for all examined strains. the best results were achieved for combinations of neomycin with peptide antibiotics (polymyxin, gramicidin and bacitracin)--5 for all 6 synergy effect observed.

AB  == the chemical compositions of the essential oil of curcuma zedoaria (berg.) rosc.  were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) and showed a high content of epicurzerenone and curdione representing 46.6% and 13.7% of the total  oil, respectively. the essential oil was evaluated for potential antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonasa aeruginosa, vibrio parahaemolyticus, salmonella typhimurium and bacillus cereus.  v. parahaemolyticus was sensitive to the presence of the essential oil, while the most resistant strain appeared to be e. coli. based on 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (mtt) assay, nitroblue tetrazolium (nbt) reduction and cell morphology, the essential oil of c. zedoaria could inhibit the proliferation of human promyelocytic leukemia hl-60 cells. these results suggest that the essential oil has the antimicrobial activity against some of gram- positive and negative pathogenic microorganisms and the components of the extract lead to the apoptosis of human cancer cell line.

TI  == application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  == a rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. nylon membrane was used as the array support. a mutation region of the 23s rrna gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. a pair of universal primers was designed for pcr amplification of the 23s rrna gene. twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. the 23s rrna gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella dysenteriae, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. two other species (salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with e. coli, but  the reaction did not affect their detection. after redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with staphylococcus aureus, but not  with clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes. the oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne  infections. the superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.

TI  == validation of bact/alert plastic culture bottles for use in testing of whole-blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich-plasma-derived platelets.
AB  == background: bacterial detection of platelet (plt)-rich-plasma (prp)-derived plts  presents unique challenges for countries that do not allow pooling before storage. this study validated the bact/alert for use in testing pooled prp-derived plts with nine contaminating organisms. study design and methods: isolates of bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into two prp-derived plt pools (target, 10 and 100 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml; actual recovered concentrations, 5 and 90 cfus/ml). four milliliters of each postbacterial inoculation sample was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles and 0.5 ml was plated onto blood agar. results: all organisms (excluding p. acnes) were detected in 8.2 to 22.0 and 7.6 to 20.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) and the mean time to detection was 15.0 and 13.1 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respective). p. acnes was detected with the anaerobic bottles in a mean of 74.9 and 64.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively). with e. cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. viridans detection with the anaerobic bottles was faster or equivalent to the detection with the aerobic bottles. this was most notable with s. viridans where  the anaerobic bottle was reactive on average 21.6 and 10.8 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) faster than the aerobic bottle. conclusions: this study validates the use of the bact/alert system for the detection of bacteria in prp-derived plts in a pooled format. overall, the use of the bact/alert system allowed the detection of pooled prp-derived plts inoculated with nine bacteria at 10 and 100 cfus per ml in 7.6 to 22.0 hours (excluding p. acnes).

AB  == this research expresses the potential of the bacterial activity present in the organic extracts obtained from penicillium sp., isolated from the esponge irciniafelix. this activity was evaluated through agar diffusion test and minimal inhibitory concentration (mic). the susceptibility trials of organic fractions were carried out against staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, bacillus cereus and b. subtilis. the use of the chromatographic techniques (clv and tlc), permitted to obtain bioactive organic extracts of different polarities, of which  only the etoac and meoh fractions inhibited the growth of the bacteria used. of the etoac fractionation, only fraction number 3 etoac/hex presented greatest activity against the gram-positive bacteria. number 1 etoac/hex fraction increased its activity against s. aureus (24 mm) and s. epidermidis (25 mm), which can be explained by the loss of possible antagonistic effect during the fractionation process. the cmi trials were carried out for the etoac number i subfraction against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, b. cereus and b. subtilis, wich was clinical interest, and shows the potential of this organic extract as antimicrobial agent.

TI  == essential oils: their antibacterial properties and potential applications in foods--a review.
AB  == in vitro studies have demonstrated antibacterial activity of essential oils (eos) against listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli o157:h7, shigella dysenteria, bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus at levels between  0.2 and 10 microl ml(-1). gram-negative organisms are slightly less susceptible than gram-positive bacteria. a number of eo components has been identified as effective antibacterials, e.g. carvacrol, thymol, eugenol, perillaldehyde, cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic acid, having minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 0.05-5 microl ml(-1) in vitro. a higher concentration is needed to achieve the same effect in foods. studies with fresh meat, meat products, fish, milk, dairy products, vegetables, fruit and cooked rice have shown that the concentration needed to achieve a significant antibacterial effect is around 0.5-20 microl g(-1) in foods and about 0.1-10 microl ml(-1) in solutions for washing fruit and  vegetables. eos comprise a large number of components and it is likely that their mode of action involves several targets in the bacterial cell. the hydrophobicity of eos enables them to partition in the lipids of the cell membrane and mitochondria, rendering them permeable and leading to leakage of cell contents. physical conditions that improve the action of eos are low ph, low temperature and low oxygen levels. synergism has been observed between carvacrol and its precursor p-cymene and between cinnamaldehyde and eugenol. synergy between eo components and mild preservation methods has also been observed. some eo components are legally registered flavourings in the eu and the usa. undesirable  organoleptic effects can be limited by careful selection of eos according to the  type of food.

TI  == pcr detection of bacillus and staphylococcus in various foods.
AB  == a broad-range pcr assay for the detection of bacteria belonging to bacillus and staphylococcus genera was developed. primers targeting the bacterial 16s rrna gene were newly designed and used in a pcr assay. to determine the specificity of the assay, 81 different bacterial strains (of 50 genera), 2 fungi, 3 animals, and 4 plants were tested. results were positive for every tested bacillus, staphylococcus, or aerococcus strain. in addition, the result for listeria grayi  was positive with lower pcr product. for all other bacterial strains and eukaryotes tested, results were negative. bacterial dna was prepared with the use of achromopeptidase and chelex 100 resin from culture after growth in brain heart infusion medium. to test the sensitivity of this pcr assay for bacillus or staphylococcus genus, either bacillus cereus or staphylococcus aureus was inoculated into various foods with undetectable levels of endogenous microbial contamination as an indicator. inoculation of bacteria at 10 to 30 cfu/g of food  was followed by a 5-h enrichment culture step after which the pcr assay allowed the detection of bacterial cells. when the inoculation (b. cereus or s. aureus) of 10 to 90 cfu/g into noodle foods containing endogenous microflora (10(3) to 10(5) cfu/g) was followed by a 6-h enrichment culture step, the pcr assay detected the bacteria. including the enrichment culture step, the entire pcr detection process can be completed within 8.5 h.

TI  == influence of the cell wall on ciprofloxacin susceptibility in selected wild-type  gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the susceptibility of several wild-type bacteria to ciprofloxacin and accumulation of the drug in these bacteria were evaluated. species studied included escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and bacillus cereus. ciprofloxacin susceptibility was measured for each strain using two different methods: the minimal inhibitory concentration and the bactericidal index. significant differences were observed between the results derived from these two methods. whereas the minimal inhibitory concentration was low in all strains tested, ciprofloxacin's bactericidal activity, as indicated by the bactericidal index, varied with the species studied. to determine whether this finding was due to variations in cell envelope permeability to ciprofloxacin (i.e. to combined cell  uptake and efflux), we studied ciprofloxacin accumulation using spectrofluorometry. in gram-negative bacteria, differences in permeability can lead to altered susceptibility to antibiotics. in fact, the combination of slow uptake and efficient efflux seems to be crucial to the characteristic poor susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin. however, the low level of activity of ciprofloxacin against s. aureus and two bacillus species may have resulted from the drug's interaction with its target enzymes (i.e. topoisomerase  iv in s. aureus and dna gyrase in bacillus spp.) rather than diminished permeability.

TI  == purification of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == bacteriocins are antibacterial substances of a proteinaceous nature that are produced by different bacterial species. lactic acid bacteria (lab) produce biologically active peptides or protein complexes that display a bactericidal mode of action almost exclusively toward gram-positive bacteria and particularly  toward closely related species. generally they are active against food spoilage and foodborne pathogenic microorganisms including bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria monocytogenes. there is an increased tendency to use natural occurring metabolites to prevent the growth of  undesirable flora in foodstuffs. these metabolites could replace the use of chemical additives such as sorbic acid, sulfur dioxide, nitrite, nitrate, and others. for instance, bacteriocins produced by lab may be promising for use as bio-preservaties. bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria are typically cationic, hydrophobic peptides and differ widely in many characteristics including molecular weight, presence of particular groups of amino acids, pi, net positive  charge, and post-translational modifications of certain amino acids. this heterogeneity within the lab bacteriocins may explain the different procedures for isolation and purification developed so far. the methods most frequently used for isolation, concentration, and purification involve salt precipitation of bacteriocins from culture supernatants, followed by various combinations of gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (rp-hplc). in this chapter, a protocol is described that combines several methods used in our laboratory for the purification of two cationic bacteriocins, lactocin 705al and enterocin crl10, produced by lactobacillus casei crl705 and enterococcus mundtii crl10, respectively.

TI  == sensitization of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to jenseniin g by sublethal injury.
AB  == jenseniin g, a bacteriocin produced by propionibacterium thoenii p126, is active  against related propionibacteria and some lactic acid bacteria and is sporostatic to botulinal spores. the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of sublethal stress on jenseniin g activity. bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica were subjected to temperature, acid, and osmotic stresses in the presence of jenseniin g. the bacteriocin reduced the viability of sublethally injured cultures, although the extent of reduction varied with strain and treatment. e. faecalis was the most sensitive to temperature stress; no reduction of viable counts occurred in the absence of jenseniin g, and a 1.5-log reduction occurred in the presence of jenseniin g. b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. aureus were more sensitive to jenseniin g when exposed to heat stress than when exposed to cold stress, whereas e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, and s. flexneri were more sensitive to jenseniin g when exposed to cold stress than when exposed to heat stress. when comparing an acid stress test alone to a combination of acid stress and jenseniin g, e. faecalis and l. monocytogenes showed the greatest sensitivities with 4.87- and 2.82-log reductions, respectively, after 7 days. all cultures except for s. aureus were adversely affected by the combination of salt stress and jenseniin g. salmonella typhimurium showed the greatest sensitivity to salt stress with jenseniin g (a 1.54-log reduction at day 7) when compared to salt stress alone (a 0.55-log reduction at day 7). jenseniin g, like bacteriocins produced by other gram-positive species, has broader activity against stressed organisms.

AB  == developing countries are faced with high incidences of food poisoning outbreaks,  with obvious economic consequences. in highly perishable foodstuffs such as fresh red meat the threat of food poisoning is particularly intense. in this study, red meat samples were collected from a deboning room of a high throughput abattoir. the samples were analysed for the presence of bacillus cereus., staphylococcus aureus., pseudomonas spp., listeria monocytogenes., escherichia coli and salmonella spp. the aerobic plate counts as well as enterobacteriaceae were also  enumerated. almost without exception the counts exceeded the microbiological guidelines for raw meat as proposed by the south african department of health. the average b. cereus count over the sampling period was 8.32 x 10(3) cfu, g (-1), for s. aureus and pseudomonas spp. 1.72 x 10(5) and 1.7 x 10(5) cfu g(-1) respectively and for e. coli 3.4 x 10(5) cfu g(-1). sixty percent of the samples  were positive for presumptive salmonella spp. while 52% of the samples tested positive for the presence of l. monocytogenes. the aerobic plate and enterobacteriaceae counts were 1.7 x 10(7) and 4.6 x 10(6) cfu g(-1), respectively. the data highlighted the need for a more systematic approach to ensuring safe food through implementing quality control methods to prevent the entry and proliferation of pathogens in meat and meat products, especially during processes with a high degree of handling, such as deboning.

TI  == [evaluation of a colorimetric method for studying the interaction between microorganisms and intestinal epithelial cells].
AB  == the aim of the present study was to gain further insight on the reliability of the colorimetric determination of the activity of bacterial nitrate reductase to  evaluate bacterial concentrations and interaction between microorganisms and enterocyte-like cells. nitrite produced after incubation of the samples with a nitrate-formate solution was determined with a diazotization reaction with sulphanilic acid and n-naphthyl-ethylene-diamonium dichloride. cell association assays were performed with differentiated caco-2 cells. a biphasic relationship was found between nitrite concentration and bacterial densities. this behavior seems to be due to the sigmoideal character of the kinetics of nitrate reduction. association to caco-2 cells was strongly strain dependent being staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 the strain showing the highest values of association. for some  strains, percentages of association calculated on the basis of the colorimetric assay were significantly higher than those calculated in terms of viable counts.  bacterial association with enterocyte-like cells can be evaluated by measures of  the activity of bacterial nitrate reductase provided that the biphasic relationship between bacterial and nitrite concentrations is taken into account for the calculations. results presented in this paper show the applicability of the colorimetric method to assess the amount of microorganisms associated to human enterocytes in culture.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a low-molecular-weight chitosan obtained from cellulase digestion of chitosan.
AB  == a water-soluble chitosan hydrolysate with high activity against escherichia coli  was obtained during cellulase digestion of chitosan for 18 h. this 18-h hydrolysate is composed of low-molecular-weight chitosan (lmwc), with a molecular weight of 12.0 kda, and chitooligosaccharides, which are composed of sugars with  a degree of polymerization of 1 to 8. lmwc has a strong activity at 100 ppm against many pathogens and yeast species, including bacillus cereus, e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica serovar typhi, and saccharomyces cerevisiae, while the chitooligosaccharides have much weaker antimicrobial activity than does lmwc. accordingly, the antimicrobial activity against e. coli in the 18-h hydrolysate proved to come mainly from the presence of lmwc.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

TI  == the role of bacterial and non-bacterial toxins in the induction of changes in membrane transport: implications for diarrhea.
AB  == bacterial toxins induce changes in membrane transport which underlie the loss of  electrolyte homeostasis associated with diarrhea. bacterial- and their secreted toxin-types which have been linked with diarrhea include: (a) vibrio cholerae (cholera toxin, e1 tor hemolysin and accessory cholera enterotoxin); (b) escherichia coli (heat stable enterotoxin, heat-labile enterotoxin and colicins); (c) shigella dysenteriae (shiga-toxin); (d) clostridium perfringens (c. perfringens enterotoxin, alpha-toxin, beta-toxin and theta-toxin); (e) clostridium difficile (toxins a and b); (f) staphylococcus aureus (alpha-haemolysin); (g) bacillus cereus (cytotoxin k and haemolysin bl); and (h)  aeromonas hydrophila (aerolysin, heat labile cytotoxins and heat stable cytotoxins). the mechanisms of toxin-induced diarrhea include: (a) direct effects on ion transport in intestinal epithelial cells, i.e. direct toxin interaction with intrinsic ion channels in the membrane and (b) indirect interaction with ion transport in intestinal epithelial cells mediated by toxin binding to a membrane  receptor. these effects consequently cause the release of second messengers, e.g. the release of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate/guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate, ip(3), ca2+ and/or changes in second messengers that are the result of toxin-formed ca2+ and k+ permeable channels, which increase ca2+ flux and augment changes in ca2+ homeostasis and cause depolarisation of the membrane  potential. consequently, many voltage-dependent ion transport systems, e.g. voltage-dependent ca2+ influx, are affected. the toxin-formed ion channels may act as a pathway for loss of fluid and electrolytes. although most of the diarrhea-causing toxins have been reported to act via cation and anion channel formation, the properties of these channels have not been well studied, and the available biophysical properties that are needed for the characterization of these channels are inadequate.

TI  == phytoestrogen genistein as an anti-staphylococcal agent.
AB  == the soybean-derived isoflavone genistein has been shown to exert beneficial effects on many disorders, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. the effects of genistein on mammalian cells are mediated by its abilities to inhibit  topoisomerase ii and protein tyrosine kinase. in order to examine the potential antibacterial activities of genistein, we incubated the bacteria with various concentrations of this compound for different periods of time and assessed the viable counts. exposure to genistein exhibited an inhibitory effect on all staphylococcal strains tested, including methicillin-resistant strains. furthermore, the growth of streptococcus pasteurianus, bacillus cereus, and helicobacter pylori was clearly inhibited by genistein, whereas escherichia coli  growth was not suppressed. daidzein, which is structurally similar to genistein,  but deficient in topoisomerase ii inhibitory activity, also inhibited the growth  of staphylococcus aureus, albeit with lower potency than genistein. our results indicate that genistein exerts potent antibacterial properties in vitro, which are possibly mediated by the stabilization of the covalent topoisomerase ii-dna cleavage complex.

TI  == antibacterial activity and mechanism of action of tick defensin against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == defensins are a major group of antimicrobial peptides and are found widely in vertebrates, invertebrates and plants. invertebrate defensins have been identified from insects, scorpions, mussels and ticks. in this study, chemically  synthesized tick defensin was used to further investigate the activity spectrum and mode of action of natural tick defensin. synthetic tick defensin showed antibacterial activity against many gram-positive bacteria but not gram-negative  bacteria and low hemolytic activity, characteristic of invertebrate defensins. furthermore, bactericidal activity against pathogenic gram-positive bacteria including bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was observed. however, more than 30 min was necessary for tick defensin to completely kill bacteria. the interaction of tick defensin with  the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane and its ability to disrupt the membrane potential was analyzed. tick defensin was able to disrupt the membrane potential  over a period of 30-60 min consistent with its relatively slow killing. transmission electron microscopy of micrococcus luteus treated with tick defensin showed lysis of the cytoplasmic membrane and leakage of cellular cytoplasmic contents. these findings suggest that the primary mechanism of action of tick defensin is bacterial cytoplasmic membrane lysis. in addition, incomplete cell division with multiple cross-wall formation was occasionally seen in tick defensin-treated bacteria showing pleiotropic secondary effects of tick defensin.

TI  == effect of gamma irradiation on the survival of pathogens in kwamegi, a traditional korean semidried seafood.
AB  == kwamegi (semidried raw pacific saury) is traditional seafood available in korea.  it has water activity in the range of 0.90 to 0.95. spoilage and the growth of most pathogenic bacteria is retarded because of low water activity, low temperature, and packaging. however, it is contaminated with bacteria of public health significance and poses a hazard to the consumer because it is consumed raw without any cooking. the effectiveness of these hurdles in preventing the growth  of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, salmonella typhimurium, and escherichia coli and the efficacy of irradiation treatment in eliminating these bacteria from kwamegi using inoculated pack studies was examined. radiation sensitivity of s. aureus, b. cereus, salmonella typhimurium, and e. coli in kwamegi was investigated. d10-values of these organisms in kwamegi were 590 +/- 13.6, 640 +/- 14.9, 560 +/- 45.4, and 550 +/- 8.6 gy, respectively. the growth of all four test organisms inoculated into these foods during 4 weeks of storage at  an ambient winter temperature (ranging from -5 degrees c to +5 degrees c) was recorded. all four pathogens (inoculated at 10(6) cfu/g) were eliminated by irradiation at 4 kgy. these studies unequivocally demonstrate that irradiation, with a combination of low water activity and low temperature, results in microbiologically safe kwamegi.

TI  == identification of foodborne bacteria by infrared spectroscopy using cellular fatty acid methyl esters.
AB  == identification of bacterial species by profiling fatty acid methyl esters (fames) has commonly been carried out by using a 20-min capillary gas chromatographic procedure followed by library matching of fame profiles using commercial midi databases and proprietary pattern recognition software. fast gc (5 min) fame procedures and mass spectrometric methodologies that require no lipid separation  have also been reported. in this study, bacterial identification based on the rapid (2 min) infrared measurement of fame mixtures was demonstrated. the microorganisms investigated included gram positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus anthracis, and bacillus cereus, and gram negative bacteria from the family enterobacteriacae: yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella typhimurium, shigella sonnei, and escherichia coli (four strains of e. coli), and non-enterobacteriacae: vibrio cholerae, vibrio vulnificus, and vibrio  parahemolyticus. foodborne bacterial mixtures of fames were measured by using an  attenuated total reflection (atr)-fourier transform infrared (ftir) spectroscopic procedure and discriminated by multivariate analysis. results showed that the enterobacteriacae could be discriminated from the vibrios. the identification was at the level of species (for the bacillus and vibrio genera) or strains (for the  e. coli species). a series of bacterial fame test samples were prepared and analyzed for accuracy of identification, and all were correctly identified. our results suggest that this infrared strategy could be used to identify foodborne pathogens.

TI  == bactericidal effects of konjac fluid on several food-poisoning bacteria.
AB  == in this study, the bactericidal effects of japanese alkaline foods on food-poisoning bacteria were evaluated. konjac is an alkaline food soaked in calcinated calcium (the ph of konjac fluid ranges from 11.42 to 12.53). konjac fluids completely inactivated escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic e. coli o157:h7 and e. coil o26:h9, salmonella enteritidis, vibrio parahemolyticus. and staphylococcus aureus. the initial level of 6 log cfu/ml dramatically decreased after incubation with konjac fluid, and no viable gram-negative bacterium cells could be detected within 1 to 2 days and no viable s. aureus cells could be detected within 3 to 5 days. on the other hand, treatment with konjac fluid was also effective in reducing levels of spore-forming bacteria (bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium botulinum type e and type a). at least a 4-log reduction of spore-forming bacteria was obtained in konjac fluid within 7 to 14 days. vegetative cells were more susceptible to konjac fluid than spores were. when the initial cell count was 6 log cfu/ml, a few surviving spores remained for 60 to 90 days, but no spores could be detected  after 120 days. when the initial count of spore-forming bacteria was 3 to 4 log cfu/ml, the cells considered vegetative were completely inactivated within i to 3 days. repeated treatment with konjac fluid caused complete inactivation of spores in less than 1 to 3 days. our studies indicate that konjac fluid, which has a long history of use in food, will control food-poisoning bacterial contamination  during the production or preservation of konjac and other foods and has a preventive effect on bacteria that can cause severe disease at uniquely low levels.

AB  == promethazine has been recognised as an effective antiplasmid agent in cultures containing a single bacterial species such as escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus and agrobacterium tumefaciens. the objective of this study was to examine the effect of heterogenity of the microbial flora on plasmid elimination by promethazine in a laboratory based model system of mixed bacterial infection. f'lac plasmid elimination of e. coli k12 le140 was studied in the presence of a numerically predominant gram-positive  species (bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis) by promethazine (0-120 mg/l) at 23, 37 and 39 degrees c. growth kinetics of different bacterial species  were studied at various temperatures without drug treatment in mixed bacterial cultures and it was found that the small number of added bacteria overgrew the pre-existing flora during the incubation period. we observed that bacterial-bacterial interactions modified the growth rate of individual bacterial species and gave selective advantages to some bacterial species of the microbial  community. some interactions between coexisting bacterial species enhanced the frequency of plasmid curing by promethazine in mixed cultures with s. epidermidis. in our experiments the plasmid curing action of promethazine was more effective at elevated temperature than at lower temperatures.

TI  == diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  == among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (aa) is one of the most important. aa has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on helicobacter pylori. however, there are limited studies on the possible role of aa and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (pa) on the growth and survival of h. pylori. in the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that aa in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mm) inhibited  h. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. in contrast,  under aerobic conditions aa in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mm) significantly increased the survival of h. pylori presumably eliminating the  toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. the hydrophobic derivative of aa, pa (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mm). this effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, clostridium sporogenes and campylobacter jejuni. among these bacterial strains, pa showed a similar inhibitory effect on b. cereus and b. subtilis as observed with h. pylori. the results suggest that pa may be considered an important aa derivative  in eradication of h. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.

AB  == annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. there are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. however, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. this study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing  the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the mics  and mbcs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. the results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and staphylococcus aureus, with mics of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. a concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactococcus lactis, and paenibacillus polymyxa. the mics for listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus  durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. no activity was detected against lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils from thymus spinulosus ten. (lamiaceae).
AB  == the chemical composition of essential oils from aerial parts of thymus spinulosus ten. (lamiaceae) is reported. four oils from plants growing in different environmental conditions were characterized by gc and gc-ms methods; the oils seem to indicate a new chemotype in the genus thymus. influences of soil and altitude characteristics on the essential oil composition are discussed. the oils showed antibacterial activity against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, and bacillus cereus) and gram-negative (proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimuium ty2, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa) bacteria.

TI  == horizontal transfer of drug-resistant aminoacyl-transfer-rna synthetases of anthrax and gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == the screening of new antibiotics against several bacterial strains often reveals  unexpected occurrences of natural drug resistance. two examples of this involve specific inhibitors of staphylococcus aureus isoleucyl-transfer-rna synthetase 1  (ilers1) and, more recently, streptococcus pneumoniae methionyl-trna synthetase 1 (metrs1). in both cases, resistance is due to the presence of a second gene that  encodes another synthetase (ilers2 or metrs2). here, we show that both s. pneumoniae metrs2 and s. aureus ilers2 have closely related homologues in the gram-positive bacterium bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax. furthermore, similar to drug-resistant pathogens, strains of b. anthracis and its closest relative, b. cereus, also have wild-type iles1 and mets1 genes. clostridium perfringens, the causative agent of gangrene, also has two mets genes, whereas oceanobacillus iheyensis isolated from deep-sea sediments has a single iles2-type gene. this study shows the importance of understanding complex  evolutionary networks of ancient horizontal gene transfer for the development of  novel antibiotics.

TI  == vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  == objective: to investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. methods: a prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between september 2001 and may 2002 at the cullen eye institute. aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients  after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: mean +/- sd gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/ml, 1.34  +/- 0.34 micro g/ml, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/ml respectively. mean +/- sd sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. the percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration  achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous mic(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. conclusions: orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low mic(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin  represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.

TI  == inactivation of bacteria and spores by pulse electric field and high pressure co2 at low temperature.
AB  == the common methods for inactivation of bacteria involve heating or exposure to toxic chemicals. these methods are not suitable for heat-sensitive materials, food, and pharmaceutical products. recently, a complete inactivation of many microorganisms was achieved with high-pressure carbon dioxide at ambient temperature and in the absence of organic solvent and irradiation. the inactivation of spores with co(2) required long residence time and high temperatures, such as 60 degrees c. in this study the synergistic effect of pulsed electric field (pef) in combination with high-pressure co(2) for inactivation was investigated. the bacteria escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus were suspended in glycerol solution and treated in the first step with pef (up to 25 kv/cm) and then with high-pressure co(2) not higher than 40 degrees c and 200 bar. the inactivation efficiency was determined  by counting the colony formation units of control and sample. samples of the cells subjected to pef treatment alone and in combination with co(2) treatment were examined by scanning electron microscopy to determine the effect of the processes on the cell wall. experimental results indicate that the viability decreased with increasing electrical field strength and number of pulses. a further batch treatment with supercritical co(2) lead to complete inactivation of bacterial species and decreased the count of the spores by at least three orders  of magnitude, the inactivation being enhanced by an increase of contact time between co(2) and the sample. a synergistic effect between the pulsed electric field and the high-pressure co(2) was evident in all the species treated. the new low temperature process is an alternative for pasteurization of thermally labile  compounds such as protein and plasma and minimizes denaturation of important nutrient compounds in the liquid media.

TI  == [observations of characteristics of the mechanisms of biological oxidation of cell wall-deficient bacteria].
AB  == the l-forms were induced from staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and bacillus cereus by beta-lactam antibiotics and then observations on the properties of oxygen requirement, sugar fermentation and sensitive to cyanide of  the l-forms were done. the results were shown that the l-forms derived from the obligate aerobe or the facultative anaerobe did not ferment sugars and were highly oxygen-dependent and more sensitive to cyanide than their parent bacteria. the metabolic activities which were same as the parent bacteria of the l-forms would return after the l-forms reverted to the typical bacteria forms. it was possible that the changes of biological oxidation mechanism were due to the deficiency of the cell wall which led to loss of the periplasmic space or the membrane-wall interlayer so that the enzymes for fermentation existed in the space could not be hold.

TI  == vitreous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous humor after oral  administration. methods: a prospective, nonrandomized clinical study of 20 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy surgery between september 2001 and february 2002 at the cullen eye institute, houston, texas. aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 20 patients  after oral administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before surgery. assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: mean gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 19), vitreous (n = 19), and aqueous (n = 10) 4.98 +/- 1.14 micrograms/ml, 1.35 +/- 0.36 microgram/ml, and 1.09 +/- 0.57 micrograms/ml, respectively. mean sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 2.99 +/- 0.73 hours, 3.79 +/- 0.81 hours, and 3.71 +/- 0.87 hours, respectively. the percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 27.13% and 21.85%, respectively. mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous mic90 levels were achieved against a wide spectrum of pathogens, including staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. conclusions: gatifloxacin is a novel fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic that has mic90 levels significantly lower than those of other fluoroquinolone agents. furthermore, it penetrates well into the vitreous cavity in the noninflamed eye. potential uses for oral gatifloxacin may include prophylaxis against endophthalmitis in open-globe injuries, surgical prophylaxis against postoperative endophthalmitis,  and adjunctive therapy for the current management of bacterial endophthalmitis.

TI  == eggshell matrix proteins as defense mechanism of avian eggs.
AB  == this study focused on the role of eggshell matrix proteins as a function of potential natural antimicrobial defenses of avian eggs. the electrophoretic profile of sds-page showed that the soluble eggshell matrix proteins had three major bands of 15 000, 36 000, and 66 000 and several minor bands comprising 17 000, 25 000, 30 000, and 75 000, while insoluble matrix proteins were consisting  of various bands comprising at least 16 distinct migration bands between 10 000 and 200 000. three bacteria species, pseudomonas aureginosa, bacillus cereus, and staphylococcus aureus, were found to be inhibited in the presence of soluble eggshell matrix proteins (100 microg/ml). on the other hand, escherichia coli and salmonella enteritidis were weakly inhibited at only an early stage of incubation time (up to 4 h). scanning electron microscopy revealed that eggshell matrix proteins might interact and disrupt the membrane integrity of bacteria. the present study clearly indicated that avian eggshell matrix proteins possess a potential of novel antimicrobial defensin mechanism.

TI  == bacillus cereus, bacillus thuringiensis and bacillus mycoides differentiation using a pcr-re technique.
AB  == a method was developed to differentiate between bacillus cereus, bacillus mycoides and bacillus thuringiensis using the polymerase chain reaction combined  with a restriction endonuclease (pcr-re) technique. this fast and simple protocol, applied to pure culture strains, was developed using the gyrb dna sequence, as previously proposed by other authors. strains from international collections were used to optimize the method which was then applied to the identification of strains isolated from food samples. amplifications were specific for the b. cereus group. only staphylococcus aureus gave the same size pcr product, but it was easily differentiated from strains in the b. cereus group by using restriction analysis, based on digestion with the rsai, sau3ai and ecori endonucleases. specific amplifications and good differentiations were obtained using pure strains, suggesting the possibility of using the method described to identify the b. cereus group directly in food samples.

TI  == application of a real-time biosensor to detect bacteria in platelet concentrates.
AB  == a spore-based biosensor for detecting low levels of bacteria in real-time has been recently developed. the system (termed lexsas, label-free exponential signal-amplification system) exploits spore's ability to produce fluorescence when sensing neighboring bacterial cells. we studied the lexsas as a possible approach for identifying bacterially contaminated platelet concentrates prior to  transfusion because the system offers rapid analysis, high sensitivity, and low cost. if successful, this approach could reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality from transfusion-related bacteremia and sepsis. in this study, we used  the lexsas for detecting bacteria in platelet concentrates spiked with bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, or streptococcus pyogenes. bacteria were separated from platelets using a 2-min procedure based on bacterial resistance to detergents and osmotic shock. the results indicate that the lexsas could be used to design a practical biosensor for identifying bacterially contaminated platelets in real-time.

AB  == a total of 14,020 lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from nham and screened for bacteriocin production. one lactococcus lactis strain wnc 20 produced a bacteriocin that not only inhibited closely related lab, but also some food-borne pathogens including listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus. biochemical studies revealed that the bacteriocin was heat-stable even at autoclaving temperature (121 degrees c for 15 min) and was active over a wide ph range (2-10). the bacteriocin was inactivated  by alpha-chymotrypsin and proteinase k but not other proteases. the antimicrobial spectrum and some characteristics of this bacteriocin were nearly identical to that of nisin. the gene encoding this bacteriocin was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with nisin gene-specific primer. sequencing of this gene showed identical sequences to nisin z as indicated by the substitution of asparagine residue instead of histidine at position 27. the ability of the bacteriocin produced by lc. lactis wnc 20 may be useful in improving the food safety of the fermented product.

TI  == an investigation into the microflora of heroin.
AB  == in 2000, an unusual increase of morbidity and mortality among illegal injecting drug users in the uk and ireland was reported and clostridium novyi was identified as the likely source of the serious infection, although infections due to c. botulinum and bacillus cereus were also reported. because heroin was a possibile source of infection, this study investigated the microflora of heroin samples seized in england during 2000 and 2002. two methods were developed for the examination of the microflora of heroin. the first consisted of suspension of the drug in maximum recovery diluent (mrd) which was inoculated directly into clostridium botulinum isolation cooked meat broth (cbi). the second method rendered the heroin soluble in citric acid, concentrated particulate material (and bacterial cells) by filtration and removed heroin residues by washing with citric acid and phosphate-buffered saline before placing the filter in cbi broth. duplicate cbi broths from both methods were incubated without heating and after heating at 60 degrees c for 30 min. subcultures were made after incubation for 7  and 14 days on to eight different solid media. the methods were evaluated with heroin samples spiked with either c. botulinum or c. novyi spore suspensions; recovery of 10 spores in the original sample was demonstrated. fifty-eight heroin samples were tested by citric acid solubilisation and 34 by the mrd suspension technique. fifteen different gram-positive species of four genera were recognised. no fungi were isolated. aerobic endospore-forming bacteria (bacillus  spp. and paenibacillus macerans) were the predominant microflora isolated and at  least one species was isolated from each sample. b. cereus was the most common species and was isolated from 95% of all samples, with b. licheniformis isolated  from 40%. between one and five samples yielded cultures of b. coagulans, b. laterosporus, b. pumilus, b. subtilis and p. macerans. staphylococcus spp. were isolated from 23 (40%) samples; s. warneri and s. epidermidis were the most common and were cultured from 13 (22%) and 6 (10%) samples respectively. one or two samples yielded cultures of s. aureus, s. capitis and s. haemolyticus. the remainder of the flora detected comprised two samples contaminated with c. perfringens and two samples with either c. sordellii or c. tertium. multiple bacterial species were isolated from 43 (74%) samples, a single species from the  remaining 15. in 13 samples b. cereus alone was isolated, in one b. subtilis alone and in one sample b. pumilus alone. c. botulinum and c. novyi were not isolated from any of the heroin samples. recommendations for the optimal examination of the microflora of heroin are given.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of several extracts and fractions of the aerial parts  of hypericum canariense, hypericum glandulosum and hypericum grandifolium was investigated using the disc diffusion and broth microdilution methods against twelve reference microorganisms (eight bacterial and four fungal strains). the methanol extract and chloroform fraction of h. canariense, as well as the methanol extracts, butanol and chloroform fractions of both h. glandulosum and h. grandifolium exhibited a good antibacterial activity against four gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus var. mycoides, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis) and the gram-negative bacterium bordetella bronchiseptica with the diameters of growth inhibition area in the range 10-25 mm and mics values between 0.03 and 0.29 mg/ml. neither the infusions and aqueous fractions of the species studied nor the butanol fraction of h. canariense showed any antibacterial activity against the tested microorganisms. amongst the active  extracts, the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determination showed that the h. canariense chloroform fraction was the most active against m. luteus, s. aureus and s. epidermidis. no antifungal activity was seen with any of the extracts or fractions tested. the results of this study support the use of these  species in canarian traditional medicine to treat skin infections.

TI  == essential oil constituents and in vitro antimicrobial activity of decalepis hamiltonii roots against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == hydrodistillation of decalepis hamiltonii roots yielded an essential oil (0.33% v/w) that contained 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde (37.45%), 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (31.01%), 4-o-methylresorcylaldehyde (9.12%), benzyl alcohol (3.16%), and alpha-atlantone (2.06%) as major constituents, with aromatic aldehydes constituting the main fraction of this root's essential oil. the oil was tested for its antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens responsible for food spoilage and human pathologies using standard antimicrobial assays. it exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against bacillus cereus, bacillus megaterium, candida albicans, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, micrococcus roseus, and staphylococcus aureus at a concentration range of 1:0 with inhibitory activities of 27, 23, 16, 19, 22, 19, and 23 mm, respectively, which are comparable to those of the standards. the roots of d. hamiltonii, therefore, may  be considered as an inexpensive source of an essential oil rich in antimicrobial  compounds against foodborne pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial synergistic effect of linolenic acid and monoglyceride against bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the antimicrobial effect of linolenic acid with or without monoglyceride (glycerol laurate or glycerol myristate) against six food-borne microorganisms was determined in broth medium. minimum inhibitory concentration of linolenic acid on bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus was 20 and 50 ppm, respectively. the growth of b. cereus treated with linolenic acid at 10 ppm with  10 ppm monoglyceride was more inhibitory than that of linolenic acid alone, and the viable cell population was reduced 2-4 log cycles compared to that of the control. when linolenic acid was added at that level, the adenosine triphosphate  (atp) concentration of extracellular fluid was drastically increased compared with that of the control, and the combined effect with monoglyceride was higher than that with linolenic acid alone. however, the intracellular atp concentration decreased compared with that of the control. from these results, we concluded that linolenic acid has a strong antimicrobial activity against b. cereus and s.  aureus, and that linolenic acid combined with monoglyceride showed stronger antimicrobial activity than using linolenic acid alone.

TI  == interaction of the rho-adp-ribosylating c3 exoenzyme with rala.
AB  == rhoa, -b, and -c are adp-ribosylated and biologically inactivated by clostridium  botulinum c3 exoenzyme and related c3-like transferases. we report that rala gtpase, which is not adp-ribosylated by c3, inhibits adp-ribosylation of rhoa by  c3 from c. botulinum (c3bot), clostridium limosum (c3lim), and bacillus cereus (c3cer) but not from staphylococcus aureus (c3stau) in human platelet membranes and rat brain lysate. inhibition by rala occurs with the gdp- and guanosine 5'-3-o-(thio)triphosphate-bound forms of rala and is overcome by increasing concentrations of c3. a direct interaction of rala with c3 was verified by precipitation of the transferase with gst-rala-sepharose. the affinity constant (k(d)) of the binding of rala to c3lim was 12 nm as determined by fluorescence titration. rala increased the nad glycohydrolase activity of c3bot by about 5-fold. although rala had no effect on glucosylation of rho gtpases by clostridium difficile toxin b, c3bot and c3lim inhibited glucosylation of rala by clostridium sordellii lethal toxin. furthermore, c3bot decreased activation of phospholipase d by rala. the data indicate that several c3 exoenzymes directly interact with rala without adp-ribosylating the gtpase. the interaction is of high affinity and interferes with essential functions of c3 and rala.

AB  == two strains showing bacteriocin production were selected from a total of 206 lactic acid bacteria isolated from samples of milk, milk serum, whey and homemade cheeses in southern cordoba, argentina. this property was detected by means of well diffusion assays. the strains were identified as enterococcus hirae and enterococcus durans. the protein nature of those substances was proved by showing their sensitivity to type iv and xxv proteases, papaine, trypsin, pepsin and k proteinase. the bacteriocins inhibited the growth of listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringes and two strains of staphylococcus aureus, an a-enterotoxin and a b-enterotoxin producers. all of these bacteria are common  pathogens usually associated with food borne diseases (eta). these lactic acid bacteria or their bacteriocins could be suitable candidates for food preservation and specially useful in the our regional dairy industry.

TI  == epidemiologic profiling: evaluating foodborne outbreaks for which no pathogen was isolated by routine laboratory testing: united states, 1982-9.
AB  == the objective was to evaluate foodborne outbreaks of undetermined aetiology by comparing them to pathogen-specific epidemiologic profiles of laboratory-confirmed foodborne outbreaks. national foodborne outbreak data reported to cdc during 1982-9 were categorized by clinico-epidemiologic profiles  based on incubation, duration, percent vomiting, fever and vomiting to fever ratio. from the pathogen-specific profiles, five syndromes were developed: a vomiting-toxin syndrome resembling bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus; a diarrhoea-toxin syndrome characteristic of clostridium perfringens, a diarrhaeogenic escherichia coli syndrome, a norwalk-like virus syndrome, and a salmonella like syndrome. of 712 outbreaks, 624 (87.6%) matched one of five syndromes; 340 (47.8%) matched the norwalk-like syndrome and 83 (11.7%) matched the salmonella-like syndrome. after combining information on known pathogens and  epidemiologic profiles, only 88 (12.4%) outbreaks remained unclassified. norwalk-like virus outbreaks appear as common as salmonella-like outbreaks. we conclude that profiling can help classify outbreaks, guide investigations and direct laboratory testing to help detect new and emerging pathogens.

TI  == effects of antibacterial dishwashing liquid on foodborne pathogens and competitive microorganisms in kitchen sponges.
AB  == in response to increasing concern about home hygiene, the use of antibacterial products to reduce microorganisms in kitchen sponges and cleaning cloths is strongly promoted by some producers of detergent for domestic use. the effects of an antibacterial dishwashing liquid on escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis,  staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus were investigated in a modified suspension test and in used sponges with and without food residues under laboratory conditions. a limited study was conducted in households to assess the  efficacy of antibacterial dishwashing liquid as used by the consumer. in the suspension tests, s. aureus and b. cereus were shown to be susceptible to low concentrations of antibacterial dishwashing liquid (0.5%), whereas e. coli and salmonella enteritidis maintained their initial numbers for at least 24 h at 25 degrees c. at higher concentrations (2 to 4%), all test organisms decreased to below the detection limit after 24 h. over a 24-h period, the antibacterial dishwashing liquid did not significantly reduce these organisms in used sponges in which food residues were present. the antibacterial product did not reduce the competitive microorganisms either. similar results were found for sponges involved in daily household use. the results of this study demonstrate that the antibacterial dishwashing liquid was effective in reducing pathogens in the suspension test but not in the used sponges. this finding indicates that to determine the efficacy of antibacterial products, their use in a household setting must be considered.

AB  == we report here the molecular cloning and expression of a hemolytic sphingomyelinase from an aquatic bacterium, pseudomonas sp. strain tk4. the sphingomyelinase gene was found to consist of 1,548 nucleotides encoding 516 amino acid residues. the recombinant 57.7-kda enzyme hydrolyzed sphingomyelin but not phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, or phosphatidylethanolamine, indicating that the enzyme is a sphingomyelin-specific sphingomyelinase c. the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by the enzyme was found to be most efficient at ph 8.0 and activated by mn(2+). the enzyme shows quite a broad specificity, i.e., it hydrolyzed 4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (nbd)-sphingomyelin with short-chain fatty acids and nbd-sphingosylphosphorylcholine, the latter being completely resistant to hydrolysis by any sphingomyelinase reported so far. significant sequence similarities were found in sphingomyelinases from bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria ivanovii, and leptospira interrogans, as well as a hypothetical  protein encoded in chromobacterium violaceum, although the first three lacked one-third of the sequence corresponding to that from the c terminus of the tk4 enzyme. interestingly, the deletion mutant of strain tk4 lacking 186 amino acids  at the c-terminal end hydrolyzed sphingomyelin, whereas it lost all hemolytic activity, indicating that the c-terminal region of the tk4 enzyme is indispensable for the hemolytic activity.

AB  == background and objective: to evaluate the bact/alert automated blood culture system for the detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates, and to determine bacterial growth kinetics in leucodepleted and non-leucodepleted units. materials and methods: apheresis (cobe leucocyte reduction system [lrs]) and pooled buffy coat-derived (optipress) platelet concentrates (pcs) were tested. six organisms were used for spiking the pcs: clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus, group b  streptococcus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli. units were inoculated to give a final concentration of approximately equal  to 1 and 50 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. on days 0, 2 and 5, bact/alert standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles were inoculated with a 5-ml fill volume and bacteria were enumerated. results: the bact/alert automated blood culture system gave rapid determination times of spiked units, with all positives detected within 48 h and 98.1% detected within 24 h. in general, as the inoculum  concentration increased, the detection time decreased. rapid growth was obtained  with all organisms tested except for b. cereus, which failed to grow on four occasions. bacterial numbers on day 2 ranged from 10(5) to 10(11) cfu/ml and on day 5 ranged from 10(4) to 10(12) cfu/ml. growth was not significantly greater in leucodepleted units. conclusions: the study confirmed that pcs are an excellent growth medium for bacteria. rapid and substantial growth was obtained with all organisms under test. leucodepletion does not appear to enhance bacterial proliferation. the bact/alert automated blood culture system could rapidly detect contamination of units. bacterial screening using an automated blood culture system is therefore a potential option.

TI  == inhibitory activity of honey against foodborne pathogens as influenced by the presence of hydrogen peroxide and level of antioxidant power.
AB  == antimicrobial activity of honey has been attributed to hydrogen peroxide, which is produced by naturally occurring glucose oxidase, and phenolic compounds, although lethality of and inhibition by these and other components against microorganisms vary greatly, depending on the floral source of nectar. this study was undertaken to compare honeys from six floral sources for their inhibitory activity against escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, shigella sonnei, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus. a disc assay revealed that development of zones of inhibition of growth depends on  the type and concentration of honey, as well as the test pathogen. growth of b. cereus was least affected. the inhibition of growth of s. sonnei, l. monocytogenes, and s. aureus in 25% solutions of honeys was reduced by treating solutions with catalase, indicating that hydrogen peroxide contributes to antimicrobial activity. darker colored honeys were generally more inhibitory than light colored honeys. darker honeys also contained higher antioxidant power. since antimicrobial activity of the darker colored test honeys was not eliminated by catalase treatment, non-peroxide components such as antioxidants may contribute to controlling the growth of some foodborne pathogens. the antibacterial properties of honeys containing hydrogen peroxide and characterized by a range of antioxidant power need to be validated using model food systems.

TI  == mode of action of beta-barrel pore-forming toxins of the staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin family.
AB  == staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin is the prototype of a family of bacterial exotoxins with membrane-damaging function, which share sequence and structure homology. these toxins are secreted in a soluble form which finally converts into a transmembrane pore by assembling an oligomeric beta-barrel, with hydrophobic residues facing the lipids and hydrophilic residues facing the lumen of the channel. besides alpha-hemolysin the family includes other single chain toxins forming homo-oligomers, e.g. beta-toxin of clostridium perfringens, hemolysin ii  and cytotoxin k of bacillus cereus, but also the staphylococcal bi-component toxins, like gamma-hemolysins and leucocidins, which are only active as the combination of two similar proteins which form hetero-oligomers. the molecular basis of membrane insertion has become clearer after the determination of the crystal structure of both the oligomeric pore and the soluble monomer. studies on this family of beta-barrel pore-forming toxins are important for many aspects: (i) they are involved in serious pathologies of humans and farmed animals, (ii) they are a good model system to investigate protein-membrane interaction and (iii) they are the basic elements for the construction of nanopores with biotechnological applications in various fields.

AB  == aims: to determine the role of lactoperoxidase (lp) in inhibiting the growth of micro-organisms in pasteurised milk. methods and results: four micro-organisms of importance in the spoilage of pasteurized milk were challenged in lactoperoxidase (lp)-enriched ultra-heat treated (uht) milk after subsequent pasteurization. milk samples were stored at the optimum temperatures for growth of the individual bacteria. pasteurization was carried out at 72 degrees c/15 s and 80 degrees c/15 s to determine the effect of the lp system on the micro-organisms. an active lp system was found to greatly increase the keeping quality (kq) of milks inoculated with pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus thermophilus and pasteurized at 72 degrees c, but had little or no effect in milks heated at 80 degrees c, presumably due to virtual inactivation of lp at 80 degrees c. however, pasteurization temperature had no effect on the kq of milks challenged with bacillus cereus spores. conclusions: this study suggests that the lp system, rather than heat-shocking of spores, is responsible for the greater kq of milk pasteurized at 72 degrees c/15 s compared with 80 degrees c/15 s. significance and impact of the study: the study emphasizes the care required in selecting pasteurization temperatures in commercial practice and to avoid the temptation to compensate for inferior quality of raw milk by increasing pasteurization temperature.

TI  == evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria from healthy oral cavity of thai volunteers: inhibition of oral pathogens.
AB  == the aims of the present study were to screen and characterize the antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria which were isolated from healthy oral cavities of thai volunteers, and to characterize their inhibiting substances. among 3790 isolates  (suspected to be lactic acid bacteria) from 130 volunteers, five showed an appreciable effect against sarcina lutea atcc 9341, bacillus cereus atcc 11778, escherichia coli atcc 25922, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, streptococcus mutans dtmu 1, strep. salivarius dtmu 1, strep. sanguis dtmu 1, candida albicans  atcc 13803 and c. albicans dtmu 2, as well as the oral pathogens. these antimicrobial isolates included l17 and n14 which showed the antibacterial activity, d14 which showed the anticandidal activity, and d6 and n8 which showed  both the antibacterial and anticandidal activities. the isolates were later found to be facultative anaerobic, gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-capsule-forming and catalase-negative bacilli. they could utilize casein but  could not hydrolyse starch, and they produced hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. their antimicrobial potentials were found to be affected by ph, catalase, proteolytic enzymes and temperature. the activity was partially inactivated after catalase treatment, significantly declined at ph > or =9.0 or after trypsin and pepsin treatments, and also reduced after heating at > or =100 degrees c. however, the antimicrobial activity of these five isolates was somewhat resistant to heat. when the isolates were tested for their antimicrobial sensitivity, they  were shown to be sensitive to a number of antimicrobial agents. the final identification revealed that d6, d14 and n14 were lactobacillus paracasei subsp.  paracasei, and l17 and n8 were lact. rhamnosus.

TI  == growth of bacteria in inoculated platelets: implications for bacteria detection and the extension of platelet storage.
AB  == background: recent reports from europe have advocated the use of bacterial culturing of platelets on day 2 or 3 of storage to extend the shelf life of platelets to 7 days, thereby reducing the outdating of platelets and preserving a limited medical resource. to assess the optimal timing, the necessary sensitivity, and the possible efficacy of bacterial detection, the bacterial growth characteristics were reviewed in 165 platelet units, each inoculated on the day of collection with one of the following organisms: bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis from four previously published studies. study design and methods: quantitative culture data from inoculated platelet concentrates from five sites and four studies were combined into one database and analyzed for bacterial concentration thresholds (> or =10(1), > or =10(2), > or =10(3), > or =10(4), > or =10(5) cfu/ml) by day of storage. results: all examples of b. cereus, p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. aureus had concentrations > or =10(2) cfu per ml by day 3 after inoculation. by day 4, all units with these organisms contained > or =10(5) cfu per ml. units contaminated with s. epidermidis showed slower and more varied  growth. by day 3 after inoculation, 81.3 percent had 10(2) cfu per ml. by day 4 after inoculation, 46 (95.8%) of 48 units had concentrations > or =10(2) cfu per  ml. conclusion: these experiments suggest that an assay capable of detecting 10(2) cfu per ml on day 3 of storage would detect the vast majority of bacterially contaminated platelet units, prevent many cases of platelet-associated bacterial sepsis, and provide a scientific basis for the extension of the current platelet storage time. it would be expected that a rare, slow-growing organism could escape such a detection scheme.

TI  == microbiological hazard identification and exposure assessment of street food vending in johannesburg, south africa.
AB  == one hundred and thirty-two samples of beef, chicken, salad and gravy were collected from two street vendors over eleven replicate surveys to assess microbiological safety and quality. for each food type samples were collected during preparation and holding. dish water was also collected and food preparation surfaces swabbed during preparation and display. standard methods were used to determine aerobic plate counts, enterobacteriaceae counts, coliform  counts and spore counts. six hundred and seventy-five predominant colonies were isolated from aerobic plate counts of all samples and characterised. the incidence of selected foodborne bacterial pathogens and non-pathogenic e. coli 1  was also determined. in most cases mean bacterial counts of the raw materials were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those of corresponding cooked foods. no significant differences (p > 0.05) in all count types were observed between food  samples collected during cooking and those collected during holding. in addition, no significant differences (p > 0.05) in all count types were observed between prepared salads and their raw materials. mean bacterial counts of water and swab  samples collected from vendor 1 were lower than those of water and swab samples collected from vendor 2.the predominant populations isolated from the aerobic plate counts were bacillus spp., staphylococcus spp., enterobacteriaceae and alcaligenes spp. bacillus cereus was detected in 17%, clostridium perfringens in  1%, staphylococcus aureus in 3% and vibrio metchnikovii in 2% of the food samples. campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes, and escherichia coli o157:h7 were not detected. non-pathogenic e. coli 1 was detected in 13% of food samples, in 86 and 36% of dish water samples collected from vendors 1 and 2, respectively, and in 36% of surface swab samples from vendor 2.

TI  == a new cytotoxin from bacillus cereus that may cause necrotic enteritis.
AB  == a cytotoxin (cytk) has been isolated from a bacillus cereus strain that caused a  severe food poisoning outbreak killing three people. a protein of 34 kda was highly cytotoxic, and the addition of other secreted proteins gave no synergistic effect. cytk was also necrotic and haemolytic. no known b. cereus enterotoxins were produced by this strain. a dna sequence from 1.8 kb upstream to 0.2 kb downstream of the toxin gene was sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequence of the toxin showed similarity to staphylococcus aureus leucocidins, gamma-haemolysin and alpha-haemolysin, clostridium perfringens beta-toxin and b.  cereus haemolysin ii, all belonging to a family of beta-barrel channel-forming toxins. there was no sequence similarity between cytk and enterotoxins of b. cereus. the upstream sequence contained a partial sequence of a putative histidine kinase gene. a recognition site for plcr, which regulates the transcription of enterotoxins hbl and nhe of b. cereus, was found in the promoter region of the toxin. this new cytotoxin may be responsible for a disease that is  similar to, although not as severe as, the necrotic enteritis caused by the beta-toxin of c. perfringens type c.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of rosemary extracts.
AB  == a rosemary extract commercially exploited (oxy'less) as an antioxidant of lipids  in foods was dissolved in ethanol (100 mg/ml), and the solution was tested against foodborne microorganisms. for gram-positive bacteria, the mic of the ethanolic solution was 1% for leuconostoc mesenteroides, 0.5% for listeria monocytogenes, 0.5% for staphylococcus aureus, 0.13% for streptococcus mutans, and 0.06% for bacillus cereus. it slowed the growth of penicillium roquefortii and botrytis cinerea. up to 1% of the ethanolic solution had no activity on the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, and erwinia carotovora and on the yeasts rhodotorula glutinis and cryptococcus laurentii. antibacterial activity of the rosemary extract was strongly influenced by the composition of the media. the mic was reduced by low ph, high nacl contents, and  low temperatures. low ph and high nacl concentration had a synergistic effect on  the mic of the rosemary extract for s. aureus. lipids, surface-active agents, and some proteins decreased its antibacterial activity, whereas pectin had no effect. the inhibitory effect was little modified by heat treatment (100 degrees c). the  natural microflora of pasteurized zucchini broth was inhibited by 0.5% of the rosemary extract. the antibacterial activity was linked to the compounds extracted with hexane, which are presumably phenolic diterpenoids.

TI  == characterization of reutericyclin produced by lactobacillus reuteri lth2584.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri lth2584 exhibits antimicrobial activity that can be attributed neither to bacteriocins nor to the production of reuterin or organic acids. we have purified the active compound, named reutericyclin, to homogeneity  and characterized its antimicrobial activity. reutericyclin exhibited a broad inhibitory spectrum including lactobacillus spp., bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria innocua. it did not affect the growth of gram-negative bacteria; however, the growth of lipopolysaccharide mutant strains of escherichia coli was inhibited. reutericyclin exhibited a bactericidal mode of action against lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, staphylococcus aureus, and b. subtilis and triggered the lysis  of cells of l. sanfranciscensis in a dose-dependent manner. germination of spores of b. subtilis was inhibited, but the spores remained unaffected under conditions that do not permit germination. the fatty acid supply of the growth media had a strong effect on reutericyclin production and its distribution between producer cells and the culture supernatant. reutericyclin was purified from cell extracts  and culture supernatant of l. reuteri lth2584 cultures grown in mmrs by solvent extraction, gel filtration, rp-c(8) chromatography, and anion-exchange chromatography, followed by rechromatography by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. reutericyclin was characterized as a negatively charged, highly hydrophobic molecule with a molecular mass of 349 da. structural characterization (a. holtzel, m. g. ganzle, g. j. nicholson, w. p. hammes, and g. jung, angew. chem. int. ed. 39:2766-2768, 2000) revealed that reutericyclin is a  novel tetramic acid derivative. the inhibitory activity of culture supernatant of l. reuteri lth2584 corresponded to that of purified as well as synthetic reutericyclin.

TI  == photochemical inactivation of bacteria and hiv in buffy-coat-derived platelet concentrates under conditions that preserve in vitro platelet function.
AB  == background and objectives: a photochemical process has been tested for the inactivation of viruses and bacteria in buffy-coat derived platelet concentrates  (bc pcs). materials and methods: bc pcs in 35% cpd plasma and 65% platelet-additive solution (pas iii) were exposed to photochemical treatment (pct) with 150 microm of the psoralen s-59 and a 3 j/cm(2) treatment with long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva, 320-400 nm). platelet function was evaluated following pct using a panel of in vitro assays. results: this pct process was highly effective at inactivating gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia  marcescens). no viable bacteria were detected following pct and 7 days of platelet storage while bacterial growth was detected in paired untreated control  bc pcs. complete inactivation of the gram-positive bacillus cereus was achieved only in one of two replicate experiments with bc pcs. pct was also highly effective for inactivation of human immunodeficiency virus hiv-1 in bc pcs inoculated with approximately 10(6) tissue culture infectious doses per milliliter (tcid(50)/ml) of cell-associated hiv-1. rapid inactivation was observed with increasing uva doses: with 150 microm s-59 and a 1 j/cm(2) treatment of uva, a reduction of 5.6+/-0.5 log tcid(50)/ml was achieved, and a reduction of >6.4 log tcid(50)/ml was achieved with 150 microm s-59 and a 3 j/cm(2) treatment of uva. no physiologically relevant differences in platelet functions were found between the test and the control bc pcs during 7 days of storage. conclusion: pct with 150 microm s-59 and a 3 j/cm(2) uva treatment does  not adversely affect in vitro properties of bc pcs stored at 22 degrees c for 7 days. the pct process inactivated bacteria and hiv-1 inoculated into the bc pcs.  these results extend the earlier reported efficacy of pct apheresis pcs to bc pcs.

AB  == cured meats such as ham can undergo premature spoilage on account of the proliferation of lactic acid bacteria. this spoilage is generally evident from a  milkiness in the purge of vacuum-packaged sliced ham. although cured, most hams are at more risk of spoilage than other types of processed meat products because  they contain considerably higher concentrations of carbohydrates, approximately 2 to 7%, usually in the form of dextrose and corn syrup solids. unfortunately, the  meat industry is restricted with respect to the choice of preservatives and bactericidal agents. an alternative approach from these chemical compounds would  be to use novel carbohydrate sources that are unrecognizable to spoilage bacteria. l-glucose and d-tagatose are two such potential sugars, and in a series of tests in vitro, the ability of bacteria to utilize each as an energy source was compared to that of d-glucose. results showed that both l-glucose and d-tagatose are not easily catabolized by a variety of lactic bacteria and not at  all by pathogenic bacteria such as escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and yersinia enterocolitica. in a separate study, d-glucose, l-glucose, and d-tagatose were added to a chopped and formed ham formulation and the rate of bacterial growth was monitored. analysis of data by a general linear model revealed that the growth rates of total aerobic and lactic acid bacteria were significantly (p < 0.05) slower for the formulation containing d-tagatose than those containing l- or d-glucose. levels of enterobacteriaceae were initially low and these bacteria did not significantly (p < 0.20) change in the presence of any of the sugars used in the  meat formulations. compared to the control sample containing d-glucose, the shelf life of the chopped and formed ham containing d-tagatose at 10 degrees c was extended by 7 to 10 days. these results indicate that d-tagatose could deter the  growth of microorganisms and inhibit the rate of spoilage in a meat product containing carbohydrates.

TI  == occurrence of nisin z production in lactococcus lactis bfe 1500 isolated from wara, a traditional nigerian cheese product.
AB  == screening for bacteriocin production of 500 strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) from various african fermented foods resulted in the detection of a bacteriocin producing lactococcus lactis (bfe 1500) isolated from a dairy product called wara. the bacteriocin inhibited not only the closely related lab, but also strains of listeria monocytogenes, listeria innocua, clostridium butyricum, clostridium perfringens, bacillis cereus and staphylococcus aureus. it was heat stable even at autoclaving temperature (121 degrees c for 15 min) and was active  over a wide ph range (2-10), but highest activity was observed in the lower ph range. the bacteriocin was inactivated by alpha-chymotrypsin and proteinase k, but not by other proteases. growth kinetic assay indicated stronger growth inhibition by the bacteriocin produced by lc. lactis bfe 1500 on l. monocytogenes ws 2250 and b. cereus dsm 2301 than with the nisin a producing strain dsm 20729.  polymerase chain reaction indicated the presence of the nisin operon in strain bfe 1500 and sequencing of its structural gene showed that lc. lactis bfe 1500 produced the natural nisin variant, nisin z, as indicated by the substitution of  asparagine residue instead of histidine at position 27. the genetic determinants  for bacteriocin production in strain bfe 1500 are located on a conjugative transposon. the ability of the bacteriocin produced by lc. lactis bfe 1500 to inhibit a wide range of food-borne pathogens is of special interest for food safety, especially in the african environment with perennial problems of poor food hygiene.

TI  == bacteriological studies of blood, tissue fluid, lymph and lymph nodes in patients with acute dermatolymphangioadenitis (dla) in course of 'filarial' lymphedema.
AB  == filarial lymphedema is complicated by frequent episodes of dermatolymphangioadenitis (dla). severe systemic symptoms during attacks of dla resemble those of septicemia. the question we asked was whether bacterial isolates can be found in the peripheral blood of patients during the episodes of  dla. out of 100 patients referred to us with 'filarial' lymphedema 14 displayed acute and five subacute symptoms of dla. all were on admission blood microfilariae negative but had a positive test in the past. blood bacterial isolates were found in nine cases, four acute (21%) and five subacute (26%). in 10 acute cases blood cultures were found negative. six blood isolates belonged to bacilli, four to cocci and one was sarcina. to identify the sites of origin of bacterial dissemination, swabs taken from the calf skin biopsy wounds and tissue  fluid, lymph and lymph node specimens were cultured. swabs from the calf skin biopsy wound contained isolates in nine (47%) cases. they were bacilli in nine, cocci in three, acinetobacter and erwinia in two cases. tissue fluid was collected from 10 patients and contained bacilli in four (40%) and staphylococci  in three (30%). lymph was drained in four patients and contained isolates in all  samples (100%). they were staphylococcus epidermis, xylosus and aureus, acinetobacter, bacillus subtilis and sarcina. three lymph nodes were biopsied and contained staphylococcus chromogenes, xylosus, enterococcus and bacillus cereus.  in six cases the same phenotypically defined species of bacteria were found in blood and limb tissues or fluids. in the 'control' group of patients with lymphedema without acute or subacute changes all blood cultures were negative. interestingly, swabs from biopsy wound of these patients contained isolates in 80%, tissue fluid in 68%, lymph in 70% and lymph nodes in 58% of cases. in healthy controls, tissue fluid did not contain bacteria, and lymph isolates were  found only in 12% of cases. this study demonstrates that patients with acute episodes of dla reveal bacteremia in a high percentage of cases. diversity of blood and tissue bacterial isolates in these patients points to a breakdown of the skin immune barrier in lymphedema and subsequently indiscriminate bacterial colonization of deep tissues and spread to an blood circulation.

TI  == formation and structure of mixed bacterial communities.
AB  == mixed bacterial communities are formed by unrelated bacteria on solid media. mixed bacterial communities on solid media are similar to "classical" colonies and are formed after the growth of a large number of unrelated bacteria simultaneously plated onto a limited area of agar. the morphology of the mixed bacterial communities was similar for different combinations of bacteria and did  not change when the bacteria were plated on different media. different bacterial  strains form zones of individual and mixed growth in the structure of mixed bacterial communities. the results of electron microscopic examination indicate that mixed bacterial communities are isolated from their external environment by  a surface film. the basic part of this film is formed by an elementary membrane.  the membrane of the surface film of mixed bacterial communities is a stable structure occupying a large surface area. the results of this investigation seem  to indicate the existence of a special type of co-operation between different species of bacteria. this type of co-operation may be very important in the regulation of interactions between different bacteria and between bacteria and the environment.

TI  == the smcl gene of listeria ivanovii encodes a sphingomyelinase c that mediates bacterial escape from the phagocytic vacuole.
AB  == the ruminant pathogen listeria ivanovii differs from listeria monocytogenes in that it causes strong, bizonal haemolysis and a characteristic shovel-shaped co-operative haemolytic ('camp-like') reaction with rhodococcus equi. we cloned the gene responsible for the differential haemolytic properties of l. ivanovii, smcl. it encodes a sphingomyelinase c (smase) highly similar (> 50% identity) to  the smases from staphylococcus aureus (beta-toxin), bacillus cereus and leptospira interrogans. smcl was transcribed monocistronically and was expressed  independently of prfa. low-stringency southern blots demonstrated that, within the genus listeria, smcl was present only in l. ivanovii. we constructed an smcl  knock-out mutant. its phenotype on blood agar was identical to that of l. monocytogenes (i.e. weak haemolysis and no shovel-shaped camp-like reaction with  r. equi ). this mutant was less virulent for mice, and its intracellular proliferation was impaired in the bovine epithelial-like cell line mdbk. the role of smcl in intracellular survival was investigated using an l. monocytogenes mutant lacking the membrane-damaging determinants hly, plca and plcb, being thus  unable to grow intracellularly. complementation of this mutant with smcl on a plasmid was sufficient to promote bacterial intracellular proliferation in mdbk cells. transmission electron microscopy showed that smcl mediates the disruption  of the phagocytic vacuole and the release of bacteria into the cytosol. therefore, l. ivanovii possesses a third phospholipase with membrane-damaging activity that, together with plca and plcb, may act in concert with the pore-forming toxin hly to mediate efficient escape from the vacuolar compartment. the 5' end of smcl is contiguous with the internalin locus i-inlfe, which is also specific to l. ivanovii and is required for full virulence in mice. thus, smcl forms part of a novel virulence gene cluster in listeria that is species specific.

TI  == pathogenesis of gram-positive bacterial endophthalmitis.
AB  == the severity of endophthalmitis has been associated generally with the virulence  of the offending pathogen. however, precisely what constitutes the virulence in intraocular infections remains ill defined. we therefore sought to identify the basis for virulence for three common ocular pathogens (bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus) in terms of intraocular growth  rates, bacterial localization patterns, and the contribution of cell walls and secreted products to the pathogenesis of endophthalmitis. rabbit eyes were injected intravitreally with (i) viable b. cereus, e. faecalis, or s. aureus, (ii) metabolically inactive b. cereus, e. faecalis, or s. aureus, (iii) sacculus  preparations from each strain, or (iv) culture fluid containing products secreted by each strain. eyes were assessed at various times following injection by slit lamp biomicroscopy, electroretinography (erg), bacterial and inflammatory cell enumeration, and histology. b. cereus endophthalmitis followed a more rapid and virulent course than e. faecalis or s. aureus endophthalmitis, eliminating retinal responsiveness, as measured by erg, by 12 h. analysis of bacterial localization revealed that b. cereus uniquely migrated rapidly from posterior to  anterior segment during infection. although injection of neither metabolically inactive bacteria nor cell wall sacculi greatly affected erg, significant intraocular inflammation was observed. injection of b. cereus or s. aureus culture fluids caused both significant reductions in retinal responsiveness and significant intraocular inflammation, paralleling that seen in natural infections. the results demonstrate that toxins, intraocular localization, and, to a lesser extent, the intraocular host response to cell walls all contribute to the pathogenesis of b. cereus, s. aureus, and e. faecalis endophthalmitis in a pathogen-specific manner. the key pathophysiologic differences in these intraocular diseases highlight opportunities for optimizing conventional therapies and deriving new ones.

AB  == a cdna encoding achacin, an antimicrobial glycoprotein from the body surface mucus of giant african snail achacina fulica ferussac, was expressed in a methylotrophic yeast, pichia pastoris, and recombinant achacin (rach) was secreted in yeast minimal medium in a polyglycosylated form with 80 kda. carbohydrate analysis revealed that the glycosylated moiety of rach was composed  of 50 mol mannose and 2 mol n-acetylglucosamine residues. antimicrobial activity  using escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus showed that the rach had a behavior similar to its native counterpart. the rach showed so wide an antimicrobial spectrum that 0.1 mg/ml rach inhibited the growth of pseudomonas fluorescens, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus faecalis in addition to e. coli and s. aureus, whereas it did not appreciably affect the growth of proteus mirabilis, bacillus cereus and micrococcus luteus. the rach was also effective in preventing growth of vibrio anguillarum and vibrio parahaemolyticus. the results suggested that the rach had great potential of using as an antimicrobial agent.

TI  == effect of "siljo" fermentation on growth of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus and listeria monocytogenes.
AB  == the fate of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and listeria monocytogenes in control gruel and fermenting "siljo" was assessed. s. aureus reached levels of 10(8) cfu/ml within 48 h in the control gruel. in fermenting "siljo" the count decreased all through the fermentation time. b.cereus was completely inhibited in fermenting "siljo" within 24 h, whereas it survived until 72 h in the control gruel. complete inhibition of l.monocytogenes was noted at 48 h in fermenting "siljo". l.monocytogenes survived until 96 h in control gruel. fermentation resulted in fall in ph to < 5.0 within 48-72 h and increase in titratable acidity was also noted. as "siljo" is usually consumed after 72 h of fermentation, "siljo" fermented for more than three days is safe from food intoxication caused  by b. cereus or s.aureus or infection from l.monocytogenes.

TI  == the role of the non-conserved residue at position 104 of class a beta-lactamases  in susceptibility to mechanism-based inhibitors.
AB  == the role of the non-conserved amino acid residue at position 104 of the class a beta-lactamases, which comprises a highly conserved sequence of amino acids at the active sites of these enzymes, in both the hydrolysis of beta-lactam substrates and inactivation by mechanism-based inhibitors was investigated. site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the penpc gene encoding the bacillus cereus 569/h beta-lactamase i to replace asp104 with the corresponding staphylococcus aureus pc1 residue ala104. kinetic data obtained with the purified asp104ala b. cereus 569/h beta-lactamase i was compared to that obtained from the wild-type b. cereus and s. aureus enzymes. replacement of amino acid residue 104  had little effect on the michaelis parameters for the hydrolysis of both s- and a-type penicillins. relative to wild-type enzyme, the asp104ala beta-lactamase i  had 2-fold higher km values for benzylpenicillin and methicillin, but negligible  difference in km for ampicillin and oxacillin. however, kcat values were also slightly increased resulting in little change in catalytic efficiency, kcat/km. in contrast, the asp104ala beta-lactamase i became more like the s. aureus enzyme in its response to the mechanism-based inhibitors clavulanic acid and 6-beta-(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)amido-penicillanic acid sulfone with respect to both response to the inhibitors and subsequent enzymatic properties. based on the known three-dimensional structures of the bacillus licheniformis 749/c, escherichia coli tem and s. aureus pc1 beta-lactamases, a model for the role of the non-conserved residue at position 104 in the process of inactivation by mechanism-based inhibitors is proposed.

TI  == uptake kinetics of nucleic acid targeting dyes in s. aureus, e. faecalis and b. cereus: a flow cytometric study.
AB  == for flow cytometry-based detection as well as susceptibility testing and counting, staining of the bacterial cells is essential. in an attempt to develop  rapid preparatory procedures for nucleic acid staining of wild type gram positive bacteria, the uptake of fluorescent dyes in viable s. aureus, e. faecalis, and b. cereus cells was studied by flow cytometry under conditions intended to block probe efflux and increase cell wall permeability. the aim of the study was to develop procedures which allow rapid nucleic acid staining independent of fixation, since ethanol fixation is time-consuming and may mask phenomena associated with viability and lead to uncontrolled loss and aggregation of cells. the dye uptake was measured repeatedly after treating cells with metabolic inhibitors in order to block probe efflux, or cold shock (0 degree c) to increase permeability. the probes used were mithramycin (mi), ethidium bromide (eb), dapi, hoechst 33342 and hoechst 33258. none of the procedures facilitated uptake of the dyes to a level similar to that obtained in fixed control cells in all of the species. after metabolic inhibition of b. cereus cells, dapi and hoechst fluorescence increased to a level similar to or above that found in fixed cells,  indicating that the uptake of these dyes is limited by energy-dependent efflux. a similar increase of dapi fluorescence was observed after cold shock suggesting the uptake of this dye to be limited also by permeability in b. cereus. the mi and eb fluorescence increased to the level of the fixed control cells under all conditions tested, suggesting free probe influx in this species. generally, probe uptake in s. aureus and e. faecalis was lower than in b. cereus cells, and no permeabilizing effect of cold shock was observed. in some experiments the fluorescence exceeded that of ethanol fixed control cells, indicating that the fixation may cause conformational changes in dna.

TI  == isolation and detection of listeria monocytogenes using fluorogenic and chromogenic substrates for phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase c.
AB  == the bcm listeria monocytogenes detection system (lmds) consists of a selective preenrichment broth (lmpeb), selective enrichment broth (lmseb), selective/differential plating medium (lmpm), and identification on a confirmatory plating medium (lmcm). the efficacy of the bcm lmds was determined using pure cultures and naturally and artificially contaminated environmental sponges. the bcm lmpeb allowed the growth of listeria and resuscitation of heat-injured l. monocytogenes. the bcm lmseb, which contains the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-myo-inositol-1-phosphate and detects phosphatidylinositol phospholipase c (pi-plc) activity, provided a presumptive positive test for the presence of pathogenic listeria (l. monocytogenes and l. ivanovii) after 24 h at 35 degrees c. an initial inoculum of 10 to 100 cfu/ml of  l. monocytogenes in bcm lmseb yielded a fluorogenic response after 24 h. on bcm lmpm, l. monocytogenes and l. ivanovii were the two listeria species forming turquoise convex colonies (1.0 to 2.5 mm in diameter) from pi-plc activity on the chromogenic substrate, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoxyl-myo-inositol-1-phosphate. l. monocytogenes was distinguished from l. ivanovii by either its fluorescence on bcm lmcm or acid production from rhamnose. false-positive organisms (bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus thuringiensis, and yeasts) were eliminated by at least one of the media in the bcm lmds. using a pure culture system, the bcm lmds detected one to two l. monocytogenes cells from a sponge rehydrated in 10 ml of de neutralizing broth. in an analysis of 162 environmental sponges from facilities inspected by the u.s. department of agriculture (usda), the values for identification of l. monocytogenes by bcm lmds and the usda method were 30 and 14 sites, respectively, with sensitivity and specificity values of 85.7 and 100.0% versus 40.0 and 66.1%, respectively. no false-positive organisms  were isolated by bcm lmds, whereas 26.5% of the sponges tested by the usda method produced false-positive results.

TI  == evaluation of accuracy and repeatability of identification of food-borne pathogens by automated bacterial identification systems.
AB  == the performances of five automated microbial identification systems, relative to  that of a reference identification system, for their ability to accurately and repeatedly identify six common food-borne pathogens were assessed. the systems assessed were the microlog system (biolog inc., hayward, calif.), the microbial identification system (mis; midi inc., newark, del.), the vitek system (biomerieux vitek, hazelwood, mo.), the microscan walkaway 40 system (dade-microscan international, west sacramento, calif.), and the replianalyzer system (oxoid inc., nepean, ontario, canada). the sensitivities and specificities of these systems for the identification of food-borne isolates of bacillus cereus, campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella spp., and verotoxigenic escherichia coli were determined with 40 reference positive isolates and 40 reference negative isolates for each pathogen. the sensitivities of these systems for the identification of these pathogens ranged from 42.5 to 100%, and the specificities of these systems for the identification of these pathogens ranged from 32.5 to 100%. some of the systems had difficulty correctly identifying the reference isolates when the results were compared to those from the reference identification tests. the sensitivity of mis for the identification of s. aureus, b. cereus, e. coli, and c. jejuni, for example, ranged from 47.5 to 72. 5%. the sensitivity of the microlog system for the identification of e. coli was 72.5%, and the sensitivity of the vitek system  for the identification of b. cereus was 42.5%. the specificities of four of the five systems for the identification of all of the species tested with the available databases were greater than or equal to 97.5%; the exception was mis for the identification of c. jejuni, which displayed a specificity of 32.5% when  it was tested with reference negative isolates including campylobacter coli and other campylobacter species. all systems had >80% sensitivities for the identification of salmonella species and listeria species at the genus level. the repeatability of these systems for the identification of test isolates ranged from 30 to 100%. not all systems included all six pathogens in their databases; thus, some species could not be tested with all systems. the choice of automated  microbial identification system for the identification of a food-borne pathogen would depend on the availability of identification libraries within the systems and the performance of the systems for the identification of the pathogen.

TI  == identification and semiquantitative estimation of antibiotics added to complete feeds, premixes, and concentrates.
AB  == classical microbiological methods for determining antimicrobial compounds in feeds are nonspecific. thus, there is a need to identify biological activity, and bioautography is used for this purpose. a routine method for detecting the following antimicrobial substances in feeds is described: avilamycin, avoparcin,  zn-bacitracin, erythromycin, flavomycin, furazolidone, lasalocid, monensin, narasin, penicillin, salinomycin, spiramycin, tetracyclines, tylosin, and virginiamycin. carbadox can be detected by uv light examination of the plates prior to bioautography. semiquantitative estimations of antibiotic content are compared with quantitative determinations of the above mentioned substances in feeds, except erythromycin, penicillin, and tetracyclines. detection limits range from 0.1 mg/kg (chlortetracycline) to 20 mg/kg (lasalocid). the method involves agar diffusion of buffered samples, a neutral extraction of polyether antibiotics followed by thin-layer chromatography (tlc), and an acid extraction for other antibiotics followed by tlc. five test bacteria were used for the main detection  by agar diffusion: micrococcus luteus atcc 9341, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538p, corynebacterium xerosis nctc 9755, bacillus cereus atcc 11778, and b. subtilis atcc 6633. identification after tlc was achieved by bioautography with the most sensitive microorganism(s). this method allows one laboratory technician to analyze up to 30 feed samples within 2.5 working days, provided that feeds of  the same category are analyzed in the same run, and that labels of additives are  available. qualitative and semiquantitative information are valuable when performing a quantitative antibiotic determination and it provides proof that the activity determined is due to the tested substance. this last feature is essential from the perspective of quality assurance of results.

TI  == in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam relative to other antibiotics against blood culture isolates.
AB  == resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is an increasing problem in many countries. accurate locally relevant information is essential for detection and control of emerging resistance and to facilitate choice of empirical antibiotic therapy in the immediate management of seriously ill patients. we have determined the minimum inhibitory concentration of piperacillin/tazobactam for 97 strains of bacteria (55 enterobacteriaceae, 13 non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli, 22 staphylococcus aureus, 6 enterococcus faecalis and 1 bacillus cereus) isolated from blood cultures and compared its activity to that of amoxycillin, co-amoxiclav, cephalothin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, piperacillin, cefotaxime. the strains were consecutive non-fastidious isolates with the following qualifications: coagulase negative staphylococci and diphtheroids were excluded and the number of staphylococcus aureus isolates was limited to 12 methicillin-resistant and 10 methicillin-sensitive strains. multiple isolates of the same species from individual patients were not included. the minimum inhibition concentrations of methicillin, penicillin, teichoplanin and vancomycin were also determined for specific groups of organisms. mics were determined by the etest method (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) on mueller hinton agar. the mics of appropriate american type culture collection control strains were determined. based on the interpretative criteria of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (usa), 87 per cent of gram-negative bacilli were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam compared with amoxycillin 26 per cent, cephalothin 35 per cent, co-amoxiclav 54 per cent, piperacillin 56 per cent, cefotaxime 69 per cent, ceftazidime 84 per cent, gentamicin 85 per cent and ciprofloxacin 91 per cent. of all isolates 75 per cent were sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam, compared with amoxycillin 22 per cent, cephalothin 35 per cent, piperacillin 41 per cent, co-amoxiclav 52 per cent, cefotaxime 59 per cent, ceftazidime 60 per cent, gentamicin 74 per cent and ciprofloxacin 77 per cent. two isolates (1 e. coli and 1 klebsiella pneumoniae) with antibiograms consistent with the relatively new resistance phenomenon of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production were identified. the spectrum of activity of piperacillin-tazobactam for empirical antibiotic therapy is significantly greater than that of piperacillin alone and is similar to that of ciprofloxacin and gentamicin.

TI  == amino-acid sequence and three-dimensional structure of the staphylococcus aureus  metalloproteinase at 1.72 a resolution.
AB  == background: aureolysin is an extracellular zinc-dependent metalloproteinase from  the pathogenic bacterium staphylococcus aureus. this enzyme exhibits in vitro activity against several molecules of biological significance for the host, indicating that it is involved in the pathology of staphylococcal diseases. results: here we report the amino-acid sequence and inhibitor-free x-ray crystal  structure of aureolysin, a member of the thermolysin family of zinc-dependent metalloproteinases. this enzyme, which binds one zinc and three calcium ions, comprises a single chain of 301 amino acids that consists of a beta-strand-rich upper domain and an alpha-helix-rich lower domain. conclusions: the overall structure of aureolysin is very similar to that of the other three members of this family whose structures are known - thermolysin (tln) from bacillus thermoproteolyticus, neutral protease (np) from bacillus cereus and elastase (pae) from pseudomonas aeruginosa. but an important difference has been encountered: in contrast to what has been observed in the other three members of  this family (tln, np and pae), inhibitor-free aureolysin displays a 'closed' active site cleft conformation. this new structure therefore raises questions about the universality of the hinge-bending motion model for the neutral metalloproteinases.

AB  == a new instrument, capable of detecting metabolic changes due to microbiological activity, is described. optical changes in growth media are monitored in a semi-fluid zone that separates the liquid medium containing the sample. data demonstrate that common media can be utilized in conjunction with this rapid automated technology. nutrient broth with the ph dye indicator. bromocresol purple was suitable for total counts. selective media containing dyes were utilized to assess the presence or absence of specific groups of organisms. biochemical reactions, such as lysine decarboxylase activity, were identified by  the unique generated patterns, and specific enzymatic cleavage reactions with chromogenic substrates, such as 5-bromo-4 chloro-3 indolyl-beta-d-glucuronic acid (x-gluc), were monitored.

TI  == a study of photobactericidal activity in the phenothiazinium series.
AB  == the photodynamic antibacterial properties of a closely related series of commercially available phenothiazinium dyes were tested against a range of pathogenic strains of gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus) and gram-negative organisms (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa). the photosensitisers were illuminated using a non-laser  light source at a fluence of 1.75 mw cm-2 and this resulted in the enhancement of antibacterial activity in liquid culture. in several cases, illumination resulted in considerable decreases in the minimum lethal concentrations required, giving up to 100-fold increases in bactericidal activity.

TI  == meat from dairy cows: possible microbiological hazards and risks.
AB  == the authors provide an overview of the circumstances associated with culling of dairy cattle in the united states of america (usa) and focus on the possible significant microbiological hazards associated with meat from cull dairy cows. cull dairy cows are an important source of food in the usa, accounting for at least approximately 17% of ground beef. the potential microbiological hazards for foodborne illness from cull dairy cows discussed here include salmonella (with special attention to s. typhimurium dt104), escherichia coli o157:h7, campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens and staphylococcus aureus. possible sources and means of contamination are pointed out, as are the potential foodborne risks from bacillus cereus and aeromonas spp. in conclusion, widespread microbiological studies are needed to determine the prevalence and risk of foodborne pathogens in cull dairy cattle.

TI  == comparative sensitivity of 13 species of pathogenic bacteria to seven chemical germicides.
AB  == background: the relative resistance of diverse human bacterial pathogens to commonly used germicidal agents has not been established. methods: we measured by titration the survival of thirteen different bacteria after exposure to glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, cupric ascorbate, sodium hypochlorite, or phenol. results: our comparative experiments allowed classification of the organisms' survival into four groups: (a) pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus showed the most resistance, (b)  clostridium perfringens, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus epidermidis, and  escherichia coli o157:h7 showed intermediate resistance, (c) listeria monocytogenes, shigella sonnei, and vibrio parahaemolyticus survived some treatments with chemical agents only in the presence of protecting protein (serum albumin), and (d) vibrio cholerae, vibrio vulnificus, bacillus cereus, and yersinia enterocolitica did not survive any of the treatments applied. conclusion: we found species that more frequently survived exposure to germicidal agents were also those most commonly reported in association with hospital infections. our findings suggest that resistance to disinfectants may be more important than pathogenicity in determining the relative prominence of an organism as an agent responsible for nosocomial infections.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of food-related penicillium sp. against pathogenic bacteria in laboratory media and a cheese model system.
AB  == food-related penicillium species (n = 34) and geotrichum candidum (n = 11) grown  on czapek dox and brie agar were tested for their ability to suppress growth of pathogenic bacteria. ten out of 13 p. camemberti showed antagonistic activity while the other species did not interact significantly with the bacterial growth. the order of inhibition was: gram-negative bacteria and bacillus cereus > listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus sp. > micrococcus sp. whereas lactobacillus sp., staphylococcus aureus and some micrococcus sp. were unaffected. when salmonella typhimurium was inoculated together with p. camemberti p25 in brie agar, bacterial growth was inhibited during the first 6 d of incubation whereafter growth started. the inhibition of l. monocytogenes was similar but less pronounced. the antimicrobial activity produced by p. camemberti p25 and l84 was enhanced with increasing amount of sucrose in the medium. the activity was increased at low ph and destroyed at ph above 8. it was detectable at 15 degrees  c but not at 37 degrees c indicating that volatile metabolites might be involved. no significant accumulation of organic acids and no secondary metabolites such as mycotoxins were detected. hsgc-ms analysis indicated that acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, 3-methylbutanal and 1-octen-3-ol were produced by p. camemberti during the period when inhibitory activity was observed. pure acetaldehyde and benzaldehyde were shown to be inhibitory to l. monocytogenes and salm. typhimurium when grown at 15 degrees c and ph 5.5 and 7.0.

TI  == bacterial viability and antibiotic susceptibility testing with sytox green nucleic acid stain.
AB  == a fluorescent nucleic acid stain that does not penetrate living cells was used to assess the integrity of the plasma membranes of bacteria. sytox green nucleic acid stain is an unsymmetrical cyanine dye with three positive charges that is completely excluded from live eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. binding of sytox  green stain to nucleic acids resulted in a > 500-fold enhancement in fluorescence emission (absorption and emission maxima at 502 and 523 nm, respectively), rendering bacteria with compromised plasma membranes brightly green fluorescent.  sytox green stain is readily excited by the 488-nm line of the argon ion laser. the fluorescence signal from membrane-compromised bacteria labeled with sytox green stain was typically > 10-fold brighter than that from intact organisms. bacterial suspensions labeled with sytox green stain emitted green fluorescence in proportion to the fraction of permeabilized cells in the population, which was quantified by microscopy, fluorometry, or flow cytometry. flow cytometric and fluorometric approaches were used to quantify the effect of beta-lactam antibiotics on the cell membrane integrity of escherichia coli. detection and discrimination of live and permeabilized cells labeled with sytox green stain by  flow cytometry were markedly improved over those by propidium iodide-based tests. these studies showed that bacterial labeling with sytox green stain is an effective alternative to conventional methods for measuring bacterial viability and antibiotic susceptibility.

TI  == rapid identification of bacterially contaminated platelets using reagent strips:  glucose and ph analysis as markers of bacterial metabolism.
AB  == background: one in every 1000 units of platelets is bacterially contaminated, which puts patients at risk for transfusion-associated sepsis and death. however, there is currently no screening test in place to detect contaminated units. the use of commercially available multiple-reagent urine dipsticks for this purpose was evaluated. study design and methods: platelet concentrates were inoculated with either sterile saline or suspensions of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus cereus, klebsiella pneumoniae, or serratia marcescens to a final concentration of 50 colony-forming units (cfu) per ml. the  platelets were analyzed daily by the use of multiple-reagent strips, quantitative culture, and glucometry. results: b cereus grew rapidly, reaching 10(7) cfu per ml 1 day after inoculation, while s. epidermidis grew slowly, achieving similar concentration 4 to 6 days after inoculation. two of 10 dipstick reagents, glucose and ph, proved useful in detecting bacteria. both were lower in bacterially contaminated units than in controls. glucose data obtained from automated analyzers validated the dipstick data. all organisms were detected at concentrations > or = 10(7) cfu per ml, and s. aureus and k. pneumoniae were detected in the range of 10(3) to 10(5) cfu per ml. conclusion: the multiple-reagent test used had a sensitivity and specificity of 95 percent (> or  = 10(7) cfu/ml) and 98 to 100 percent, respectively. these data indicate that urine dipsticks can be used to rapidly and inexpensively detect bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates, which potentially will reduce morbidity and mortality at minimal cost.

TI  == intracellular transport and processing of protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria.
AB  == bacterial toxins are associated with disease in humans and animals. toxins can either be preformed in food or produced by bacteria in the intestine. there are two types of toxins: heat-labile protein toxins and heat stabile toxins. heat labile toxins are produced by bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, and vibrio cholerae, and heat-stabile enterotoxins consisting of relatively few amino acids are produced by escherichia coli and acts by activation of guanylate cyclase. similarly, heat-stabile entero-toxins are also produced by staphylococcus aureus, a common cause of food poisoning in the united states, and yersenia enterocolitica. protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria  can intoxicate intestinal cells and can also be taken up from the gut and reach other cells in the body. for example the shiga-like toxins (vero-toxins) can intoxicate endothelial cells in the kidney and cause kidney failure. intracellular transport and processing of a few of the protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria, namely clostridium difficile toxin a and b, cholera toxin and the related heat-labile toxin produced by escherichia coli, and shiga toxin and shiga-like toxins are presented.

AB  == rabbits were treated with a single intravenous injection of various antibiotics.  more than 40 per cent of the animals showed diarrhea after being treated with sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefmetazole, clindamycin, piperacillin or aspoxicillin. clostridium difficile was isolated from sulbactam/cefoperazone-treated diarrheic  rabbits, with their cecal contents showing positive reaction in a latex agglutination test for c. difficile enterotoxin. however, 27 cefmetazole-induced  diarrheic cases were not associated with c. difficile. other enteropathogenic bacteria, such as campylobacter spp., bacillus cereus, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, coagulase positive staphylococcus aureus, salmonella spp., vibrio spp., clostridium perfringens and clostridium spiroforme, were not isolated from either of diarrheic rabbit. however, the counts of clostridia remarkably increased in the intestine of cefmetazole-associated diarrheic rabbits. this was ascribed to the overgrowth of clostridium innocuum and clostridium sporogenes. there were no remarkable differences in changes in other  bacterial population between diarrheic and non-diarrheic rabbits.

TI  == evaluation of swirling, ph, and glucose tests for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: although infrequent, episodes of transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis may lead to serious outcomes or death and therefore are of concern. this study evaluates the sensitivity of three surrogate tests for the presence of bacteria in platelet concentrates: cessation of swirling, low extracellular ph, and low plasma glucose levels. study design and methods: day 0 platelet concentrates were inoculated with low levels of one of seven bacterial strains and stored with agitation at 20 to 24 degrees c for up to 5 days. in the morning  and afternoon of each day of storage, bacterial levels were ascertained by quantitative plate culture, and platelet concentrates were tested for platelet ph, plasma glucose, and swirling. quantitative and semiquantitative dipstick techniques were used to determine ph and glucose levels. results: platelet concentrates had attained stationary phase growth of streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus mitis, or staphylococcus epidermidis (> or = 10(7) -10(8) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml) before either the swirling or dipstick methods suggested the presence of bacteria. the sensitivity of swirling and glucose tests for detecting bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates was generally comparable. although the sensitivity of the ph test was generally similar to that of swirling and glucose tests for most bacteria, platelet concentrates contaminated with e. cloacae had normal ph despite the presence of high levels of bacteria (> or = 10(7)-10(8) cfu/ml). conclusion: the sensitivity in detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates by the swirling technique or by measuring extracellular ph or plasma glucose is less than the sensitivity reported for microscopy with gram stain (10(5)-10(6) cfu/ml), fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange stain (10(4)-10(5) cfu/ml), chemiluminescence detection of ribosomal rna (10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml), and automated bacterial culture (1 cfu/sample volume).

TI  == comparison of the beta-toxins from staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus intermedius.
AB  == the beta-toxins produced by staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus intermedius  were purified to homogeneity from culture supernatants. although the toxin from s. aureus has been throughly studied, less is known about its unique counterpart  from s. intermedius. this is the first reported purification and analysis of the  s. intermedius beta-toxin. both toxins have similar enzymatic properties, belong  to the class of neutral sphingomyelinases c, and have a high specificity for sphingomyelin. they also hydrolyze lysophosphatidylcholine at a much slower rate, but have no activity toward phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, or phosphatidylserine. the kinetic parameters determined for both proteins (apparent km 1.4 mm, vmax 100 mmol/min/microg protein) are identical. despite these similarities, the size and amino acid composition of the two beta-toxins differ.  molecular mass values, determined by electrophoresis and gel filtration, indicate that the both enzymes are single polypeptides. the decrease in sphingomyelinase activity of s. aureus beta-toxin upon pretreatment with dithiothreitol (dtt) indicates the presence of a disulfide bond in the protein. in contrast, dtt has no effect on the enzymatic activity of s. intermedius beta-toxin. this observation is consistent with the absence of detectable cysteine residue in the  protein. n-terminal amino acid sequences determined for the first 19 residues of  both beta-toxins also differ, only nine of the first 19 residues are identical. further evidence that the two proteins differ was obtained by immunological analysis which demonstrated crossreactivity but a lack of identity.

AB  == ajoene, a garlic-derived sulfur-containing compound that prevents platelet aggregation, exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. growth of gram-positive bacteria, such as bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, mycobacterium smegmatis, and streptomyces griseus, was inhibited at 5 micrograms of ajoene per  ml. staphylococcus aureus and lactobacillus plantarum also were inhibited below 20 micrograms of ajoene per ml. for gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and xanthomonas maltophilia, mics were between 100 and 160 micrograms/ml. ajoene also inhibited yeast growth at concentrations below 20 micrograms/ml. the microbicidal effect of ajoene on growing cells was observed at slightly higher concentrations than the corresponding mics. b. cereus and saccharomyces cerevisiae were killed at 30 micrograms of ajoene per ml after 24 h of cultivation when cultivation was started at 10(5) cells per ml. however, the minimal microbicidal concentrations for resting cells were at 10 to 100 times higher concentrations than the corresponding mics. the disulfide bond in ajoene appears to be necessary for the antimicrobial activity of ajoene, since reduction by cysteine, which reacts with disulfide bonds, abolished its antimicrobial activity.

TI  == selective killing of human monocytes and cytokine release provoked by sphingomyelinase (beta-toxin) of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the best-known activity of staphylococcus aureus sphingomyelinase c, alias beta-toxin, is as a hemolysin that provokes hot-cold lysis of erythrocytes which  contain substantial amounts of sphingomyelin in the plasma membrane. sheep erythrocytes are most susceptible, and we found that one hemolytic unit, representing the toxin concentration that elicits 50% hemolysis of 2.5 x 10(8) erythrocytes per ml, corresponds to 0.05 enzyme units or to approximately 0.25 microg of sphingomyelinase per ml. the cytotoxic action of beta-toxin on nucleated cells has not been described in any detail before, and the present investigation was undertaken to fill this information gap. we now identify beta-toxin as a remarkably potent monocytocidal agent. at a concentration of 0.001 u/ml, corresponding to approximately 5 ng/ml, beta-toxin killed over 50% of human monocytes (10(6) cells per ml) within 60 min. by contrast, 1 to 5 microg of beta-toxin per ml had no cytocidal effects on human granulocytes, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, or erythrocytes. a selective monocytocidal action was also observed  with sphingomyelinase c from bacillus cereus and a streptomyces sp., whereas phospholipase a2 and phospholipase d at 100 u/ml were without effect. monocytes succumbing to the action of beta-toxin processed and released interleukin-1beta,  soluble interleukin-6 receptor, and soluble cd14 into the supernatant. thus, monocyte killing by beta-toxin is associated with cytokine-related events that are important for the initiation and progression of infectious disease. these findings uncover a potentially important role for sphingomyelinase as a determinant of microbial pathogenicity.

TI  == beta-secondary and solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effects on beta-lactamase catalysis.
AB  == beta-secondary and solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effects have been determined for the steady-state kinetic parameters v/k and v for turnover of a depsipeptide  substrate, m-[[(phenylacetyl)glycyl]-oxy]benzoic acid, and of a beta-lactam substrate, penicillanic acid, by three typical class a beta-lactamases and a class c beta-lactamase. the isotope effects on alkaline hydrolysis of these substrates have been used as a frame of reference. the effect of the transition state conformation of the substrates in determining the beta-secondary isotope effects has been explicitly considered. the inverse beta-secondary isotope effects on both v/k and v for the class a enzymes with both substrates indicate transition states where the carbonyl group of the scissile bond has become tetrahedral and therefore reflect typical acyl-transfer transition states. the solvent isotope effects indicate that enzyme deacylation (as reflected in v for the staphylococcus aureus pc1 beta-lactamase) may be a classical general-base-catalyzed hydrolysis but that there is little proton motion in the enzyme acylation transition state (as revealed by v/k) for the tem beta-lactamase and bacillus cereus beta-lactamase i. these results provide kinetic support for the conjecture made on structural grounds that class a beta-lactamases employ an  asymmetric double-displacement mechanism. the isotope effects on v/k for the class c beta-lactamase of enterobacter cloacae p99 suggest an acyl-transfer transition state for the penicillin, although, as for the class a enzymes, without significant proton motion. on the other hand, the v/k transition state for depsipeptide does not seem to involve covalent chemistry. suggestive of this  conclusion are the measured beta-secondary isotope effect of 1,002 +/- 0.012 and  the inverse solvent isotope effect. these results provide an example of a significant difference between the kinetics of turnover of a beta-lactam and a depsipeptide by a beta-lactamase. the v transition state for both substrates with the p99 beta-lactamase probably involves acyl-transfer (deacylation) where the conformation of the acyl-enzyme is closely restricted. the conformations of acyl-enzymes of the pc1 and p99 beta-lactamases correlate to the (different) dispositions of general base catalysts at their active sites.

AB  == dmg-dmdot (cl-331,002 or cl-331,928) and dmg-mino (cl-329,998 or cl-344,677) are  two new semisynthetic tetracyclines called glycylcyclines, with a broad spectrum  of activity and includes enterobacteriaceae, gram-positive cocci, jk diphtheroids, and bacillus cereus. potent activity was demonstrated against all streptococcus spp. strains [minimum inhibitory concentrations] (mic90s) 0.06-0.25 micrograms/ml) and staphylococci (oxacillin susceptible ans resistant; mic90s 0.12-2 micrograms/ml). both glycylcyclines (mic90, 0.06 micrograms/ml) were more  potent than minocycline (mic90 8 micrograms/ml) against enterococcus faecium, many of which were vancomycin resistant (116 strains). organisms with minocycline mics at > or = 8 micrograms/ml (staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and pneumococci) had glycylcycline mic results ranging from 0.06 to 0.5 micrograms/ml (e.g., apparent use against existing tetracycline-resistance phenotypes). drugs in this class appear promising for therapy of infections caused by gram-positive species now testing resistant to contemporary antimicrobial agents, and further development of compounds in this class is encouraged.

TI  == characteristics of streptomyces strains isolated from soils in two landfill areas in north jordan.
AB  == a total of 114 streptomyces strains were isolated and purified from soils collected from al akider (53) and from al kafeer (61) landfill areas in north jordan. the al akider strains were classified into 5 colour series gray (27), white (18), yellow (3), violet (3) and green (2); while the al kafeer strains were classified into 6 colour series white (26), gray (16), yellow (9), red (2),  green (7) and blue (1). melanin pigment was produced by 21 and 25% of the al akider and al kafeer strains, respectively, while soluble pigment was produced by 15% of the a; akider and 21% of the al kafeer strains; 17% of al akider strains and 23% of al kafeer strains showed distinctive reverse side pigment. forty, 32,  19, and 9% of the al akider strains had spiral, rectus, flexous and retinaculum apertum spore-chains, respectively, while the distribution of the al kafeer strains in the same spore-chain forms was equally 25% each. arabinose, xylose, inositol, fructose, rhamnose, sucrose, raffinose, and mannitol were utilized by 91, 53, 89, 60, 30, 25 and 79% of the al akider strains and by 84, 59, 62, 64, 70, 75, 41 and 26% of the al kafeer strains, respectively, while only 2% of the al kafeer strains were found to utilize cellulose. thirty-six percent of the al akider strains showed, in vitro activity against staphylococcus aureus followed by aspergillus niger (26%), bacillus cereus and saccharomyces cerevisiae (25% each), fusarium monilliforme (21%), candida albicans (15%), escherichia coli (8%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%), while 51, 49, 46, 34, 25, 15, 7 and 2% of the al kafeer strains exhibited activity against a. niger, s. cerevisiae, b. cereus, s.  aureus, f. monilliforme, c. albicans, p. aeruginosa and e. coli, respectively.

TI  == probes and polymerase chain reaction for detection of food-borne bacterial pathogens.
AB  == dna-hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) are techniques commonly used to detect pathogenic bacteria. in this paper, the use of these techniques for detection of salmonella, e. coli, v. cholerae, non-o1 vibrio, yersinia enterocolitica, campylobacter, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and c. botulinum is reviewed with emphasis on application in food microbiology. in food control, dna-techniques have most often been used in a 'culture confirmation' fashion, i.e. bacteria are  enriched and sometimes even purified by traditional culture procedures and thereafter identified by the use of dna-based methods. the most desirable approach is, however, to detect organisms directly in the food, but major problems remain to be solved before this can be routinely performed.

(c) gram-negative bacilli: escherichia coli(2), klebsiella pneumoniae(1) and proteus mirabilis(2). the specimens from healthy controls yielded similar organisms. these were (a) gram-positive cocci: staphylococcus albus(2), staphylococcus aureus(2) and micrococci(2); (b) gram-positive bacilli: corynebacterium xerosis(1), bacillus subtilis(2), corynebacterium hofmanni(1) and bacillus cereus(1); (c) gram-negative bacilli: escherichia coli(3), proteus vulgaris(1) and proteus mirabilis(1). while these results show no significant differences in the species types of non-mycobacterial aerobic organisms isolated from healthy skin and pb/mb types of leprosy, these isolates need to be characterized by immunological/molecular methods to find out  subtypes if any.

TI  == postmortem drug metabolism by bacteria.
AB  == studies were undertaken to determine the possible role of enteric bacteria in the postmortem bioconversion of the nitrobenzodiazepines flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and nitrazepam. flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and nitrazepam were completely metabolized in blood in the presence of eight species of enteric bacteria to their respective 7-amino-metabolites. the rates of metabolism, at 37 degrees c, ranged from 0.1 ng/ml/min for streptococcus faecalis to 8.8 ng/ml/min for clostridium perfringens. the rate of conversion was reduced to 87% by a combination of 0.7% (w/v) sodium fluoride and potassium oxalate, and almost completely inhibited (96%) by 1% (w/v) sodium fluoride. ph had variable effects on the rate of metabolic bioconversion of nitrobenzodiazepines, while increasing  temperatures were found to generally increase the rate of nitrobenzodiazepine bioconversion. these data support the proposal that bacteria may mediate postmortem bioconversion of the nitrobenzodiazepines.

TI  == rho-adp-ribosylating exoenzyme from bacillus cereus. purification, characterization, and identification of the nad-binding site.
AB  == the adp-ribosyltransferase produced by a pathogenic strain of bacillus cereus was purified to near homogeneity. the transferase is a 28,000 da molecular mass enzyme with a pi of 10.3. the specific enzyme activity is 7.0 nmol of adp-ribose  min-1 mg-1 with a km for nad of 0.3 microm. partial amino acid sequence analysis  of the exoenzyme reveals no significant homology to clostridium botulinum c3 nor  to clostridium limosum exoenzyme. the novel exoenzyme selectively modifies the small gtp-binding proteins of the rho family presumably at the same acceptor amino acid (asn-41) as determined for c3. besides cellular rho, recombinant rhoa  and -b are substrates for the exoenzyme. however, recombinant rac1 and cdc42, although belonging to the rho family, are not modified. b. cereus exoenzyme was photolabeled with [carbonyl-14c]nad resulting in inhibition of adp-ribosyltransferase and nad-glycohydrolase activity. a glutamic acid residue was identified as part of the nad-binding site which corresponds to glu-174 of c3. this glutamic acid is located in a domain which shows high homology with the  c-terminal part of c3 exoenzyme, c. limosum exoenzyme, and staphylococcus aureus  edin and which probably represents the catalytic site of the transferases. the data indicate that b. cereus exoenzyme is a novel member of the family of c3-like adp-ribosyltransferases which share the same substrate protein rho and which have an identical highly conserved catalytic domain.

TI  == isolation, and virulence profiles, of aeromonas hydrophila implicated in an outbreak of food poisoning in sweden.
AB  == a case of food poisoning outbreak involving aeromonas hydrophila is reported in this study. a group of 27 people consumed a typical swedish food "landgang" which is a type of smorgasbord containing shrimps with mayonnaise, liver pate, ham, sausage, and legume salad which was purchased from a food store. twenty-two of the 27 persons became ill within 20-34 hr of consumption of the food and reported the symptoms ranging from severe acute diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, fever  and vomiting. one person also fainted. the symptoms lasted for a couple of days.  of the remaining 5 healthy persons who consumed the left-over food the next day,  2 became ill with similar symptoms. the bacteriological examination of left-over  food samples resulted in the isolation of a. hydrophila from shrimps with mayonnaise, smoked sausage, liver pate and boiled ham. the total number of a. hydrophila in these foods were log 10(6) to log > 10(7) organisms per gram of food sample. a. hydrophila was however, not isolated from legume/mayonnaise salad samples. all the food samples tested showed low numbers of other expected food contaminating organisms such as coliforms at 37 c and 44 c, fecal streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, fungi and yeast etc., while bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and salmonella spp. were not detected in the food samples. investigations of the virulence profiles of the a. hydrophila isolates showed their capacity to produce beta-hemolysin, cytotoxins, cytotonic toxins, enterotoxins, and adhesion to and invasion of human intestinal (henle 407) cells  in culture.

TI  == platelet bacterial contamination and the use of a chemiluminescence-linked universal bacterial ribosomal rna gene probe.
AB  == background: currently, the maximum outdate for platelets is 5 days, because of the increasing chance of bacterial growth over time. various methods for rapid detection of bacterial contamination of blood components have been described, with mixed results and no general acceptance. a recently described, molecular biologic approach for the detection of bacterial contamination involves a chemiluminescence-linked universal dna bacterial probe to a highly conserved bacterial region of ribosomal rna (rrna). study design and methods: a multicenter trial of a chemiluminescence-linked universal bacterial rrna probe for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates is described. at each of five sites, platelet concentrates (no older than 1 day from date of phlebotomy) were inoculated in triplicate with isolates of four bacterial species (pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus aureus) to a final concentration of 10 to 50 colony-forming units  (cfus) per ml and in triplicate to a final concentration of 1000 cfus per ml. at  one site, an additional 6 platelet concentrates were inoculated with sterile saline to serve as controls. inoculated units were then subjected periodically to quantitative cultures and probe analyses. a total of 126 platelet concentrates were studied over a period of 7 days (120 inoculated with bacteria and 6 with sterile saline). results: this assay was, in some cases, able to detect s. aureus bacterial contamination in the range of 100 to 1000 cfus per ml; the majority of  samples (b. cereus, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, and s. epidermidis) with contamination exceeding 10(4) cfus per ml; and all samples with contamination of  2.1 x 10(5) cfus per ml or greater. increasing the sample size from the recommended 0.4 ml to 1.0 ml resulted in an unacceptable loss of specificity (83.3%). conclusion: the routine use of this assay would be expected to result in a decreased risk of septic platelet transfusion reactions and could lead to a lengthening of the current 5 day storage period for platelets. further, the pooling of random-donor platelet concentrates before storage instead of immediately before transfusion may be possible if this rrna probe is employed to  detect bacteria in the pool.

TI  == modes of inhibition of foodborne non-salmonella bacteria by selenite cystine selective broth.
AB  == various cell densities of six common foodborne non-salmonella bacteria were exposed to selenite cystine (sc) salmonella selective medium. the insensitivity of pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris to sc was confirmed. selenite cystine selective medium was effective against the sensitive bacteria up to certain cell densities, beyond which the bacteria survived. as judged from the minimum cell number required for survival in sc, staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive to sc, followed by bacillus cereus, escherichia coli and citrobacter freundii. when sensitive bacteria were grown in sc, they enriched resistant variants which exhibited no or reduced sensitivity to sc. the change in density of sensitive cells after exposure to sc suggested that bacterial sensitivity to sc depended on the efficiency of killing and growth inhibition by  sc as well as the fraction of resistant variants in the bacterial population. since salmonella samples generally contain unknown numbers and types of sensitive bacteria, it is difficult to predict the effectiveness of their selective inhibition by sc.

AB  == staphylococcus aureus secretes a phosphatidylinositol (pi)-specific phospholipase c (pi-plc) which is able to hydrolyze the membrane lipid pi and membrane protein  anchors containing glycosyl-pi. the gene for pi-plc (plc) was cloned from s. aureus into escherichia coli. oligonucleotide probes based on partial protein sequence and polyclonal antibodies raised against the purified protein were used  to identify positive clones. e. coli transformed with a plasmid containing the plc gene expressed pi-plc enzyme activity which was abolished by mutagenesis with a tetracycline resistance gene. the plc gene was present in all 15 s. aureus strains examined but not in any of 6 coagulase-negative staphylococcal species. the plc gene contained 984 bp and coded for a mature protein with a calculated molecular mass of 34,107 da. amino acid sequence comparisons indicated that the staphylococcal plc gene was similar (51 to 56%) to the pi-plcs from bacillus cereus, bacillus thuringiensis, and listeria monocytogenes. the recombinant pi-plc expressed in e. coli was purified and exhibited biochemical properties identical to those of the native pi-plc from s. aureus. pi-plc production was decreased in agr mutant strains of s. aureus. however, pi-plc production by both  agr+ and agr mutant strains exhibited a similar dependence on the type of medium  used. these data suggested that pi-plc production was regulated by both agr-dependent and agr-independent mechanisms.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of neutralized extracellular culture filtrates of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a cultured indian milk product ('dahi').
AB  == neutralized extracellular culture filtrate obtained from isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbruecki ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus salivarius and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis from 'dahi' showed weak to moderate inhibition of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, bacillus brevis, bacillus circulans, bacillus coagulans, bacillus laterosporus, bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa when tested by the diffusion agar well assay method. the effective minimum quantity of lactic culture filtrates required to obtain complete inhibition of an inoculum of 10(3)  cfu/ml of the bacteria tested was between 20 and 26% (vol/vol), as determined by  the agar incorporation method. neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of these lactic cultures added at a level of 10% in sterile, 10% reconstituted non-fat dry milk was able to either suppress or retard growth of selected bacterial cultures when incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. this study indicated  the antimicrobial activity of dahi and the potential of using neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of lactic acid bacteria in the biopreservation of  foods.

TI  == a prospective microbiologic surveillance program to detect and prevent the transfusion of bacterially contaminated platelets.
AB  == after two patients received bacterially contaminated platelet transfusions, a prospective surveillance program was instituted to perform gram staining and microbiologic culturing of platelets at the time of transfusion. in 12 months, 3141 random-donor platelet pools (prepared from 14,481 units) and 2476 single-donor apheresis units were cultured. all single-donor apheresis units were sterile, but 6 (0.19%) of the random-donor pools were found to be bacterially contaminated, with 1 unit of 5 in the pool being the source in each case. contaminants were staphylococcus epidermidis (4 cases), bacillus cereus (1), and  staphylococcus aureus (1) at counts of 0.5 x 10(2) to 10(11) colony-forming units per ml in platelet pools and 10(3) to 10(13) colony-forming units per ml in source units. the contamination rate for units transfused at < or = 4 days (1.8/10,000) was significantly lower than that at 5 days (11.9/10,000; p < 0.05), as was the magnitude of contamination (p < 0.05). use of the pretransfusion gram  stain on 4- and 5-day-old platelet pools was 100 percent sensitive (4/4 true positives) and 99.93 percent specific (1 false positive) in detecting contaminated pools. these data define the extent and magnitude of platelet bacterial contamination and demonstrate the efficacy of the pretransfusion gram stain on platelet units stored for 4 and 5 days in preventing the transfusion of  heavily contaminated units. it is concluded that the risk of platelet contamination is related to the duration of component storage.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == detection, identification and characterization of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria from retail food products.
AB  == forty bacteriocin-producing (bac+) lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from  food samples purchased from retail supermarkets and local farms. of the 40 bac+ isolates, 18 were isolated from 85 food samples by enrichment (21% isolation rate) whereas eight were obtained from 63 samples by direct plating (13% isolation rate). by direct plating, bac+ lab were detected at levels up to 2.4 x  10(5) cfu/g in ready-to-eat meats. the bac+ isolates were identified by carbohydrate fermentation patterns, sds-page protein patterns, and other biochemical characteristics; sds-page proved invaluable in identifying strains that could not be identified by other means. differential inhibitory spectra against indicator microorganisms assisted in the identification of 19 unique bac+ isolates. bac+ lab included enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus curvatus, lb. delbrueckii, lb. plantarum, lactococcus lactis, and pediococcus acidilactici. lb. curvatus (four strains) and lc. lactis (nine strains) were the only isolates inhibitory to foodborne pathogens including listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and staphylococcus aureus. some lc. lactis isolates inhibited as many as nine gram-positive genera. lb. curvatus fs47 and fs65 grew to high cell densities and produced bacteriocin at 6 degrees c; however, lc. lactis fs56 produced greater levels of bacteriocin at lower cell densities. the high incidence of bac+ lab detected in retail foods indicates that the public is consuming a wide variety of bac+ lab that occur as natural contaminants. these data suggest a greater role for bacteriocins as biopreservatives in food.

AB  == extracts of nine mosses, collected in switzerland, were screened for antimicrobial, antioxidative, and 15-lipoxygenase (15-lpo) inhibitory activities. the ch2cl2 extract of dicranum scoparium was found to possess pronounced antimicrobial activity against bacillus cereus, bacillus stearothermophilus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. in addition, inhibition of soybean 15-lpo occurred at very low concentration. phytochemical investigation of this extract afforded z,z,z-octadeca-6-yne-9,12,15-trienoic acid [1] by a combination of chromatographic techniques. this compound, named dicranin [1], was found to be responsible for most of the biological activity. the strongest antimicrobial effect was observed against streptococcus faecalis (disc  diffusion assay). in contrast to the ch2cl2 extract of d. scoparium, dicranin was inactive against e. coli. dicranin was identified by ir, ms, and nmr spectroscopy. a 2d inadequate experiment confirmed the structure and yielded the  assignment of all 13c-nmr signals.

TI  == effect of low-dose irradiation on growth of and toxin production by staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus in roast beef and gravy.
AB  == the effect of irradiation (2 kgy) on growth of and toxin production by staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus in roast beef and gravy during storage  at abuse temperatures (15 and 22 degrees c) was assessed by inoculation studies.  irradiation resulted in a 3-4 log10 reduction in numbers of both pathogens. whenever b. cereus and s. aureus numbers reached 10(6) and 10(7) cfu/g, respectively, during storage their toxins were detectable. as the time taken to attain these levels was longer in irradiated than in unirradiated samples, toxin  production by both pathogens was delayed by irradiation. when samples initially containing low levels (10(2)/g) of s. aureus were irradiated no toxin was produced during subsequent storage at 15 or 22 degrees c. diarrhoeal toxin produced by b. cereus was detected after 2 days at 22 degrees c, but not at 15 degrees c, in samples containing 10(2) cells/g prior to irradiation. when higher  numbers (10(6)/g) of either pathogen were present prior to irradiation, toxins were produced by both pathogens at 22 degrees c, but not at 15 degrees c. microbial competition had an effect on the growth of b. cereus and s. aureus after irradiation when a low initial inoculum was applied. however, when a higher inoculum was used the pathogens outnumbered their competitors and competition effects were less important. it was concluded that low-dose irradiation would improve the microbiological safety of roast beef and gravy.

TI  == a surface antigen of giardia lamblia with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor.
AB  == since giardia lamblia trophozoites are exposed to high concentrations of fatty acids in their human small intestinal milieu, we determined the pattern of incorporation of [3h]palmitic acid and myristic acid into g. lamblia proteins. the pattern of fatty acylation was unusually simple since greater than 90% of the giardia protein biosynthetically labeled with either [3h]palmitate or myristate migrated at approximately 49 kda (gp49) in reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis during both growth and differentiation. gp49, which partitions into the triton x-114 detergent phase, is localized on the cell surface since it is 125i-surface-labeled. gp49 was also biosynthetically labeled with [14c]ethanolamine and [3h]myoinositol, suggesting that it has a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi) anchor. moreover, phospholipase  a2 (pla2) or mild alkaline treatment released free fatty acids, indicating a diacylglycerol moiety with ester linkages. finally, a 3h- and 14c-labeled species was released by nitrous acid deamination from [14c]palmitate- and [3h]myoinositol-labeled gp49. the gpi anchor of gp49 is unusual, however, because purified gp49 was cleaved by bacillus cereus phosphatidylinositol (pi)-specific plc, but not by staphylococcus aureus pi-plc, or plasma pld, and did not react with antibody against the variant surface glycoprotein cross-reactive determinant. moreover, the double-labeled deaminated gp49 anchor migrated faster  than authentic pi in tlc and produced [3h]glycerophosphoinositol after deacylation. in contrast to the variable cysteine-rich g. lamblia surface antigens described previously, gp49 was identified in western blots of every isolate tested, as well as in subclones of a single isolate which differ in expression of a major cysteine-rich 85/66-kda surface antigen, which does not appear to be gpi-anchored. these observations suggest that gp49, the first common surface antigen to be described in g. lamblia, may play an important role in the  interaction of this parasite with its environment.

TI  == phosphonate monoester inhibitors of class a beta-lactamases.
AB  == phosphonate monoesters with the general structure: [formula: see text] are inhibitors of representative class a and class c beta-lactamases. this result extends the range of this type of inhibitor to the class a enzymes. compounds where x is an electron-withdrawing substituent are better inhibitors than the unsubstituted analogue (x = h), and enzyme inhibition is concerted with stoichiometric release of the substituted phenol. slow turnover of the phosphonates also occurs. these observations support the proposition that the mechanism of action of these inhibitors involves phosphorylation of the beta-lactamase active site. the inhibitory ability of these phosphonates suggests that the beta-lactamase active site is very effective at stabilizing negatively charged transition states. one of the compounds described also inactivated the streptomyces r61 d-alanyl-d-alanine carboxypeptidase/transpeptidase.

AB  == pork slurries inoculated with various test microorganisms were prepared and subjected to high hydrostatic pressure at 1000 to 6000 atm for 10 min at 25 degrees c to examine for the pressure effects on characteristics of the slurries  and the inactivation of the microorganisms associated with meat and meat products. pressure treatment at higher than 3000 atm caused coagulation and discoloration of the pork slurries. harder and more white coagulants were obtained by increasing the pressure. pressure treatment at 3000 to 6000 atm killed all the microorganisms tested by more than 6-log colony-forming units (cfu)/g except bacillus cereus spores. gram-negative microorganisms were more labile to pressure than gram-positive ones. campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica were inactivated at pressures higher than 3000 atm; escherichia coli, saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida utilis at pressures higher than 4000 atm; micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis at 6000 atm. only less than one-log cfu/g of b. cereus spores were inactivated at 6000 atm. ultraviolet absorption spectra and acridine orange staining suggested that e. coli became permeable and leaked cytoplasmic rna at lower pressure than s. aureus. from the present findings, the authors propose high hydrostatic pressure treatment as a promising means of preparing wholesome meat and meat products.

TI  == rapid methods for differentiating gram-positive from gram-negative aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == different tests based on lysis by koh and on reaction with fluorogenic and chromogenic substrates, l-alanine-4-nitroanilide (lana); l-alanine-4-methoxy- beta-naphthylamide (mna); 4-alanine-2-amidoacridone (aaa); l-alanine-7-amido- 4-methylcoumarin (aamc); 8-anilino-1-naphthalene-sulphonic acid (ans) were compared for their suitability to distinguish gram-positive from gram-negative bacteria. a concentration of 100 micrograms/ml was chosen for incorporating lana, aaa, aamc and ans into the growth medium, based on sensitivity tests. mna did not show any detectable reaction over a concentration range from 50 to 200 micrograms/ml, and led to inhibition of all bacteria at 200 micrograms/ml. in the examination of a total of 146 bacterial strains, including yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, and b. subtilis the koh test was not comparable  with the gram staining. a good correlation with gram staining was found between lana, aaa and aamc added to plate count agar on one hand, and lana and aamc impregnated paper strips on the other hand, thereby utilizing the aminopeptidase  activity. agar containing ans showed detectable fluorescence with all gram-negative strains, but with staphylococcus aureus and staph. epidermidis a weak reaction was also observed. aamc was selected for a rapid paper strip test.  with this substrate a pronounced blue fluorescence was obtained with gram-negative colonies.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ly264826, a novel glycopeptide antibiotic produced by amycolatopsis orientalis, was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and oxacillin against 311 gram-positive clinical isolates from patients with cancer,  ly264826 had lower mics for 90% of isolates (mic90) than vancomycin for all species tested. it was active against oxacillin-resistant isolates including staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), staphylococcus haemolyticus (mic90, 2.0 micrograms/ml), enterococcus spp. (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), bacillus cereus (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml), and corynebacterium jeikeium (mic90, 0.12 micrograms/ml). for s. aureus, including oxacillin-resistant isolates, the mics of ly264826 were similar to those of teicoplanin. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, however, ly264826 had mics that were 4- to 32-fold lower than those of teicoplanin. against most streptococcal species the activities of ly264826 and teicoplanin were similar. bactericidal activity against staphylococcus spp. and most streptococcus pyogenes isolates was less than or equal to 1 dilution of the mic. one isolate of s. pyogenes and all enterococcus faecalis strains tested were tolerant of ly264826, with mbcs greater than or equal to 32-fold greater than the mics. the addition of 50% human serum resulted  in a significant increase in activity only against staphylococcus epidermidis. variations in ph from 6.4 to 8.4 and in inoculum from 10(3) to 10(7) cfu/ml did not significantly affect the activity of ly264826.

TI  == sodium hypophosphite inhibition of the growth of selected gram-positive foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == sodium hypophosphite (shp) was evaluated for inhibition of growth of selected gram-positive foodborne pathogenic bacteria in trypticase soy broth. in addition, the effects of ph and sodium chloride (nacl) alone and in combination with (shp)  were also examined. all inhibition studies were performed with optimal or nearly  optimal growth conditions for each bacterium. growth was monitored by determining culture optical density at 600 nm, and a time to significant growth determined for each test media. ratios of time to significant growth for each control over that in test variables were used to evaluate the effect of shp and other variables on growth. shp was effective in inhibiting growth of clostridium perfringens and clostridium botulinum strains 62a 52a and lamanna b, but generally ineffective against staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus. results  from this investigation show that shp has potential as a food ingredient for the  inhibition of certain gram-positive foodborne pathogens.

TI  == selection and application of antibodies modifying the function of beta-lactamase.
AB  == nine monoclonal antibodies directed against class a beta-lactamases were detected and selected by a novel screening procedure based on assaying the modifications in the catalytic and stability properties of beta-lactamase in solution. unlike conventional screening, e.g., elisa or immunoprecipitation, the present method does not depend on firm binding and thus favors detection of low affinity antibodies. individual antibodies were found to affect the enzymatic activity in  various ways including stimulation, neutralization, protection and stabilization. class a beta-lactamases show only 20% among members of this class. in contrast, two of our monoclonal antibodies cross-reacted with different beta-lactamases and thus demonstrate the presence of shared structural epitopes in this class of enzymes. one of the cross-reacting antibodies was elicited by sequential immunization with two different beta-lactamases. taken together, our findings stress the importance of the screening method in antibody selection and illustrate the use of 'functional' monoclonal antibodies in the study of the structure-function relationship in an enzyme.

TI  == the bactericidal activity of a deuteroporphyrin-hemin mixture on gram-positive bacteria. a microbiological and spectroscopic study.
AB  == the combined antibacterial activity of various porphyrins with hemin on gram-positive bacteria was studied. protoporphyrin, hematoporphyrin derivative and deuteroporphyrin show only a marginal inhibitory effect in the dark. however, hemin has a strong cytotoxic effect which is independent of illumination and is equally strong in the dark. the disadvantage of hemin treatment is that it is temporary. in this study, we have demonstrated that a combination of deuteroporphyrin and hemin has a unique cytotoxic activity on staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis and bacillus cereus. the effect of the combined compound is stronger than that of the separate constituents, and is as strong in  the dark as in the light. only 0.005% of the initial s. aureus population survive after a 2 h treatment. absorption and fluorescence spectra of hemin-deuteroporphyrin mixtures in water and liposomes suggest the formation of a species with spectroscopic properties which are different from those of the two constituents.

TI  == molecular analysis of a sphingomyelinase c gene from leptospira interrogans serovar hardjo.
AB  == a thermolabile hemolysin from leptospira interrogans serovar hardjo, strain sponselee, was shown to specifically degrade sphingomyelin. nucleotide sequence determination revealed that sphingomyelinase activity was encoded by an open reading frame of 1,668 nucleotides. although a putative signal sequence could be  identified, no evidence for protein export in either l. interrogans or escherichia coli was obtained. the apparent molecular mass of the expression product in e. coli minicells was 41.2 kilodaltons, whereas open reading frame 1 encoded a protein of 63,268 daltons. the observed difference may be explained by  processing at the carboxy-terminal part of the hemolysin in e. coli. a high degree of similarity on the dna and protein levels with staphylococcus aureus beta-hemolysin and sphingomyelinase c from three bacillus cereus strains was observed. the presence of various sphingomyelinase genes within the l. interrogans species is demonstrated.

TI  == beta-lactamases as fully efficient enzymes. determination of all the rate constants in the acyl-enzyme mechanism.
AB  == the rate constants for both acylation and deacylation of beta-lactamase pc1 from  staphylococcus aureus and the rtem beta-lactamase from escherichia coli were determined by the acid-quench method [martin & waley (1988) biochem. j. 254, 923-925] with several good substrates, and, for a wider range of substrates, of beta-lactamase i from bacillus cereus. the values of the acylation and deacylation rate constants for benzylpenicillin were approximately the same (i.e. differing by no more than 2-fold) for each enzyme. the variation of kcat./km for  benzylpenicillin with the viscosity of the medium was used to obtain values for all four rate constants in the acyl-enzyme mechanism for all three enzymes. the reaction is partly diffusion-controlled, and the rate constant for the dissociation of the enzyme-substrate complex has approximately the same value as  the rate constants for acylation and deacylation. thus all three first-order rate constants have comparable values. here there is no single rate-determining step for beta-lactamase action. this is taken to be a sign of a fully efficient enzyme.

TI  == analytical methods for bacillus cereus and other bacillus species.
AB  == bacillus cereus can give rise to two distinct forms of foodborne disease, the emetic and the diarrhoeal syndromes. the emetic syndrome is believed to be associated with an emetic toxin pre-formed in food. cooked rice is the most common vehicle, and the symptoms are similar to those of staphylococcus aureus intoxication. the diarrhoeal type is caused by an enterotoxin and the symptoms generally parallel those of the clostridium perfringens food poisoning. the heat  resistance of b. cereus spores and the non-fastidious nature of the organism facilitates its survival and/or growth in a wide variety of foods. this review describes analytical methods available for the isolation, identification, and enumeration of the organism, in addition to details about biological and immunological methods for toxin assay. data are also presented concerning the incidence and epidemiology of b. cereus food poisoning around the world, and especially in japan.

AB  == the survival of beta-lactamase-producing (beta-lac+) and non-beta-lactamase-producing (beta-lac-) bacillus and staphylococcus spp. has been investigated in dextrose 5% injection, nacl 0.9%, and dextrose 5% in nacl 0.9% solutions. tests were performed under static and turbulent conditions of incubation, with and without antibiotics added to the fluids, and with or without 1% citrated blood. all solutions were inoculated with about 1000 organisms/ml, and sampled for viable bacteria at specific time intervals. under static conditions, there was no significant decrease in viability (p greater than 0.01)  of the bacilli, except for the staphylococci (p less than 0.01). however, when cultures were agitated, all species showed significant decline in viability (p less than 0.01). when antibiotics were present, s. aureus (beta-lac+) declined gradually throughout 24 hours (p greater than 0.01). b. cereus (beta-lac+) concentrations were static in all solutions. all organisms multiplied rapidly in  solutions containing blood. the results suggest that the growth characteristics of both beta-lac+ and beta-lac- bacteria in intravenous fluids are essentially similar, except in solutions containing beta-lactamase-sensitive antibiotics in which beta-lac+ bacteria tend to survive.

TI  == the migration of bacteria through gels in the presence of iucd monofilament tails.
AB  == an in vitro model was developed to investigate the migration of a variety of bacteria of different characteristics through a gel system in the presence or absence of a wide range of polymer monofilament threads. the bacteria were unable to migrate through the gel from the point of inoculation in the absence of a solid substrate. migration occurred along all thread types tested, including those used as iucd marker tails and the extent of bacterial migration appeared to be determined primarily by the motility of the microorganisms. the implications of these findings in relation to the development of pelvic infections in iucd wearers is discussed.

TI  == isolation of a staphylococcus aureus beta-lactamase-dicloxacillin complex and kinetic studies on the reactivation of the enzyme.
AB  == exposure of the beta-lactamase from staphylococcus aureus to the slowly reacting  substrates cloxacillin or dicloxacillin results in time-dependent inactivation of the enzyme. methods for the rapid separation of a beta-lactamase-dicloxacillin complex from excess inhibitor, using centrifuged columns of sephadex g-25 or deae-sephadex g-25, are described. the enzyme-dicloxacillin complex releases active enzyme, with specific activity identical to that of untreated enzyme, after storage at ph 7.5 at 15 degrees c. full reactivation was accompanied by the release of 0.8 eq of hydrolyzed dicloxacillin. the complex is stable for up to 40 h when stored at ph 3 at 4 degrees c. the reactivation process, which occurs with first-order kinetics at 15 degrees c and ph values between 4 and 8, displays a ph dependence with apparent pka's of 4.6 and 8.5, and a limiting value of the reactivation rate constant of 0.022 min-1. deviation from first-order kinetics at ph 9 is consistent with a competing irreversible inactivation of the enzyme at that ph. this behavior differs substantially from that of the similarly inactivated beta-lactamase i from bacillus cereus, whose rate of reactivation is  independent of ph, but which undergoes irreversible denaturation at acidic ph [a. l. fink, k. m. behner, and a. k. tan (1987) biochemistry 26, 4248-4258]. addition of hydroxylamine to the s. aureus beta-lactamase-dicloxacillin, complex stimulates the rate of reactivation by a maximum of 35%. this effect is hyperbolically dependent on the concentration of hydroxylamine with half-maximal  stimulation at 2.8 mm. the km for ampicillin hydrolysis catalyzed by the partially reactivated enzyme is identical to that measured for catalysis by the untreated enzyme. we discuss our observations in relation to models for the transient inhibition process.

TI  == critical control points for foods prepared in households whose members had either alleged typhoid fever or diarrhea.
AB  == hazard analysis of food preparation practices were conducted in four households and eleven others were visited to survey both food preparation practices and environmental conditions. households selected had members who were suffering from either diarrhea of unknown etiology or alleged typhoid fever. hazard analyses and sanitary surveys included gathering data on time-temperature exposures of foods,  collecting samples of food and drinking water, sampling sewage or drains, and obtaining stool specimens from persons with diarrhea and from family controls. food samples were tested for aerobic mesophilic colony counts and common foodborne pathogens; specimens were tested for salmonella, shigella, campylobacter and yersinia. campylobacter was isolated from two persons purported to have diarrhea, but neither salmonella, shigella nor yersinia were recovered from alleged cases or controls. salmonella agona was recovered from a latrine. most foods were cooked to internal temperatures to or near to boiling. those not  promptly eaten were held at ambient room or outside temperatures until a subsequent meal, until a family member returned home, or until lunch time when taken to the fields. during these intervals, microorganisms multiplied and mesophilic aerobic organisms increased often reaching 10(8)/g or greater before consumption. none of these foods were reheated before eating. bacillus cereus was isolated from 4 of 10 samples; one sample of 'moro' (beans and rice) exceeded 10(6)/g, two other samples exceeded 10(3)/g. staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 7 of 14 samples, one exceeded 10(5)/g. fecal coliforms were isolated from 8  of 14 food samples, five exceeded 10(5)/g. neither salmonella nor shigella were isolated from any food, the community water supplies or from vessels of water within houses. fecal coliform counts of water were less than 3/ml, except one sample from a clay vessel (9/ml). risks associated with cooked foods which were not promptly eaten appeared to be greater than that associated with water.

TI  == endovesiculation of human erythrocytes exposed to sphingomyelinase c: a possible  explanation for the enzyme-resistant pool of sphingomyelin.
AB  == when human erythrocytes are treated with staphylococcus aureus sphingomyelinase c at 37 degrees c they become susceptible to cold lysis and appear to endovesiculate. endovesiculation has been confirmed by showing that in parallel with sphingomyelin breakdown, the cells accumulate [3h]inulin or [14c]sucrose (without losing intracellular k+) and also experience a loss of cell-surface acetylcholinesterase activity into a latent intracellular pool which can be revealed by treatment with detergent. on the basis of these observations it can be calculated that endovesicles account for about 2-4% of cell volume and about 25% of total cell surface. pretreatment of cells with bee venom phospholipase a2  completely blocked sphingomyelinase-induced endovesiculation but this effect was  related to a concomitant decrease in sphingomyelin breakdown which was reduced by about 90%. these results indicate that the pool of sphingomyelin which is not susceptible to attack by sphingomyelinase c (about 15% of total sphingomyelin) may be resistant because of membrane internalisation and not because it originally resides in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane.

TI  == microbial spoilage of pre-cooked potato-topped pies.
AB  == the ecological succession of bacteria which developed in pre-cooked potato-topped pies stored at two different temperatures was examined. bacillus, streptococcus and staphylococcus-micrococcus spp. were the predominant organisms isolated from  freshly prepared pies and those stored at 4 degrees and 37 degrees c. none of these groups of bacteria caused significant biodeterioration of pies held at 4 degrees c, but all groups grew well in pies stored at 37 degrees c and achieved counts of ca 10(8)/g of sample. bacillus spp. were the first group to grow, followed by streptococcus and staphylococcus-micrococcus spp. growth which occurred at 37 degrees c did so at the expense of glucose, lactate accumulated and the ph of pie components decreased. amylase activity detected in all pie components during storage was associated with the growth of bacillus spp. and probably supplemented glucose already present in pies, by hydrolytic cleavage of  potato, flour or binder starches. spoilage caused by growth and activity of the bacteria isolated was not associated with visual signs of biodeterioration, nor production of 'off' odour usually associated with spoilage of meats. these results suggest that pre-cooked potato-topped pies held at inappropriate temperatures represent a potential public health risk.

TI  == release of proteins from the surface of bovine central nervous system myelin by salts and phospholipases.
AB  == incubation of bovine cns myelin with phospholipase c from bacillus cereus under conditions that lead to extensive phospholipid degradation caused 10% of the myelin protein to be released from the membrane. the myelin basic protein (mbp) was a major component of the dissolved protein. comparable incubations with phospholipase c from clostridium perfringens, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase c from staphylococcus aureus, or cabbage phospholipase d removed little mbp. however, concentrations of sodium chloride near 1 m and concentrations of divalent metal ions between 50 and 600 mm released typically 9-12% of the total myelin protein, with mbp again as the predominant component. repetitive washing with calcium chloride solutions resulted in dissolution of over 90% of the mbp. when myelin was incubated in 1.0 m sodium chloride or 25 mm  calcium chloride, the mbp was cleaved largely into two major peptides with apparent molecular weights near 14,000 and 12,000, but with 200 mm or higher concentrations of calcium chloride most of this protein remained intact. with appropriate manipulation of the ionic milieu, it is thus possible to remove most  of this extrinsic protein from the myelin surface under relatively mild conditions. the conditions that release the protein suggest that it is held at the membrane surface by ionic interactions.

TI  == kinetics and mechanism of the serine beta-lactamase catalyzed hydrolysis of depsipeptides.
AB  == steady-state kinetic parameters have been determined for the hydrolysis of a series of acyclic depsipeptides (ester analogues of acyl-d-alanyl-d-alanine peptides) catalyzed by representative class c (enterobacter cloacae p99) and class a (bacillus cereus i, tem-2, and staphylococcus aureus pc1) beta-lactamases. the best of these substrates, and the one most used in this work, was m-[[(phenylacetyl)-glycyl]oxy]benzoic acid, whose rates of cleavage could be followed spectrophotometrically. the p99 enzyme also catalyzed the methanolysis of these substrates in aqueous methanol solutions. quantitative evaluation of the effects of methanol on the kinetics of the competing hydrolysis and methanolysis reactions, and on the product distribution, supports a reaction  mechanism involving an acyl-enzyme intermediate whose formation is rate-determining under conditions of substrate saturation. consideration of the variation of these kinetic parameters with the structure of the depsipeptides and comparison with the analogous parameters for bicyclic beta-lactam substrates suggest that a variety of substrate binding modes exist on this enzyme. the class a enzymes, b. cereus beta-lactamase i and the tem-2 beta-lactamase, catalyze depsipeptide and benzylpenicillin hydrolyses but not methanolysis. the acyl-enzyme derived from both types of substrate is thus shielded from external nucleophiles; the shielding is therefore not an effect, direct or indirect, of the thiazolidinyl group in the penicilloyl-enzyme. the class a beta-lactamase of  the pc1 plasmid of s. aureus is distinctly different from the above two representatives of that class, in that it does catalyze methanolysis of depsipeptides (but not of benzylpenicillin). the methanolysis kinetics suggest that deacylation is rate-determining at saturation, a conclusion supported by the demonstration of an intermediate during the hydrolysis of m-[[(phenylacetyl)glycyl]oxy]benzoate, subsequent to leaving-group departure. the beta-lactamases have thus been shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of specific depsipeptides with comparable facility to that demonstrated by d-alanyl-d-alanine carboxypeptidase/transpeptidases. the former enzymes, however, differ in being unable to cleave the analogous peptides.

AB  == in a 12-month survey (june 1982-may 1983) 41 laboratories examined 2493 samples of goat's milk for colony counts and the presence of pathogens. the statutory tests for cow's milk were also applied. surface counts of less than 10(5) organisms per ml of raw milk were given by 79% of samples at 37 degrees c and by  76% at 22 degrees c. there were less than 100 coliforms per ml in 71% of samples, less than 10 escherichia coli per ml in 91%. staphylococcus aureus was not detected in countable numbers in 96% of samples. only one isolation of campylobacter was made and two of yersinia enterocolitica. salmonella was not detected in 2462 samples. the methylene blue test was carried out on 2368 samples and 86.7% were deemed satisfactory. no sample was brucella ring-test-positive. experiments on the survival and growth of six food poisoning organisms in stored  goat's milk showed that bacillus cereus, staph. aureus, salmonella typhimurium and y. enterocolitica survived quite well and multiplied at the higher storage temperature of 30 degrees c. clostridium perfringens only increased 10- to 100-fold while campylobacter jejuni did not grow. the results of the survey indicate that any problems with goat's milk relate to poor hygiene during production rather than transmission of organisms from the goat herself.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine and morphine.
AB  == antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine and morphine against 10 microbial strains was studied with an agar dilution method. the strains tested were escherichia coli (atcc 25922), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), and one of each of the clinical isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis (a multiresistant strain), staphylococcus epidermidis (a sensitive strain), streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes (a), streptococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, and candida albicans. the antimicrobial effect of bupivacaine was tested at concentrations of 0.5, 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg/ml (0.05% 0.125%, 0.25%, and 0.5%). bupivacaine at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml inhibited the growth of the sensitive s. epidermidis strain, s. pyogenes, and s. pneumoniae, and all of the others except p. aeruginosa at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. morphine 0.2 and 2 mg/ml (0.02 and 0.2%) did not inhibit any of the strains.

TI  == comparative study of the nature and biological activities of bacterial enterotoxins.
AB  == it is apparent that there are considerable similarities between many of the enterotoxins produced by enteric pathogens. although the effect of most of these  toxins is restricted to the intestine in vivo, many cells are also sensitive to intoxication in vitro. the resultant in-vitro biochemical changes may have no pathological significance but serve to underline the central role of cyclic nucleotides in cellular fluid regulation. the biological activity of these enterotoxins is the result of interaction with membrane-bound adenylate cyclase,  leading to persistent elevation of intracellular levels of camp. stimulation of adenylate cyclase occurs consistently after a characteristic lag phase which varies somewhat between toxins. the duration and degree of stimulation of adenylate cyclase by the various toxins may point to possible differences in affinity, dissociation and mechanism of activation of the cyclase molecule. subtle events at, or within, the cell membrane must occur during intoxication and may include complex associations of toxin with membrane lipid and protein components. the heat-labile toxins of v. cholerae, e. coli, salmonella spp., a. hydrophila and y. enterocolitica have much in common in their structures, membrane receptors and biochemical modes of action. similarly the heat-stable toxins of e. coli and y. enterocolitica, match each other in their biological activities. classified along with the enterotoxin of c. perfringens, the enterotoxin produced by sh. dysenteriae (and possibly some strains of e. coli) appears to differ from the other enterotoxins by acting on protein biosynthesis primarily and not on the nucleotide cyclase activation systems. in another category must be placed the various enterotoxins produced by staph. aureus until  more is known. surprisingly little research has been directed towards the elucidation of their mode of action, although much is known of their serological  and structural differences. evidence to date suggests that staphylococcal enterotoxins differ from the other diarrhoeagenic agents discussed in this review. the structural and immunological similarities between the various heat-labile enterotoxins suggest a common genetic origin with gene transfer between the different bacterial species being responsible for the spread of enterotoxigenicity. it is possible that many of the "newer" enterotoxins owe their origin to genetic recombination with the "older" enteropathogens like v. cholerae.

TI  == [medical aspects of elaboration of microbiological criteria for evaluating the quality and principles of microbiological standards of dried milk and other mixtures for children in the first year of life].
AB  == the author demonstrates the ability of st. aureus, e. coli o iii, b. cereus and other opportunistic microorganisms to multiply in model media similar to those in the alimentary tract of children of the first year of life. describes the principal differences between microbiological criteria of evaluating the quality  and safety of infant food mixtures and other products intended for children of the first year of life and these criteria for consumer goods. emphasizes that food mixtures for infant nutrition should not contain potentially pathogenic and  pathogenic microorganisms. at the present stage of manufacturing food for children of the first year of life the microbiological criteria are based on an assay of mesophilic aerobic microorganisms in 1 g (ml) and on the determination of the mass of the ready-made mixture or other product which should not contain e. coli that ferment glucose, coliform bacteria, lactose, e. coli, st. aureus, salmonella, yeast and mold.

TI  == beta-lactamase-catalyzed hydrolysis of acyclic depsipeptides and acyl transfer to specific amino acid acceptors.
AB  == beta-lactamases from all three classes, a, b, and c, catalyze the hydrolysis of specific acyclic depsipeptide (phch2conhcr1r2co2chr3co2h) analogs of acyl-d-alanyl-d-alanine peptides. the depsipeptides investigated, which are chemically as reactive toward nucleophiles as penicillins, are in general poor substrates, although differences between the classes of beta-lactamases have been observed: the order of effectiveness seems to be c greater than b greater than a. certain class a and c beta-lactamases also catalyze phenylacetylglycyl transfer between phenylacetylglycyl depsipeptides and specific amino acid acceptors, a type of reaction hitherto identified more closely with d-alanyl-d-alanine transpeptidases than with beta-lactamases. preliminary indications of an acyl-enzyme intermediate in these reactions have been obtained. these results support the suggestion [tipper, d.j. and strominger, j.l. (1965) proc. natl. acad. sci. usa 54, 1133-1141] that beta-lactamases are evolutionary descendants of bacterial cell wall d-alanyl-d-alanine transpeptidases.

TI  == the microbiology of selected retail food products with an evaluation of viable counting methods.
AB  == in an inter-laboratory survey, the pour plate, surface spread, agar droplet and spiral plate methods were used in parallel with the surface drop method for enumeration of micro-organisms in foods. good agreement was obtained between all  surface methods of enumeration, but there was poor agreement between molten agar  methods and the surface drop method. a total of 1143 samples of food that were ready for consumption at the point of retail sale were examined. eight types of food products were chosen: meat pasties, sausage rolls, real-cream slices, synthetic-cream slices, mayonnaise-based coleslaws, faggots, pates and continental sausages. the results of this survey suggest that the upper limit for an acceptable viable count should vary according to the food product. salmonellae were not isolated on any occasion. potentially harmful organisms were not isolated at levels expected to constitute a public health hazard. information concerning the nature of the product, the total viable count, the presence or absence of pathogenic, toxigenic or indicator organisms, the spectrum of the bacterial flora and the relative predominance of each organism must all be considered when assessing the microbiological acceptability of retail 'ready to eat' products.

TI  == antibacterially active substituted anilides of carboxylic and sulfonic acids.
AB  == anilides of carboxylic and sulfonic acids were prepared and tested for antimicrobial activity. while these anilides were ineffective against gram-negative organisms, there was a good correlation between chemical structure  and biological activity against gram-positive species. both the nature and position of the benzene ring substituents and the length of the carbon side chain affected the activity and specificity of the compounds. the highest activity was  observed when the acyl or sulfuryl moiety had a c7-c9 side chain attached. the conh and so2nh bridging groups were equally effective. the attachment of cooh or  cooch3 groups in the omega-position did not effect activity, but the substitution of the acidic proton of the sulfonamide group by an alkyl group rendered the compound inactive. six compounds, which were substituted anilides of sulfonic acids, fatty acids, or the analagous alpha-methylene-substituted acids, were bacteriostatic at 10 ppm against bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, and lactobacillus plantarum. one of these compounds, 2-hydroxy-5-nitroanilide of alpha-methylenedecanoic acid, was bactericidal at 1 ppm.

AB  == when bacillus subtilis gsy908 (rece4-) (h. c. spatz and t. a. trautner, 1971, mol. gen. genet. 113, 174-190) protoplasts were infected with staphylococcus aureus plasmid pns1 specifying tetracycline resistance (tcr) (n. noguchi et al.,  1983, gene 21, 105-112), which was modified such that it either could not replicate or did not carry a functional tcr gene, a plasmid with a molecular weight of 3.1 x 10(6) (4.9 kb) was generated in tcr phenotypes. this plasmid, named tcr pns1981, exhibited completely different restriction endonuclease cleavage patterns to pns1 and showed only negligible sequence homology in hybridization experiments. southern hybridization experiments revealed that pns1981 arises by excision of a b. subtilis chromosomal dna sequence. no sequence corresponding to pns1 was detectable on the chromosome of pns1981-maintaining b.  subtilis. the production of pns1981 was also observed in b. subtilis rm125 (r-mm-mrec+) (t. uozumi et al., 1977, mol. gen. genet. 152, 65-69.) with almost the same frequency as b. subtilis gsy908. since the recipient b. subtilis marburg 168 derivatives stated above are sensitive to tc, the results indicate that information essential for tcr is under negative regulatory control in the integrated state on the chromosome. restriction endonuclease analysis suggested that pns1981 is essentially the same as pbc16, formerly found in b. cereus (k. bernhard, h. schrempf, and w. goebel, 1978, j. bacteriol. 133, 897-903).

AB  == studies were undertaken to determine functional properties of neutrophils attracted into involuted mammary glands of staphylococcus aureus--immunized ewes  by soluble antigens prepared from s. aureus (homologous antigen) or from bacillus cereus (heterologous antigen). the ewes were immunized with an s. aureus vaccine  known to stimulate synthesis of cytophilic igg2 antibody, and the inflammatory responses were elicited 4-8 weeks later by infusing homologous antigen into one gland and heterologous antigen into the other. inflammatory cells were collected  at 2, 4, and 8 h postinfusion. the magnitude of the cellular responses was similar in both glands with high proportions of viable neutrophils. there were no significant differences between neutrophil populations from each gland for proportions of cells bearing cytophilic immunoglobulin, although the proportions  of cytophilic immunoglobulin-positive cells from both glands were lower in 2-h exudates than in 4-h or 8-h exudates. in invitro phagocytosis assays using 3h-labeled s. aureus and b. cereus no differences could be detected between the two populations of neutrophils in terms of phagocytic efficacy using a range of bacteria-neutrophil ratios and various opsonizing treatments.

AB  == the hygienic condition of 6 milking installations, 3 sanitized by circulation cleaning (cc) with chlorine-based chemicals and 3 by flushing with acidified boiling water (abw), was tested using rinses of quarter strength ringer's solution. the bacterial content of the rinses was determined using both colony counts and the direct epifluorescent filter technique (deft). a comparison of testing methods gave correlation coefficients between colony count and deft of 0.82 for plants using cc and 0.46 for plants using abw. five strains of bacteria  belonging to different genera and commonly found on milking equipment were exposed to various degrees of heat and to various concentrations of chlorine. the effects of such treatments on the staining characteristics of the organisms were  studied. it was observed that staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus lactis, although killed by heat treatment, stained a bright orange when treated with acridine orange dye. pseudomonas fluorescens, escherichia coli and vegetative cells of bacillus cereus did not take up the orange stain after heat treatment, nor did any of the 5 strains stain orange after treatment with naocl. it is suggested that the deft is a useful and rapid means of counting bacteria in rinses of equipment where sterilization is due primarily to chlorination, but in  the absence of a stain which can differentiate more accurately between dead and living organisms its use is limited where sterilization is carried out solely by  heat.

TI  == what do beta-lactamases mean for clinical efficacy?
AB  == beta-lactamases have proved to be extremely important in influencing therapy with penicillins and cephalosporins against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic species. both plasmid mediated beta-lactamases which are primarily  of a constitutive penicillinase type and the inducible chromosomal enzymes which  are primarily cephalosporinases are important. the use of penicillins to treat haemophilus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella, salmonella, shigella and pseudomonas infections must be based upon the relative incidence of  beta-lactamase producing strains. in the same manner cephalosporins can be used to treat infections due to enterobacter, serratia and bacteroides only if the compounds are beta-lactamase stable and not good inducers of beta-lactamase activity. although altered permeability is important in the resistance of some pseudomonas and enterobacter to beta-lactams, the resistance really is due to a combination of reduced entry of molecules and strategically placed beta-lactamases. it is only in some streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis strains that altered penicillin-binding proteins make a significant contribution to the resistance to beta-lactams. beta-lactamases will continue to be the most important factor in clinically significant resistance of bacteria to both penicillins and cephalosporins.

TI  == survival of cultured cells after functional and structural disorganization of plasma membrane by bacterial haemolysins and phospholipases.
AB  == lesions were induced in the plasma membranes of cultured human fibroblasts by membrane damaging toxins of bacterial origin (haemolysins). structural disorganization of the membrane was measured as leakage of a radiolabelled small  cytoplasmic marker and functional membrane damage was measured as decreased uptake of aminoisobutyrate. cell survival was scored 24 and 48 hr later by measuring uptake of trypan blue and by light microscopical evaluation of cell morphology and proliferation. the membrane damage induced by most bacterial toxins was reversible upon removal of the toxin, since toxin-treated cells recovered and excluded trypan blue although they had been permeable to the dye immediately after the toxin treatment. among ten bacterial toxins tested, the only exception of this general behavior was the aeromonas hydrophila beta-haemolysin, which irreversibly damaged human fibroblasts. thus, the action of bacterial haemolysins on cultured cells generally seems restricted to a plasma membrane permeabilization, which is reversible regardless of the mechanism of membrane damaging action of the toxin or of the relative size of the structural lesions induced. furthermore, the use of trypan blue uptake as a measure of cell  death caused by membrane damaging agents appears to be of limited value.

TI  == gram-positive bacteria-induced granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis in rabbits.
AB  == pneumococci have been shown to induce granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis  which might contribute to morbidity and mortality in pneumococcal sepsis. we studied whether other gram-positive species (groups a and b streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and clostridium perfringens) could also induce these phenomena. rabbits were challenged with nonviable preparations of each species, and all five species induced profound granulocytopenia (mean decrease of 90%) and pulmonary leukostasis. in vitro studies of serum incubated with these species of bacteria showed a mean consumption of total hemolytic complement of 90%, a mean increase of chemotactic activity for granulocytes of 204%, and a mean augmentation of granulocyte adherence of 45% (compared with 18%  for the control). infusion of sonicate-exposed sera induced granulocytopenia in recipient rabbits. thus, several nonviable gram-positive species can interact with serum to activate the complement system, generate c5a bioactivity, augment granulocyte adherence, and generate a neutropenia-inducing factor. these alterations may contribute to granulocytopenia or pulmonary leukostasis, which may play a role in the morbidity and mortality associated with gram-positive bacterial infections.

TI  == membrane-bound penicillinases in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the penicillinases of bacillus licheniformis, bacillus cereus, and staphylococcus aureus are related in structure and cellular localization to one another more closely than they are to penicillinases from gram-negative organisms. in the latter, penicillinases are almost exclusively found in the periplasm, while the gram-positive bacteria retain a substantial proportion as hydrophobic membrane-bound forms. we recently showed (nielsen, j. b. k., caulfield, m. p., and lampen, j. o. (1981) proc. natl. acad. sci. u. s. a. 78, 3511-3515) that b. licheniformis membrane attachment was achieved through a glyceride thioether modification identical to that in several gram-negative outer membrane proteins.  we now report that the membrane penicillinases of s. aureus and b. cereus also possess the modification. we do this by demonstrating isotopic labeling of these  forms of [3h]palmitate, by showing that they exhibit the same response to the antibiotic globomycin which appears to inhibit processing steps specifically involving the glyceride thioether in escherichia coli outer membrane proteins, and lastly by isolating glyceryl cysteine sulfone, the oxidation product of the modified cysteine residue. by comparing the modification-susceptible signal sequences of gram-positive penicillinases and of gram-negative outer membrane proteins with those of nonmodified gram-negative penicillinases, we describe in increased detail the structural features within the signal sequence that allow modification and cleavage resulting in membrane anchorage.

AB  == pyridine-2-azo-p-dimethylanaline cephalosporin (padac), a chromogenic reagent which is purple and changes to yellow upon cleavage of its beta-lactam ring, was  evaluated in comparison with other chromogenic cephalosporins. padac exhibited little antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria, but did have good activity (minimum inhibitory concentration, 0.12 to 0.5 microgram/ml) against staphylococcus aureus, a quality comparable to nitrocefin. nitrocefin, however, demonstrated an unexpected and uniquely potent activity against streptococcus faecalis (minimum inhibitory concentration, less than or equal to 0.06 to 0.12 microgram/ml) the relative hydrolysis rate of padac when subjected to six different beta-lactamases was substantially greater than that of cephacetrile, but less than that of nitrocefin. the relative hydrolysis rates of padac and nitrocefin were comparable with type iiia beta lactamase and the derived from bacillus cereus. the inhibition of beta-lactamase hydrolysis of the chromogenic cephalosporin substrates by six enzyme-stable inhibitors was generally greater with padac than with nitrocefin. unlike nitrocefin, padac mixed with 50% human serum or various broth culture media showed no evidence of color change or degradation over several hours. the subsequent enzyme hydrolysis rates of such mixtures were the same as in phosphate buffer. beta-lactamase-containing bacterial suspensions and clinical specimens containing such bacteria produced positive visual and spectrophotometric color changes when mixed with padac or nitrocefin. although color changes occurred more slowly with padac than with nitrocefin, padac was not adversely influenced (non-enzyme-related color change)  by the protein content of specimens. padac appears to be a promising alternative  for beta-lactamase diagnostic testing in the clinical and research microbiology laboratory.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity evaluation of cefodizime (hr221), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin.
AB  == cefodizime (hr221) is a new alpha-methoxyimino cephalosporin developed by hoechst-roussel with a reported serum half-life of over 2 h. in vitro susceptibility studies showed that the cefodizime spectrum includes all those enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci, streptococcus spp., haemophilus spp., and neisseria spp. normally susceptible to cefotaxime (hr756) or ceftizoxime (fk749)  or both. cefodizime was less active (two- to eightfold) than cefotaxime or ceftizoxime against some enteric species, but was the most potent drug against some strains of morganella spp. and proteus vulgaris. enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and most pseudomonas spp. were resistant to cefodizime (median minimum inhibitory concentrations, greater than or equal to 64 microgram/ml). acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains required cefodizime concentrations of 32 microgram/ml to inhibit 50% of tested strains. cefodizime was very stable to hydrolysis by richmond-sykes type i, ii, iii, and iv beta-lactamases, as well as the enzyme derived from bacillus cereus. the reference padac and nitrocefin substrate hydrolysis by a type i beta-lactamase was markedly inhibited (greater than 80%) by cefodizime at concentrations 0.4 to 4% of substrate concentration. cefodizime was active against 43% of bacteria which were resistant to cephalothin and cefamandole and against 58% of those resistant to aminoglycosides.

TI  == mode of antibiotic action of 4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzaldehyde from streptomyces viridans.
AB  == the free ligand, deferroviridomycin a, and its iron(ii) complex, viridomycin a, were detected in culture supernatant fluids of streptomyces viridans 1671 and were structurally characterized as 4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzaldehyde and tris(4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzaldehydato-n3,o4)ferrate(ii), respectively. we investigated the antibiotic activity of the above compounds and of the chemically synthesized bis copper(ii), tris cobalt(iii), and tris nickel(ii) complexes against escherichia coli nihj, salmonella typhimurium lt-2z, staphylococcus aureus 209p, streptococcus faecium 10541, and bacillus cereus, t. the free ligand and its kinetically labile copper(ii) and nickel(ii) complexes displayed activity against all of the above organisms, whereas the kinetically inert iron(ii) and cobalt(iii) complexes displayed activity only against s. aureus and b. cereus. the antibiotic activity of the substitutionally labile metal complexes was attributed to dissociation of the free ligand. the mode of antibiotic action of the free ligand against e. coli appears to be interference with the structural and functional integrity of the cell membrane.

TI  == enzymatic hydrolysis by bacterial phospolipases c and d of immobilized radioactive sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine.
AB  == an assay system for phospholipases c has been described with sphingomyelin immobilized to octyl-sepharose cl-4b as substrate. the immobilization procedure was further developed and used with [14 c-choline]-sphingomyelin and [14c-choline] phosphatidylcholine (lecithin). these immobilized radioactive phospholipids made the enzymatic assays easier to perform and made it possible to increase the sensitivity. furthermore, since release of the choline part instead  of the phosphate part of the substrate molecule was measured, it was possible to  use this assay for phospholipase d as well. the enzyme characteristics of phospholipase d from corynebacterium ovis were compared in this test system with  those of three phospholipases c (from clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus) with respect to hydrolysing capacities and optimal ion concentrations.

TI  == enzymatic hydrolysis of immobilized sphingomyelin by three bacterial phospholipases c.
AB  == through hydrophobic interaction, sphingomyelin was adsorbed to agarose beads containing octyl groups by a stepwise dilution procedure. this immobilized lipid  was used as a substrate for three bacterial phospholipases c (e.c. 3.1.4.3.). the degradation with time of this substrate showed two different fractions of the substrate according to hydrolysing velocity in the early part of the time-curve when phospholipases c from bacillus cereus and clostridium perfringens were used. the early fractions could be predigested by the enzymes, a procedure which resulted in linear time-curves. the corresponding early part of the time-curve for phospholipase c from staphylococcus aureus was linear, indicating a comparatively large early fraction of the substrate for this enzyme. the stock gel of the immobilized lipid substrate could be stored for months. it was easily  and reproducibly handled as a water suspension. after enzymatic hydrolysis the substrate was rapidly separated from enzyme and product by filtration. the enzyme assay presented thus represents a convenient way to avoid the difficulties connected with the use of temporary sonicated suspensions as substrate for bacterial phospholipases c.

TI  == ceftazidime, a pseudomonas-active cephalosporin: in-vitro antimicrobial activity  evaluation including recommendations for disc diffusion susceptibility tests.
AB  == the in-vitro qualities of ceftazidime, as compared to other beta-lactams and three other antimicrobials (amikacin, gentamicin and chloramphenicol), were evaluated in a multilaboratory, multiphasic study in the united states. a total of 12,986 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference dilution methods in six medical centres over 45-60 days. ceftazidime was superior to the comparison cephalosporin (cefamandole) and comparable in spectrum and activity to gentamicin against enterobacteriaceae. of 8038 enteric bacilli tested, over 98% had ctaz mics < or = 8 mg/l with a mode of < or = 0.12 mg/l. only citrobacter freundii and enterobacter aerogenes had ceftazidime mic(90s) in the resistant range ( > or =32 mg/l). staphylococcus aureus strains were less susceptible to ceftazidime (mode mic 8 mg/l) compared to cefamandole or gentamicin. ceftazidime was more effective than cefamandole or gentamicin against the beta-haemolytic streptococci and the pneumococcus. more than 90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, most other pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by ceftazidime at concentrations of 8  mg/l. in other comparative studies ceftazidime was found remarkably similar in spectrum to cefotaxime, cefoperazone and moxalactam against the enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci and streptococcus spp. enterobacter cloacae was the only enteric species having ceftazidime mic90 >8 mg/l. only cefsulodin (mode  mic 2 mg/l) and cefoperazone (mode mic 4 mg/l) shared the ceftazidime activity against ps. aeruginosa. ceftazidime mic(50s) for neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were 0.03-0.06 and 0.015 mg/l, respectively. ceftazidime was found to be bactericidal against most strains at or one doubling dilution above the mic, and was relatively unaffected  by increasing inoculum concentration (some strain variations). it perfused readily into bacterial cells and was effective against the majority of strains resistant to currently available cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. beta-lactamases of types i-v and bacillus cereus failed to significantly hydrolyse ceftazidime. ceftazidime inhibited only type i ent. cloacae beta-lactamase hydrolysis. disc diffusion tests favour the use of a 30 microg ceftazidime disc for the methods described by the national committee clinical laboratory standards (nccls). quality control data are presented. tentative 30 microg disc interpretive criteria, based on susceptible mics of < or =8 mg/l(> 17 mm) and resistant > or =32 mg/l ( < or =13 mm), resulted in < 1% (false resistance or false susceptible) interpretive error rates. staph. aureus was the  species most commonly found to have strains with indeterminate ceftazidime zones  or mics. we found ceftazidime to possess one of the widest clinically usable antimicrobial spectrum by in-vitro testing of any beta-lactam tested and to be most comparable to broad-spectrum aminoglycosides such as amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin.

AB  == ro 13-9904 is a novel semisynthetic and highly active parenteral cephalosporin. its stability against hydrolysis by several beta-lactamases was studied. the enzymes were isolated from various enterobacteriaceae or staphylococcus aureus and several commercially available enzyme preparations were also included. most of the penicillinases, cephalosporinases or the tem-type beta-lactamase studied were unable to hydrolyze this novel cephalosporin. the cephalosporinases from bacillus cereus 569/h9 and proteus vulgaris 1028, however, were found to readily  cleave all new cephalosporins like cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ro 13-9904, but not cefoxitin. ro 13-9904 was seen to be a potent inhibitor of several cephalosporinases, but had little or no affinity for penicillinases or the tem lactamase.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of street heroin.
AB  == street heroin and injection paraphernalia have been implicated as sources of bacteria causing infections in drug abusers [1]. staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacillus cereus are common etiologic agents. in a previous study of the microbiology of street heroin and injection paraphernalia,  bacillus species was the predominant isolate [2]. we did not find s. aureus, but  one study reported isolates of identical phage type from heroin powder and from an infected patient [3]. to reconcile the results of our recent investigation among drug abusers with panophthalmitis, we theorized that the drug mixture might have an antibacterial effect. of the samples of street heroin tested, all except  one were bactericidal against s. aureus. the single sample with no heroin content was not bactericidal against one isolate of s. aureus and was the only sample that exhibited some degree of inhibitory and bactericidal activity against p. aeruginosa. all samples were bactericidal against the two isolates of b. cereus tested. quinine exhibited bactericidal activity against s. aureus and b. cereus but was ineffective against p. aeruginosa. our findings indicate that most samples of street heroin have antibacterial effects against s. aureus and b. cereus but no activity against p. aeruginosa. such activity may be due to the quinine content of the mixture. the apparent lack of recovery of s. aureus from street heroin may be partially explained by this phenomenon.

AB  == two commercially available baby milks, one 'biologically acidified', the other 'non-acidified', and a traditional weaning food, millet gruel, were prepared and  stored under village conditions in west africa. increases in total colony count and in number of bacillus cereus, clostridium welchii, staphylococcus aureus and  escherichia coli were determined in these products when stored as commonly practised at ambient temperatures over a period of 8 h. poor hygiene during preparation was indicated by readily detectable numbers of coliforms and e. coli  in freshly prepared samples of each of the milks, though the cooked local gruel seemed less vulnerable in this respect. the rate of increase in the numbers of these organisms was lower in the acidified milk when prepared with unboiled water containing high numbers of coliforms and e. coli. increases in total colony count and in numbers of staph. aureus were also less marked in the acidified milk. when food was not eaten soon after preparation the problem of bacterial overgrowth was as great with the local gruel as with the considerably more nutritious reconstituted milks.

TI  == phenylpropynal, a specific, irreversible, non-beta-lactam inhibitor of beta-lactamases.
AB  == phenylpropynal is a specific, irreversible, non-beta-lactam inhibitor of typical  beta-lactamases. in the presence of millimolar concentrations of phenylpropynal,  the beta-lactamase i of bacillus cereus and the beta-lactamases of staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli become completely inactivated; the beta-lactamase ii  of b. cereus is not affected. the e. coli beta-lactamase is considerably more sensitive to the reagent than the gram-positive enzymes. a variety of structural  analogs of phenylpropynal are much less effective inhibitors. bovine alpha-chymotrypsin, bovine carboxypeptidase a, and the d,d-carboxypeptidase/transpeptidase of streptomyces r-61 were not inactivated by  phenylpropynal. the inactivation of the e. coli beta-lactamase can be significantly retarded when the good substrate benzylpenicillin is also present.  the development of a characteristic chromophore (lambda max 318 nm) during beta-lactamase inactivation suggests that covalent modification of the enxymes is involved; arginine and/or lysine modification is indicated.

AB  == breakdown of the covalent complex formed between [14c]penicillin g and higher molecular weight, cephalosporin-sensitive penicillin-binding proteins was studied using mixtures of the purified proteins isolated from membranes of staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis. these penicillin-binding proteins were found to release the bound 14c label in a first order process characterized by half-lives  of 10 to 300 min at 37 degrees c. denaturation of the penicilloyl.penicillin-binding proctein complex prevented this release, indicating that the process is enzyme-catalyzed. [14c]phenylacetylglycine was identified as the major labeled fragmentation product, indicating that these cephalosporin-sensitive penicillin-binding proteins, for which no in vitro transpeptidase or carboxypeptidase activity has been found, catalyze the same fragmentation of the bound penicilloyl moiety previously described for several penicillin-sensitive d-alanine carboxypeptidases.

TI  == precipitating antibody against protease of corynebacterium pyogenes in pigs.
AB  == antibody in sera from pigs carrying an abscess associated with corynebacterium pyogenes and healthy pigs was examined by the agar gel diffusion test. in the test, the concentrated culture fluid containing the protease of c. pyogenes was used as antigen. as a result, precipitating antibody was demonstrated in sera from 25 of 30 abscessed pigs and a few of the healthy pigs. when the relationship between precipitating antibody and protease was examined by the immunoelectrophoresis and gel filtration of the concentrated culture fluid, the antibody was shown in the same position as the protease. from the result, it was  clear that the precipitating antibody was against the protease of c. pyogenes. all the proteases produced by 27 strains of c. pyogenes of porcine and bovine origin were serologically identical with one another. they were, however, serologically different from those of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and b. subtilis. in the inhibition test, the proteolytic activity of c. pyogenes was  inhibited by the serum of the abscessed pig. it was also inhibited by healthy pig serum. from the results, it seems that the determination of precipitating antibody may be useful for the diagnosis of c. pyogenes infection.

AB  == the resistence of different microorganisms to formaldehyde was determined. as test objects served gram-negative and gram-positive vegetative germs (klebsiella  pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella paratyphi-b, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis), bacterial spores (bacillus cereus, bacillus pumilus, bacillus stearothermophilus, bacillus subtilis), fungi (aspergillus niger, candida albicans), bacteriophages (escherichia coli phages, t1, t2, t3), and viruses (adenovirus, poliomyelitis virus, vaccinia virus). for the studies, suspensions of germs were exposed at identical temperature (20 degrees c) and ph  (7.0). the microbicidal effect of formaldehyde was measured by the decrease of the proportion of germs capable of multiplication in the suspension (lg (n/n0); where: n0 equals initial number of germs capable of multiplication; n equals number of germs capable of multiplication after exposure to formaldehyde). for all germs the dependence of the microbicidal effect on the concentration of formaldehyde was determined. in all experiments, the duration of exposure was two hours. pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and salmonella paratyphi-b  were found to be more susceptible than staphylococcus aureus (vf. fig. 1 a). the  strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa used were widely varying as to their susceptibility. to obtain equal microbicidal effects, concentrations of formaldehyde almost three times as high had to be used for the most resistant strain than were necessary for the most susceptible strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa. all strains of klebsiella pneumoniae examined were found to have an identical resistence to formaldehyde. streptococcus faecalis was even more resistant to formaldehyde than staphylococcus aureus. in the case of streptococcus faecalis, a concentration of formaldehyde about three times as high had to be used to obtain microbicidal effects of identical magnitude. for the killing of candida albicans cells concentrations of formaldehyde not higher than  those needed for the killing of vegetative gram-negative bacteria were necessary. the conidia of aspergillus niger were found to be more resistant than the cells of candida albicans but did not require any higher concentrations than for the killing of staphylococcus aureus (see fig. 1 b). in the case of bacterial spores, a special phenomenon was observed. if the spores had been exposed to a temperature of 80 and 95 degrees c, respectively (depending on the species involved) for one or two hours following exposure to formaldehyde, a considerably higher number of spores was found to be capable of germination and colony formation than without such treatment (heat activation: cf. fig. 2a and fig. 2b). the spores of bacillus cereus had only a relatively low resistance to formaldehyde. to reduce the proportion of the spores capable of colony formation  to 1/10000, a 2.9% formaldehyde concentration was necessary without heat activation and one of 10.8% with heat activation...

TI  == the effect of phospholipase c on dna synthesis, morphology and phospholipid content of isolated hela cell nuclei.
AB  == isolated hela cell nuclei have been treated with purified phospholipase c (bacillus cereus) and sphingomyelinase (staphylococcus aureus). the phospholipids of untreated nuclei consisted of about 67% phosphatidylcholine, 23% phosphatidylethanolamine, 7% sphingomyelin, 2% phosphatidylserine and 1% phosphatidylinositol. phospholipase c degraded 80-90% of the total phospholipids  of the nuclei. such nuclei seemed ultrastructurally intact, and had an average diameter and a protein loss during incubation which were not significantly different from those of controls. their rate of dna synthesis was only slightly reduced after treatment with phospholipase c alone and slightly more reduced when phospholipase c was used in combination with sphingomyelinase. this suggests that the polar head-groups of the nuclear phospholipids are of very limited importance in dna synthesis. since it has been reported that phospholipase c treatment releases nascent dna from a membrane complex, the absence of a concommitant reduction in dna synthesis may suggest that this complex is not necessary for the replication of dna. phospholipase c did not significantly influence the stability of the dna product and gave only a slight inhibition of cytosol and nuclear dna polymerases when tested with exogenous template.

AB  == because of the unavailability of strictly comparable data, seven representative penicillins and the five cephalosporins currently used in britain were evaluated  in parallel, both in vitro and in vivo. penicillin sensitive and resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis were the main test organisms. minimum bacteriocidal concentrations of cloxacillin, flucloxacillin, cephalothin, and cephazolin in serum were much higher than conventional minimum inhibitory concentrations in the absence of serum. cephalexin and cephradine showed the smallest divergence in these values. staph, aureus beta-lactamase caused least damage to methicillin and cephradine, whereas enzymes from escherichia, klebsiella, and bacillus cereus had least effect against cephradine  followed by cephalexin. in mouse protection experiments, highly protein-bound antibiotics had relatively low efficacy. cephradine had the highest mean activity followed closely by cephaloridine and cephalexin. from the data, cephradine was the cephalosporin of choice, and firm decisions were also made about the choice of penicillins.

TI  == organization of phospholipids in human red cell membranes as detected by the action of various purified phospholipases.
AB  == 1. the action of eight purified phospholipases on intact human erythrocytes has been investigated. four enzymes, e.g. phospholipases a2 from pancreas and crotalus adamanteus, phospholipase c from bacillus cereus, and phospholipase d from cabbage produce neither haemolysis nor hydrolysis of phospholipids in intact cells. on the other hand, both phospholipases a2 from bee venom and naja naja cause a non-haemolytic breakdown of more than 50% of the lecithin, while sphingomyelinase c from staphylococcus aureus is able to produce a non-lytic degradation of more than 80% of the sphingomyelin. 2. phospholipase c from clostridium welchii appeared to be the only lipolytic enzyme tested, which produces haemolysis of human erythrocytes. evidence is presented that the unique  properties of the enzyme itself, rather than possible contaminations in the purified preparation, are responsible for the observed haemolytic effect. 3. with non-sealed ghosts, all phospholipases produce essentially complete breakdown of those phospholipids which can be considered as proper substrates for the enzymes  involved. 4. due to its absolute requirement for ca2+, pancreatic phospholipase a2 can be trapped inside resealed ghosts in the presence of edta, without producing phospholipid breakdown during the resealing procedure. subsequent addition of ca2+ stimulates phospholipase a2 activity at the inside of the resealed cell, eventually leading to lysis. before lysis occurs, however, 25% of  the lecithin, half of the phosphatidylethanolamine and some 65% of the phosphatidylserine can be hydrolysed. this observation is explained in relation to an asymmetric phospholipid distribution in red cell membranes.

TI  == the partial amino acid sequence of the extracellular beta-lactamase i of bacillus cereus 569/h.
AB  == the chemical structure of the extracellular beta-lactamase i of bacillus cereus 569/h was investigated. three electrophoretically homogenous charge variants of this enzyme were isolated and amino acid analysis of each revealed no significant differences. however, a degree of n-terminal heterogeneity was found by direct end-group modification of the protein and also on alignment of peptides from tryptic and chymotryptic digestion. the n-terminal heterogeneity observed was great enough to explain the production of the beta-lactamase i isoenzymes which are probably produced by postsynthesis modification of a single gene product. over 80% of the amino acid sequence of beta-lactamase i was determined by the detailed analysis of peptides derived from tryptic, chymotryptic and thermolytic  digests. five polypeptide fragments were constructed from these data and aligned  by comparison with the known amino acid sequences of the penicillinases produced  by bacillus licheniformis and staphylococcus aureus (ambler & meadway, 1969). about 60% of the proposed sequence was identical with that of b. licheniformis penicillinase, whereas the s. aureus enzyme had only about 40% of its residues in common with beta-lactamase i. these results are discussed with reference to the possible evolutionary relationships existing between known beta-lactamases. detailed evidence for the amino acid sequence proposed has been deposited as supplementary publication sup 50044 (27 pages) at the british library (lending division), boston spa, wetherby, w. yorks. ls23 7bq, u.k., from whom copies can be obtained on the terms indicated in biochem. j.

TI  == influence of food microorganisms on staphylococcal growth and enterotoxin production in meat.
AB  == forty-four microorganisms were studied for their influence on staphylococcal growth and enterotoxin production. inhibition was found to be more common than stimulation. two types of inhibition were observed: inhibition of staphylococcal  growth, and inhibition of enterotoxin formation with no apparent effect on growth. by use of a plate test, 12 of the 44 food microorganisms were found to inhibit staphylococcal growth at 35 c. of the 12, 3 also inhibited growth at 25 c. no significant differences in inhibition were observed with the 15 strains of  enterotoxigenic staphylococci. in meat slurries, inhibition of staphylococcal growth was found to be greater at 25 c than at 35 c. results on inhibition obtained from the plate test could not be correlated with the effect of the organisms in slurries. environmental conditions were found to affect markedly the influence of food microorganisms on staphylococci. of the 44 food microorganisms  studied, only bacillus cereus was observed to stimulate significantly staphylococcal growth and enterotoxin formation. stimulation was more pronounced  with staphylococcus aureus 196e than with other strains of enterotoxigenic staphylococci. bacillus megaterium and brevibacterium linens were inhibited by staphylococci. these organisms were completely inhibited when inoculated in mixed cultures with staphylococci. in pure cultures, good staphylococcal growth was found to be accompanied by enterotoxin production; however, in the presence of food microorganisms, good staphylococcal growth occurred without the formation of detectable levels of enterotoxin a.

TI  == heterogenetic antigens of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == chorpenning, frank w. (the ohio state university, columbus), and matthew c. dodd. heterogenetic antigens of gram-positive bacteria. j. bacteriol. 91:1440-1445. 1966.-soluble antigens obtained by various methods from gram-positive bacteria were used to modify erythrocytes whose hemagglutinating reactions with immune rabbit sera and normal human sera were then studied. antigens from all gram-positive organisms studied except corynbacteria altered red cells, causing them to react with specific bacterial antisera and with normal human sera; however, cross-absorption and inhibition tests indicated that at least three different specificites were involved. one of these antigens seemed to be similar  to rantz's streptococcal nss, which is shared with staphylococcus aureus and bacillus spp., and is therefore heterogenetic. another was found in streptococci  but was apparently not present in s. aureus and bacillus spp. a third antigen, also heterogenetic, appeared to be shared by several species of bacillus and by s. aureus, but not by streptococci or any gram-negative bacteria. the third antigen was heat-stable at ph 8.0, and appeared to be essentially polysaccharide  in nature. normal human sera varied in their content of antibodies which reacted  with erythrocytes modified by extracts from gram-positive bacteria. whereas some  sera reacted very broadly with red cells modified by extracts of practically any  gram-positive organism, other sera agglutinated only cells which had been modified by streptococcal antigen.

TI  == food-borne bacterial toxins.
AB  == food poisoning caused by the ingestion of preformed bacterial toxins is considered in relation to comparative symptoms, procedures for extraction and purification of the causal toxins, their chemistry, serology, assay procedures and pharmacology, in so far as these are known.the bacteria discussed in this context are clostridium botulinum, c. perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and vibrio parahemolyticus. the possible roles of the enterococci, proteus, e. coli and of unknown species, in relation to production of non-antigenic toxic substances, are discussed briefly.requirements for prevention of the various forms of bacterial food poisoning are outlined.

TI  == the purification and properties of a penicillinase whose synthesis is mediated by an r-factor in escherichia coli.
AB  == 1. the penicillinase (beta-lactamase) from escherichia coli strain tem has been purified and its activity against a range of penicillin and cephalosporin derivatives measured. 2. the enzyme shows little resemblance to penicillinases from bacillus cereus, bacillus licheniformis and staphylococcus aureus. 3. the molecular weight of the enzyme is 16700+/-5%, which is about half the value obtained for other penicillinases. 4. the enzyme is most similar in properties to a crude preparation of a penicillinase from klebsiella (aerobacter) aerogenes, but clearly different from crude enzyme preparations from other strains of e. coli. 5. since penicillinase synthesis in e. coli strain tem is mediated by an r-factor known to infect many other species of enterobacteriaceae, the appearance of similar enzymes in other gramnegative species is not surprising.

TI  == production and partial purification of antibiotic materials formed by physarum gyrosum.
AB  == pure cultures of physarum gyrosum were grown on agar plates with autoclaved escherichia coli suspensions as the growth medium. portions of such agar, after growth of the slime mold, contained diffusible materials that inhibited the growth of bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. paper chromatography of extracts of such cultures revealed at least three different active fractions. preliminary fractionations increased the specific activity by one order of magnitude, probably in part by removal of inactive material and in part by separating active components. the fractionations also demonstrated the multiplicity of the antibiotic activity. fractions variously obtained always retarded the growth of the bacterial species  listed above.

TI  == fate of bacteria in chicken meat during freeze-dehydration, rehydration, and storage.
AB  == total plate counts were determined on boneless cooked, cubed chicken meat obtained from a commercial processor. survival of the natural flora was determined after the meat was freeze-dehydrated and rehydrated at room temperature for 30 min and 50, 85, and 100 c for 10 min. total counts of bacteria in the rehydrated samples were determined during storage of the meat at 4, 22, and 37 c until spoilage odor was detectable. meat samples were inoculated with staphylococcus aureus, then dried, rehydrated, and stored at the same temperatures. numbers of surviving organisms in the inoculated samples were determined with use of both selective and nonselective media. representative genera surviving the various rehydration treatments were determined. approximately 32% of the bacteria in the meat survived during dehydration and rehydration at room temperature. many numbers and types of vegetative bacteria also survived rehydration at 50 c. when meat was rehydrated at 85 or 100 c, the initial count was less than one per gram. the only organisms isolated from samples rehydrated at 85 or 100 c were of the genus bacillus. s. aureus in inoculated samples survived dehydration and rehydration at 60 c. storage of all rehydrated samples at 4 c gave a good shelf life (18 or more days). the study indicates that freeze-dehydrated meat should be produced with adequate microbiological control and that such meat should be rehydrated in very hot water.

TI  == repression of staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria. ii. causes of inhibition.
AB  == two food bacteria, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas sp. cs-1, inhibited an enterotoxigenic strain of staphylococcus aureus, apparently by out-competing it for nutrients. five others, bacillus cereus, proteus vulgaris, escherichia coli h-52, aerobacter aerogenes, and achromobacter sp., inhibited by means of antibiotic substances which were seitz-filterable, dialyzable, and stable at 90 c for 10 min. inhibition was not caused by changes in ph, oxidation-reduction potential, or production of peroxide or fatty acids. the concentrated antibiotic  material from e. coli h-52 contained amino acids but not peptides and was especially effective against staphylococci and micrococci.

TI  == repression of staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria. i. effect of environmental  factors on inhibition.
AB  == the effects of environmental factors on the inhibition of an enterotoxin-producing strain of staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria were investigated. type of medium and temperature of incubation were important factors in determining the amount of inhibition. the ph range of maximal inhibition was found to be 7.4 to 6.2. availability of oxygen was not a factor. as the ratios of inhibitor to staphylococcus were increased from 1:1 to 10:1 and 100:1, the amount of inhibition was markedly increased. inhibition occurred in custard, where it increased with increasing ratios of effector to staphylococcus. the repression of the staphylococcus in all media usually was sufficient to be of practical significance.

TI  == attempts to freeze some bacteriophages to ultralow temperatures.
AB  == a variety of bacteriophages specific for different hosts, including bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, shigella dysenteriae, staphylococcus aureus, and vibrio comma, were frozen at a controlled rate to liquid nitrogen temperatures, and then quick-thawed. glycerol (10%) was used as a protective additive. quantitative determinations showed from 10% to virtually 100% recovery in the various cases. host specificity, plaque morphology, and, in one case, rate of inactivation of phage by homologous antiserum remained unchanged.

TI  == the international standard for aureomycin.
AB  == in 1950, the department of biological standards, national institute for medical research, london, was authorized by the who expert committee on biological standardization to proceed with the establishment of an international standard for aureomycin. a 100-g batch of aureomycin was obtained and was compared with the standard preparation of aureomycin of the united states food and drug administration (fda) in a collaborative assay in which six laboratories in five countries participated.in all, 30 assays were carried out; 26 of these were done  by biological methods, using sarcina lutea, bacillus pumilus, staphylococcus aureus, or bacillus cereus, and the remaining four by physicochemical methods. the results were subjected to standard methods of analysis, and the overall weighted mean potency (calculated from the biological assays only) was 1.0139, with limits of error of 99.5% to 100.5%.since the international standard is 1.39% more potent than the fda standard preparation, it is probable that the latter contains a small amount of inert material; it is also possible that the international standard itself is not 100% pure. for most practical purposes, however, both preparations may be regarded as substantially pure, and it is considered that to alter the present practice of quoting aureomycin dosage in metric units of weight would be inadvisable. nevertheless, since the international standard may not be a pure substance, a unit notation-for use where required in bioassays-is desirable, and the international unit of aureomycin has  therefore been defined as the activity contained in one microgram of the international standard.
