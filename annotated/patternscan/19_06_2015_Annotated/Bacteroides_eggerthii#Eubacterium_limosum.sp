TI  == characterization of anaerobic bacteria by using a commercially available rapid tube test for glutamic acid decarboxylase.
AB  == a rapid glutamic acid decarboxylase microdilution test for presumptive identification of certain anaerobic bacteria was marketed recently by carr-scarborough microbiologicals, inc., stone mountain, ga. the test was evaluated with 474 clinical isolates, representing 11 genera and 54 species, and  was found to be a useful aid in the presumptive identification of bacteroides fragilis, b. distasonis, b. vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. ovatus, b. uniformis, b. eggerthii, clostridium perfringens, c. barati, c. sordellii, and eubacterium limosum.
