TI  == in vitro activity of daptomycin against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == we determined the activity of daptomycin, a recently fda-approved antimicrobial agent, against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria, including viridans group streptococci (16 streptococcus mitis species group, 12 s. mutans species group, 9 s. anginosus species group, 8 s. sanguinis species group, 5 s. salivarius species group) from patients with infective endocarditis, 32 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 32 high-level penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, 38 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (including 1 linezolid-resistant isolate), and the following unusual gram-positive bacteria: 3 listeria monocytogenes, 4 erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, 9 corynebacterium species, 10 abiotrophia/granulicatella species, 2 rothia (stomatococcus) mucilaginosus, and 4 gemella morbillorum. daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)(90) values for the viridans group streptococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, and enterococcus species were 0.5, 0.5, < or =0.125, and 4 microg/ml, respectively. the daptomycin mic range for the unusual gram-positive bacteria was < or =0.125-2 microg/ml. we conclude that daptomycin has in vitro activity against viridans group streptococci associated with endocarditis as well as against several types  of unusual gram-positive bacteria that can cause endocarditis.

TI  == gemella bacteraemia characterised by 16s ribosomal rna gene sequencing.
AB  == aims: to define epidemiology, clinical disease, and outcome of gemella bacteraemia by 16s rrna gene sequencing. to examine the usefulness of the vitek,  api, and atb systems in identifying two gemella species. methods: all alpha haemolytic streptococci other than streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from blood cultures during a six year period were identified by conventional biochemical methods, the vitek system, and the api system. 16s rrna gene sequencing was performed on all isolates identified by both kits as gemella with >or= 95% confidence or by either kit as any bacterial species with < 95% confidence. the atb expression system was used to identify the two isolates that were defined as  gemella species by 16s rrna gene sequencing. results: of the 302 alpha haemolytic streptococci other than s pneumoniae isolated, one was identified as gemella morbillorum, and another as gemella haemolysans by 16s rrna gene sequencing. the  patient with monomicrobial g morbillorum bacteraemia was a 66 year old man with community acquired infective endocarditis with septic thromboemboli. the patient  with g haemolysans bacteraemia was a 41 year old woman with hospital acquired polymicrobial bacteraemia during the neutropenic period of an autologous bone marrow transplant for non-hodgkin's lymphoma, the first case of its kind in the english literature. the api and atb expression systems only identified the second strain as g haemolysans at 94% and 99% confidence, respectively, whereas the vitek system identified none of the two strains correctly at > 70% confidence. conclusions: gemella bacteraemia is uncommon. 16s rrna gene sequencing is the method of choice for identification of gemella and gemella-like isolates.

TI  == infective endocarditis caused by unusual gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == of a total of 81 patients hospitalized in the infectious diseases department in 1990-2000 with infectious endocarditis caused by gram-positive pathogen, unusual  etiological agents were found in several cases: streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, corynebacterium diphtheriae, and gemella morbillorum. cardiac defects were present in the latter two patients: bicuspid aortic valve and tetralogy of fallot. two patients were successfully treated with antibiotics  only and one patient with antibiotics and surgery. the patient with c. diphtheriae endocarditis died due to progressive sepsis and multiple organ failure.

TI  == [pericarditis caused by gemella morbillorum. description of a case].
AB  == pericardial diseases, in the pediatric age group are rare, and are usually due to viral infection or collagen diseases. since the advent of the antibiotic era, bacterial pericardial has rarely been reported, and the bacteria most commonly involved are staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophylus influenzae and neisseria meningitidis; other pyogenic agents have rarely been isolated in pericarditis. gemella morbillorum, also known as streptococcus morbillorum, is a gram-positive pyogen, usually a saprophite agent of the human gastrointestinal tract, rarely associated with human infections such as arthritis, endocarditis and meningitidis; to our knowledge, it has never been isolated in pericarditis. we report a case of pyogenic pericarditis in an 11-year-old boy, suffering from substernal chest pain for about one year, in which the clinical symptoms, the presence of acute phase proteins, the large amount of fluid within the pericardial space (echocardiographically estimated to  be approximately 18 mm), the lack of improvement in clinical conditions and in laboratory values after therapy (diuretics, broad spectrum antibiotics and steroids) led to the indication for a pericardial drainage with the isolation of  gemella morbillorum. antimicrobial therapy was then modified according to in vitro susceptibility of the gemella morbillorum, with a decisive contribution to  the recovery of the patient, although long-term steroid therapy (5 months) was necessary because of one recurrence of pericardial effusion. this case report shows how gemella morbillorum, usually a saprophit microorganism, can become pathogenic and also underlines the importance of a correct etiologic diagnosis of pericarditis resistent to classical antibiotic therapy.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of cefmenoxime against recent fresh clinical isolates from patients in sinusitis].
AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (cmx), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cmx and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates from patients of sinusitis that were obtained in our laboratory from october of 1993 to march of 1994. the results are summarized as follows; 1.  cmx showed strong antimicrobial activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis that were 3 major aerobic bacteria from sinusitis. antimicrobial activities of cmx against benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) and pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) were stronger than those of ampicillin (abpc), and these strong activities suggested that cmx might have strong antimicrobial activities against  beta-lactamase producing h. influenzae and m. (b.) catarrhalis. 2. antimicrobial  activities of cmx against microaerophiles, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus intermedius and gemella morbillorum and against peptostreptococcus  spp., from chronic sinusitis and odontogenic maxillary sinusitis, were stronger than those of most of the control drugs. 3. the mic90's of cmx against isolates from patients of sinusitis were < or = 0.025-0.39 micrograms/ml. these values were lower than transitional concentrations in mucous membrane of maxillary sinus obtained when "1% cmx nasal solution" was used with nebulizer. it appears likely  that sufficient concentrations exceeding mics against main organisms would be obtained by nebulizer treatment using cmx nasal solution.

TI  == gram-positive cocci isolated from slaughtered poultry.
AB  == gram-positive cocci were found in all meat samples of poultry slaughtered and processed for retail sale, at incidence rates ranging from 10(2) cfu/ml to 1.35 x 10(6) cfu/ml and a mode between 8 x 10(5) and 9 x 10(5) cfu/ml for 75% of the samples. the 93 isolated strains were identified as belonging to the following species: enterococcus faecalis (48 strains), e. faecium (16), e. avium (7), e. durans (4), aerococcus viridans (10), streptococcus morbillorum (2), s. salivarius (1), s. sanguis (1), s. "milleri" (1), s. pneumoniae (1), s. acidominimus (1), and gemella haemolysans (1). these species, which mainly colonize the intestinal tract, but may also be found in other parts of both the human and animal body, are pathogens or potentially such. their presence is an indication of the fecal contamination of meat processed following gutting of slaughtered chickens (endogenous contamination). a count of the gram-positive cocci and enterobacteria detected showed that enterococci were present in a far greater number than coliform bacteria.
