carbapenem susceptibility among escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae isolates obtained from patients in intensive care units in taiwan in 2005, 2007, and 2009.
to investigate the evolutionary trends in non-susceptibility of carbapenems against the isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (icus) of major teaching hospitals throughout taiwan during 2005-2009, we applied the breakpoints of mics recommended by clinical and laboratory standards institute and european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing in 2013. escalations in imipenem mic levels for overall e. coli and e. cloacae isolates and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing k. pneumoniae isolates were noted during this period. the overall mic levels against imipenem and meropenem for subgroups of esbl producers of 3 enterobacteriaceae species were significantly higher than those of respective overall groups in 2007 and 2009. compared with meropenem, we found that significant evidence of imipenem mic creep and evidence of extraordinarily high rates of non-susceptibility to ertapenem among isolates of 3 species in 2009 existed. the prominent rises in rates of ertapenem non-susceptibility for esbl-producing e. coli and k. pneumoniae during 2005-2009 and rate of esbl positivity for e. cloacae between 4 years were notably found. based on our findings, ertapenem should be used cautiously in management of the icu infections caused by these potentially esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates in taiwan.
in vitro spectrum of pexiganan activity when tested against pathogens from diabetic foot infections and with selected resistance mechanisms.
pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. bacterial isolates from the 2013 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (dfi) and gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth. the mic50 and mic90 against all organisms tested from dfi were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa mic values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. pexiganan mic values among staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the family enterobacteriaceae or p. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against s. aureus or e. faecium. enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (mic, 32 to 256 mug/ml). the "all organism" mic90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.
activity of eravacycline against enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter baumannii,  including multidrug-resistant isolates, from new york city.
eravacycline demonstrated in vitro activity against a contemporary collection of  more than 4,000 gram-negative pathogens from new york city hospitals, with mic50/mic90 values, respectively, for escherichia coli of 0.12/0.5 mug/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae of 0.25/1 mug/ml, enterobacter aerogenes of 0.25/1 mug/ml, enterobacter cloacae 0.5/1 mug/ml, and acinetobacter baumannii of 0.5/1 mug/ml. activity was retained against multidrug-resistant isolates, including those expressing kpc and oxa carbapenemases. for a. baumannii, eravacycline mics correlated with increased expression of the adeb gene.
[trends in antibiotic resistance in medellin and municipalities of the metropolitan area between 2007 and 2012: results of six years of surveillance].
introduction: bacterial resistance is a global phenomenon, but it presents geographic and temporal variations; this is the importance of local surveillance programs. objective: to determine trends in antibiotic resistance in hospitals between 2007 and 2012 in medellin and its metropolitan area. materials and methods: percentages of antibiotic resistance between 2007 and 2012 in 22 institutions were obtained using whonet 5.6 program. for interpretation of susceptibility results, clsi standards of 2009 and 2012 were used. using the epi-info 6.04 program a trends analysis of antibiotic resistance was done using the chi-square for linear trend with a confidence level of 95%, a value of p=0.05 was considered significant. results: in six years of surveillance of antibiotic resistance we found a decrease of oxacillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus (p=0.0006) and an increase of vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium (p=0.0000). in escherichia coli and serratia marcescens an increase of resistance to ceftazidime was found, in contrast to a decrease in klebsiella pneumoniae (p=0.0000) and enterobacter cloacae (p=0.058). k. pneumoniae , s. marcescens and e. cloacae showed an increase of carbapenem resistance in contrast to a reduction of carbapenem resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii . conclusions: the resistance surveillance identified important findings as the emergence of e. faecium resistant to vancomycin and carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae . it is essential to determine the antibiotic use in the region to establish their influence on the resistance profiles, as well as ensuring the quality of information and microbiological procedures in the microbiology laboratories.
antimicrobial co-resistance patterns of gram-negative bacilli isolated from bloodstream infections: a longitudinal epidemiological study from 2002-2011.
background: increasing multidrug resistance in gram-negative bacilli (gnb) infections poses a serious threat to public health. few studies have analyzed co-resistance rates, defined as an antimicrobial susceptibility profile in a subset already resistant to one specific antibiotic. the epidemiologic and clinical utility of determining co-resistance rates are analyzed and discussed. methods: a 10-year retrospective study from 2002-2011 of bloodstream infections with gnb were analyzed from three hospitals in greater vancouver, bc, canada. descriptive statistics were calculated for antimicrobial resistance and co-resistance. statistical analysis further described temporal trends of antimicrobial resistance, correlations of resistance between combinations of antimicrobials, and temporal trends in co-resistance patterns. results: the total number of unique blood stream isolates of gnb was 3280. increasing resistance to individual antimicrobials was observed for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. cloacae, and p. aeruginosa. ciprofloxacin resistance in e. coli peaked in 2006 at 40% and subsequently stabilized at 29% in 2011, corresponding to decreasing ciprofloxacin usage after 2007, as assessed by defined daily dose utilization data. high co-resistance rates were observed for ceftriaxone-resistant e. coli with ciprofloxacin (73%), ceftriaxone-resistant k. pneumoniae with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (83%), ciprofloxacin-resistant e. cloacae with ticarcillin-clavulanate (91%), and piperacillin-tazobactam-resistant p. aeruginosa with ceftazidime (83%). conclusions: increasing antimicrobial resistance was demonstrated over the study period, which may partially be associated with antimicrobial consumption. the study of co-resistance rates in multidrug resistant gnb provides insight into the epidemiology of resistance acquisition, and may be used as a clinical tool to aid prescribing empiric antimicrobial therapy.
characterization of a novel pyranopyridine inhibitor of the acrab efflux pump of  escherichia coli.
members of the resistance-nodulation-division (rnd) family of efflux pumps, such  as acrab-tolc of escherichia coli, play major roles in multidrug resistance (mdr) in gram-negative bacteria. a strategy for combating mdr is to develop efflux pump inhibitors (epis) for use in combination with an antibacterial agent. here, we describe mbx2319, a novel pyranopyridine epi with potent activity against rnd efflux pumps of the enterobacteriaceae. mbx2319 decreased the mics of ciprofloxacin (cip), levofloxacin, and piperacillin versus e. coli ab1157 by 2-, 4-, and 8-fold, respectively, but did not exhibit antibacterial activity alone and was not active against acrab-tolc-deficient strains. mbx2319 (3.13 mum) in combination with 0.016 mug/ml cip (minimally bactericidal) decreased the viability (cfu/ml) of e. coli ab1157 by 10,000-fold after 4 h of exposure, in comparison with 0.016 mug/ml cip alone. in contrast, phenyl-arginine-beta-naphthylamide (pabetan), a known epi, did not increase the bactericidal activity of 0.016 mug/ml cip at concentrations as high as 100 mum. mbx2319 increased intracellular accumulation of the fluorescent dye hoechst 33342 in wild-type but not acrab-tolc-deficient strains and did not perturb the transmembrane proton gradient. mbx2319 was broadly active against enterobacteriaceae species and pseudomonas aeruginosa. mbx2319 is a potent epi with possible utility as an adjunctive therapeutic agent for the treatment of infections caused by gram-negative pathogens.
in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
changes in fluoroquinolone resistance over 5 years (canward 2007-11) in bacterial pathogens isolated in canadian hospitals.
objectives: the purpose of this study was to analyse canadian national surveillance data, specifically fluoroquinolone resistance, from 2007 to 2011 inclusive, to determine trends in resistance over time and to assess correlations with patient demographic factors. methods: all isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae collected by the 10 sites that participated in the annual canward surveillance studies in each of the 5 years were included in this analysis. a multifactorial logistic regression model was used to determine the variables with significant impact on fluoroquinolone resistance. results: the proportion of e. coli isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin increased significantly (p = 0.0005) between 2007 (20.0%) and 2011 (29.2%), although similar increases were not seen in k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, p. aeruginosa and s. pneumoniae (tested against levofloxacin) (p > 0.05). among isolates of s. aureus, there was a significant decrease in ciprofloxacin resistance from 34.4% in 2007 to 24.6% in 2011 (p < 0.0001). resistance to ciprofloxacin was a component of most multidrug-resistant (mdr) phenotypes for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, p. aeruginosa and s. aureus. conclusions: a significant increase in the percentage of ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli, primarily among urine isolates, and a significant decrease in the percentage of ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus occurred between 2007 and 2011. notably, mdr isolates were frequently fluoroquinolone resistant for all organisms studied, except s. pneumoniae.
occurrence and characteristics of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase- and ampc-producing clinical isolates derived from companion animals and horses.
objectives: to investigate the occurrence and characteristics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates in clinical samples of companion animals and horses and compare the results with esbl/ampc-producing isolates described in humans. methods: between october 2007 and august 2009, 2700 enterobacteriaceae derived from clinical infections in companion animals and horses were collected. isolates displaying inhibition zones of </= 25 mm for ceftiofur and/or cefquinome by disc diffusion were included. esbl/ampc production was confirmed by combination disc tests. the presence of resistance genes was identified by microarray, pcr and sequencing, escherichia coli genotypes by multilocus sequence typing and antimicrobial susceptibility by broth microdilution. results: sixty-five isolates from dogs (n = 38), cats (n = 14), horses (n = 12) and a turtle were included. six enterobacteriaceae species were observed, mostly derived from urinary tract infections (n = 32). all except 10 isolates tested resistant to cefotaxime and ceftazidime by broth microdilution using clinical breakpoints. esbl/ampc genes observed were bla(ctx-m-1, -2, -9, -14, -15,) bla(tem-52), bla(cmy-2) and bla(cmy-)(39). bla(ctx-m-1) was predominant (n = 17). bla(ctx-m-9) occurred in combination with qnra1 in 3 of the 11 enterobacter cloacae isolates. twenty-eight different e. coli sequence types (sts) were found. e. coli carrying bla(ctx-m-1) belonged to 13 sts of which 3 were previously described in dutch poultry and patients. conclusions: this is the first study among a large collection of dutch companion animals and horses characterizing esbl/ampc-producing isolates. a similarity in resistance genes and e. coli sts among these isolates and isolates from dutch poultry and humans may suggest exchange of resistance between different reservoirs.
enhanced antibacterial activities of leonuri herba extracts containing silver nanoparticles.
we report an efficient and powerful green process to enhance the antibacterial activities of the leonuri herba extract. plant sources, especially leaves and herbs, are precious for the generation of gold and silver nanoparticles. various kinds of polyphenols and hydroxyl groups are capable of processing a reduction reaction to generate metals from its corresponding salts. we have prepared gold and silver nanoparticles with 70% ethanol and water extracts. no other toxic chemicals were utilized and the extracts played dual roles as reducing and stabilizing agents. for the generation of nanoparticles, both oven incubation and autoclaving methods were applied and the reaction conditions were optimized. surface plasmon resonance band indicated that the formation of nanoparticles was successful. images of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed mostly spherical nanoparticles ranging from 9.9 to 13.0 nm in size. a water extract containing silver nanoparticles exhibited remarkable (approximately 127-fold) enhancement in antibacterial activities against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae when compared with the water extract alone. in addition, antibacterial activity towards gram-negative bacteria was greater than that against gram-positive bacteria. the process reported here has the potential to be a new approach to improve the antibacterial activities of plant extracts.
emmdr, a new member of the mate family of multidrug transporters, extrudes quinolones from enterobacter cloacae.
we cloned a gene, ecl_03329, from the chromosome of enterobacter cloacae atcc13047, using a drug-hypersensitive escherichia coli kam32 cell as the host. we show here that this gene, designated as emmdr, is responsible for multidrug resistance in e. cloacae. e. coli kam32 host cells containing the cloned emmdr gene (kam32/pemmdr28) showed decreased susceptibilities to benzalkonium chloride, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ethidium bromide, acriflavine, rhodamine6g, and trimethoprim. emmdr-deficient e. cloacae cells (ecdeltaemmdr) showed increased susceptibilities to several of the antimicrobial agents tested. emmdr has twelve predicted transmembrane segments and some shared identity with members of the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (mate) family of transporters. study of the antimicrobial agent efflux activities revealed that emmdr is an h+-drug antiporter but not a na+ driven efflux pump. these results indicate that emmdr is responsible for multidrug resistance and pumps out quinolones from e. cloacae.
[antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 produced by enterococcus faecium strain lwp760].
antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 (enterocin) produced by enterococcusfaecium strain lwp760 was studied. bacteriocin s760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kda and pl of 9.8. enterocin s760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. mics of the bacteriocin s760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for escherichia coli 0157:h117, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and corynebacterium diphteriae. it is also active against antibioticresistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter baumannii (with mics of 0.05-3 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (with mics of 6 mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of candida albicans, candida krusei and aspergillus niger (with mics of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). enterocin s760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
antimicrobial susceptibilities of commonly encountered bacterial isolates to fosfomycin determined by agar dilution and disk diffusion methods.
we studied the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against 960 strains of commonly encountered bacteria associated with urinary tract infection using standard agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. species studied included 3 common species of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia; methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus; and vancomycin-susceptible and resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. mics and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with both the currently recommended clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) criteria for urinary tract isolates of escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) criteria for enterobacteriaceae. tentative zone diameter interpretive criteria were developed for species not currently published by clsi or eucast. escherichia coli was uniformly susceptible to fosfomycin, as were most strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. a. baumannii was resistant to fosfomycin, while the prevalence of resistance in p. aeruginosa and s. maltophilia was greatly affected by the choice of mic breakpoint. new tentative zone diameter criteria for k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, s. aureus, and e. faecium were able to be set, providing some interim laboratory guidance for disk diffusion until further breakpoint evaluations are undertaken by clsi and eucast.
in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing on burn wound isolates.
objective: to test the antimicrobial effectiveness of a silver alginate dressing  on opportunistic pathogens, namely meticillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa) and meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), klebsiella spp., enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter sakazakii, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, chryseobacterium indologenes, proteus vulgaris and acinetobacter baumannii. method: in total, 40 microorganisms were isolated from patients attending three burn centres in the us and evaluated for their susceptibility to a silver alginate wound dressing, employing a corrected zone of inhibition assay, conducted on mueller hinton agar (mha). results: the sizes of the corrected zones of inhibition varied between and within genera. for example, all acinetobacter baumannii strains were found to be sensitive to ionic silver at ph 7, with a mean of 2.8mm, compared with 3.5mm at ph 5.5. the silver alginate dressing also demonstrated activity on all strains of enterobacter and escherichia coli, with susceptibility to the silver alginate dressing enhanced at ph 5.5. for enterococcus spp. the average corrected zone of inhibition at ph 7 was 3.6mm, versus 4.9mm at ph 5.5. all strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were found to be sensitive to the silver alginate dressing. the average corrected zone of inhibition was 6.9mm at ph 7, compared with 8mm at ph 5.5. for mrsa and staphylococcus aureus, it ranged from 4.5mm to 7.5mm at ph 7. when the ph was decreased to 5.5, the corrected zone of inhibition increased. conclusion: this study demonstrates the activity of a silver alginate dressing on a wide range of burn isolates, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria, isolated from three different burn centres in the us. it also highlights the possible importance of ph and its potential effects on antimicrobial performance and microbial susceptibility. however, more extensive testing is required to substantiate this. conflict of interest: slp is employed by advanced medical solutions ltd.
what remains against carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae? evaluation of chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, colistin, fosfomycin, minocycline, nitrofurantoin, temocillin and tigecycline.
carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae present an increasing and diverse problem, including strains of multiple species with metallo-beta-lactamases (imp, ndm or vim) and non-metallo (kpc and oxa-48) enzymes as well as those combining an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) or ampc enzyme with porin loss. most strains, except those with oxa-48 alone, are broadly resistant to beta-lactams and have multiple aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes; those with ndm-1 carbapenemase typically also have 16s rrna methylases, conferring complete aminoglycoside resistance. in this study, the activity of chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, colistin, fosfomycin, minocycline, nitrofurantoin, temocillin and tigecycline was evaluated against 81 carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolates from the uk. testing was performed by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) agar dilution method. chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin inhibited <25% of the isolates at the breakpoint, whereas colistin was active against 75/81 isolates (92.6%), the exceptions being four klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae isolates along with members of inherently resistant genera. fosfomycin was active against 49/81 isolates (60.5%), including 7/7 escherichia coli, 16/20 enterobacter and citrobacter spp., but only 25/52 klebsiella spp. tigecycline was active against 38/81 isolates (46.9%) and was intermediate against another 27 (33.3%), with resistance scattered amongst k. pneumoniae and enterobacter spp. the activity of colistin, fosfomycin and tigecycline was unrelated to the isolates' carbapenem resistance mechanisms. temocillin was fully active [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) </=8 mg/l] against only 4/81 isolates (4.9%), but inhibited a further 22 isolates (27.2%) at the british society for antimicrobial chemotherapy (bsac) urinary breakpoint (32 mg/l), predominantly comprising those isolates with combinations of impermeability and an esbl or ampc enzyme, along with 6/11 isolates producing kpc carbapenemases. studies with transconjugants and transformants confirmed the small effect of kpc enzymes against temocillin, whereas oxa-48 and ndm-1 conferred clear resistance.
surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility of aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with intra-abdominal infections in china: the 2002-2009 study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart).
the objective of this study was to investigate the distribution and susceptibility of aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacilli (gnb) isolated from patients with intra-abdominal infections (iais) in china. from 2002 to 2009, minimum inhibitory concentrations of 14 antibiotics for 3420 aerobic and facultative gnb from up to eight hospitals in six cities were determined by the broth microdilution method. enterobacteriaceae comprised 82.9% (2834/3420) of the total isolates, with escherichia coli (49.2%) being the most commonly isolated species followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (17.0%), enterobacter cloacae (5.8%) and citrobacter freundii (2.3%). amongst the antimicrobial agents tested, the three carbapenems (ertapenem, imipenem and meropenem) were the most active agents against enterobacteriaceae, with susceptibility rates of 96.1-99.6% (2002-2009), 98.2-100% (2002-2009) and 99.6-100% (2002-2004), respectively, followed by amikacin (86.8-95.1%) and piperacillin/tazobactam (84.5-94.3%). susceptibility rates of all tested third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins against enterobacteriaceae declined by nearly 30%, with susceptibility rates of 40.2%, 39.1%, 56.3% and 51.8% in 2009 for ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and cefepime, respectively. the occurrence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases increased rapidly, especially for e. coli (from 20.8% in 2002 to 64.9% in 2009). susceptibility of e. coli to ciprofloxacin decreased from 57.6% in 2002 to 24.2% in 2009. the least active agent against enterobacteriaceae was ampicillin/sulbactam (sam) (25.3-44.3%). in conclusion, enterobacteriaceae were the major pathogens causing iais, and carbapenems retained the highest susceptibility rates over the 8-year study period. third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and sam may not be ideal choices for empirical therapy of iais in china.
sensitization of microcin j25-resistant strains by a membrane-permeabilizing peptide.
microcin j25 (mccj25) is a plasmid-encoded, 21-amino-acid, antibacterial peptide  produced by escherichia coli. mccj25 inhibits rna polymerase and the membrane respiratory chain. mccj25 uptake into e. coli-sensitive strains is mediated by the outer membrane receptor fhua and the inner membrane proteins tonb, exbb, exbd, and sbma. this peptide is active on some e. coli, salmonella, and shigella species strains, while other gram-negative bacteria, such as clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, moraxella catarrhalis, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, are completely resistant. in the present work, we demonstrated that the membrane-permeabilizing peptide (kff)(3)k made some resistant strains sensitive to mccj25, among them s. typhimurium, where the antibiotic inhibits in vitro cell growth and bacterial replication within macrophages. the results demonstrate that the membrane permeabilization induced by (kff)(3)k allows mccj25 penetration in an fhua and sbma-independent manner and suggest that the combination of both peptides could be considered as a therapeutic agent against pathogenic salmonella strains.
detection of enterobacteriaceae isolates carrying metallo-beta-lactamase - united states, 2010.
during january-june 2010, three enterobacteriaceae isolates carrying a newly described resistance mechanism, the new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (ndm-1), were identified from three u.s. states at the cdc antimicrobial susceptibility laboratory. this is the first report of ndm-1 in the united states, and the first report of metallo-beta-lactamase carriage among enterobacteriaceae in the united states. these isolates, which include an escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae, carry blandm-1, which confers resistance to all beta-lactam agents except aztreonam (a monobactam antimicrobial); all three isolates were aztreonam resistant, presumably by a different mechanism. in the united kingdom, where these organisms are increasingly common, carriage of enterobacteriaceae containing blandm-1 has been closely linked to receipt of medical care in india and pakistan. all three u.s. isolates were from patients who received recent medical care in india.
a novel polymyxin derivative that lacks the fatty acid tail and carries only three positive charges has strong synergism with agents excluded by the intact outer membrane.
polymyxins are cationic lipopeptides (five cationic charges) and the last resort  for the treatment of serious gram-negative infections caused by multiresistant strains. nab741 has a cyclic peptide portion identical to that of polymyxin b but carries in the linear peptide portion a threonyl-d-serinyl residue (no cationic charges) instead of the diaminobutyryl-threonyl-diaminobutyryl residue (two cationic charges). at the n terminus of the peptide, nab741 carries an acetyl group instead of a mixture of methyl octanoyl and methyl heptanoyl residues. nab741 sensitized escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and acinetobacter baumannii to antibiotics against which the intact outer membrane is an effective permeability barrier. when tested by using etest strips on plates containing increasing concentrations of nab741, the fractional inhibition concentration index (fici) of the combination of nab741 with rifampin ranged from <or=0.111 to 0.158 and that with clarithromycin from <or=0.094 to 0.292. when tested by the checkerboard method, the corresponding fici values against e. coli atcc 25922 were <or=0.141 to <or=0.155 with rifampin and 0.094 with clarithromycin. in addition, at 4 microg/ml, nab741 decreased the mics of azithromycin, mupirocin, fusidic acid, and vancomycin for e. coli strains and e. cloacae by factors ranging from 8 to 200. a sister peptide, nab752, carrying a threonyl-aminobutyryl residue as the linear peptide portion, was inactive. furthermore, nab741 sensitized e. coli to the bactericidal activity of fresh guinea pig serum. the renal clearance of nab741 was approximately 400-fold, 16-fold, and 8-fold higher than those measured for colistin, nab7061, and nab739, respectively.
novel depsides as potential anti-inflammatory agents with potent inhibitory activity against escherichia coli-induced interleukin-8 production.
sixteen novel depsides were synthesized for the first time. their chemical structures were clearly determined by (1)h nmr, esi mass spectra, and elemental analyses. all the compounds were assayed for antibacterial activities against three gram-positive bacterial strains (bacillus subtilis atcc 6633, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, and streptococcus faecalis atcc 9790) and three gram-negative bacterial strains (escherichia coli atcc 35218, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 13525, and enterobacter cloacae atcc 13047) by the mtt method. compound 2-(2-methoxy-2-oxoethyl)phenyl 5-bromonicotinate (5) exhibited significant antibacterial activities against e. coli atcc 35218 with an mic of 0.78 microg/ml, which was superior to the positive control kanamycin b. in addition, compound 5 showed potent inhibitory activity against e. coli-induced interleukin-8 production.
[evolution of third-generation cephalosporin resistance in enterobacteriaceae from 2000 to 2008 in a perpignan hospital].
the aim of this work was to evaluate the evolution of enterobacteriaceae resistance to third generation cephalosporin (3cg) from 2000 to 2008 at perpignan hospital. were observed: the percentage of strains isolated from short stay wards, intensive care unit and medium and long-term care facility. the percentage of strains isolated from: urine, suppuration, tracheal aspiration, and blood have been evaluated. the proportion of escherichia coli (e. coli) strains among the enterobacteriaceae strains intermediate (i) or resistant (r) to 3gc was also evaluated.the number of enterobacteriaceae intermediated (i) or resistant (r) to 3gc increased (402 %).the distribution of species i or r to 3gc has changed, decrease of klebsielle pneumoniae and enterobacter aeorogenes species, escherichia.coli and enterobacter cloacae became dominant in 2008. we noted the change of isolated species distribution, urines represent the main source of multiresistant enterobacteriaceae (mre), 72 % of strains. the profile of patients colonised or infected by mre has changed. patients mainly infected with hospital acquirred mre changed to mre colonised patients carrying the strain into the hospital. the association of fluorinated quinolone resistance and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase enterobacteriaceae represented 51 % in 2000, became stable at 73 % from 2002. the association of fluorinated quinolone resistance and high-level enterobacteriaceae cephalosporinase has increased from 21 % in 2000 to be stable at 50 % since 2006. the mesures to contain the spread of mre strains remained inefficient because of outpatients circulation, multiresistant e. coli being community species.
multidrug efflux systems in escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae obtained from wholesome broiler carcasses.
members of the enterobacteriaceae family are present in the intestines of man and animals as commensals or are important disease causing agents. bacteria bearing multidrug efflux systems (mdr) are able to survive adverse ecological niches. multiresistant escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae isolates from wholesome broiler carcasses were investigated for the presence of mdr. lowering of minimal inhibitory concentration for antimicrobials in the presence of a proton-motive force (pmf) uncoupler was tested as a potential display of the mdr phenotype. pcr amplification of the genes encoding acra and acrb, components of a mdr system was performed. diversity of each species was ascertained by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) of dna digested with endonuclease xbai. for all the isolates, except e. coli 1 and e. cloacae 9, lowering of mic or of the growth rate in the presence of antimicrobials was observed, indicating a pmf dependent resistance mechanism. expected products of dna amplification with acrab derived primers was obtained with all e. coli strains and with two of the five e. cloacae strains. dendrogram generated shows diverse pulsetypes, confirming the genetic diversity among the strains. an important issue and related public health is the fact that different models and mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance are present in a small number of non-pathogenic strains and isolated from the same origin. these may be sources of resistance genes to others microorganisms, among them, pathogenic strains.
generation of antibacterial oligosaccharides derived from chitin using heterologous endochitinase synthesized in escherichia coli.
aims: to synthesize two heterologous endochitinases in escherichia coli and demonstrate their potential for applied use in generating antibacterial chitin-derived oligosaccharides (ogs). methods and results: heterologous endochitinase genes, chia nima and chia74, were expressed in e. coli. endochitinases were secreted by the e. coli export machinery and by approximately 20 h maximal chitinolytic activity was observed. the highest chitinolytic activity was observed with chia nima, which produced antibacterial ogs with activities against enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and s. xylosus. conclusions: it was shown that the export machinery of e. coli is well suited for the secretion of bioactive chia74 and chia nima endochitinases, and that the latter can generate antibacterial ogs. significance and impact of the study: our study suggests that it is feasible to synthesize endochitinases chia nima and chia74 codified by e. coli and mass-produce these enzymes in culture supernatants. as signal peptides in native chia nima and chia74 were recognized by the protein export molecular apparatus in e. coli, these short peptides could be included as signal sequences for transport in e. coli of other proteins with applied value. this is the first report suggesting that chia nima can be used to produce ogs to control food-borne pathogenic bacteria.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sm-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
sm-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. in agar dilution susceptibility testing, the mic of sm-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains tested (mic(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. sm-216601 was also very potent against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (mic(90) = 8 microg/ml). sm-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, with mic(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the therapeutic efficacy of sm-216601 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by s. aureus, e. faecium, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. thus, sm-216601 is a promising candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.
selectivity and specificity of a chromogenic medium for detecting vibrio parahaemolyticust.
the thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose agar (tcbs) used in the most-probable-number method for detecting vibrio parahaemolyticus cannot differentiate growth of v. parahaemolyticus from vibrio vulnificus or vibrio mimicus. this study examined the selectivity and specificity of bio-chrome vibrio medium (bcvm), a chromogenic medium that detects v. parahaemolyticus on the basis of the formation of distinct purple colonies on the medium. a panel consisting of 221 strains of bacteria, including 179 vibrio spp. and 42 non-vibrio spp., were examined for their ability to grow and produce colored colonies on bcvm. growth of salmonella, shigella, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, yersinia enterocolitica, and aeromonas was inhibited by both bcvm and tcbs. all 148 strains of v. parahaemolyticus grew on bcvm, and 145 of them produced purple colonies. the remaining 31 vibrio spp., except one strain of vibrio fluvialis, were either unable to grow or produced blue-green or white colonies on bcvm. bio-chrome vibrio medium was capable of differentiating v. parahaemolyticus from other species, including v. vulnificus and v. mimicus. further studies are needed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of bcvm for detecting v. parahaemolyticus in foods.
[antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin under various conditions against standard strains, beta-lactam resistant strains, and multidrug efflux system mutants].
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible benefit of fosfomycin (fom) as prophylactic antibiotic in terms of antimicrobial activity and the potential of inducibility of beta-lactamase, compared with cefazolin, cefotiam, cefmetazole, and piperacillin that are commonly used as perioperative agents. the in vitro activity of fom against aerobic gram-negative bacteria using mueller-hinton agar or nutrient agar supplemented with glucose-6-phosphate (g6p) as tested medium increased within a range from 2 to 256 times the activity in the medium without g6p. however, the susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria to fom remained largely unchanged with or without g6p. there was no aerobic- or anaerobic-bacteria which changed susceptibility against beta-lactam antibiotics under various tested medium conditions. fom demonstrated strong bactericidal activity against escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa in a dose dependent manner, and decreased viable cell counts of staphylococcus aureus. in the case of p. aeruginosa, transmission electron micrographs study revealed that numerous lysed cells were present 2 hours after treatment with fom at four times the mic. first and second generation cephalosporins induced ampc-type beta-lactamase in a dose dependent manner among beta-lactamase inducible strains of p. aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae. on the other hand, inducible activity of fom on beta-lactamase production was less than 1/25 to 1/65 compared with those of cephalosporins. in addition, fom maintained strong antimicrobial activity for over then 20 years after marketing, because of the excellent stability against various types of beta-lactamase produced by plasmid-carrying bacteria and clinical isolates. fom was not extruded by four types of efflux systems, such as mexab-oprm, mexcd-oprj, mexxy/ oprm and mexef-oprn, however beta-lactam antibiotics were substrates of mexab-oprm and mexcd-oprj. in conclusion, fom provides adequate coverage for both aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria causing postoperative infections. further, fom would not select/concentrate beta-lactamase producing bacteria in the clinical fields and would not be a substrate for multidrug efflux system of p. aeruginosa.
temporal changes in bacterial resistance in german intensive care units, 2001-2003: data from the sari (surveillance of antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance in intensive care units) project.
conservative testing revealed a stable antibiotic resistance situation for staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae in 32 german intensive care units (icus) actively participating in the sari (surveillance of antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance in icus) project over a three-year period (2001--2003). no significant changes were shown for methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) (p=0.501; the mrsa rate increased in 18 icus and decreased in 14 icus). the only exception was an increase in ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli.
the rising influx of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli into a tertiary care hospital.
background: the prevalence of multidrug resistance (mdr) among gram-negative bacilli is rapidly increasing. quantification of the prevalence and the common antimicrobial coresistance patterns of mdr gram-negative bacilli (mdr-gnb) isolates recovered from patients at hospital admission, as well as identification of patients with a high risk of harboring mdr-gnb, would have important implications for patient care. methods: over a 6-year period, patients who harbored mdr-gnb (i.e., patients who had mdr-gnb isolates recovered from clinical cultures within the first 48 h after hospital admission) were identified. "mdr-gnb isolates" were defined as pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, and klebsiella species isolates with resistance to at least 3 antimicrobial groups. a case-control study was performed to determine the independent risk factors for harboring mdr-gnb at hospital admission. results: between 1998 and 2003, the prevalence of mdr-gnb isolates recovered from patients at hospital admission increased significantly for all isolate species (p < .001), with the exception of p. aeruginosa (p = .09). of 464 mdr-gnb isolates, 12%, 35%, and 53% of isolates were coresistant to 5, 4, and 3 antimicrobial groups, respectively. multivariable analysis identified age > or = 65 years (odds ratio [or], 2.8; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.1-7.4; p < .04), prior exposure to antibiotics for > or = 14 days (or, 8.7; 95% ci, 2.5 -30; p < .001), and prior residence in a long-term care facility (or, 3.5; 95% ci, 1.3-9.4; p < .01) as independent risk factors for harboring mdr-gnb at hospital admission. conclusion: a substantial number of patients harbor mdr-gnb at hospital admission. identification of common coresistance patterns among mdr-gnb isolates may assist in the selection of empirical antimicrobial therapy for patients with a high risk of harboring mdr-gnb.
in vitro activity of levofloxacin against recent gram-negative nosocomial pathogens.
the objective of our study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of levofloxacin  in comparison with other antibiotics (coamoxiclav, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, meropenem, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin and netilmicin) against about 500 gram-negative nosocomial microorganisms, isolated during 2003. the bactericidal activities (minimal bactericidal activity and killing curve) of levofloxacin and the other antibiotics were also evaluated. the results confirm the excellent in vitro activity of levofloxacin against multiresistant nosocomial gram-negative pathogens, including the 73 extended spectrum beta-lactamase producer strains (90% of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited at 0.5 mg/l). of particular interest is its susceptibility and bactericidal activity against stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains. in conclusion, due to the favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the molecule, associated with its safety, levofloxacin may represent a valid therapeutic option in the treatment of severe gram-negative nosocomial infections.
beta-lactam susceptibilities and prevalence of esbl-producing isolates among more than 5000 european enterobacteriaceae isolates.
in vitro susceptibility to 15 beta-lactam antibiotics was evaluated using enterobacteriaceae isolated during the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. piperacillin/tazobactam was the most active penicillin against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella oxytoca and klebsiella pneumoniae (94.9%, 98.3%, 87.4% and 82.9% of isolates susceptible). of the cephalosporins, cefepime was most effective against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and enterobacter cloacae (99.2%, 96.3% and 95.2% of isolates susceptible, respectively) and cefoxitin against klebsiella oxytoca and klebsiella pneumoniae (98.6% and 95.6% of isolates susceptible). carbapenems had excellent activity (> or =99.5% of all isolates). esbl-production was confirmed with the esbl-etest and disk diffusion test in 1.3% of escherichia coli isolates, 18.4% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 12.6% of klebsiella oxytoca and 5.3% of proteus mirabilis isolates.
intestinal microflora in 45 crows in ueno zoo and the in vitro susceptibilities of 29 escherichia coli isolates to 14 antimicrobial agents.
microorganisms from 45 jungle crows (corvus macrorhynchos) captured from july to  december 2002 at ueno zoo, tokyo were identified as escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter agglomerans, pseudomonas maltophila, staphylococcus spp., micrococcus spp., and streptococcus spp. e. coli showed the highest rate of isolation (21.6%). in an in vitro susceptibility test for 29 isolates of e. coli to 14 antimicrobial agents, all the isolates were resistant to penicillin g, vancomycin, erythromycin, lincomycin, bicozamycin, sulfadimethoxine, and olaquindox. several isolates of them were also resistant to tetracycline, oxytetracycline, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. twenty-nine isolates were divided into 19 serogroups and the most frequently identified serogroups were o8, o114 and o144, which showed the same multidrug-resistant patterns.
mechanism of action of nb2001 and nb2030, novel antibacterial agents activated by beta-lactamases.
two potent antibacterial agents designed to undergo enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic  activation were evaluated for their mechanisms of action. the compounds, nb2001 and nb2030, contain a cephalosporin with a thienyl (nb2001) or a tetrazole (nb2030) ring at the c-7 position and are linked to the antibacterial triclosan at the c-3 position. the compounds exploit beta-lactamases to release triclosan through hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring. like cephalothin, nb2001 and nb2030 were hydrolyzed by class a beta-lactamases (escherichia coli tem-1 and, to a lesser degree, staphylococcus aureus pc1) and class c beta-lactamases (enterobacter cloacae p99 and e. coli ampc) with comparable catalytic efficiencies (k(cat)/k(m)). they also bound to the penicillin-binding proteins of s. aureus and e. coli, but with reduced affinities relative to that of cephalothin. accordingly, they produced a cell morphology in e. coli consistent with the toxophore rather than the beta-lactam being responsible for antibacterial activity. in biochemical assays, they inhibited the triclosan target enoyl reductase (fabi), with 50% inhibitory concentrations being markedly reduced relative to that of free triclosan. the transport of nb2001, nb2030, and triclosan was rapid, with significant accumulation of triclosan in both s. aureus and e. coli. taken together, the results suggest that nb2001 and nb2030 act primarily as triclosan prodrugs in s. aureus and e. coli.
evaluation of parameters affecting quantitative detection of escherichia coli o157 in enriched water samples using immunomagnetic electrochemiluminescence.
we report here the use of immunomagnetic (im) electrochemiluminescence (ecl) for  quantitative detection of esherichia coli o157:h7 in water samples following enrichment in minimal lactose broth (mlb). im beads prepared in-house with four commercial anti-o157 monoclonal antibodies were compared for efficiency of cell capture. im-ecl responses for e. coli o157:h7 (strain sea13b88) were similar for all four commercial anti-o157 lps monoclonal antibodies. the ecl signal was linearly correlated with e. coli o157:h7 cell concentration, indicating a constant ecl response per cell. twenty-two strains of e. coli o157:h7 or o157:nm gave comparable ecl signals using im beads prepared in-house. to assess the potential for interference from background bacteria in mlb-enriched water samples, 10(4) cells of e. coli o157:h7 (strain sea13b88) were added to enriched samples prior to analysis. there was considerable variability in recovery of e. coli o157:h7 cells; net ecl signals ranged from 1% to 100% of expected values (i.e., percent inhibition from 0% to 99%). cultures of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, and enterobacter cloacae, subsequently isolated from mlb-enriched water samples via im separation (ims), were observed to interfere with the binding of e. coli o157:h7 cells to im beads. recoveries of 10(4) e. coli o157:h7 cells were </=10% in the presence of ca. 10(8) k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, or e. cloacae cells. none of these strains gave a positive im-ecl signal. although competitive binding decreased sensitivity, there still was a linear correlation between ecl signal and higher e. coli o157:h7 cell concentrations. these studies indicate that im-ecl in conjunction with mlb enrichment is capable of quantitatively detecting as few as 10(3) to 10(5) e. coli o157:h7 cells ml(-1), depending on percent recoveries, in enriched samples that contain ca. 10(9) total lactose-fermenting bacteria ml(-1). assuming comparable growth rates for e. coli o157:h7 and other lactose-fermenting bacteria in mlb, it may be possible to detect as few as one e. coli o157:h7 in 100 ml of raw water containing as many as 10(4) to 10(6) lactose-fermenting bacteria (i.e., total coliforms).
contemporary re-evaluation of the activity and spectrum of grepafloxacin tested against isolates in the united states.
grepafloxacin potency and spectrum of activity were re-evaluated against contemporary pathogens collected from clinical infections in 2001-2002. a total of 995 isolates were tested for grepafloxacin by the reference agar dilution method and these results were compared to those of 25 other antimicrobial agents. grepafloxacin activity remained comparable to that of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae (mic(90), 0.03-2 microg/ml; 0.0-7.7% resistance rates). for pseudomonas aeruginosa, grepafloxacin was active against ciprofloxacin-susceptible (mic(90), 2 microg/ml), but not against ciprofloxacin-resistant (mic(90), >8 microg/ml) isolates. against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, grepafloxacin susceptibility rate was 91.4%, equal to that of levofloxacin. none of the fluoroquinolones showed reasonable activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci. gatifloxacin and grepafloxacin had the same mic(90) against beta-hemolytic streptococci (0.25 microg/ml) and penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (0.25 microg/ml). grepafloxacin and other fluoroquinolone activities were not influenced by penicillin resistance in s. pneumoniae. grepafloxacin was very active against haemophilus influenzae (mic(90), 0.03 microg/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic(90), 0.03 microg/ml) and legionella spp. (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml). these results on recently isolated organisms indicate that grepafloxacin has a sustained potency and spectrum against most clinically important and indicated pathogens.
[surveillance on drug resistance of gram-negative bacilli isolated from hospital  acquired infections and community acquired infections (2000 - 2001)].
objective: to determine the resistance rates of gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with hospital acquired infections (hai) or community acquired infections (cai) in the 34 study wards of 13 hospitals located at different areas in china. methods: 1596 strains of gram-negative bacilli from the 2401 pathogenic strains isolated from 13 hospitals 1 july 2000 to 30 june 2001 were collected for susceptibility test using international standard two-fold agar dilution method. according to the criteria of guidelines of nccls (2001), mic(50) and mic(90) were detected for antibacterial activity of antimicrobial agents and r%, i%, and s%, were calculated to show the resistant, intermediate and susceptible rates of bacteria to the compounds tested. results: 15 species of gram-negative pathogens were isolated and most of them could be isolated from both cai and hai patients. the resistance rates of isolates, especially enterobacter cloacae, serratia spp. and acinetobacter spp. from hai were higher than those of cai. the carbopenems were the most active compounds tested against enterobacteriaceae. cefoperozone/sulbactam and cefprime demonstrated excellent activity against most of gram-negative bacilli. most of the gram-negative bacilli were still rather susceptible to cefatazidime, a third generation cephalosporin, with a susceptibility rate of 70% to 100%. fluoroquinolones showed strong and broad-spectrum activity against gram-negative bacilli, but more than 50% of escherichia coli strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones, and the susceptible rates to fluoroquinolones of pseudomonas aeruginosa and haemophilus influenzae had decreased. conclusion: (1) the results obtained in the two surveillance-years, 2000 - 2001 and 1998 - 1999, were similar in the bacterial resistance pattern and the trend of rising of resistant rates for some gram-negative pathogens. (2) the resistance rates of isolates from hai patients were higher than those of cai.
[continuous surveillance of antimicrobial resistance among nosocomial gram-negative bacilli from intensive care units in china].
objective: to investigate the change of antimicrobial resistance among nosocomial gram-negative bacilli, especially those of enterobacteriaceae isolated from intensive care units from 1994 to 2001 in china. methods: e test was made to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of 10 279 isolates of gram-negative bacilli (including 5 829 strains of bacilli of enterobacteriaceae) from 32 hospitals in china from 1994 to 2001. results: the most common pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa; escherichia coli, klebsiella spp, acinetobacter spp. enterobacter spp, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. the most common pathogens in respiratory tract specimens were pseudomonas aeruginosa (25%), klebsiella pneumoniae (18%), and acinetobacter baumanni (11%). the most common pathogens in blood and urine specimens were escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the antibiotic remaining the most active against all of the gram-negative bacilli for 7 years was imipenem (with a susceptibility rate of 87%), followed by cefoperazone/sulbactam (however, with a susceptibility rate decreasing from 86% to 75%), amikacin (75%), ceftazidime (73%), cefepime (72%), and piperacillin/tazobactam (71%). the susceptibility rate of escherichia coli klebsiella pneumoniae to imipenem remained 98% with a mic(90) of 0.5 micro g/ml during the 7 years, much higher than those to amikacin (84%), ceftazidime (83%), cefoperazone/sulbactam (83%), piperacillin/tazobactam (80%), and cefepime (80%). the susceptibility rate of these two species to cefoperazone/sulbactam decreased from 90% in 1996 to 74% in 2001. while the susceptibility to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone decreased from 82% to 57%. the susceptibility rate of escherichia coli to ciprofloxacin decreased from 54% to 25% and that of klebsiella pneumoniae to ciprofloxacin decreased from 90% to 75%. the prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases in these two species increased from 11% in 1994 to 34% in 2001. the most active antibiotics against enterobacter cloacae were imipenem, cefepime, amikacin with the susceptible rates of 95%, 76%, and 70%, respectively; the susceptibility rates of citrobacter freundii to imipenem, cefepime, amikacin, and cefoperazone/sulbactam were 94%, 80%, 80%, and 78% respectively. only 40% approximately 60% isolates of enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii were susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins. conclusion: imipenem remains highly active against enterobacteriaceae, but the activities of other antibiotics have decreased in recent years.
trends in antimicrobial susceptibilities among enterobacteriaceae isolated from hospitalized patients in the united states from 1998 to 2001.
longitudinal surveillance of enterobacteriaceae for antimicrobial susceptibility  is important because species of this family are among the most significant and prevalent human pathogens. to estimate rates of in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility among hospitalized patients in the united states, data from the surveillance network were studied for 14 agents tested against 10 species of enterobacteriaceae (n = 384,279) isolated from intensive-care-unit (icu) patients and non-icu inpatients from 1998 to 2001. cumulative susceptibility (percent) data for all species of enterobacteriaceae isolated from icu patients and non-icu inpatients, respectively, were ranked as follows: ampicillin-sulbactam (45.5 and 57.2) << ticarcillin-clavulanate (74.8 and 83.5) < trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (87.0 and 84.5) congruent with cefotaxime (82.9 and 92.6) = ceftazidime (82.3 and 91.0) = ceftriaxone (86.5 and 93.9) = piperacillin-tazobactam (83.5 and 90.5) < levofloxacin (89.3 and 90.6) = ciprofloxacin (91.0 and 91.7) < gentamicin (91.8 and 94.3) < cefepime (95.0 and 97.9) < amikacin (98.5 and 99.2) < imipenem (100 and 100) = meropenem (100 and 100). of those agents studied only susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin (94 to 89%) and levofloxacin (93 to 89%) decreased in a stepwise manner from 1998 to 2001. decreased fluoroquinolone susceptibility was most pronounced for escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae. for all species of enterobacteriaceae, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance was more commonly observed in isolates with a single-drug resistance phenotype while gentamicin and fluoroquinolone resistances were more common in isolates resistant to at least one additional class of antimicrobial agent. ongoing surveillance of enterobacteriaceae will be particularly important to monitor changes in fluoroquinolone susceptibility, as well as changes in the prevalence of isolates resistant to multiple classes of antimicrobial agents.
in vitro and in vivo activities of am-112, a novel oxapenem.
am-112 [(1'r,5r,6r)-3-(4-amino-1,1-dimethyl-butyl)-6-(1'-hydroxyethyl)oxapenem-3-carboxy late] is a novel oxapenem compound which possesses potent beta-lactamase-inhibitory properties. fifty-percent inhibitory concentrations (ic(50)s) of am-112 for class a enzymes were between 0.16 and 2.24 micro m for three enzymes, compared to ic(50)s of 0.008 to 0.12 micro m for clavulanic acid. against class c and class d enzymes, however, the activity of am-112 was between 1,000- and 100,000-fold greater than that of clavulanic acid. am-112 had affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of escherichia coli dc0, with pbp2 being inhibited by the lowest concentration of am-112 tested, 0.1 micro g/ml. ceftazidime was combined with am-112 at 1:1 and 2:1 ratios in mic determination studies against a panel of beta-lactamase-producing organisms. these studies demonstrated that am-112 was effective at protecting ceftazidime against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains and derepressed class c enzyme producers, reducing ceftazidime mics by 16- and 2,048-fold. similar results were obtained when am-112 was combined with ceftriaxone, cefoperazone, or cefepime in a 1:2 ratio. protection of ceftazidime with am-112 was maintained against enterobacter cloacae p99 and klebsiella pneumoniae shv-5 in a murine intraperitoneal sepsis model. the 50% effective dose of ceftazidime against e. cloacae p99 and k. pneumoniae shv-5 was reduced from >100 and 160 mg/kg of body weight to 2 and 33.6 mg/kg, respectively, when it was combined with am-112 at a 1:1 ratio. am-112 demonstrates potential as a new beta-lactamase inhibitor.
evaluation of antibacterial efficacy of drugs for urinary tract infections by genotyping based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge).
we attempted to determine whether the same bacterium isolated from patients with  urinary tract infections (uti) before and after treatment with antimicrobial agents was of the same strain ("persisted") or of a different strain ("changed"). furthermore, to verify the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents for uti, we investigated whether bacterial strains could be classified as persisted or changed based on their electrophoretic patterns in pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). we examined eight species of bacteria ( enterococcus avium, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas fluorescens, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and escherichia coli), consisting of 41 strains (19 pairs isolated before and after treatment with antimicrobial agents) isolated from patients with complicated uti. it was concluded that all bacteria were unchanged, based on the clinical effect on bacteriuria. the chromosomal dna of these bacteria was digested with restriction enzymes and classified based on their electrophoretic pattern in pfge. a comparison of the patterns of the fragments revealed that 14 pairs were indistinguishable before and after treatment, 3 pairs were closely related, 1 pair was possibly related, and 1 pair was different. these results demonstrated that 18 pairs of isolates (indistinguishable, closely related, and possibly related) were highly likely to be continued infections by the same strain, and that 1 pair (different) had been replaced by another strain. based on these results, we believe that bacterium genotyping by pfge is a more effective method for evaluating the antibacterial efficacy of antimicrobial agents.
development of a sensitive and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detecting and quantifying cmy-2 and shv beta-lactamases.
polyclonal rabbit antibodies against shv-1 and cmy-2 beta-lactamases were produced and characterized, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisas) were developed. immunoblots revealed that the anti-shv-1 antibody recognized shv-1 but did not recognize tem-1, k-1, oxa-1, or any ampc beta-lactamase tested. the anti-cmy-2 antibody detected escherichia coli cmy-2, enterobacter cloacae p99, klebsiella pneumoniae act-1, and the ampc beta-lactamases of enterobacter aerogenes, morganella morganii, and citrobacter freundii. no cross-reactivity of the anti-cmy-2 antibody was seen against laboratory strains of e. coli possessing tem-1, shv-1, k-1, or oxa-1 beta-lactamases. operating conditions for performing elisas were optimized. both anti-cmy-2 and anti-shv-1 antibodies detected picogram quantities of purified protein in elisas. the reactivity of the anti-cmy-2 antibody was tested against a number of ampc beta-lactamases by assaying known quantities of purified enzymes in elisas (ampc beta-lactamases of m. morganii, c. freundii, e. coli, and e. cloacae). as the homology to cmy-2 beta-lactamase decreased, the minimum level needed for detection increased (e.g., 94% homology recognized at 1 ng/ml and 71% homology recognized at 10 ng/ml). the elisas were used to assay unknown clinical isolates for ampc and shv beta-lactamases, and the results were confirmed with pcr amplification of bla(ampc) and bla(shv) genes. overall, we found that our elisas were at least 95% sensitive and specific for detecting shv and ampc beta-lactamases. the elisa format can facilitate the identification of ampc and shv beta-lactamases and can be used to quantify relative amounts of beta-lactamase enzymes in clinical and laboratory isolates.
nb2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ecta) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. we present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ecta compounds, nb2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of nb2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) nb2001 is a substrate for tem-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of greater than 77,000 m-1 s-1. (ii) triclosan is detected in nb2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli but not in e. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) nb2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing e. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. nb2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. nb2001 is also active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. the results indicate that nb2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent and demonstrate the potential of ecta in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.
trends in quinolone susceptibility of enterobacteriaceae among inpatients of a large university hospital: 1992-98.
objectives: to assess trends in quinolone susceptibility of enterobacteriaceae isolated in a large university hospital. methods: between 1992 and 1998, bacterial isolates were collected each year during a 3-month period to evaluate annual changes in susceptibility. in addition, the activities of fluoroquinolones (pefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin) against nalidixic acid-resistant strains were determined by disk diffusion and mic methodologies during the first and last year of the study. results: the susceptibility of enterobacteriaceae to nalidixic acid was unchanged between 1992 and 1998 (86% versus 85%). however, at the species level, the susceptibility rates to nalidixic acid decreased for escherichia coli from 92% to 89%, and for enterobacter cloacae from 87% to 82%. in contrast, there was a 10% increase in the nalidixic acid susceptibility rates for klebsiella pneumoniae (74% versus 83%), which was thought to be due to the control of the spread of epidemic extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains. the overall susceptibility of the enterobacteriaceae to the fluoroquinolones remained high during the study period, greater than 90% in the case of ciprofloxacin. however, nalidixic acid-resistant escherichia coli showed decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin between 1992 and 1998, as reflected by a decrease in median zone diameter (26 mm to 19 mm), an increase in mic(50) (0.25 mg/l to 1 mg/l) and a shift in mic distribution (unimodal in 1992 to bimodal in 1998). this has resulted in the reduced susceptibility of escherichia coli to fluoroquinolones between 1992 and 1998 (pefloxacin, 95-90%; ciprofloxacin, 99-95%). conclusions: the susceptibility of escherichia coli to quinolones has decreased, and the level of susceptibility of the resistant strains has increased over the 7-year study period.
in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in taiwan.
the in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. a total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the national taiwan university hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. for many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. some strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. moxifloxacin was less active against p. aeruginosa, but was more active against s. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in taiwan.
antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolone photodegradation products determined by parallel-line bioassay and high performance liquid chromatography.
the fluoroquinolones produce multiple photodegradation products. little is known  about these products, particularly whether any possess antimicrobial activity. to investigate this, we used the parallel-line bioassay to investigate discrepancies in zone of inhibition size in conjunction with high performance liquid chromatography (hplc) analysis. a continuous flow photochemical reaction unit ('beam-boost') was used to partially photodegrade the fluoroquinolones ofloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin (0.02 mm) by between 15 and 89%, as confirmed by hplc. the concentration of residual parent fluoroquinolone in each irradiated sample was measured by hplc and a non-irradiated control solution was prepared at the same concentration. these were compared by parallel-line bioassays using escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca. with ofloxacin and levofloxacin, the zone size for the control solution was significantly less than that of the irradiated solutions, with >15% photodegradation in at least two of the indicator organisms, indicating that the photodegradation products possess antimicrobial activity. no difference was seen with ciprofloxacin at any level of photodegradation with any of the indicator organisms, nor with moxifloxacin at 30 and 54% photodegradation. a significant difference was observed with e. cloacae only, at 83% photodegradation.
antimicrobial properties and mode of action of the pyrrothine holomycin.
holomycin, a member of the pyrrothine class of antibiotics, displayed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, inhibiting a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, with the exception of enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the antibiotic lacked activity against the eukaryotic microorganisms saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida kefyr. holomycin exhibited a bacteriostatic response against escherichia coli that was associated with rapid inhibition of rna synthesis in whole cells. inhibition of rna synthesis could have been a secondary consequence of inhibiting trna aminoacylation, thereby inducing the stringent response. however, the levels of inhibition of rna synthesis by holomycin were similar in a stringent and relaxed pair of e. coli strains that were isogenic except for the deletion of the rela gene. this suggests that inhibition of rna synthesis by holomycin could reflect direct inhibition of dna-dependent rna polymerase. examination of the effects of holomycin on the kinetics of the appearance of beta-galactosidase in induced e. coli cells was also consistent with inhibition of rna polymerase at the level of rna chain elongation. however, holomycin only weakly inhibited e. coli rna polymerase in assays using synthetic poly(da-dt) and plasmid templates. furthermore, inhibition of rna polymerase was observed only at holomycin concentrations in excess of those required to inhibit the growth of e. coli. it is possible that holomycin is a prodrug, requiring conversion in the cell to an active species that inhibits rna polymerase.
in vitro antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin against 873 clinical isolates from respiratory tract, urinary tract and surgical infections during 1997-1998 in japan.
the in vitro activity of gatifloxacin was determined for 873 isolates from various infections during 1997-1998 in japan. gatifloxacin was active against streptococci, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae, with mic(90)s of </=0.39 mg/l. the activity was two- to 32-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria, and comparable to that against gram-negative bacteria. gatifloxacin was more active than the other quinolones against quinolone-resistant staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. it also had good activity against penicillin- or macrolide-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae.
evaluation of the in vitro activity of six broad-spectrum beta-lactam antimicrobial agents tested against over 2,000 clinical isolates from 22 medical centers in japan. japan antimicrobial resistance study group.
numerous broad-spectrum beta-lactam antimicrobial agents have been introduced into medical practice since 1985. although several of these compounds have advanced, infectious disease therapy resistances to them has also emerged world-wide. in 1997, a japanese 22 medical center investigation was initiated to assess the continued utility of these agents (oxacillin or piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, cefoperazone/sulbactam [c/s], imipenem). the participating medical centers represented a wide geographic distribution, and a common protocol and reagents were applied. three control strains and a set of challenge organisms were provided to participant centers. etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) strips were used in concurrent tests of these organisms and a qualitative determination of participant skills in the identification of resistant and susceptible phenotypes was established. the quantitative controls demonstrated 97.7-99.2% of mic values within established qc limits, and the qualitative (susceptibility category) controls documented a 97.3% agreement of participant results with that of reference values (1,320 total results). only 0.2% of values were false-susceptible errors. after the participant quality was assured, a total of 2,015 clinical strains were tested (10 strains from 10 different organism groups including methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci [cons], escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., indole-positive proteae, serratia spp., acinetobacter spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa). the staphylococci were uniformly susceptible to all drugs tested except ceftazidime (mic90, 24 micrograms/ml) that had a potency six- to 12-fold less than either cefepime or cefpirome. only 3.7 and 45.1% of s. aureus and cons were susceptible to ceftazidime, respectively. among e. coli and klebsiella spp. the rank order of antimicrobial spectrum was imipenem = "fourth-generation" cephalosporins > ceftazidime > c/s > piperacillin. possible extended spectrum beta-lactamase phenotypes were identified in 2.9-8.6% of these isolates. isolates of c. freundii, enterobacter spp., proteae, and serratia spp. that were resistant to ceftazidime and piperacillin remained susceptible to imipenem (0.0-4.5% resistance) and cefepime (0.0-5.0%). acinetobacters were inhibited best by c/s (99.5% susceptible) and least susceptible to piperacillin (mic90, > 256 micrograms/ml; 21.7% susceptible) activity. p. aeruginosa isolates were most susceptible to cefepime (83.6%) and this zwitterionic cephalosporin also had the lowest level of resistance (9.1% of mics at > or = 32 micrograms/ml). several multi-resistant organisms were identified in participant medical centers including s. marcescens strains resistant to cefepime, imipenem, or both observed in six hospitals. clonal spread was documented in two medical centers; one hospital having two distinct epidemic clusters. also a multi-resistant e. cloacae was found in two patients in the same hospital. evaluations of carbapenem resistance in four species discovered only two strains (in same hospital) among 40 p. aeruginosa isolates (5.0%) with a metallo-enzyme, with nearly all of the remaining strains inhibited by an ambler class c enzyme inhibitor (brl42715) indicating a hyperproduction of a chromosomal cephalosporinase. these results indicate that most newer beta-lactams remain widely useable in medical centers in japan, but emerging often clonal, resistances have occurred. the overall rank order of antimicrobial spectrum against all ten tested bacterial groups favors the "fourth-generation" cephalosporin, cefepime (96.4% susceptible) as an equal to imipenem (95.9%) > c/s (90.9%) = cefpirome (90.0%) > ceftazidime (75.1%) = penicillins, either oxacillin or piperacillin (76.4%).
efficacy of beta-lactam and inhibitor combinations in a diffusion chamber model in rabbits.
using a diffusion chamber in rabbits, we evaluated therapy with the combination of ceftriaxone plus the beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam in comparison with ceftriaxone alone. one sensitive and one resistant strain of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae were inoculated into one of the six diffusion chambers, implanted in the same animal. in order to simulate pharmacokinetics in humans, both substances were administered in decreasing doses. ceftriaxone was given 0, 2, 4 and 6 h after infection in dosages of 45, 35, 25 and 15 mg/kg of body weight, while tazobactam was administered either in one dose at 0 h, or divided into two doses at 0 and 1 h or 0 and 4 h, or divided into three doses at 0, 1 and 4 h after infection. the ratio of ceftriaxone:tazobactam was fixed at 8:1. ceftriaxone, in combination with tazobactam, given in one dose immediately after infection showed a significant reduction in bacterial count. all other combinations of ceftriaxone and tazobactam did not differ from ceftriaxone in monotherapy. co-administration of the beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam significantly enhanced the activity of ceftriaxone against all three tested species.
cloning, sequence analyses, expression, and distribution of ampc-ampr from morganella morganii clinical isolates.
shotgun cloning experiments with restriction enzyme-digested genomic dna from morganella morganii 1, which expresses high levels of cephalosporinase, into the pbkcmv cloning vector gave a recombinant plasmid, ppon-1, which encoded four entire genes: ampc, ampr, an hybf family gene, and orf-1 of unknown function. the deduced ampc beta-lactamase of pi 7.6 shared structural and functional homologies with ampc from citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia marcescens. the overlapping promoter organization of ampc and ampr, although much shorter in m. morganii than in the other enterobacterial species, suggested similar ampr regulatory properties. the mics of beta-lactams for e. coli mc4100 (ampc mutant) harboring recombinant plasmid pacyc184 containing either ampc and ampr (pac-1) or ampc (pac-2) and induction experiments showed that the ampc gene of m. morganii 1 was repressed in the presence of ampr and was activated when a beta-lactam inducer was added. moreover, transformation of m. morganii 1 or of e. coli jrg582 (delta ampde) harboring ampc and ampr with a recombinant plasmid containing ampd from e. cloacae resulted in a decrease in the beta-lactam mics and an inducible phenotype for m. morganii 1, thus underlining the role of an ampd-like protein in the regulation of the m. morganii cephalosporinase. fifteen other m. morganii clinical isolates with phenotypes of either low-level inducible cephalosporinase expression or high-level constitutive cephalosporinase expression harbored the same ampc-ampr organization, with the hybf and orf-1 genes surrounding them; the organization of these genes thus differed from those of ampc-ampr genes in c. freundii and e. cloacae, which are located downstream from the fumarate operon. finally, an identical ampc beta-lactamase (dha-1) was recently identified as being plasmid encoded in salmonella enteritidis, and this is confirmatory evidence of a chromosomal origin of the plasmid-mediated cephalosporinases.
in vivo activities of peptidic prodrugs of novel aminomethyl tetrahydrofuranyl-1  beta-methylcarbapenems.
a series of novel aminomethyl tetrahydrofuranyl (thf)-1 beta-methylcarbapenems which have excellent broad-spectrum antibacterial activities exhibit modest efficacies against acute lethal infections (3.8 mg/kg of body weight against escherichia coli and 0.9 mg/kg against staphylococcus aureus) in mice when they are administered orally. in an effort to improve the efficacies of orally administered drugs through enhanced absorption by making use of a peptide-mediated transport system, several different amino acids were added at the aminomethyl thf side chains of the carbapenem molecules. the resulting peptidic prodrugs with l-amino acids demonstrated improved efficacy after oral administration, while the d forms were less active than the parent molecules. after oral administration increased (3 to 10 times) efficacy was exhibited with the alanine-, valine-, isoleucine-, and phenylalanine-substituted prodrugs against acute lethal infections in mice. median effective doses (ed50s) of < 1 mg/kg against infections caused by s. aureus, e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, or penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae were obtained after the administration of single oral doses. several of the peptidic prodrugs were efficacious against morganella morganii, serratia marcescens, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, and e. coli infections, with ed50s of 1 to 14 mg/kg by oral administration compared with ed50s of 14 to > 32 mg/kg for the parent molecules. in general, the parent molecules demonstrated greater efficacy than the prodrugs against these same infections when the drugs were administered by the subcutaneous route. the parent molecule was detectable in the sera of mice after oral administration of the peptidic prodrugs.
changes in the incidence and etiological patterns of bacteremia associated with acute leukemia over a 25-year period.
during the 25-year period from 1972-1996, 360 episodes of bacteremia occurred in  248 (45%) of a total of 548 patients with acute leukemia on our hematology ward, with the rate of occurrence remaining almost unchanged. patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, however, had a significant decrease in the incidence of bacteremia during the last 5-year period. gram-negative bacilli decreased in relative frequency from 64% for the first 15-year period to 40% for the last 5-year period, whereas gram-positive cocci increased from 24% to 51%. escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae somewhat decreased in frequency, whereas coagulase-negative staphylococci and streptococci had considerable increases. in contrast, pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated at a relatively constant frequency, forming one of the top two pathogens throughout the study period. despite the shift toward gram-positive cocci, therefore, p. aeruginosa remains a key organism in considering the initial empiric antibiotic regimen and infection prevention during neutropenia.
the in vitro bactericidal effect of microwave energy on bacteria that cause prostatitis.
objectives: we investigated the in vitro nonthermal effects of microwaves delivered from prostatron 2.0 on escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae. methods: the fingers of powder-free, sterile gloves were ligated, and bacterial solutions were transferred into the remaining area of the glove. the gloves were then sealed using silk ligatures. one set of gloves was subjected to the microwave treatment while another set was placed in a temperature-matched waterbath to act as control samples. the gloves containing the treatment group were taped around the probe, at the site where microwave energy exits the probe. during the treatment period, the temperatures from the urethral probe and the rectal probe were carefully monitored. results: the mean (+/-sd) energy delivered was 46.6 +/- 9.5 kj (range 30.0 to 59.5) for the 10 trials on e. coli and colony counts in the experimental microwaved gloves decreased significantly compared with control samples (5.26 +/- 4.5 x 10(5) versus 10.16 +/- 9.3 x 10(5) cfu/ml, p = 0.02). for the experiments on e. cloacae the mean (+/-sd) energy applied was 38.5 +/- 12.5 kj, and a significant decrease in colony counts of microwaved samples was also observed compared with controls (11.04 +/- 4.8 x 10(5) versus 20.08 +/- 10.1 x 10(5) cfu/ml, p = 0.004). conclusions: microwave energy, delivered from prostatron 2.0, independent of heat production has an in vitro bactericidal effect on laboratory-cultured e. coli and e. cloacae.
a rob-like gene of enterobacter cloacae affecting porin synthesis and susceptibility to multiple antibiotics.
a chromosomal gene of enterobacter cloacae affecting the synthesis of major outer membrane proteins in e. cloacae and escherichia coli was cloned by using selection for resistance to cefoxitin in e. coli. the presence of the gene, when plasmid-borne, led to a decrease in the amount of porin f in e. cloacae and the amount of ompf in e. coli and caused 2- to 32-fold increases in the mics of chloramphenicol, tetracycline, quinolones, and beta-lactam antibiotics. the gene encoded a 33-kda protein, similar (83% identity) to the protein rob involved in the initiation of dna replication in e. coli, which was called roba(ec1) by analogy. roba from e. cloacae was found to inhibit ompf expression at the posttranscriptional level via activation of micf, a gene also apparently present in e. cloacae, as detected by pcr. as with its homolog from e. coli, roba(ec1) is related to the xyls-arac class of positive transcriptional regulators, along with mara and soxs, which also cause a micf-mediated decrease in the level of ampf expression.
in vitro and in vivo activities of lb10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
in vitro activity of lb10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. against gram-positive bacteria, lb10522 was most active among the compounds tested. it was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. lb10522 was highly effective against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested. ninety percent of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. these activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, lb10522 with a mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by staphylococcus aureus giorgio, streptococcus pneumoniae iii, pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e, escherichia coli 851e, proteus mirabilis 1315e, serratia marcescens 1826e, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus ac-54. lb10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as tem-3, tem-7, shv-1, fec-1, and p-99. lb10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in enterobacter cloacae 1194e, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. time-kill study showed that lb10522, at concentrations of two or four times the mic, had a rapid bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus 6538p, escherichia coli 851e, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e.
characterization of a cys115 to asp substitution in the escherichia coli cell wall biosynthetic enzyme udp-glcnac enolpyruvyl transferase (mura) that confers resistance to inactivation by the antibiotic fosfomycin.
the antibiotic fosfomycin inhibits bacterial cell wall biosynthesis by inactivation of udp-glcnac enolpyruvyl tranferase (mura). prior work has established that cys115 of escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae mura is the active site nucleophile alkylated by fosfomycin and implicated this residue in the formation of a covalent phospholactyl-enzyme adduct derived from substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate (pep). on the basis of sequencing information from putative mura homolog from mycobacterium tuberculosis, we generated a c115d mutant of e. coli mura that was highly active but fully resistant to time-dependent inhibition by fosfomycin. fosfomycin still bound to the active site of c115d mura, as established by the observed reversible competitive inhibition by fosfomycin. fosfomycin still bound to the active site of c115d mura, as established by the observed reversible competitive inhibition vs pep. in contrast to the broad ph-independent behavior of wild-type (wt) mura, c115d mutant activity titrated across the ph range examined (ph 5.5-9) with an apparent pka approximately 6, with kcatc115d ranging from approximately 10kcatwt at ph 5.5 to <0.1kcatwt at ph9.0. km(pep)115d was relatively constant in the ph range examined and increased approximately 100-fold relative to km(pep)wt. a fosfomycin-resistant c115e mutant with -1% activity of the c115d mutant was found to follow a ph dependence similar to that observed for c115d mura. the contrasting ph dependences of wt and c115d mura was also observed in the reaction with the pseudosubstrate, (z)-3-fluorophosphoenolpyruvate, strongly suggesting a role for cys/asp115 as the general acid in the protonation of c-3 of pep during mura-catalyzed enol ether transfer. the difference in nucleophilicity between the carboxylate side chains of asp115 and glu115 and the thiolate group of cys115 suggests that covalent enzyme adduct formation is not required for catalytic turnover and, furthermore, provides a chemical rationale for the resistance of the c115d and c115e mutants to fosfomycin inactivation.

the frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 657 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of june 1993 to may 1994. of the above total bacterial isolates, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 28.3% and a majority of them were enterococcus faecalis. gram-negative bacteria accounted for 71.7% and most of them were escherichia coli. 1. enterococcus faecalis ampicillin (abpc), imipenem (ipm) and vancomycin (vcm) showed the highest activities against e. faecalis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. the mic90s of them were 2 micrograms/ml. piperacillin (pipc) was also active with the mic90 of 8 micrograms/ml. the others were not so active with the mic90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 2. staphylococcus aureus including mrsa vcm showed the highest activities against s. aureus isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. its mic90 was 1 microgram/ml. arbekacin (abk) was also active with the mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml. the others were not so active with the mic90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 3. staphylococcus epidermidis vcm showed the strongest activity against s. epidermidis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. its mic90 was 1 microgram/ml. abk was also active with the mic90 of 4 micrograms/ml. the others except abpc were not so active with the mic90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 4. streptococcus agalactiae most of the agents were active against s. agalactiae isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. penicillins, cephems, erythromycin (em), and clindamycin (cldm) showed the highest activities. the mic90s of them were 0.25 microgram/ml or below. amikacin (amk) and minocycline (mino) showed somewhat low activities with the mic90s of 16 micrograms/ml. 5. citrobacter freundii ipm showed the highest activities against c. freundii isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. its mic90 was 2 micrograms/ml. cefozopran (czop) and gentamicin (gm) were also active with the mic90s of 8 micrograms/ml. penicillins and cephems generally were not so active. 6. enterobacter cloacae ipm and gm showed the highest activities against e. cloacae. the mic90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. czop and tosufloxacin (tflx) were also active with the mic90s of 8 micrograms/ml. penicillins and cephems except czop showed lower activities with the mic90s of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 7. escherichia coli most of antimicrobial agents were active against e. coli. flomoxef (fmox), czop, ipm, cpfx and tflx showed the highest activities against e. coli. the mic90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. cefmenoxime (cmx), ceftazidime (caz), cefuzonam (czon), latamoxef (lmox), carumonam (crmn), norfloxacin (nflx) and ofloxacin (oflx) were also active with the mic90s of 0.25 microgram/ml. penicillins and mino were not so active with the mic90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 8. klebsiella pneumoniae czop, ipm and crmn showed the highest activities against k. pneumoniae. the mic90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. caz, czon, cfix, cpfx and tflx were also active the mic90s of 0.25 microgram/ml. penicillins were not so active with the mic90s of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 9. proteus mirabilis p. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. cmx, caz, czon, lmox, cfix, crmn and cpfx showed the highest activities against p. mirabilis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. the mic90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. mino was not so active with the mic90 of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 10. pseudomonas aeruginosa most of the agents were not so active against p. aeruginosa. ipm showed mic90 of 8 micrograms/ml.
inhibitory action of metabolites of pseudomonas aeruginosa against gram-negative  bacteria.
fifty clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested for inhibition of growth of clinical isolates of escherichia coli, salmonella infantis, klebsiella pneumoniae and other gram-negative bacteria in the authors' laboratory. pseudomonas aeruginosa was strongly active against both e. coli and enterobacter cloacae, with 89.4% and 94.7% inhibition respectively, but weakly active against s. infantis, k. pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis with 56.3%, 48.8% and 23.8% inhibition, respectively. the pigmented strains were found to have stronger antimicrobial activity than the unpigmented strains. pyocyanin, the major metabolite of pseudomonas aeruginosa, has been shown to inhibit escherichia coli, proteus spp. and other gram-negative bacteria, by research with a few strains of p. aeruginosa and a single inhibited strain. however, little attempt has been made to determine the inhibitory action of many strains of p. aeruginosa against a large number of clinical isolates such as escherichia spp., klebsiella spp., and salmonella spp., up to now. for this reason, in this study we examined 50 randomly selected clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa for inhibition of growth of a wide range of gram-negative bacteria, including 30 strains of e. coli, 30 of k. pneumoniae, 30 of s. infantis, 6 of enterobacter cloacae and 9 of proteus mirabilis.
biological and immunological comparisons of enterobacter cloacae and escherichia  coli porins.
bacteriocin susceptibilities indicate that during cloacin df13 uptake the f porin of enterobacter cloacae plays a similar role to that reported for the ompf porin of escherichia coli during colicin a entry. the translocatory activities of these two porins during the bacteriocin uptake can be substituted by the porins d and ompc, respectively, under conditions not requiring the receptor binding step. using anti-peptide antibodies, a peptide located in the internal loop l3 of the escherichia coli ompf porin was identified in the d and f porins of enterobacter cloacae. the results demonstrated the existence of a close relationship between porins in terms of both antigenic determinants and bacteriocin susceptibilities.
[bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of sy5555 dry syrup in the pediatric field].
bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on sy5555 dry syrup (powder which is dissolved before use), a new penem antibiotic for oral use, were performed. the following results were obtained. 1. antibacterial activities. mics of sy5555, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (cva/ampc), cefotiam (ctm), cefpodoxime (cpdx), cefaclor (ccl) and cefdinir (cfdn) were determined against clinically isolated staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae at a dose of 10(6) cfu/ml. mics of sy5555 against s. aureus, cns, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, e. coli and e. cloacae were 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, < or = 0.025, 0.78, 0.2, 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing excellent antibacterial effects on these pathogens. although the effects of sy 5555 against h. influenzae and e. coli were slightly inferior to those of cpdx and cfdn, the drug showed the most excellent antibacterial effect on other strains as compared with the control drugs. 2. absorption and excretion in this study, plasma concentrations and urinary recovery rates were examined after administration of sy5555 at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg (potency) after meals. with both 5 and 10 mg/kg doses, peak plasma concentrations were reached 1 hour after administration, at 0.25-2.61 micrograms/ml (mean 1.47 micrograms/ml) and 1.08-2.17 micrograms/ml (mean 1.74 micrograms/ml), respectively. the plasma levels rapidly decreased to 0.06-0.19 micrograms/ml (0.12 micrograms/ml) and 0.0503-0.0637 micrograms/ml) after 6 hours. the half-lives 1.12 hours in the 5 mg/kg group and 1.0 hour in the 10 mg/kg group. the urinary recovery rates were determined in the first 8 hours after administration in the 5 mg/kg and 6 hours in the 10 mg/kg group, and the values were as low as 1.05-12.3% and 1.6-4.33%, respectively. 3. clinical results the clinical responses were examined in a total of 73 cases including 4 acute pneumonia, 13 acute bronchitis, 11 tonsillitis, 3 pharyngitis, 12 scarlet fever, 2 pertussis, 6 urinary tract infection, 6 otitis media, 7 lymphadenitis, 2 staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, 2 phlegmon, 4 impetigo and 1 purulent parotitis. the treatment was effective or better in 66 of 70 cases with an efficacy rate of 94.3% (3 undeterminable cases were excluded). bacteriological effects were examined during the clinical course for detected or suspected pathogens found before administration of sy5555. the effects were determined in 50 cases including 7 cases of polymicrobacterial infections, 57 strains in total. eight strains, however, persisted, hence the overall eradication rate was 86.0%.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
resistance of bacterial strains to dry conditions: use of anhydrous silica gel in a desiccation model system.
the viability of 18 bacterial strains desiccated on anhydrous silica gel and stored at a temperature of 22 degrees c for at least 3 months was determined. according to their stability in the dried state, these strains could be classified into three typical groups. group 1, containing gram-positive strains and salmonella serotypes, was marked by a very slow decrease of the concentration of culturable cells from day 14 on (respectively day 21 for salmonella thompson). the rate of decrease expressed as regression coefficient (b) ranged from -0.000389 to -0.00521 log (cfp ml-1) per d. the group 2 strains enterobacter cloacae and escherichia coli did not reach a comparable slow decrease in the dry material within the indicated time period. regression coefficients were respectively -0.04406 and -0.03412 log (cfp ml-1) per d. the reciprocal values -(1/b) were respectively 23 d per log (cfp ml-1) and 29 d per log (cfp ml-1), indicating the time periods in which a reduction of 1 log unit of culturable cells occurred. group 3 strains pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila and aer. sobria were marked by a significant susceptibility to cell damage caused during desiccation and reconstitution. a high initial decrease (id) of the concentration of culturable organisms seems to be a characteristic property of these bacterial strains: culturable organisms could not be detected after storage for 1 d (aer. hydrophila, aer. sobria) or 7 d (ps. aeruginosa). the wide range of resistance of the different bacterial strains tested indicated that the silica gel model system is a suitable tool for microbiological challenge tests to investigate the survival of micro-organisms exposed to desiccation and their stability in dry materials.
in vitro activity of cp-99,219, a novel 7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl) naphthyridone antimicrobial.
the in vitro activity of cp-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. cp-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin g and erythromycin (mic90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against s. pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). the activity of cp-99,219 against enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, c. diversus, helicobacter pylori, and k. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with mic90 values to cp-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for cp-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. cp-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x mic against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented mueller-hinton broths. the spectrum and potency observed with cp-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.
induction of cecropin-like and attacin-like antibacterial but not antiviral activity in heliothis virescens larvae.
inducible cecropin-like and attacin-like proteins were isolated from immune hemolymph obtained from vaccinated heliothis virescens larvae. the attacin-like protein had a molecular weight of approximately 25,000 daltons and was not dialyzable. the cecropin-like peptide had an estimated molecular weight of 6,000-7,000 daltons and was dialyzable, heat-stable and sensitive to trypsin digestion. the cecropin-like peptide showed bactericidal activity against escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae, and the attacin-like protein showed bactericidal activity against e. coli. the immune hemolymph was bactericidal against e. coli, e. cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. ultrastructural cell envelope damage to e. coli, produced by the immune hemolymph, was observed by scanning electron microscopy. no antiviral activity by the inducible cecropin-like and attacin-like proteins was detected against herpes simplex virus-1 and the vesicular stomatitis virus.
comparative serum bactericidal activities of three doses of ciprofloxacin administered intravenously.
the pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activities of three intravenous doses of ciprofloxacin were studied comparatively in 30 patients. single 200-, 300-, and 400-mg intravenous doses of ciprofloxacin were given over 30 min to 10 patients each, and serum samples were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12 h after the start of the infusion. serum drug concentrations were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by using noncompartmental analysis methods. serum bactericidal activity against clinical isolates of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and staphylococcus aureus was determined for samples obtained at 0.5, 4, 8, and 12 h. excellent activity was demonstrated up to 12 h by all doses against e. coli and e. cloacae. much poorer titers were observed for the remaining organisms, although the 400-mg dose prompted improved results against p. aeruginosa with a mean bactericidal titer of 1:2.9 at 8 h. in conclusion, while the 200-mg dose appears to be largely adequate for infections caused by members of the family enterobacteriaceae, it seems that when p. aeruginosa is involved, 400 mg twice a day or even three times a day is more appropriate. intravenous ciprofloxacin performs poorly against a. calcoaceticus and s. aureus, even at a higher dose.
comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
an agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, shigella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, and haemophilus influenzae with an mic90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, and legionella pneumophila with an mic of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ciprofloxacin inhibited staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (mic90) against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and some other gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. the results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against gram-negative and gram-positive species.
phospholipid impregnation of abdominal rubber drains: resistance to bacterial adherence but no effect on drain-induced bacterial translocation.
in order to evaluate the effect of surface modification of biomaterials on bacterial adherence and bacterial translocation after intraperitoneal biomaterial implantation, phosphatidylcholine- or phosphatidylinositol-impregnated rubber drain pieces, which had been intraperitoneally implanted in the rat for 2 and 7 days, or unimplanted, were incubated in vitro with 3h-labelled escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae. as compared with unimpregnated pieces, the adherence of bacteria significantly decreased to phosphatidylcholine- and phosphatidylinositol-impregnated rubber drain pieces that were either unimplanted or implanted for 2 days, but not for 7 days. the supplementation of albumin in the medium reduced the adherence of bacteria to the unimplanted, unimpregnated drain pieces, but did not further decrease adherence of bacteria to the unimplanted, phospholipid-impregnated brain pieces. bacterial growth was inhibited after incubation in nutrient broth supplemented with phospholipids. the incidence of enteric bacterial translocation induced by intraperitoneal drain implantation did not differ between phospholipid-impregnated and unimpregnated drain pieces. scanning electron microscopy revealed a large amount of biofilm and fibrous deposition on the surface of the implanted, phospholipid-impregnated rubber drain pieces. thus, phospholipid impregnation of rubber drains reduces bacterial adherence and inhibits bacterial growth, without influencing the incidence of bacterial translocation.
in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of ljc 10,627.
the in vitro activity of ljc 10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. ljc 10,627 inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, hafnia alvei, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, proteus rettgeri, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas cepacia, salmonellae, shigellae, aeromonas, and yersiniae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, and moraxellae were inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml. ljc 10,627 was twofold more active than imipenem against aerobic gram-negative organisms and inhibited ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, and gentamicin-resistant members of the genera klebsiella, enterobacter, citrobacter, and serratia at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. xanthomonas maltophilia strains were resistant to the drug. imipenem was two- to fourfold more active than ljc 10,627 against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. ljc 10,627 did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis strains. ljc 10,627 inhibited streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 and 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively. bacteroides fragilis and other bacteroides spp. were inhibited by 0.5 microgram of ljc 10,627 per ml. serum (50%) did not affect the mics. ljc 10,627 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of bush types 2b, 2b', tem-1, tem-2, tem-3, tem-5, tem-7, tem-9, and shv-1; the chromosomal beta-lactamases of bush type 1; p-99; a morganella enzyme; or a citrobacter freundii enzyme. the bush type 2c and 2d enzymes oxa-1, oxa-2, pse-1, pse-2, and pse-4 did not hydrolyze ljc 10,627, nor did the beta-lactamases of staphylococcus aureus, moraxella spp., bacteroides fragilis, and proteus vulgaris. the beta-lactamase of xanthomonas hydrolyzed ljc 10,627, albeit at approximately one-third the rate that imipenem was hydrolyzed.
plasmid profiles of acinetobacter and enterobacter species of hospital origin: restriction endonuclease analysis of plasmid dna and transformation of escherichia coli by r plasmids.
a total of 37 multi-resistant strains (20 acinetobacter calcoaceticus and 17 enterobacter cloacae) were isolated from patients of the intensive care units. all the isolates were examined for resistance to a battery of antimicrobial agents by the disk diffusion method. plasmid profiles and restriction endonuclease analysis of plasmid dna by ecor1 revealed the spread of one a. calcoaceticus and two e. cloacae endemic strains. transformation experiments on escherichia coli competent cells by three plasmids established the presence of r plasmids in the multi-resistant isolates.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents, 1989. a study mainly focused on imipenem. the research group for testing imipenem susceptibilities of clinical isolates].
we investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antimicrobial agents at hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1989. the susceptibility testing was carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: (+++), (++), (+) and (-). ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, bacteroides fragilis and had rather strong activities against enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and achromobacter xylosoxidans, but was less active to staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and xanthomonas maltophilia. ipm has been found to have activities superior to those of other antibiotics tested against e. faecalis, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis. no antibiotics tested showed good activities against mrsa except minocycline.
comparative study of pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activity of ceftizoxime and cefotaxime.
single 2-g intravenous doses of ceftizoxime (czx) and cefotaxime (ctx) were given over 30 min to 10 adult volunteers in a crossover manner on two separate occasions. concentrations of czx, ctx, and the primary metabolite of ctx, desacetylcefotaxime (dctx), in serum, suction-induced-blister fluid, and urine were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by using an extended least-squares modeling program (mkmodel). czx exhibited a half-life in serum (2.05 h) longer than that of ctx (1.43 h) but comparable to that of dctx (2.02 h). the percentage of penetration in blister fluid, estimated by area under the curve ratios, was significantly higher for czx (164.4%) than for ctx (60.8%). serum bactericidal activity, determined for volunteer samples at 1, 6, 8, and 12 h after patients were dosed, against clinical isolates of the bacteroides fragilis group, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and morganella morganii were significantly higher for czx than those for ctx against members of the family enterobacteriaceae at all times. serum bactericidal titers against b. fragilis were also higher for czx than for ctx at 1 h postinfusion. neither czx nor ctx exhibited any bactericidal activity at any other time against the b. fragilis group. in conclusion, the serum bactericidal activity of czx was greater and more-prolonged than that of ctx against tested strains in spite of the in vitro synergistic contribution of dctx to ctx, equal serum elimination half-lives of dctx and czx, and similar antibacterial activity and similar instability under microbiological testing for czx and ctx.
increased resistance to multiple drugs by introduction of the enterobacter cloacae roma gene into ompf porin-deficient mutants of escherichia coli k-12.
introduction of the roma gene cloned from enterobacter cloacae into escherichia coli k-12 resulted in almost complete inhibition of ompf expression and a concomitant increase in resistance to quinolones, beta-lactams, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines. in addition, the roma gene reduced the susceptibility to these multiple drugs even in the ompf porin-deficient mutants of e. coli k-12. results indicate the presence of roma-sensitive penetration pathway(s) for these multiple drugs other than the ompf porin in e. coli.
cefpodoxime: comparative antibacterial activity, influence of growth conditions,  and bactericidal activity.
the antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of the new cephalosporin ester cefpodoxime proxetil, in comparison to cefixime, cefotiam, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime was determined against a broad spectrum of freshly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. cefpodoxime was demonstrated to be inhibitory at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 90% of strains of moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli (beta-lactamase- negative strains), klebsiella spp., serratia spp., proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia spp., and salmonella spp. this antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was generally superior to that of cefuroxime and similar to that of cefixime. cefpodoxime was active at less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 50% of the members of beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter spp., and morganella morganii. cefpodoxime proved to be highly inhibitory against group a, b, and g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90 less than 0.015 mg/l). the mics of cefpodoxime and those of the other cephalosporins were less than 2 mg/l for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, with the exception of cefixime which had no activity with mics below 8 mg/l against these bacteria. pseudomonas spp., acinetobacter spp., and enterococcus spp. were resistant to cefpodoxime. the antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime was only to a minor degree influenced by different growth conditions with the exception of high inoculum sizes against some beta-lactamase producing strains of gram-negative bacilli.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
in vitro activity of cefcanel versus other oral cephalosporins.
cefcanel is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. its activity was compared with that of cefuroxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, and cefixime against gram-positive and negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. cefcanel had excellent activity against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, mic90 1 micrograms/ml, superior to the other oral cephalosporins. however, methicillin-resistant staphylococci were resistant, mic greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.015-1 micrograms/ml, concentrations comparable to other cephalosporins. clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml, 8- to 128-fold lower concentrations than were found for other agents, but the mics were greater than 64 micrograms/ml for bacteroides spp. the mic90 for moraxella catarrhalis was 1 micrograms/ml, similar to cefuroxime but 16-fold greater than the mics of cefixime. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumonia which were high beta-lactamase producers were resistant, mics greater than 64 micrograms/ml, and 50% of enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii were resistant. cefcanel was hydrolyzed by tem-1, tem-3 and moraxella bro-1 beta-lactamases. escherichia coli containing tem-1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 had cefcanel mics of greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. although cefcanel inhibited gram-positive species as well as or at lower concentrations than other cephalosporins, it lacked activity against gram-negative species that produced common plasmid beta-lactamase although it inhibited haemophilus influenzae carrying tem-1.
in vitro activity of ro 09-1428 compared to other cephalosporins.
the in vitro activity of ro 09-1428, a new catechol-type parenteral cephalosporin, was compared to that of ceftazidime, e-1040, cefpirome and cefepime against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. ro 09-1428 inhibited group a streptococci at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, and group b, c and g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.5 micrograms/ml, whereas for staphylococcus aureus ro 09-1428 had mics of 8-16 micrograms/ml similar to ceftazidime and e-1040. against pseudomonas aeruginosa ro 09-1428 was the most active agent, inhibiting isolates at less than or equal to 0.12-2 micrograms/ml, and inhibited ceftazidime-resistant isolates. the majority of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, providencia, salmonella and shigella were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml as with the other cephalosporins. for most citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae ro 09-1428 had higher mics of 4-16 micrograms/ml; most ceftazidime-resistant isolates of these species were resistant. anaerobes, enterococci and listeria monocytogenes were resistant to ro 09-1428. ro 09-1428 was not hydrolyzed by tem-1, tem-2, staphylococcus aureus pc-1, moraxella catarrhalis bro-1, enterobacter p-99, pseudomonas aeruginosa sabath-abraham or klebsiella beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-7 and tem-9. ro 09-1428 was markedly less active at an acid ph.
[antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of cpfx against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. the clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. interpreting mic level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. when activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, cpfx expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (oflx) and norfloxacin (nflx) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of cpfx against bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of oflx, and cpfx had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus to oflx. 2. in comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, cpfx was inferior to amoxicillin (ampc) against e. faecalis and inferior to ampc and cefaclor (ccl) against peptostreptococcus spp. against all other bacterial species, however, cpfx expressed superior antibacterial potency to ampc and ccl. 3. scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to cpfx were observed among the s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. faecium, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of e. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. reported by the research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by nccls in which susceptibilities are classified into "s", "ms", "i" and "r". ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. ipm also had strong activities against achromobacter xylosoxidans and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against flavobacterium spp., e. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas cepacia. in a study in which activities of ipm against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among s. aureus, cns, a. calcoaceticus and p. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens or p. mirabilis.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
we investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. ipm had significantly high activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, providencia rettgeri, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, providencia stuartii and pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. in a comparative study on activities of ipm against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, p. mirabilis or a. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among staphylococcus aureus, cns, s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa.
antibacterial activity in the hemolymph of myriapods (arthropoda).
the hemolymphs of two diplopod (chicobolus sp. and rhapidostreptus virgator) and  two chilopod species (lithobius forficatus and scolopendra cingulata) were tested for the presence of antibacterial substances using petri dish tests. the native hemolymph of all species had substances acting on living micrococcus luteus, whereas only rhapidostreptus, scolopendra, and lithobius were effective against lyophilized micrococcus. the antibacterial activity against living micrococcus increased after inoculation with bacteria (enterobacter cloacae beta-12) in chicobolus and rhapidostreptus and also against lyophilized micrococcus in the latter. thus, these effects appear to be inducible. none of the myriapods tested had any bacteriostatic effect on escherichia coli d-31 whereas the growth of gram-negative e. cloacae was inhibited. the antibacterial substances in the diplopod species were unstable when heated but were resistant to freezing. at least two antibacterial substances (a lysozyme-like one and another substance) are considered to occur in myriapoda.
a prospective study of long-term use of amikacin in a paediatrics department. indications, administration, side-effects, bacterial isolates and resistance.
amikacin (amikin; b-m) was used as the only aminoglycoside for 18 months in a paediatric department within a general hospital because of high levels of resistance of klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae isolates to tobramycin, gentamicin and netilmicin. between 1 february 1987 and 31 july 1988, 816 children were treated with a slow intravenous injection at a standardised dose adjusted for weight and age. respiratory disease was present in 35.8% of 537 neonates, 56.4% of 190 infants and 70.9% of 89 older children. escherichia coli (65 isolates), klebsiella species (59 isolates), enterobacter species (26 isolates) and p. aeruginosa (22 isolates) constituted the most common gram-negative pathogens. the positive blood culture yield was 7.8%. satisfactory median peak and trough serum amikacin levels were achieved. no significant renal side-effects were noted. severe bilateral hearing loss in 1 low-birthweight infant resulted from inadvertent overdosage. at the end of this 18-month surveillance period 97.7% of e. coli, 98.6% of k. pneumoniae, 96.3% of e. cloacae, and 98.0% of p. aeruginosa isolates remained sensitive to amikacin, while resistance of k. pneumoniae to tobramycin, netilmicin and gentamicin decreased significantly (p less than 0.003, p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.007 respectively; chi-square test).
molecular characterization of an enterobacter cloacae gene (roma) which pleiotropically inhibits the expression of escherichia coli outer membrane proteins.
the introduction of a newly cloned enterobacter cloacae chromosomal gene roma, into escherichia coli and e. cloacae resulted in enhancement of resistance to quinolones, beta-lactams, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline. the primary effect of roma on a multicopy vector in e. coli was almost complete inhibition of ompf expression in the outer membrane. from the experiments with ompr and envz mutants or with ompf-lacz and ompc-lacz fusion plasmids, it was concluded that this inhibition is posttranscriptional. the introduction of roma on a multicopy vector into strains with micf deletion elicited only a moderate decrease in ompf protein expression. this indicates that reduction of ompf expression by roma is partly mediated posttranscriptionally by the activation of micf. moreover, the overexpression of roma protein from an isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside (iptg)-inducible promoter resulted in nearly complete inhibition of expression of ompc and ompa, as well as ompf. taken together with an observation in a recent study that overexpressed ompc inhibited the synthesis of ompa and lamb, a possible inhibitory mechanism at the translational stage of the synthesis of outer membrane proteins should also be considered. by southern hybridization, roma was generally detected in the chromosomes of all e. cloacae strains tested but not in the e. coli k-12 chromosome. sequence data show that there is an open reading frame specifying 368 amino acids residues including a putative signal peptide. roma appears to belong to the outer membrane protein family since it was extractable from an outer membrane preparation, but no sequence homology to other outer membrane proteins was detected.
mechanism of action of lomefloxacin.
the inhibition of supercoiling activity of reconstituted escherichia coli dna gyrase by lomefloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and norfloxacin was determined. the concentrations of quinolones needed to inhibit dna synthesis in escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus were also measured. the kinetics of uptake of [14c]lomefloxacin and unlabeled lomefloxacin into whole cells of e. coli kl-16 and s. aureus nctc 8532 and the induction of reca in e. coli gc2241 were assayed. all strains had wild-type susceptibilities to quinolones. the concentration of quinolones needed to inhibit dna synthesis by 50% correlated with the mic for members of the family enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa. the concentration of quinolones needed to inhibit dna synthesis by 50% for late-logarithmic-phase s. aureus also correlated with the mic, unlike the data from early-logarithmic-phase cultures. e. coli and s. aureus showed a similar pattern of uptake kinetics of [14c]lomefloxacin and unlabeled lomefloxacin, indicating that the difference in the susceptibilities of the two species is probably due to different target site affinities. essentially, lomefloxacin was less active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin and had activity similar to those of norfloxacin and enoxacin.
[clinical and pharmacokinetic studies on aztreonam in neonates].
clinical and pharmacokinetic studies on aztreonam (azt) were performed in neonates. the results are summarized as follows: a total of 6 cases consisting of 5 mature and 1 low-birth-weight infants was clinically evaluated. azt 20 mg/kg was administered 2-3 times daily, via 1 hour intravenous drip infusion for 6-21 days. concomitantly, vancomycin (vcm) 15 mg/kg was administered to 1 case 3 times daily, via 1 hour intravenous drip infusion for 3 days and ampicillin (abpc) 20-50 mg/kg to 3 cases 3 time daily via 30 minutes intravenous drip infusion for 2-6 days. of the 6 bacterial infection cases (1 with sepsis and purulent meningitis, 2 with sepsis, 2 with urinary tract infection and 1 with perirectal abscess), clinical effects of azt were evaluated in 4 cases (2 each with sepsis and urinary tract infection) as "excellent" in all the cases. all of the causative organisms (escherichia coli in 3 and enterobacter cloacae in 1) were eradicated by the treatment with azt. neither clinical side effect nor abnormal laboratory test value caused by azt was observed. mics of azt against 10 clinical isolates (staphylococcus aureus 1, e. coli 4, klebsiella pneumoniae 1, e. cloacae 1, haemophilus influenzae 1 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 2) from neonatal patients with bacterial infections were examined. as results, azt showed very good antibacterial activity comparable or even superior to cefoperazone, cefotaxime, latamoxef; however, the activity against p. aeruginosa was inferior to imipenem.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
inhibitory activity of papain on facultative pathogens--short communication.
papain, a proteolytic enzyme obtained from papaya was found inhibitory on few facultative pathogens. while escherichia coli, staphylococcus albus, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae were inhibited at concentration from 200 ppm on the cell density of staphylococcus faecalis decreased only at higher concentration of papain (400-800 ppm).
influence of the addition of mineral salts on the inhibitory activity of strains  of the arthrinium genus.
the influence which the addition of certain mineral salts has on the inhibiting activity of strains belonging to the arthrinium genus was studied. the salts employed were agno3, fecl2, mncl2 and cuso4, in concentrations of 10, 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg/l, in the presence of bacillus subtilis, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, candida albicans and aspergillus niger. for b. subtilis and s. aureus greater inhibition was observed after the addition of fecl2 (200 mg/l) and mncl2 (10 mg/l). e. coli showed a greater sensibility in the presence of agno3 (200 mg/l) and cuso4 (150 mg/l). inhibition before enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens was not increased by the addition of any of the salts. the addition of mncl2 at 10 mg/l concentration to the basal medium showed a considerable increase of inhibitory activity over klebsiella pneumoniae and candida albicans. activity for aspergillus niger decreased when any of the salts were added to the medium.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1986). i. susceptibility distribution].
susceptibilities to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents of bacterial strains isolated from urinary tract infections at 8 hospitals in japan from july to october in 1986 are summarized as follows. 1. enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (st) and imipenem (ipm) with mic90s of 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml. minocycline had the strongest activity against staphylococcus aureus; the mics for all strains tested were lower than 0.39 microgram/ml. the mic80s of dicloxacillin, and arbekacin (hbk) were 0.20 and 0.78 microgram/ml, respectively. among the cephems, the mic80 of flomoxef was 25 micrograms/ml, whereas those of cefmenoxime (cmx) and cefotiam (ctm) were 50 micrograms/ml. 2. escherichia coli was most susceptible to ofloxacin (oflx) among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents tested. oflx showed the minimum inhibitory concentration against 90% (mic90) of the 274 strains of e. coli tested to be lower than 0.10 microgram/ml. the antibacterial activities of the third generation cephems such as cmx and latamoxef (lmox) were the strongest among the injectable antibiotics tested. the mic90s of cmx and lmox were lower than 0.10 and 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. ctm and cefmetazole, the second generation cephems, were also highly active against e. coli with mic90s of 0.39 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents tested, oflx was the most active against klebsiella pneumoniae. its mic90 was 0.78 microgram/ml. among the injectable antibiotics tested, cmx was the strongest with an mic90 of 0.20 microgram/ml; mic90 of ctm and lmox were 0.39 microgram/ml. 4. the tested antibacterial and antibiotic agents were generally less active against citrobacter freundii than against other bacteria. the mic80 of oflx was 0.39 microgram/ml. gentamicin (gm) and st were slightly active against c. freundii. among the cephems, cmx had the mic80 of 25 micrograms/ml. 5. enterobacter cloacae was less susceptible to the cephems tested. oflx, gm, and mecillinam were active against this bacteria with mic80s of 0.78, 0.78 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. 6. among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents and penicillins examined, piperacillin (pipc) was the most active against proteus mirabilis. its mic90 was 0.39 microgram/ml. those of sulbenicillin, cefaclor, ampicillin, oflx, and st were 0.78, 0.78, 1.56, 3.13 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. cmx was highly active against p. mirabilis with an mic90 of less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml; lmox followed with an mic90 of 0.20 microgram/ml among the injectable antibiotics tested. ctm was also active against this bacterium; the mic90 was 0.39 microgram/ml. 7. the antibacterial and antibiotic agents were generally only slightly active against proteus vulgaris.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
[susceptibility of clinical isolates to aztreonam].
in vitro antibacterial activities of 9 antibiotics including aztreonam (azt) against clinically isolated gram-negative bacteria were determined using mic-2000 plus system. bacteria were isolated from clinical materials in saga medical school during a period from may 1987 to march 1988. summarized results were as follows: 1. azt showed excellent antibacterial activities against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus sp. and haemophilus influenzae, and mic80 values of azt against these organisms were lower than 0.20 microgram/ml. 2. antibacterial activities of azt were superior to cephem antibiotics compared against enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens. 3. the mic50 and mic80 of azt against pseudomonas aeruginosa were 12.5 micrograms/ml and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. 4. azt did not show any antibacterial activity against acinetobacter sp. and xanthomonas maltophilia.
activity of fce 22891 compared with cefuroxime axetil and cefixime in pulmonary and subcutaneous infections in mice.
the therapeutic activity of fce 22891 was compared with that of two new oral cephalosporins, cefuroxime axetil and cefixime against streptococcus pneumoniae respiratory infection and subcutaneous abscesses induced by mixed aerobes and anaerobes in mice. in experimental pneumonia fce 22891 was the most active antibiotic. in aerobic abscesses fce 22891 proved the most active agent in infections induced by methicillin susceptible and resistant staphylococcus aureus while all three compounds were very active, against str. pyogenes. in abscesses caused by gram-negative bacteria, fce 22891 showed good and constant efficacy. cefixime was the most active drug against the two susceptible strains of escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae and also against resistant esch. coli but was inactive against a strain of ent. cloacae that produced cephalosporinase. cefuroxime axetil was less active than the other two drugs against gram-negative bacteria with adequate efficacy only against a susceptible strain of ent. cloacae. fce 22891 was more effective than cefixime and cefuroxime axetil in preventing and reducing the size of abscesses induced by bacteroides fragilis 101. we conclude that fce 22891, despite its short half life of 6 min in mice, exerts comparable and sometimes better activity than the two oral cephalosporins characterized by longer half lives.
bacteremia complicating acute leukemia with special reference to its incidence and changing etiological patterns.
over the 15-yr period, 1972-1986, 194 episodes of bacteremia occurred in 132 patients with acute leukemia at the third department of medicine, kanazawa university hospital, giving an incidence of 478 episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. this incidence was at least twice as high as that in patients with chronic leukemia, malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma or aplastic anemia, and about 40-fold higher than that in patients with all other internal diseases. the rate of occurrence of bacteremia, whether unimicrobial or polymicrobial, remained almost unchanged throughout the study period. the frequency of gram-negative bacilli decreased significantly, however, from 81% of the total isolates for the first 10-yr period to 50% for the second 5-yr period. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated in markedly decreasing frequency, but pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae in relatively constant frequency. the majority of p. aeruginosa isolates belonged to a limited number of o-antigen groups, suggesting the possibility of nosocomial infection. on the other hand, the frequency of gram-positive cocci increased from 9 to 36%. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species, and staphylococcus aureus emerged as important pathogens. such a change in the spectrum of organisms was considered to coincide with the common use of the so-called second- and third-generation cephalosporins and central venous catheters. it is thus suggested that vancomycin be added to empiric antibiotic therapy, especially when gram-positive infections are clinically or microbiologically suspected, and that reducing the acquisition of p. aeruginosa from the hospital environment remains a priority in infection prevention.
[activity of 9 beta-lactam antibiotics combined with clavulanic acid or sulbactam against the strains of broad-spectrum beta-lactamase (ctx-1) producing enterobacteriaceae isolated at the henri mondor hospital].
minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of seven cephalosporins: cefotaxime (ctx), ceftriaxone (cro), ceftazidime (caz), latamoxef (mox), cefoxitin (fox), cefotetan (ctt) and cm 40876 (cm), of aztreonam (atm) and imipenem (ipm) were evaluated by agar dilution with and without 5 mg/l of clavulanic acid (ac) or sulbactam (sb) for 28 strains isolated in 1986 (15 k. pneumoniae, 3. k. oxytoca, 4 e. coli, 4 e. cloacae, 1 e. aerogenes and 1 c. freundii). comparatively to mics of sensitive strains and to those of cured variants, mics of these strains were very increased for ctx, cro, atm (mode mic: 1 mg/l), and caz (2); weakly increased for mox and ctt (0.25), and identical for imp (0.12-0.25), cm (0.06) and fox (2-4), except for enterobacter and citrobacter (64). association with ac or sb did not modify mics of fox, cm and imp. for the other antibiotics, mics were reduced by addition of ac: klebsiella: 5 log2 for ctx and cro, 4 for caz and atm, 2 for mox and ctt; e. coli: 4 log2 for ctx and atm, 3 for cro and caz, 1 for mox and ctt; enterobacter and citrobacter 2 log2 for ctx, cro, caz and atm, 1 for mox and ctt. with sb, decrease of mics was two to for fold lesser than with ac. ac, and less efficiently sb, restored activity of ctx, cro, caz and atm on ctx-1 producing enterobacteriaceae, particularly klebsiella and e. coli. it was the same for mox and ctt, weakly affected by this resistance. ac and sb had not effect on fox, cm and ipm which remained active on these strains.
the humoral defense system in tsetse: differences in response due to age, sex and antigen types.
inoculation of live escherichia coli into tsetse flies, glossina morsitans morsitans, stimulated a higher antibacterial immune response in females than in males. it increased with age in females from emergence to approximately 2 weeks and thereafter declined. in males, there was also a significant decrease in immune response with aging. inoculation of killed bacteria failed to stimulate antibacterial activity but stimulated a lysozyme response which was weaker than that stimulated by live bacteria. no antibacterial activity was present in the hemolymph of larvae from immunized pregnant tsetse. inoculation of live trypanosoma brucei brucei and t. congolense failed to induce production of antibacterial activity and lysozyme. furthermore, tsetse inoculated with or naturally infected with t. b. brucei and t. congolense failed to show any evidence of immunosuppression when challenged with live e. coli. various species of live bacteria stimulated different levels of antibacterial factors, with enterobacter cloacae stimulating the highest level of antibacterial activity and e. coli the highest level of lysozyme. saline in which certain species of bacteria and t. b. brucei were incubated inactivated tsetse immune hemolymph.
tigemonam, an oral monobactam.
tigemonam is an orally administered monobactam. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml it inhibited the majority of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter diversus, proteus spp., providencia spp., aeromonas hydrophila, salmonella spp., shigella spp., serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica. at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml it inhibited haemophilus spp., neisseria spp., and branhamella catarrhalis. it did not inhibit pseudomonas spp. or acinetobacter spp. tigemonam was more active than cephalexin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and inhibited many members of the family enterobacteriaceae resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. some enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii strains resistant to aminothiazole iminomethoxy cephalosporins and aztreonam were resistant to tigemonam. the mic for 90% of hemolytic streptococci of groups a, b, and c and for streptococcus pneumoniae was 16 micrograms/ml, but the mic for 90% of enterococci, listeria spp., bacteroides spp., and viridans group streptococci was greater than 64 micrograms/ml. tigemonam was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases such as tem-1 and shv-1 or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of enterobacter, morganella, pseudomonas, and bacteroides spp. tigemonam inhibited beta-lactamases of e. cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa but did not induce beta-lactamases. the growth medium had a minimal effect on the in vitro activity of tigemonam, and there was a close agreement between the mics and mbcs.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1985). i. susceptibility distribution].
the results of determinations of sensitivities of bacterial strains to various antibiotics are summarized as follows: 1. against escherichia coli, ofloxacin (oflx) showed the strongest activity among oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents. its mic90 was below 0.10 micrograms/ml. the next strongest activity was found in mecillinam (mpc), cefaclor (ccl) and pipemidic acid (ppa); mic90's of these agents 3.13 micrograms/ml. cefotiam (ctm), cefotaxime (ctx), ceftizoxime (czx), cefmenoxime (cmx) and latamoxef (lmox) had mic90 below 0.39 micrograms/ml. mic90's of cefmetazole (cmz) and cefoperazone (cpz) were 1.56 micrograms/ml. aztreonam (azt) and carumonam (crmn) in the monobactam group showed strong activities with mic90's at 0.20 micrograms/ml. 2. although klebsiella pneumoniae had a strong resistance to ampicillin (abpc) and showed relatively low sensitivities to other oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents, oflx maintained high activity against this species and showed mic90 of 0.39 micrograms/ml. among injectable antibiotics, third generation cephems showed the strongest activity to this species with mic90 of czx below 0.10 micrograms/ml, of ctx and cmx 0.20 micrograms/ml, and of lmox 0.78 micrograms/ml. mic90 of cpz was 6.25 micrograms/ml, which was the same as those of cefazolin (cez) and cefoxitin (cfx). ctm had similar mic90 to lmox, namely, 1.56 micrograms/ml. mic90 of cmz was 3.13 micrograms/ml. monobactams azt and crmn showed strong activities to this species; their mic90's were below 0.10 micrograms/ml and 0.20 micrograms/ml. 3. although citrobacter freundii generally exhibited low sensitivities to antibacterial and antibiotic agents examined, it showed high sensitivity to oflx, at mic80 of 0.78 micrograms/ml. this species showed low sensitivities to mpc, nalidixic acid (na), ppa, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st). among injectable antibiotics, lmox and cmx had activities against this species; namely, mic80's were 6.25 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. among monobactams, azt showed mic80 of 12.5 micrograms/ml, and crmn had that of 6.25 micrograms/ml. 4. against enterobacter cloacae, the strongest antibacterial activity was found with oflx which had mic90 of 0.39 micrograms/ml. a relatively strong activity was seen with mpc. mic80 of mpc was 1.56 micrograms/ml. except to ctm, this species had poor sensitivities to injectable first and second generation cephems, and their mic80's were over 200 micrograms/ml. mic80 of ctm was 25 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
beta-lactamase stability of cefpirome (hr 810), a new cephalosporin with a broad  antimicrobial spectrum.
cefpirome was highly stable to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases, although it was hydrolyzed to some extent by r plasmid-mediated penicillinase of richmond-sykes type va/b and by chromosomal cephalosporinases from bacteroides species. the compound had a very low affinity for cephalosporinases from enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, and proteus vulgaris. cefpirome showed strong antimicrobial activity against eight beta-lactamase (cephalosporinase)-producing strains which have become resistant to broad-spectrum cephalosporins; especially against e. cloacae and c. freundii, it had the highest activity among the cephalosporins used. its activity against ampicillin-resistant r plasmid-containing transconjugant isolates of escherichia coli was as high as that against the recipient strain e. coli chi 1037. the inducer activity of cefpirome in s. marcescens and p. vulgaris increased dose dependently, whereas cephamycin derivatives showed high inducer activity at low concentrations. a relatively low affinity of cefpirome for beta-lactamases is considered to be one of the reasons for its high antimicrobial activity against such enzyme-producing strains. in addition, other factors such as good penetration through the outer membrane and affinity for the target sites may also be involved in the high activity of cefpirome.
in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new difluoro oxacephem, 6315-s.
6315-s, a novel difluoromethyl thioacetamido oxacephem, had in vitro activity comparable to that of cefotaxime and moxalactam against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, salmonella spp., and shigella spp., inhibiting 90% at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. it inhibited piperacillin- and cefoperazone-resistant isolates in these species. 6315-s did not inhibit cefotaxime- or moxalactam-resistant citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, or enterobacter cloacae (mics for 90% of the strains tested were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml). proteus vulgaris resistant to cefotaxime was inhibited. pseudomonas species and acinetobacter species were resistant (mics greater than 64 micrograms/ml). mics for 90% of the staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis isolates were 4 micrograms/ml. 6315-s was highly active against anaerobic species of clostridium, fusobacterium, bacteroides, and peptostreptococci and was superior to other agents against these organisms. 6315-s was not hydrolyzed by the major plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases, but it induced chromosomal beta-lactamases in enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of two oral cephalosporins, ceftetrame (ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (ro 15-8074).
ceftetrame (ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (ro 15-8074), two new orally administered aminothiazolyl imimomethoxy cephalosporins, inhibited hemolytic streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml but were less active against staphylococci than were cephalexin and cefaclor. they did not inhibit s. faecalis, s. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, corynebacterium jk species, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including ampicillin-resistant isolates, were inhibited at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml. both agents inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, salmonella species, shigella species, citrobacter diversus, and aeromonas hydrophila resistant to ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, although many isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime were not inhibited by these agents. a marked inoculum effect was noted for enterobacteriaceae carrying the richmond-sykes type 1a chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, but plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases did not hydrolyze the compounds. both drugs inhibited the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of e. cloacae, p99.
in-vitro activity of ticarcillin with and without clavulanic acid against clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
the in-vitro activity of ticarcillin with and without clavulanic acid was investigated against 285 freshly isolated clinical strains of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by the agar-dilution technique on mueller-hinton-agar. clavulanic acid had an excellent or moderate potentiating effect on the in-vitro activity of ticarcillin against staphylococci, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter spp., acinetobacter, haemophilus influenzae and bacteroides spp. no effect was seen against enterococci, indole-positive proteus spp., ent. cloacae, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the effect of clavulanic acid was dose- and inoculum-dependent.
impact of azlocillin on the colon microflora.
to evaluate the impact of parenteral azlocillin therapy on human colon microflora, faecal specimens were taken from 6 patients before, during and after therapy for analysis of the microflora. in 2 patients major changes took place. thus the numbers of streptococci, escherichia coli, anaerobic cocci, lactobacilli, clostridia and bacteroides decreased markedly during therapy. one of these patients was colonized with azlocillin-resistant enterobacter cloacae. the other 4 patients had only minor changes in the microflora. variations between patients seem to exist. pronounced alterations in the colonic flora may have clinical implications.
structure-activity relationships amongst beta-lactamase inhibitors.
using a variety of beta-lactamases including those from escherichia coli (tem-1), enterobacter cloacae p99 and staphylococcus aureus the inhibition profiles (i50 values) were determined for various groups of compounds including penicillins, penicillanic acid derivatives (sulphone and beta-halo substitutions), olivanic acids and clavulanic acid derivatives including substituted ethers and amines. some of the latter compounds had higher activity than clavulanic acid with and without preincubation of enzyme with inhibitor but they still had poor activity against the p99 enzyme. improvements in activity against class i cephalosporinases were obtained with some derivatives of clavulanic acid but this was usually achieved at the expense of activity against clavulanate susceptible beta-lactamases. the olivanic acids had the highest activity against the widest range of beta-lactamases.
the humoral antibacterial response of drosophila adults.
hemolymph from a normal adult drosophila melanogaster lacks factors that block the growth of escherichia coli, but hemolymph from a fly previously inoculated with enterobacter cloacae inhibits bacterial growth. antibacterial activity appears within two hours after inoculation, and is still detectable sixty days later. activity is potent, and can be detected in as little as a quarter of the hemolymph from a single inoculated male fly. after inoculation, at least eight new polypeptides not of bacterial origin appear in hemolymph with a time course similar to the appearance of antibacterial activity; these are called antibacterial response polypeptides, or ars. the most prominent polypeptides are ar24, ar22, and ar19 with molecular weights of about 24, 22, and 19 kilodaltons (kd). other bands with as much as 75 kd and as little as 5 kd were also found. electrophoresis of active hemolymph under non-denaturing conditions, and isoelectric focusing separate several protein species that block bacterial growth (antibacterial proteins, or abs); one ab is neutral (ab7.1) and three are basic (ab8.7, ab9.0 and ab9.2). two dimensional gels show that ar24, ar22 and ar19 have pis identical to the basic antibacterial proteins. radiolabelling experiments proved that the ars were synthesized de novo after bacterial inoculation. ars in six species of drosophila showed fundamentally similar electrophoretic patterns.
the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy 7 beta acyl ureido cephalosporin.
the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy ureido cephalosporin, was determined against 726 clinical isolates. ninety percent of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, salmonella, and shigella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin and piperacillin against these species. concentrations of 25 micrograms/ml of cefbuperazone were needed to inhibit serratia marcescens and providencia species, and 50% of enterobacter cloacae had mics greater than 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was less active by 8 to 32-fold than cefotaxime or moxalactam against most enterobacteriaceae. cefbuperazone did not inhibit acinetobacter or pseudomonas species. hemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml and staphylococci by 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone had activity comparable to cefoxitin and moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis with mic90s of 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was not hydrolyzed by plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases and was an inhibitor of the p99 e. cloacae beta-lactamase with an i50 of 1 microgram/ml. it was a less effective inhibitor of the k. oxytoca k1 and e. coli tem-1 beta-lactamases than was clavulanic acid. cefbuperazone induced beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa and resistant e. cloacae. a permeability barrier in e. cloacae, c. freundii and p. aeruginosa is suggested by the potentiation of cefbuperazone's activity by edta.
growth of bacteria in enteral feeding solutions.
solutions of clinifeed iso, triosorbon, vivonex standard (full- and half-strength) and vivonex hn were experimentally contaminated with two strains each of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella aerogenes, escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae at concentrations of 10(2)-10(3) organisms/ml. samples were incubated at 4, 25 or 37 degrees c and viable counts were made at 0, 4, 8 and 24 h. no increase in numbers of any of the organisms was observed in any of the feeds during 24 h at 4 degrees c. all organisms multiplied rapidly in clinifeed iso and in triosorbon at 25 and 37 degrees c. there was less rapid growth in half-strength vivonex standard at 25 degrees c, although at 37 degrees c all strains multiplied rapidly except for the two s. aureus strains, the growth of which was inhibited in half-strength vivonex standard at both 25 and 37 degrees c. in full-strength vivonex standard at 25 degrees c, only p. aeruginosa showed any increase in numbers during 24 h, whereas p. aeruginosa, k. aerogenes and e. cloacae all multiplied at 37 degrees c. none of the test organisms multiplied in full strength vivonex hn at any of the temperatures studied. the results of the study show that bacteria survive and may multiply even in feeds with low ph and high osmolarity, and emphasise the importance of strict hygiene during the preparation and handling of all enteral feeds.
versatile escherichia coli-bacillus shuttle vectors derived from runaway replication plasmids related to clodf13.
versatile cloning vectors were constructed employing a runaway replication mutant of the bacteriocinogenic plasmid clodf13. these vectors can, under conditions where protein synthesis is not inhibited, be amplified in escherichia coli to high levels by elevating the temperature and are therefore useful for the production of large quantities of dna and protein. since the constructed shuttle vectors, which harbour at least six unique restriction endonucleases sites, replicate in e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus and a variety of bacilli, they are applicable for the genetic engineering of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
novel method for studying the public health significance of macroinvertebrates occurring in potable water.
an experimental procedure was developed to study the association of selected bacteria and macroinvertebrates and their response to free available chlorine disinfection. the organisms selected for study were escherichia coli ( lacz545 ), enterobacter cloacae (atcc 23355), and the amphipod hyalella azteca . e. coli was shown to bind tightly (1.6 x 10(4) cfu per amphipod ) to this macroinvertebrate and to resist repeated attempts to wash it off. e. cloacae was shown to bind much less tightly (1.4 x 10(3) cfu per amphipod ) to h. azteca and was less resistant to removal by washing. the extent of association is a function of macroinvertebrate size (surface area), but the procedure produces repeatable results usable for controlled experimentation. this method, together with the dual bacterial identification criteria (morphology and antibiotic resistance), was used to study the response of unassociated and associated e. coli and e. cloacae to disinfection with free available chlorine at 1.0 mg/liter. unassociated e. coli populations decreased to less than 1% of their zero time controls within 1 min of contact time, whereas more than 2% of the associated e. coli populations remained viable after 60 min of contact at 1.0 mg of free available chlorine per liter. unassociated e. cloacae populations decreased to less than 1% of their zero time controls within 1 min of contact time, whereas ca. 15% of the associated e. cloacae populations remained viable after 60 min of contact at 1.0 mg of free available chlorine per liter.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
in vitro combination effects of cefotetan with four aminoglycosides, piperacillin and mezlocillin on gram-positive and gram-negative nosocomial bacteria.
the in vitro efficacy of cefotetan in combination with gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, netilmicin against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterobacter cloacae and with piperacillin and mezlocillin against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens and enterobacter cloacae was compared by use of the checkerboard agar dilution technique. on average, 60% of the gram-negative and 46% of the gram-positive strains were inhibited by additive, but only 22% of the gram-negative and 2% of the gram-positive bacteria were inhibited by synergistic cefotetan-aminoglycoside combinations. netilmicin combinations were least active. on gram-negative bacteria, 63% of the cefotetan-penicillin combinations were additive and 11% synergistic. no antagonism occurred with any of the combinations.
synthesis and beta-lactamase inhibitory activities of some clavulanic acid analogues.
clavulanic acid analogs lacking the c-3 carboxyl group are potent inhibitors of both plasmid and chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases. they exhibit only low intrinsic anti-bacterial activity, but potentiate the activity of ampicillin and cephaloridine against beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae in vitro. no synergism was observed in beta-lactamase negative strains. the e. coli tem 1 and the e. cloacae p99 enzymes are inhibited in a progressive and irreversible manner by these compounds.
cefotetan: profile of in-vitro activity.
cefotetan, a novel 7 alpha-methoxy cephalosporin, was shown to be comparable to other third-generation cephalosporins when tested in vitro against 1063 gram-negative clinical isolates of 11 species. ninety per cent of all isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, proteus rettgeri, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii were inhibited by concentrations of cefotetan between 0.07 and 3.2 mg/l. activity against gram-positive cocci was about equal to that of moxalactam. pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter were resistant. cefotetan inhibited about two-thirds of enterobacter strains at 16 mg/l. beta-lactamases of enterobacter cloacae highly resistant to cefotetan inactivated this cephamycin. these strains were resistant to most other beta-lactams as well. synergism between cefotetan and aminoglycosides was found in 8 out of 16 gram-negatives.
[microbiological studies with the new penicillin brl 17421 (temocillin)].
in vitro evaluation of brl 17421 (temocillin), a new penicillin. the in vitro antibacterial activity of brl 17421 (temocillin), a new penicillin, was determined in quantitative serial broth dilution tests and was compared to that of mezlocillin, piperacillin, cefazolin and cefotaxime against 751 clinical isolates of the enterobacteriaceae family. in addition, the sensitivity of 211 mezlocillin-resistant gram-negative rods to brl 17421 was also determined. temocillin exhibited a high level of antibacterial activity against various bacterial species of the enterobacteriaceae family, including isolates resistant to mezlocillin. the 90% mics against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella spp., yersinia spp. and indole-negative and indole-positive proteus strains ranged from 0.5 mg/l to 16 mg/l. concentrations of 16 mg/l were required to inhibit 80% of the serratia marcescens strains; some isolates were resistant. no significant difference between mic and mbc values was observed.
in vitro activity of apalcillin compared with that of other new penicillins and anti-pseudomonas cephalosporins.
apalcillin, a naphthydridine derivative of ampicillin, was compared with ticarcillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone against gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial isolates and with cefsulodin and tobramycin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the minimal concentrations of apalcillin at which 50 and 90% of hospital isolates of escherichia coli were inhibited were similar to those of mezlocillin and piperacillin (1.6 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively). apalcillin had minimal inhibitory concentrations similar to those of piperacillin against citrobacter freundii and citrobacter diversus. against klebsiella, apalcillin inhibited 50% of organisms at a concentration of 6.3 micrograms/ml, similar to piperacillin. the activity of apalcillin against enterobacter (e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, and e. agglomerans) was similar to that of mezlocillin and piperacillin and greater than that of ticarcillin. the activity of apalcillin against proteus mirabilis was similar to that of the other agents, as was its activity against indole-positive proteus and providencia. only 40% of serratia were inhibited at an apalcillin concentration of 25 micrograms/ml. apalcillin was as active as piperacillin but twofold less active than cefoxitin or moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis. it was as active as piperacillin, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against p. aeruginosa (apalcillin inhibited 90% of organisms at a concentration of 25 mg/ml). there was an inoculum effect and a difference in the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration with beta-lactamase strains. apalcillin was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamase but not as well by cephalosporinases.
mode of action of azthreonam.
azthreonam (sq 26,776) is a member of a new class of monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotics. in escherichia coli, azthreonam caused filamentation at its lowest effective concentration (0.2 microgram/ml), a morphological effect identical to that observed with cephalothin. the penicillin-binding protein (pbp) profile indicated a very high affinity for pbp3 (complete binding at 0.1 microgram/ml), a moderate affinity for pbp1a (complete binding at 10 micrograms/ml), and poor affinities for pbp1b, pbp2, pbp4, and pbp5/6 (complete binding at greater than or equal to 100 micrograms/ml). accordingly, azthreonam had poor activity against streptomyces r61 dd-carboxypeptidase (50% inhibition, greater than 100 micrograms/ml) and e. coli peptidoglycan transpeptidase (50% inhibition, 100 micrograms/ml). azthreonam also showed very high affinity for pbp3 (complete binding at 0.1 microgram/ml) in proteus vulgaris, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in all four organisms, its pbp profile was similar to that observed in e. coli. it is concluded that azthreonam, although of novel structure, has a mode of action similar to that of cephalosporins, affecting specifically septation in e. coli and most likely other gram-negative bacteria.
sq 26,180, a novel monobactam. i taxonomy, fermentation and biological properties.
strains of chromobacterium violaceum, isolated from various environments, were found to produce a novel monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic. the antibiotic, sq 26,180 was weakly active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with the exception of mutants hypersensitive to beta-lactam antibiotics. the compound was highly stable to beta-lactamases and acted as an inhibitor of the p99 enzyme from enterobacter cloacae. sq 26,180 showed affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 1a, 4 and 5/6 of escherichia coli and inhibited r61 dd-carboxypeptidases.
in vitro activity of n-formimidoyl-thienamycin in comparison to that of moxalactam and cefotaxime against gentamicin-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
the inhibitory and bactericidal activity of n-formimidoyl-thienamycin in vitro against 131 clinical isolates selected for their gentamicin resistance was compared with that of cefotaxime and moxalactam. all strains were inhibited by n-formimidoyl-thienamycin concentrations within a range of 0.12-4 mg/l. n-formimidoyl-thienamycin was less active than cefotaxime and moxalactam against escherichia coli and klebsiella spp., and more active than all other antibiotics tested against serratia spp., enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. in contrast to the other antibiotics n-formimidoyl-thienamycin showed a narrow margin of difference between minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentrations. n-formimidoyl-thienamycin is a promising antibiotic for the treatment of hospital infections with multi-resistant organisms.
behaviour of ceftazidime towards beta-lactamases.
from escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but the geometric mean of the inhibition constant ki used to measure this interaction was 120 and almost 700 times higher with ceftazidime than with cefotaxime and cefuroxime, respectively. two other beta-lactamases isolated from pr. vulgaris and klebsiella oxytoca also showed little or no interaction with ceftazidime. a complementary microbiological technique, the "double-disc" technique, indicated that ceftazidime was more stable than cefotaxime to all beta-lactamases tested. moxalactam, however, appeared to have slightly greater stability.
the in-vivo antibacterial activity of ceftazidime (gr 20263)--a comparison with other new beta-lactam antibiotics and gentamicin.
ceftazidime was compared with cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefmenoxime, cefotiam, cefoperazone, moxalactam, piperacillin, carbenicillin, mezlocillin, cefsulodin and the aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin in a series of mouse protection tests. ceftazidime, together with the other cephalosporin antibiotics and moxalactam were equally effective against infections caused by staphylococcus aureus with ed50 values ranging from 3.5 to 25 mg/kg. gentamicin was the most active antibiotic with ed50 values of 0.4 and 1.6 mg/kg. ceftazidime showed excellent activity against enterobacteriaceae with ed50 values ranging from 0.2-0.9 mg/kg for escherichia coli strains, 1.1-13.8 mg/kg for indole positive and negative proteus spp, and 0.1-25 for enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia spp. similar activity against many of the test strains of enterobacteriaceae was found for gentamicin, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefmenoxime and moxalactam, although cefotiam and cefoperazone were significantly less active than ceftazidime. ceftazidime was significantly more active than the other beta-lactam antibiotics tested against pseudomonas aeruginosa infections with ed50 values ranging from 02-108 mg/kg. only the aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin, with ed(50,s) 0.6-6.3 mg/kg, was as effective as ceftazidime. very poor activity was found for moxalactam, cefoperazone, piperacillin, carbenicillin and mezlocillin against the majority of the test strains of pseudomonas. the results of these in-vivo indicate that ceftazidime is a promising potential alternative to aminoglycoside antibiotics.
antibacterial activity of ceftazidime (gr 20263) against routine hospital isolates and highly resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
ceftazidime was found to be highly active against routine hospital isolates of strains of enterobacteriaceae such as escherichia coli, klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis, with the mean mics varying between 0.11 and 0.75 mg/l. it had marked activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa with a mean mic of 1.8 mg/l which was comparable to tobramycin (11 mg/l) and superior to other aminoglycosides, penicillins and cefotaxime. although ceftazidime was considerably more active than cefuroxime and cefamandole against e. coli, k. aerogenes and ent. cloacae, its activity against strains with multi-antibiotic resistance and marked beta-lactamase production was much diminished, with mean mics between 5 and 21 mg/l. these results with ceftazidime suggest it will be a valuable parenteral compound in the treatment of severe bacterial infections due to strains of the enterobacteriaceae.
differences between ceftizoxime and its stereoisomer in antibacterial activity and affinity for penicillin-binding proteins.
a new cephalosporin derivative, ceftizoxime (syn fk 749), and its anti isomer, fr 14060, were compared in antibacterial activity, outer membrane permeability, stability to beta-lactamases, and affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (pbps), using escherichia coli nihj jc-2 and enterobacter cloacae 58-5 as the test organisms. although ceftizoxime was superior in antibacterial activity to fr 14060, no marked differences between the two agents were found in outer membrane permeability and stability to cephalosporinase. however, the affinity for pbps and stability to penicillinase of ceftizoxime and fr 14060 differed significantly. concentrations of ceftizoxime required to reduce [14c]penicillin g binding by 50% were below 1 microgram/ml for pbps 1a and 1bs of e. cloacae 58-5 and below 3.2 microgram/ml for pbps 1a and 1bs of e. coli nihj jc-2. a more than 10-fold-higher concentration of fr 14060 was required for 50% reduction of (14c]penicillin g binding to pbp 1bs of strains tested. ceftizoxime was severalfold more stable than fr 14060 to penicillinase, but the antibacterial activity of both drugs against penicillinase-producing e. coli was as strong as against non-penicillinase-producing e. coli. these results indicate that the difference between the two compounds in antibacterial activity is likely to be due to differences in their abilities to inhibit peptidoglycan polymerization.
antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365).
the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365 or a-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was compared with those of cefazolin, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against a broad spectrum of 486 organisms and with that of cefotaxime against 114 organisms. cefmenoxime and cefotaxime exhibited nearly equivalent activities against those organisms tested and were the most active of these cephalosporins against all aerobic and facultative organisms except staphylococcus aureus. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of cefmenoxime required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)) ranged from 0.06 to 8 mug/ml for the enterobacteriaceae. the mic(90)s for gram-positive cocci were 0.015 and </=0.008 mug/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively, and 2 mug/ml for s. aureus. group d streptococci were less susceptible. cefmenoxime was very active against haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and neisseria meningitidis with mic(90)s ranging from </=0.008 to 0.25 mug/ml. cefmenoxime, at a concentration of 16 mug/ml, inhibited 78% and 73% of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp., respectively. mics for anaerobes ranged from 0.5 to >128 mug/ml with good activity against the gram-positive organisms. in addition, cefmenoxime activity was bactericidal and only slightly affected by differences in inoculum size. the combination of cefmenoxime and gentamicin was synergistic against 80% of the enterobacteriaceae and 100% of p. aeruginosa strains tested. development of resistance to cefmenoxime was slow or absent for organisms with low initial mics but more rapid for those with higher initial mics. cefmenoxime exhibited good protective activity in mice infected with escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, or s. aureus but was less effective against p. aeruginosa.
antibacterial activity of ceftizoxime, a beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin.
the in vitro activity of ceftizoxime was compared with that of other beta-lactam  antibiotics against 538 isolates. ceftizoxime was the most active agent tested against escherichia coli and klebsiella, inhibiting 80% at 0.025 microgram/ml. it was more active than cefotaxime against enterobacter cloacae and e. aerogenes. ceftizoxime was more active than cefoxitin, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, and carbenicillin against proteus mirabilis and indole-positive proteus. it inhibited 97% of multiresistant serratia isolates at 12.5 microgram/ml, whereas cefotaxime inhibited only 19%. ceftizoxime was less active than cefotaxime and cefoperazone against pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was more active than carbenicillin. it was more active than cefotaxime and cefoxitin against bacteroides. it was not appreciably destroyed by beta-lactamases of staphylococcus aureus, enterobacteriaceae, or pseudomonas.
antimicrobial activity of heparin.
single clinical isolates of eight species of microorganisms were incubated in solutions of heparin and brain heart infusion broth at various concentrations to determine the possible antibacterial effect of heparin. at heparin concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 400 u/ml, the effect on escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis varied with brain heart infusion broth concentrations of 1.2 to 10% and inocula of 10(2) to 10(6) colony-forming units per ml; similar effects were not observed with klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and citrobacter spp. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of heparin for ten strains of each species were determined in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth with inocula of 10(4) colony-forming units per ml. all 10 isolates of s. aureus and all 10 of s. epidermidis were inhibited by heparin concentrations of 125 to 500 u/ml. three e. coli, four p. aeruginosa, and nine c. albicans strains were inhibited by </=500 u of heparin per ml. none of the k. pneumoniae, e. aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, and citrobacter spp. was inhibited by heparin at </=500 u/ml. heparin inhibition of s. aureus in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth-500 u of heparin per ml could be quantitatively overcome by addition of magnesium, calcium, or magnesium and calcium. these data suggest that the growth of microorganisms from heparin-containing material may be suppressed.
competition of beta-lactam antibiotics for the penicillin-binding proteins of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella aerogenes, proteus rettgeri, and escherichia coli: comparison with antibacterial activity and effects upon bacterial morphology.
the competition of a number of beta-lactam morphogenic probes for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella aerogenes, proteus rettgeri, and escherichia coli has been studied. the results indicate that the various gram-negative bacteria have similar, but not identical, pbp patterns and that the individual proteins probably perform similar morphogenic functions as in e. coli k-12. comparison of the 50% binding concentrations of the compounds for the various pbps of the five strains with their antibacterial activity indicates that the different antibiotics are excluded to a greater or lesser degree by the outer membrane permeability barrier and that the exclusion is most pronounced in p. aeruginosa.
clavulanic acid: a beta-lactamase-inhiting beta-lactam from streptomyces clavuligerus.
a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor has been isolated from streptomyces clavuligerus atcc 27064 and given the name clavulanic acid. conditions for the cultivation of the organism and detection and isolation of clavulanic acid are described. this compound resembles the nucleus of a penicillin but differs in having no acylamino side chain, having oxygen instead of sulfur, and containing a beta-hydroxyethylidine substituent in the oxazolidine ring. clavulanic acid is a potent inhibitor of many beta-lactamases, including those found in escherichia coli (plasmid mediated), klebsiella aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus, the inhibition being of a progressive type. the cephalosporinase type of beta-lactamase found in pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae p99 and the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of e. coli are less well inhibited. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin and cephaloridine against beta-lactamase-producing, penicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus, k. aerogenes, p. mirabilis, and e. coli have been shown to be considerably reduced by the addition of low concentrations of clavulanic acid.
susceptibility of clinically important gram-negative bacilli to 15 antibiotics. comparison of patterns in poland and federal republic of germany.
three hundred and sixty strains of gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, enterobacter cloacae, providencia, indole-positive and indole-negative proteus, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens), were isolated by random in poland and germany, and tested by agar dilution method for susceptibility to 15 antimicrobial agents, including six cephalosporin derivatives, colistin, gentamycin and tobramycin, three newer tetracyclines, ampicillin and carbenicillin, and a combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. this investigation revealed existence of growing antibiotic-resistance of gram-negative bacilli to all antimicrobial agents. a detailed analysis of this problem is described and a list of agents effective in vitro is presented. some evidence has been found concerning possible existence of geographical differences in antibiotic-susceptibility patterns of strains of gram-negative bacilli, isolated in poland and federal republic of germany.
insect immunity. 11. simultaneous induction of antibacterial activity and selection synthesis of some hemolymph proteins in diapausing pupae of hyalophora cecropia and samia cynthia.
we have previously shown that pupae of the giant silkmoth samia cynthia have a humoral antibacterial activity, which was induced by viable, nonpathogenic gram-negative bacteria (h.g. boman et al., 1974). we show here that this activity was formed simultaneously with a selective incorporation of amino acids into eight polypeptide chains characterized by their electrophoretic behavior. if actinomycin d or cycloheximide were given at an early time, no antibacterial activity was found. if the inhibitors were given at the time of maximum activity, there was no effect with actinomycin d but a rapid decrease of the activity in the case of cycloheximide. the results imply that the messenger ribonucleic acid was stable, but that at least one protein component was turning over. hemolymph from immunized pupae of another giant silkmoth, hyalophora cecropia, was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. this procedure, together with the isotope distribution after co-electrophoresis in polyarylamide gels, was used for comparing the response to injury and to different infections. almost identical polypeptide patterns were obtained as a response to an infection with either viable enterobacter cloacae or bacillus subtilis. these patterns differed both qualitatively and quantitatively from the injury effect created by an injection as such. there was only a low antibacterial activity in each of the four fractions obtained by ammonium sulfate precipitation. however, a combination of three fractions restored a high killing activity. fractionation of hemolymph from untreated pupae provided evidence for at least one preexisting factor which stimulated the killing of escherichia coli. the osmotic pressure of the bacteria contributed to the antibacterial activity towards e. coli, but not towards b. subtitlis. the killing of e. coli was inhibited by liped a and, to a lesser extent, by an inhibitor of proteolytic enzymes. the similarities and differences with the mammalian complement system are discussed.
insect immunity. i. characteristics of an inducible cell-free antibacterial reaction in hemolymph of samia cynthia pupae.
pupae of the silk moth, samia cynthia, were found to contain an inducible antibacterial activity in their hemolymph. this immunity response was provoked by primary infections with either escherichia coli k-12 or enterobacter cloacae. in both cases the antibacterial activity was directed chiefly towards e. coli. during standard conditions, 1% of hemolymph could kill 10(3) to 10(4) viable e. coli, strain d31, within 5 min. a lower level of antibacterial activity was induced by injections of a sterile salt solution. the killing of strain d31 followed single-hit kinetics, and increasing rate constants were obtained for increasing amounts of hemolymph. the reaction was sensitive to pretreatment with trypsin and it was protected by reducing agents. the activity was inhibited by microgram quantities of lipopolysaccharide (lps) prepared from certain lps mutants of e. coli k-12. a comparison of the susceptibility showed that "heptose-less" lps mutants were more sensitive to killing than other strains. during standard conditions hemolymph will lyse both e. coli and micrococcus lysodeikticus. lysis of e. coli followed a multi-hit kinetics and it was inhibited by lps, whereas lysis of m. lysodeikticus was unaffected by lps. hemolymph was fractionated on sephadex g-200, and the lytic activities were recovered in partly overlapping peaks. reconstitution with pooled fractions gave synergistic effects with the killing assay.
pathways of anaerobic acetate utilization in escherichia coli and aerobacter cloacae.
acetate-1-(14)c was added to anaerobic glucose-fermenting cultures of escherichia coli and aerobacter cloacae. in the e. coli culture, lactate formation occurred late in the fermentation, when the rate of production of formate and acetate had decreased. the occurrence of acetate label in the lactate indicated formation of pyruvate from acetyl-coenzyme a (coa) and formate. in the a. cloacae cultures, substantial amounts of acetate label were found in the 2,3-butanediol formed. evidence is presented that the label could have entered the diol only by conversion of formate and acetyl-coa into pyruvate. the observed levels of radioactivity in the diol indicated that during diol formation the reaction yielding formate and acetyl-coa from pyruvate coa was operating close to equilibrium. the shift in metabolism from formation of acetate, ethyl alcohol, and formate to the formation of butanediol or lactate appears to be due basically to an approach to equilibrium of the pyruvate-splitting reaction, whatever the induction mechanism by which the shift is implemented.
purification and genetic determination of bacteriocin production in enterobacter  cloacae.
enterobacter cloacae (strain df13) was found to produce a bacteriocin which could be induced by mitomycin c. in the supernatant fluid of the induced culture phagelike particles were found. the bacteriocin was partially purified from induced cultures by ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel-filtration on sephadex g-150. ultraviolet-absorbing material was eluted from the sephadex column in three fractions. the biological activity was mainly present in the second fraction and is associated with a protein with a molecular weight of about 61,000. the phagelike particles were found in the first fraction and show no biological activity. upon conjugation of e. cloacae strain df13 with another strain of the same species and with escherichia coli k-12s, the ability to produce bacteriocin was transferred. the new bacteriocinogenic strain produced bacteriocin, which could not be distinguished from that produced by e. cloacae strain df13. although transfer of the bacteriocinogenic factor often occurred together with transfer of the ability to produce phagelike particles, it was shown that these two factors are two separate genetic entities. in addition to a bacteriocinogenic factor, e. cloacae strain df13 was found to carry two other transferable plasmids: one determining resistance against streptomycin and sulfanilamide and another determining resistance against penicillin.
