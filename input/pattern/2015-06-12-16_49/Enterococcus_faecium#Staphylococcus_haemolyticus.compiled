TI  - [Identification of staphylococci directly from positive blood culture bottles by  MALDI-TOF MS system].
AB  - Bloodstream infections are substantial causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Staphylococcus species are the most commonly isolated microorganisms from blood cultures in clinical microbiology laboratories. MALDI-TOF MS (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time- of- Flight Mass Spectrometry) system allows the identification of microorganisms directly from positive blood culture bottles. The aim of this study was to evaluate the MALDI-TOF MS system for the identification of staphylococci directly from the positive blood culture bottles which revealed the presence of gram-positive cocci by staining. A total of 96 positive blood culture bottles that yielded gram-positive cocci by Gram stain were evaluated. These blood cultures were obtained from 69 patients between December 2013-February 2014. Conventional methods and BD Phoenix automated bacterial identification system (Becton Dickinson, USA) were used for routine identification. The strains were also identified by real-time Taqman PCR (qPCR) which was considered as the reference method. In MALDI-TOF MS method, MALDI Sepsityper Kit was used for the bacterial identification and all measurements were carried out by using Microflex LT instrument and FlexControl 3.0 software (Bruker Daltonics, USA). Of 96 culture bottles positive for gram-positive cocci, 90 were correctly identified as staphylococci at genus level with all the three study methods (qPCR, BD Phoenix, Bruker MALDI-TOF MS). The other six samples were identified as Enterococcus faecium (n= 4) and Streptococcus pyogenes (n= 2) by both Phoenix and the MALDI-TOF systems. Of the 90 samples, 87 were identified at the species level (15 S.aureus, 33 S.epidermidis, 29 S.hominis, 10 S.haemolyticus) and three at the genus level by the reference qPCR method. When comparing the results obtained by qPCR and Bruker MALDI-TOF MS, incompatibility was detected for three isolates. Those isolates were identified as S.hominis by qPCR, however two of them were identified as S.haemolyticus and one as S.epidermidis by MALDI-TOF MS. Compared with real-time Taqman PCR it was detected that Bruker MALDI TOF MS was identified 100% of S.aureus to the genus and species level and 100% and 96.6% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) to the genus and species level, respectively. In conclusion, it was thought that Bruker MALDI TOF MS system may allow rapid and reliable identification of S.aureus and CNS directly from positive blood culture bottles compared with the routine methods used in the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - A new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - An in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant Hypericum olympicum L. cf. uniflorum. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes); and Clostridium difficile. MICs were 2-8 mg/L for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/L for S. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/L for all species in the presence of blood. Compound 1 was also tested against Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium but was inactive. The MIC for Mycobacterium bovis BCG was 60 mg/L, and compound 1 inhibited the ATP-dependent Mycobacterium tuberculosis MurE ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) = 75 muM]. In a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of S. aureus overexpressing the NorA multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)C-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. Only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with IC50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 muM against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.
TI  - An international activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid: ZAAPS Program results for 2011.
AB  - Through a continuing resistance surveillance monitoring program, linezolid was shown to maintain its spectrum and potency against a collection of 8059 clinically relevant Gram-positive strains collected from patients at 79 medical centers in 33 countries and Hong Kong. Linezolid MIC90 values were 2 mug/mL for methicillin-resistant and -susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci, and the MIC90 value was 1 mug/mL for coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), beta-hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci. Reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing for linezolid demonstrated a 99.83% susceptibility rate for all organisms. All S. aureus were inhibited by </=2 mug/mL. Three (0.3%) of 928 strains of CoNS had a linezolid MIC of 4 mug/mL and contained the cfr resistance gene; 1 also had a mutation in L3. There were 14 linezolid-resistant strains detected from 7 countries (Brazil [5], France [1], Germany [2] Greece [2], Italy [2], Ireland [1], and Spain [1]) representing 5 species (E. faecium, S. capitis, S. epidermidis, S. hominis, S. lugdenensis). A mobile cfr gene was noted in 2 species having elevated linezolid MIC values; one was a S. haemolyticus isolate with a MIC at 4 mug/mL. Resistance rates were as follows for the 6 groups of organisms sampled in the 2011 ZAAPS Program: CoNS, 1.2%; enterococci, 0.39%; among S aureus, S. pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and beta-hemolytic streptococci, no resistance was detected. As the activities of commonly used antimicrobials continue to be compromised by evolving resistance mechanisms in Gram-positive pathogens, linezolid-resistant strains remain uncommon and without increasing occurrence.
TI  - Improving linezolid use decreases the incidence of resistance among Gram-positive microorganisms.
AB  - Surveillance studies have shown the emergence of infections with linezolid-resistant bacteria. The relationship between appropriate linezolid use and the spread of linezolid resistance among Gram-positive microorganisms in a single tertiary referral centre was evaluated. In an initial observational study, a prospective prescription-indication study was conducted on intensive care areas and haematology, neurosurgery, vascular surgery and nephrology wards during 2009. An intervention through follow-up feedback on audit results from May-June 2010 was then conducted. From July-December 2010, a second drug-use study of linezolid was conducted, with the same objectives and methodology. To assess the antimicrobial pressure of linezolid, an ecological study was conducted from 2006-2010 in the same hospital wards. Indications for linezolid in the initial study were considered suitable in 38.5% of cases, whilst in the second study the rate was 51.2% (33% increase). Linezolid consumption fell by 57% in the second half of 2010. A significant correlation was found between its inadequate use (DDD/1000 patient-days) and the incidence of linezolid-resistant strains/1000 patient-days (r=0.93; P=6.9e-024); 85% of the variability in the incidence of linezolid resistance was predicted by its inadequate use. Its partial correlations were significant for Enterococcus faecium (r=0.407; P=0.049), Staphylococcus epidermidis (r=0.874; P=2.3e-008) and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (r=0.406; P=0.049) but not Staphylococcus aureus (r=0.051; P=0.704). A relationship was found between appropriate linezolid use and the incidence of linezolid-resistant strains of E. faecium, S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus.
TI  - Linezolid-resistant clinical isolates of meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative  staphylococci and Enterococcus faecium from China.
AB  - Seventeen meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS), including ten Staphylococcus capitis, four Staphylococcus cohnii, two Staphylococcus haemolyticus and one Staphylococcus sciuri, and an Enterococcus faecium isolate with various levels of linezolid resistance were isolated from intensive care units in a Chinese hospital. PFGE indicated that the four S. cohnii isolates belonged to a clonal strain, and that nine of the S. capitis isolates were indistinguishable (clone A1) and the other one was closely related (clone A2). A G2576T mutation was identified in domain V of the 23S rRNA gene in the E. faecium isolate. Besides the G2576T mutation, a novel C2104T mutation was detected in the nine clone A1 S. capitis isolates. The cfr gene was detected in all the staphylococci except an S. sciuri isolate, whose 23S rRNA gene contained the G2576T mutation. There was a clonal dissemination of linezolid-resistant MRCoNS in intensive care units of our hospital, and this is the first report, to our knowledge, of linezolid-resistant staphylococci and enterococci in China.
TI  - [Investigation of distribution of bacteria and fungi in severe acute pancreatitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spectrum of bacteria and fungi in different sites in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: The prospective study was performed in 205 patients with SAP treated from January 2000 to December 2008. The Infection rate of bacteria and fungi was observed prospectively in pancreatic necrosis and(or) pus form abdomen, body fluids and deep vein catheter in SAP. Body fluids and pancreatic necrosis were cultured twice a week. Central venous catheter was cultured when it had been placed for two weeks. Blood was cultured for bacteria and fungi when body temperature was more than 39 degrees C. Constituent ratio of bacteria and fungi was observed in different sites and in all sites within 28 days after onset of SAP. RESULTS: There were 937 pathogens, among which infection rates of gram-negative bacteria was higher than gram-positive bacteria and fungi (P < 0.05), the infection rates of gam-positive bacteria and fungi were similar. Infection rates of gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis (55.2%), bile (55.4%), blood (68.1%) and central venous catheter (44.4%) were increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-positive bacteria and (30.2%, 33.9%, 23.4%, 38.9%) and fungi (14.6%, 10.7%, 8.5%, 16.7%); however, infection rate of fungi (59.6%) was increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-negative bacteria (24.0%) and gram-positive bacteria (16.3%) in urine; infection rate of gram-negative bacteria (53.2%) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of fungi (27.1%) and gram-positive bacteria (19.7%) in sputum. Infection rate of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) in gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis, bile, blood, central venous catheter and sputum was significantly higher than that of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae) (P < 0.01); infection rate of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli) was higher significantly (P < 0.01) than that of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii). Infection rate of staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium in pancreatic necrosis and sputum;but infection rate of Enterococcus faecium in bile and urine was significantly higher than other gram-positive bacteria (P < 0.05). There was not difference among gram-positive bacteria;however, infection rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis in central venous catheter was increased significantly (P < 0.05). Infection rate of candida mycoderma in pancreatic necrosis, bile, urine and sputum was significantly higher than that of tricho bacteria (P < 0.05). The peak of infection rate of microbes in body fluid was within 2 to 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Constituent ratio in gram-negative, gram-positive bacteria and fungi as well as their species in different sites is diverse. The peak of infection rate of microbes is 2 to 3 weeks after onset of the disease.
TI  - [Evolution in the antibiotic susceptibility and resistance].
AB  - Over the last decade the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has been a growing problem, especially in some geographic areas, making useless most of the classical antibiotic therapies. The rapid emergence of resistant bacteria is the result of different factors as the intrinsic microbial complexity, the growing attitude to travel of humans, animals and goods, the use of antibiotics outside hospitals, and the lack of precise therapeutic chooses for high risk group of patients. The antibiotic-resistance becomes certainly a serious problem when a resistant pathogen, and often multi-resistant today, is present in an infective site. In fact in a recent estimate of the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about 90.000 deaths per year in the USA are attributable to bacterial infections and in particular to resistant pathogens. It appears clear that the clinic relevance of this problem is the decimation of the sensible germs of the normal flora that leads to the upper hand of the only resistant bacteria. The antibiotic therapy, in fact, select the resistance and each bacteria has developed a particular strategy to survive: mutations of the genetic content or acquisition of resistance genes from the external. Among the Gram positive bacteria, besides methicillin resistant Staphyloccocus aureus, there are other pathogens such as coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, some species of streptococci and multiresistant Corynebacterium. The CoNS, eg. S. epidermidis, S. hominis and S. haemolyticus, are recognized as new important nosocomial pathogens and are not only responsible of invasive infections but have become in few years resistant to oxacillin (more than 60%) and multiresistant. The unsuspected fragility of glycopeptides, which for 40 years have been the most important treatment against infections due to Gram-positive bacteria, has posed the need for new antimicrobial molecules. Among the therapeutic possible options there are linezolid, tygecyline and daptomycin, but new other molecules are appearing in the clinical use like ceftobiprole and dalbavancin.
TI  - Bacterial diversity of Darfiyeh, a Lebanese artisanal raw goat's milk cheese.
AB  - In order to contribute to the preservation of the Lebanese dairy heritage, the aim of this study was to characterize the Darfiyeh cheese, a traditional variety made from raw goat's milk and ripened in goat's skin. Three independent batches of Darfiyeh production were analyzed after 20, 40 and 60 days of ripening. Mesophilic lactobacilli, thermophilic coccal-shaped lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and thermophilic lactobacilli were enumerated. In order to explore the Darfiyeh natural ecosystem, a combination of phenotypical and molecular approaches was applied. The latter included Polymerase Chain Reaction-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (PCR-TTGE), classical PCR and quantitative PCR. These methods revealed the presence of Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus malodoratus, group D Streptococcus sp., Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and L. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus curvatus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli, Clostridium sp./Eubacterium tenue. Real-time PCR enabled quantification of E. faecium, with a detection of 10(7)-10(9) cfu g(-1) of product. The present molecular approaches combined with phenotypic method allowed describing the complex natural ecosystem of Darfiyeh, giving useful information for the preservation of Lebanese artisanal dairy products.
TI  - DNA microarray for detection of macrolide resistance genes.
AB  - A DNA microarray was developed to detect bacterial genes conferring resistance to macrolides and related antibiotics. A database containing 65 nonredundant genes selected from publicly available DNA sequences was constructed and used to design 100 oligonucleotide probes that could specifically detect and discriminate all 65 genes. Probes were spotted on a glass slide, and the array was reacted with DNA templates extracted from 20 reference strains of eight different bacterial species (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides fragilis) known to harbor 29 different macrolide resistance genes. Hybridization results showed that probes reacted with, and only with, the expected DNA templates and allowed discovery of three unexpected genes, including msr(SA) in B. fragilis, an efflux gene that has not yet been described for gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - [Analysis of microorganisms isolated from febrile neutropenic children with neoplastic disease].
AB  - The microbiological evaluation of the blood was carried out as a continued monitoring of the microorganism culture using the colourmetric system VITAL 200 (bio-Merieux). There have been analysed 4660 bacteriological research results of the peripheral blood, blood from Broviac and from Broviac liquid of the children suffering from cancer treated in the years 1997-2000 in the Pediatric, Hematology and Oncology Clinique of the State Clinical Hospital in Bydgoszcz. There have been gained 1032 positive cultures from KZZ, KZB, PZB. There have been recognized 259 bacteremia and 22 fungemia by the children with fever in the neutropenia period. In the analysed four years in the blood dominated Gram-positive bacteria. Among Gram-positive bacteria there were mostly Staphylococcus spp. (42.5%), mostly CNS, fewer numerous were Streptococcus spp. (14.5%) and Corynebacterium spp. (5.9%). Among Gram-negative bacteria mostly were isolated Acinetobacter spp. (25.6%), Pseudomonas spp. (9.7%), E. coli (13.8%), Enterobacter spp. (13.9%), Klebsiella spp. (9.2%). There were observed few infections by strains resistant to many antibiotics, S. maltophilia, B. cepacia, E. faecium, S. haemolyticus. All strains Staphylococcus spp. were sensitive to vancomycin. There have not been found Enterococcus spp. resistant to glycopeptides. Most active against Gram-positive rods were carbapenems and aminoglycosides.
TI  - [Microbiological external quality assurance program (MEQAP)--evaluation of results obtained in sanitary epidemiological laboratories in 2002].
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate reliability of identification and determination of sensitivity to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics of some Gram positive cocci strains in 34 sanitary-epidemiological stations. All laboratories engaged in this study received 3 strains: S. aureus (S. aureus SC+ CF+, resistant to methicillin., or S. aureus SC - CF+, sensitive to methicillin), coagulase-negative staphylococci (S. epidermidis or S. haemolyticus or S. saprophyticus) and Enterococcus sp. (E. faecalis HLAR-positive or E. faecalis HLAR-negative or E. faecium or E. gallinarum). All these strains previously were identified in Department of Bacteriology of National Institute of Hygiene. Of the 68 staphylococci strains tested, 66 isolates were correctly identified. Among the 34 enterococcal strains studied the greatest difficulty in identification was caused by E. gallinarum strain--(8 out of 13 strains were incorrectly recognised). The determination of the sensitivity of the control strains to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents, generally was performed correctly in accordance with to the NCCLS and national recommendations. Some incorrect results of the antibiograms were caused by an erroneous interpretation of the zones of inhibition.
TI  - Microarray-based detection of 90 antibiotic resistance genes of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - A disposable microarray was developed for detection of up to 90 antibiotic resistance genes in gram-positive bacteria by hybridization. Each antibiotic resistance gene is represented by two specific oligonucleotides chosen from consensus sequences of gene families, except for nine genes for which only one specific oligonucleotide could be developed. A total of 137 oligonucleotides (26 to 33 nucleotides in length with similar physicochemical parameters) were spotted onto the microarray. The microarrays (ArrayTubes) were hybridized with 36 strains carrying specific antibiotic resistance genes that allowed testing of the sensitivity and specificity of 125 oligonucleotides. Among these were well-characterized multidrug-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Lactococcus lactis and an avirulent strain of Bacillus anthracis harboring the broad-host-range resistance plasmid pRE25. Analysis of two multidrug-resistant field strains allowed the detection of 12 different antibiotic resistance genes in a Staphylococcus haemolyticus strain isolated from mastitis milk and 6 resistance genes in a Clostridium perfringens strain isolated from a calf. In both cases, the microarray genotyping corresponded to the phenotype of the strains. The ArrayTube platform presents the advantage of rapidly screening bacteria for the presence of antibiotic resistance genes known in gram-positive bacteria. This technology has a large potential for applications in basic research, food safety, and surveillance programs for antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid & quinupristin/dalfopristin against Gram-positive  cocci.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Since the incidence of vancomycin- and methicillin-resistant Gram-positive infections continue to increase, novel antimicrobials such as linezolid and streptogramin may provide new options to treat patients. The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro susceptibility of Enterococcus faecium resistant to glycopeptides, coagulase negative staphylococci and S. aureus resistant to methicillin isolated mainly from blood and also rectal swab cultures of patients against quinupristin/dalfopristin and linezolid. METHODS: The in vitro susceptibility to linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin for a total of 332 isolates of Gram-positive cocci [127 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 109 methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (71 S. epidermidis, 38 S. haemolyticus) and 96 vanA genotype vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium] was investigated by E test. RESULTS: All MRSA and MRCoNS isolates were susceptible to linezolid (MICs < 4.0 mg/l). Ninety per cent of VRE isolates were inhibited by linezolid at concentration of 2.0 mg/l and presented similar activities to quinupristin/dalfopristin. MICs for quinupristin/dalfopristin against staphylococci were also low (MIC(90) = 1.0 mg/l for both MRSA and MRCoNS isolates). INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The results of the present study demonstrated that quinupristin/ dalfopristin and linezolid, have good in vitro activity against MRSA, MRCoNS and vancomycin resistant E. faecium in Turkey. These drugs could be promising therapeutic options in an era of rapidly growing antibiotic resistance in all parts of world.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial susceptibility for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (2,363 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), Streptococcus milleri group and Peptostreptococcus spp. The antibacterial activity of CZOP either against MSSA or MSSE was preferable (MIC90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/mL) and comparable to those of other cephems. CZOP was also effective on MRSE (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) but not on MRSA. CZOP and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (CPR; MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) and higher than those of other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, like other drugs. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and CPR (MIC90: < or = 0.063 microgram/mL), and, against S. agalactiae, was also preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL). CZOP indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against PSSP, PISP, or PRSP (MIC90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. milleri group was also preferable, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 95.9% in MRSA, 93.5% in PRSP, 63.3% in PISP, 35.8% in S. haemolyticus, 27.9% in E. faecalis, and 13.3% MRSE. Those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (CFPM), but E. faecalis showed 91.2% for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. In correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of PRSP was not inhibited at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or CFPM while 69.2% at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or ceftazidime. In conclusion, the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. A decline in the sensitivities of S. saprophyticus, S. milleri group, PISP, and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. A total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.
TI  - Inhibition by yeast killer toxin-like antibodies of oral Streptococci adhesion to tooth surfaces in an ex vivo model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monoclonal (KTmAb) and recombinant (KTscFv) anti-idiotypic antibodies, representing the internal image of a yeast killer toxin, proved to be microbicidal in vitro against important eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens such as Candida albicans, Pneumocystis carinii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant strains. KTmAb and KTscFv exerted a strong therapeutic effect in well-established animal models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Streptococcus mutans is the most important etiologic agent of dental caries that might result from the metabolic end products of dental plaque. Effective strategies to reduce the disease potential of dental plaque have considered the possibility of using antibiotics or antibodies against oral streptococci in general and S. mutans in particular. In this study, the activity of KTmAb and KTscFv against S. mutans and the inhibition and reduction by KTmAb of dental colonization by S. mutans and other oral streptococci in an ex vivo model of human teeth were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: KTscFv and KTmAb were used in a conventional colony forming unit (CFU) assay against a serotype C strain of S. mutans, and other oral streptococci (S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. salivarius). An ex vivo model of human teeth submerged in saliva was used to establish KTmAb potential of inhibiting or reducing the adhesion to dental surfaces by S. mutans and other oral streptococci. RESULTS: KTmAb and KTscFv kill in vitro S. mutans and other oral streptococci. KTmAb inhibit colonization of dental surfaces by S. mutans and oral streptococci in the ex vivo model. CONCLUSIONS: Killer antibodies with antibiotic activity or their engineered derivatives may have a potential in the prevention of dental caries in vivo.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem against isolates from complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem was measured using 4725 strains isolated from  patients with complicated urinary tract infections (CUTIs) between 1988 and 2000. Imipenem was inactive against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium and some non-fermenting Gram-negative rods. Resistant strains (MIC>16 mg/l) were observed in Staphylococcus haemolyticus (22%), Enterococcus faecalis (4%), Enterococcus avium (8%), Serratia marcescens (5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). Although the prevalence of imipenem-resistant strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa was sporadically high in some years, no steady increase was seen over the period. Resistant strains were rare in other major uropathogenic species. These results suggest that imipenem is still one of the most reliable antimicrobial drugs.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. Fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 127), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 123), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), Enterococcus faecium (n = 50), Enterococcus avium (n = 50), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. micros, P. prevotii; n = 125). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, CFPM, FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. The decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual MIC range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.
TI  - Evaluation of the VITEK 2 system for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - A study was conducted to evaluate the new VITEK 2 system (bioMerieux) for identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of gram-positive cocci. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n = 100), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (n = 100), Enterococcus spp. (n = 89), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 29), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 66) were examined with the ID-GPC identification card and with the AST-P515 (for staphylococci), AST-P516 (for enterococci and S. agalactiae) and AST-P506 (for pneumococci) susceptibility cards. The identification comparison methods were the API Staph for staphylococci and the API 20 Strep for streptococci and enterococci; for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the agar dilution method according to the procedure of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) was used. The VITEK 2 system correctly identified to the species level (only one choice or after simple supplementary tests) 99% of S. aureus, 96.5% of S. agalactiae, 96.9% of S. pneumoniae, 92.7% of Enterococcus faecalis, 91.3% of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and 88% of Staphylococcus epidermidis but was least able to identify Enterococcus faecium (71.4% correct). More than 90% of gram-positive cocci were identified within 3 h. According to the NCCLS breakpoints, antimicrobial susceptibility testing with the VITEK 2 system gave 96% correct category agreement, 0.82% very major errors, 0.17% major errors, and 2.7% minor errors. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed category agreement from 94 to 100% for S. aureus, from 90 to 100% for CNS, from 91 to 100% for enterococci, from 96 to 100% for S. agalactiae, and from 91 to 100% for S. pneumoniae. Microorganism-antibiotic combinations that gave very major errors were CNS-erythromycin, CNS-oxacillin, enterococci-teicoplanin, and enterococci-high-concentration gentamicin. Major errors were observed for CNS-oxacillin and S. agalactiae-tetracycline combinations. In conclusion the results of this study indicate that the VITEK 2 system represents an accurate and acceptable means for performing identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests with medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial sensitivity for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (1,913 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 178), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE; n = 98), methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE; n = 164), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), Enterococcus faecium (n = 91), Enterococcus avium (n = 72), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP; n = 100), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP; n = 29), Streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). CZOP possessed comparable antibacterial activities against MSSA and MSSE to other cephems, and was also effective on MRSE but not on MRSA. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. CZOP, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (CPR) and higher than other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, just like other drugs. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (CTM), cefepime (CFPM) and CPR, and that against S. agalactiae was also preferable. CZOP and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against S. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, CTM and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 96.5% in MRSA, 93.1% in PRSP, 60.0% in PISP, 40.3% in S. haemolyticus, 22.3% in E. faecalis, and 15.9% in MRSE. Those resistance ratios were similar to those for CFPM, but E. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. In conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria was observed. The sensitivities of PISP and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested to be decreasing.
TI  - Proficiency of Italian clinical laboratories in detecting reduced glycopeptide susceptibility in Enterococcus and Staphylococcus spp. using routine laboratory methodologies.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the ability of 59 clinical microbiology laboratories distributed throughout Italy to correctly identify and detect reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides in staphylococci and VanA-, VanB- or VanC-mediated glycopeptide resistance in enterococci. METHODS: Eight test strains comprising three staphylococci (S. aureus ATCC 29212 and two vancomycin-intermediate S. haemolyticus [11105301, 10030683Y]) and five enterococci (E. faecalis ATCC 29212, E. faecalis ATCC 51299 VanB, E. faecium AIB40 VanA, E. faecalis V583 VanB and E. gallinarum AIB39 VanC1) were distributed to 59 Italian clinical microbiology laboratories. Each isolate was blind-coded, and laboratories were instructed to identify the strains and test isolates for susceptibility to teicoplanin and vancomycin using their standard methods. Results were assessed against consensus test results obtained by a reference laboratory. In addition, to complement data interpretation, laboratories were asked to provide retrospective routine test results from their respective hospitals. RESULTS: All 59 laboratories participating in the study completed the susceptibility testing and provided data for analysis. A total of 53 laboratories provided retrospective routine data. Overall, laboratories were able to identify isolates to the genus level successfully. E. gallinarum and S. haemolyticus posed problems for species identification, with only 40.6 and 71.2%, respectively, of results reported correctly; most incorrect results were reported as 'other species'. For enterococcal test strains, VanA phenotypes were detected correctly by 96.6% of laboratories; VanB by 30.5% (E. faecalis ATCC 51299) and 88.1% (E. faecalis V583); and VanC1 by 67.8%. For staphylococcal test strains, 28.8% (S. haemolyticus 11105301) and 23.7% (S. haemolyticus 10030683Y) of the laboratories were able to detect reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. Errors in detecting vancomycin resistance in VanB and VanC1 enterococci were made with all methods, most noticeably by disk diffusion users. For staphylococci, most errors in reporting vancomycin-intermediate resistance occurred with disk diffusion and Vitek (software version 5.04) users. Overall, considerably fewer errors occurred with the detection of teicoplanin resistance, especially for staphylococci. For 1999, routine results show that 41/1749 (2.4%) of E. faecium, 220/11 180 (2.0%) of E. faecalis, 29/24 927 (0.12%) of S. aureus and 54/22 102 (0.24%) of coagulase-negative staphylococci were reported as resistant to vancomycin. CONCLUSION: Italian laboratories are able to identify staphylococci and enterococci adequately, although all methodologies used have problems in identifying E. gallinarum and coagulase-negative staphylococci to the species level. While VanA phenotypes were efficiently detected, problems were experienced in detecting VanB and VanC phenotypes. The majority of laboratories were unable to detect reduced vancomycin susceptibility in staphylococci adequately, especially with disk diffusion and older Vitek systems. Teicoplanin appeared useful as a marker for detecting vancomycin resistance, particularly with disk diffusion. Should enterococcal VanB or staphylococcal glycopeptide-intermediate phenotypes become prevalent in Italy, it is likely that they would be under-detected. New systems under development, such as Vitek2, should improve this situation.
TI  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates. MICs were determined by an agar dilution method on Mueller-Hinton agar (NCCLS/EUCAST) and on Isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/L free calcium (BSAC). Both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. Daptomycin MICs for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/L. For 99 of the 100 enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; Enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/L. For all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin MICs were 0.016- 0.25 mg/L; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/L. For miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc spp., Pediococcus spp. and isolates of Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin MICs were 0.03-2 mg/L; MICs for the seven isolates of Listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/L. There was little difference between the results on Mueller-Hinton agar and on supplemented Isotonic agar The discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented Isotonic agar. Daptomycin was active (MICs < or = 2 mg/L) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of E. faecium and L. monocytogenes (MICs = 4 mg/L). Our results indicate that daptomycin MICs are independent of methicillin and vancomycin MICs.
TI  - In vitro activities of RWJ-54428 (MC-02,479) against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - RWJ-54428 (MC-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. In a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), RWJ-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an MIC at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (MIC(90)) of 2 microg/ml. For coagulase-negative staphylococci, RWJ-54428 was 32 times more active than imipenem, with an MIC(90) of 2 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 was active against S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (RWJ-54428 MIC range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). RWJ-54428 was eight times more potent than methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MIC(90), 0.5 microg/ml). For ampicillin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), RWJ-54428 had an MIC(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 was also active against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. The potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; RWJ-54428 MICs ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. RWJ-54428 was more active than penicillin G and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). RWJ-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). This survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to RWJ-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.
TI  - In vitro activity of monoclonal and recombinant yeast killer toxin-like antibodies against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monoclonal (mAbKT) and recombinant single-chain (scFvKT) anti-idiotypic antibodies were produced to represent the internal image of a yeast killer toxin (KT) characterized by a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity, including gram-positive cocci. Pathogenic eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms, such as Candida albicans, Pneumocystis carinii, and a multidrug-resistant strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, presenting specific, although yet undefined, KT-cell wall receptors (KTR), have proven to be killed in vitro by mAbKT and scFvKT. mAbKT and scFvKT exert a therapeutic effect in vivo in experimental models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis by mimicking the functional activity of protective antibodies naturally produced in humans against KTR of infecting microorganisms. The swelling tide of concern over increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotic drugs gives the impetus to develop new therapeutic compounds against microbial threat. Thus, the in vitro bactericidal activity of mAbKT and scFvKT against gram-positive, drug-resistant cocci of major epidemiological interest was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: mAbKT and scFvKT generated by hybridoma and DNA recombinant technology from the spleen lymphocytes of mice immunized with a KT-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb KT4) were used in a conventional colony forming unit (CFU) assay to determine, from a qualitative point of view, their bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae strains. These bacterial strains are characterized by different patterns of resistance to antibiotics, including methicillin, vancomycin, and penicillin. RESULTS: According to the experimental conditions adopted, no bacterial isolate proved to be resistant to the activity of mAbKT and scFvKT. CONCLUSIONS: scFvKT exerted a microbicidal activity against multidrug resistant bacteria, which may represent the basis for the drug modeling of new antibiotics with broad antibacterial spectra to tackle the emergence of microbial resistance.
TI  - A comparison of antimicrobial resistance rates in Gram-positive pathogens isolated in the UK from October 1996 to January 1997 and October 1997 to January 1998.
AB  - Rates of resistance for two consecutive years for 28 centres (10 Teaching, nine Associate Teaching and nine District General hospitals) in the UK were compared. Combined rates of resistance for each of the hospital types of Staphylococcus aureus to methicillin revealed an increase in the rate of resistance in Teaching hospitals (12.5% year 1, 23.5% year 2), but, for Associate Teaching and District General hospitals rates fell (Associate Teaching 19.1% year 1, 11.9% year 2; District General 16.5% year 1 and 11.3% year 2). Using conventional methodology to determine MICs, no strain was considered to have reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. Among coagulase-negative staphylococci, increased resistance was observed for Staphylococcus epidermidis to rifampicin, for Staphylococcus haemolyticus to clindamycin, for Staphylococcus saprophyticus to penicillin and for Staphylococcus spp. to clindamycin, methicillin and rifampicin. For Streptococcus pneumoniae an upward trend in low-level resistance to penicillin was observed (18 of the 28 centres), however, for high-level resistance the trend was in the opposite direction (only four centres showed an increase). For Enterococcus faecalis there was a trend to a fall in levels of resistance, the only exception being an increase in high-level gentamicin resistance (10.5% year 1, 15.1% year 2, P = 0.0388). For Enterococcus faecium rates of resistance were not significantly different except for increases in resistance to nitrofurantoin and rifampicin.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in staphylococci and enterococci in 10 Portuguese hospitals in 1996 and 1997. POSGAR. Portuguese Study Group of Antimicrobial Resistance.
AB  - During a 2-year period, 10 Portuguese hospitals located throughout the country studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinically relevant staphylococci and enterococci. Of more than 12,000 Staphylococcus aureus isolates tested, two main patterns were found, methicillin-sensitive organisms most of them resistant only to penicillin but a few to other antimicrobials and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains (prevalence 48.2%) resistant to most of the antimicrobials tested and uniformly susceptible to vancomycin. Among coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), 71% of S. epidermidis (approximately 5,000 isolates tested) and 84% S. haemolyticus (approximately 1,000 isolates tested) were also resistant to methicillin as well as most other antimicrobials except vancomycin. Most of the 5,000 Enterococcus faecalis isolates tested were susceptible to ampicillin and vancomycin, in contrast to 650 E. faecium isolates, 70% of which were resistant to ampicillin and 20% to vancomycin and all other antibiotics. A high prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance occurred in both Enterococcus species. This survey showed that resistance profiles of staphylococci and enterococci hospital isolates have not changed in the last 5 years in Portugal, with the exception of the rise in vancomycin resistance in E. faecium. The high prevalence of methicillin resistance in S. aureus and in the CNS remains an issue of medical concern.
TI  - European Glycopeptide Susceptibility Survey of gram-positive bacteria for 1995. European Glycopeptide Resistance Survey Study Group.
AB  - In the European Glycopeptide Susceptibility Survey 7078 Gram-positive isolates collected in 1995 from 70 centers in 9 countries of Western Europe were examined, using a standardized, quantitative susceptibility testing method. Of the 7078 isolates, 6824 (96.4%) were tested by the national coordinating centers. Teicoplanin (mode MIC 0.5 microgram/mL) was generally twice as active as vancomycin (mode MIC 1 microgram/mL) against Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2852). All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin (MIC < or = 4 micrograms/mL) and all but four to teicoplanin (MIC < or = 8 micrograms/mL); these four isolates were of intermediate susceptibility (MIC 16 micrograms/mL). With coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 1444), the distribution of MIC of teicoplanin was wider than for vancomycin. Two and two-tenths percent of coagulase-negative staphylococci excluding Staphylococcus haemolyticus required 16 micrograms/mL teicoplanin for inhibition (intermediate) and 0.4% > or = 32 micrograms/mL (resistant). Among isolates of S. haemolyticus, 4.4% were of intermediate susceptibility (MIC 16 micrograms/mL) and 3.3% were resistant (MIC > or = 32 micrograms/mL) to teicoplanin. However, this species represented only 6.3% of the isolates of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. Generally, teicoplanin (mode MIC < or = 0.12 microgram/mL) was four to eight times more active than vancomycin (mode MIC < or = 0.5 microgram/mL) against the 770 streptococcal isolates. Glycopeptide-susceptible Enterococcus spp. (n = 1695) were generally four times more susceptible to teicoplanin (mode MIC 0.25 microgram/mL) than to vancomycin (mode MIC 1 microgram/mL). Combined vancomycin and teicoplanin (VanA phenotype) resistance was observed more frequently (9.3%) in isolates of Enterococcus faecium than in Enterococcus faecalis (0.8%). Four isolates of unspeciated enterococci (1.4%) also expressed this resistance phenotype. Four isolates of E. faecium and four of E. faecalis expressed the VanB-type (low-level, vancomycin only) resistance. Spain was the only country not to submit resistant E. faecium strains while resistant E. faecalis isolates came only from Spain and Italy.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin against Gram-positive bloodstream isolates.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, rifampicin, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 414 bloodstream isolates of Gram-positive cocci. Quinupristin-dalfopristin inhibited strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae at 0.12 mg/L, methicillin- and/or erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at 0.5 mg/L, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus anginosus at 1 mg/L and Enterococcus faecalis at 8 mg/L.
TI  - [Multicenter study of isolated micro-organisms resistant to antimicrobials in 10  Portuguese hospitals in 1994].
AB  - In 1994, Microbiology Laboratories of ten Portuguese hospitals analysed isolated  microorganisms found in blood and urine samples and studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of the most frequent bacterial pathogens. From 63780 blood samples, the most frequent were Staphylococcus spp. and from 69189 urine samples significant numbers of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida spp. were isolated. Escherichia coli strains (c.7000) revealed a low percentage of resistance to antibiotics with the exceptions of ampicillin (48%) and co-trimoxazol (25%). Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (c.2000) revealed important resistance to ampicillin (98%), cephalotin (31%), co-trimoxazol (38%) and gentamicin (28%), while values for 3rd generation cephalosporins varied among hospitals, with several strains showing phenotype of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. A great variation in resistance values of P. aeruginosa (c.4000) was found in relation to the antibiotics as well as to the hospitals. Resistance to methicillin in S. aureus (c.6000) was high, reaching an average of 47%, and it was even higher with S. epidermidis (c.3000) and S. haemolyticus (c.650). Only vancomycin was always active against these strains. In E. faecalis (c.2500) resistance was of 2% to ampicillin, 35% to gentamicin, 45% to streptomycin and 1% to vancomycin. E. faecium isolates (c.300) showed the most worrying results with 70% resistance to ampicillin, 42% to gentamicin, 59% to streptomycin and 9% (30 strains isolated in 5 hospitals) to vancomycin. Vancomycin resistant strains were also resistant to all other antibiotics.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. Rationale for clinical use.
AB  - Most Gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500; Synercid). Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (MIC90) were < or = 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Listeria monocytogenes. Importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. Enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant Enterococcus faecium. E. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. Among the Gram-negative respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and Haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. are resistant. The drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant E. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus with the combination of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus infection in rabbits, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. The drug is rapidly bactericidal against Gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the MIC, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Susceptibility of staphylococci and enterococci to glycopeptides comparison of 3  test methods.
AB  - The significance of grampositive bacteria, especially staphylococci and enterococci, as nosocomial pathogens has increased in the last decade. Furthermore, resistance to commonly used antibiotics like beta-lactams has also become more common and even resistance to glycopeptides has been observed. We evaluated the susceptibility of 150 staphylococcal clinical isolates (52 S. epidermidis, 52 S. haemolyticus, 10 S. saprophyticus, 10 S. hominis, 4 S. warneri, 4 S. simulans, 4 S. capitis and 14 S. aureus) and of 50 enterococci (49 E. faecalis, 1 E. faecium) to the glycopeptides, vancomycin and teicoplanin. The data from the agar dilution test used as reference method were compared with the results from the E test and the agar disk diffusion test. Concerning vancomycin, no resistance among all the staphylococcal isolates was observed whereas one single enterococcal strain (E. faecium) proved to be resistant. The overall resistance of staphylococcal isolates against teicoplanin was about 10.7% (15 S. haemolyticus, 1 S. epidermidis) being mainly due to the high proportion of S. haemolyticus strains (52 out of 150) among the staphylococcal isolates. Teicoplanin resistance among the enterococci was not detected. For vancomycin, a very close correlation between the MICs from the agar dilution test and the E test was noticed. As concerns teicoplanin, the MICs from the E-test were usually somewhat lower than those obtained by the agar dilution test. No correlation was found between the MICs of resistant and intermediate staphylococcal strains and the results from the teicoplanin agar disk diffusion test. For routine teicoplanin susceptibility testing of staphylococci, the determination of the MIC (e.g., by the E test) is much more reliable for detecting resistant strains than the agar disk diffusion test.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of CS-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of CS-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone drug, was tested against 761 clinical isolates. CS-940 activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae was most similar to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, with a large range of MICs inhibiting 90% of isolates tested (MIC90S) of 0.015 to 16 micrograms/ml (median MIC90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). CS-940 had greater activity than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin when they were tested against Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90S, 0.03 micrograms/ml) and Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia (MIC90S, 2 micrograms/ml). CS-940 demonstrated a high degree of potency against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria spp. (MIC90S, < or = 0.06 micrograms/ml). CS-940 was two- to eightfold more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. CS-940 was also very active against Streptococcus spp. and enterococci, for which MIC90S were < or = 2 micrograms/ml; for Enterococcus faecium, however, the MIC90 was 4 micrograms/ml. CS-940 was generally less active than a comparison investigational fluoroquinolone, clinafloxacin. This compound appears promising by in vitro test analysis and warrants further in vivo trials.
TI  - In vitro activity of the semisynthetic glycopeptide amide MDL 63,246.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the semisynthetic glycopeptide amide MDL 63,246 against  293 U.S. clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci was determined by the broth microdilution method. When compared with teicoplanin, MDL 63,246 had improved activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis (MICs that inhibited 90% strains tested [MIC90s], 0.25 versus 8 micrograms/ml, respectively). Staphylococcus haemolyticus (MIC90s, 1 versus 32 micrograms/ml, respectively), and VanA Enterococcus faecium (MIC90s, 32 versus > or = 1,024 micrograms/ml, respectively).
TI  - [Method of DNA extraction and mecA, femA and PBP2' in multi-drug resistant bacterial strains].
AB  - Recently, it has become more important to establish rapid and reliable methods for identifying bacterial species and their drug resistances because of the high incidence of nosocomial infection caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria. At first, several enzymes were tested to evaluate the efficacy of DNA extraction. N-acetylmuramidase, lysozyme and achromopeptidase were most effective to extract DNA from E. faecalis, E. faecium and S. aureus, respectively. After achromopeptidase extraction, the mecA gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in clinically isolated MRSA (95 strains), MSSA (66), MRSE (methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, 37), MSSE (methicillin-sensitive S. epidermidis, 1), S haemolyticus(5), S.hominis(1) and others (Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, and Streptococcus, total 45). PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The positive rates were 95% (MRSA), 1.5% (MSSA), and 97% (MRSE). The mecA gene was also positive in 2/2 of methicillin-resistant S.haemolyticus and 2/3 of methicillin-sensitive S.haemolyticus and 1/1 of methicillin-resistant S.hominis. The mecA gene was not detected in 45 non-Staphylococcal strains. MecA and femA gene by PCR and PBP 2' by IRMA were further detected in newly isolated MRSA (20 strains), MSSA(20), MRSE(14), MSSE(1) and S.simulans(2). Complete correlation between MPIPC susceptibility and mecA were found. The femA gene was positive in 39/40 of S. aureus, and 0/14 of S.epidermidis, 2/3 of S.simulans. PBP2' were positive in 20/20 of MRSA, 0/20 of MSSA, 14/14 of MRSE, 0/1 of MSSE, 1/1 of methicillin-resistant S.simulans, and 0/2 of methicillin-sensitive S.simulans. In conclusion, diagnoses of MRSA by simultaneous detection of mecA and femA gene as well as PBP2' are similarly useful because of their specificity and rapidity.
TI  - Identification of gram positive cocci isolated from urine.
AB  - A total of 195 strains of Gram positive cocci isolated from urine, in pure culture and in counts of > 10(3) colony forming units/ml, during January-September 1992, were speciated using schema recently described by Facklam and Washington, and Kloos and Lambe. Seventy three (85%) of the 86 enterococci were identified as Enterococcus faecalis while 11 (13%) were E. faecium. Eighteen (29%) of the 62 staphylococcal isolates were Staphylococcus aureus; 20 (45%) of the 44 coagulase negative staphylococci were speciated as Staph. haemolyticus. Of the 47 strains of beta haemolytic streptococci isolated, 45 (96%) were group B; one was group G and the other group F. Our results show the diverse species of Gram positive cocci associated with bacteriuria and the need to speciate them in a diagnostic laboratory. In the context of a larger number of tests required for the speciation of Gram positive cocci, we recommend a simplified scheme which we found feasible on a routine basis.
TI  - [Determination of the susceptibility of staphylococci and enterococci to plycopeptides by the E-test method].
AB  - E-test was evaluated by comparison with the reference agar dilution method on 15  enterococci and 15 staphylococci with variable resistance to glycopeptides and isolated from clinical samples: 15 enterococci with 3 glycopeptide-resistant (2 E. facalis and 1 E. faecium), 1 glycopeptide intermediate E. gallinarum and 11 glycopeptide-sensible E. faecalis; 15 staphylococci with 4 teicoplanine-resistant (1 S. aureus, 1 S. epidermidis and 2 S. hominis), 3 teicoplanin-intermediate (1 S. epidermidis, 2 S. haemolyticus) and 8 teicoplanin sensible strains (6 S. aureus, 1 S. epidermidis and 1 S. hominis). Repeatability (10 determinations by strain) and exactitude were tested for all strains. Our data shows very good results for repeatability and exactitude with the reference method except in the case of coagulase negative staphylococci and teicoplanin. Some technical problems appear in our experience: for staphylococci, a 48 h incubation is necessary to detect teicoplanin-intermediate strains but 24 h is sufficient for enterococci. E-test is expensive, require a strict methodology, but is a good method to detect glycopeptide resistance for staphylococci and enterococci except for coagulase negative staphylococci and teicoplanine.
TI  - Infection problems for the 1990's--do we have an answer?
AB  - There is and has been continued change in organisms causing infection in the hospital. In the past few years, although Gram-negative bacteria have remained a major cause of mortality, Gram-positive bacteria and fungi have become increasingly important. This has caused organisms such as methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci, Xanthomonas maltophilia and multiply resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa to be common pathogens. Can this difficult state of affairs be changed by better antimicrobial prescribing practices? Yes and no. Virtually any agent will select MRSA and MRSE since the chromosomal location of the resistance of multiple-antibiotics makes such selection common and explains the rapid rate of the fluoroquinolones as therapy of MRSA. Restriction of oral vancomycin will markedly reduce the pressure to select Enterococcus faecium and thus limit the spread of the organisms and delay transmission of glycopeptide resistance to S. aureus. Judicious use of antibiotics in the intensive care environment will be major factor in "saving" antibiotics for other patients since the ICU patient goes to other parts of the hospital carrying with him/her the baggage of resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus, klebsiella, P. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, enterobacter, xanthomonas and Pseudomonas cepacia. All of these organisms have the potential to become resistant to the agents heretofore used to treat them and are common in ICU patients.
TI  - The activity of metal compounds against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - We evaluated the antimicrobial activity of two metal compounds, JM-1397 (OsO2[xylyl]2) and JM-2469 (AuCl[S2CPEt3]). Both inhibited methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus at concentrations of 0.5-2 micrograms/ml, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) of 1 microgram/ml for JM-1397 and 0.5 microgram/ml for JM-2469. Similar concentrations inhibited methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus). JM-2469 inhibited group A, B, C, F, and G beta-hemolytic streptococci and viridans group streptococci at 1-8 micrograms/ml (MIC90 4 micrograms/ml) but Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium had MICs of 8-16 micrograms/ml. JM-1397 had MICs for these organisms of greater than 64 micrograms/ml. Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides, and Clostridium species were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.12-4 micrograms/ml (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/ml). MICs of both compounds for Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. were greater than 64 micrograms/ml. These studies show that osmium and gold compounds have potential as topical agents against Gram-positive and anaerobic species.
TI  - In vitro activity of decaplanin (M86-1410), a new glycopeptide antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro activity of decaplanin (formerly M86-1410), a novel glycopeptide antimicrobial agent, was tested against 169 gram-positive bloodstream isolates from patients at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics and 12 selected vancomycin-resistant strains. Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, bacilli, corynebacteria, and listeria were inhibited by decaplanin (MICs for 90% of the strains tested [MIC90s], 0.12 to 4 micrograms/ml). However, some rarely isolated and selected Enterococcus sp. populations had a MIC90 of 16 micrograms/ml, and S. haemolyticus strains had a MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml. These in vitro results suggest that decaplanin may be useful against most gram-positive strains, even though some Enterococcus species and coagulase-negative staphylococci were potentially resistant (MICs, greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml).
