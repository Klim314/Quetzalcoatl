TI  == surgical site infections in day surgery settings.
AB  == background: because major complications are rare in day surgery, minor morbidities such as surgical site infections, which become evident only after patient discharge, have a major impact on the perceived quality of care. we performed an audit of such infections over a oneyear period. methods: all procedures were performed in a multidisciplinary day surgery setting. there were  155 inguinal hernia repairs, 44 excisions of lipomas, and 27 excisions of pilonidal cysts. all patients received antibiotic prophylaxis according to a rotation protocol. results: one patient (0.65%) operated on for inguinal hernia developed a deep incisional infection caused by staphylococcus schleiferi. the patient was treated using selective antibiotics, and complete recovery ensued. one patient (2.27%) who underwent excision of a lipoma revealed developed a deep  incisional infection associated with fever (39 degrees c) caused by staphylococcus aureus. he was treated by daily antibiotics and application of dressings for two weeks and recovered. one patient (3.7%) treated for pilonidal cyst developed a deep incisional surgical site infection. a group a streptococcus was isolated, and he received an intravenous antibiotic for ten days. in the seven patients treated for pilonidal cyst with the wound left open, swab specimens were taken because of persisting local pain, and the following bacteria were found: pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus vulgaris, and streptococcus constellatus. no antibiotic therapy was given, and local wound care led to complete recovery. conclusion: in our day surgery unit, the rates of surgical site infection are similar to those described in the literature. continuing audit is essential to maintain and improve the quality and standard of the surgery provided. prevention of surgical site infection is very much the responsibility of the persons working in the operating theater. therefore, it is vital not only to apply strict regulations concerning everyday management but also to maintain a high degree of motivation among the personnel.

TI  == a prospective study of microorganisms in urine and bladder biopsies from interstitial cystitis patients and controls.
AB  == objectives: interstitial cystitis (ic) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the bladder of unknown etiology. we tested the hypothesis that a microorganism would  be found at higher prevalence in urine or bladder tissue from women with ic than  from control women. methods: urine and bladder tissue were obtained at cystoscopy from 11 ic patients and 7 control subjects. these specimens were cultured for a variety of fastidious and nonfastidious bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and viruses. in addition, special staining techniques were used to examine biopsy specimens and cytospun urine, and tissue sections and outgrowths of explanted bladder cells were examined by electron microscopy. results: cultures of urine from 6 of 11 ic patients grew five different bacteria (corynebacterium sp. klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacillus sp, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus morbillorum), human cytomegalovirus, or torulopsis glabrata; one of these organisms (lactobacillus sp) was found in urine from 2 patients. although contamination by urethral organisms is possible, the prevalence of microorganisms in urine of ic patients (6 of 11) was significantly greater than in urine of control subjects (0 of 7) (p < 0.05). acridine orange staining revealed rods with appropriate morphology in urine from 4 of the 5 ic patients who had positive bacterial cultures and yeastlike organisms in urine and bladder tissue specimens  that grew torulopsis. additionally, rodlike organisms were seen in urine from 2 ic patients with negative bacterial cultures and cocci were seen in the urine of  1 control patient. biopsy specimens from 2 ic patients grew torulopsis sp or lactobacillus sp, in agreement with the results of acridine orange staining and culture of urine from these patients; in contrast, specimens from 3 control subjects grew small numbers of pseudomonas sp or staphylococcus epidermidis, but  no organisms were cultured from urine or seen in acridine orange-stained tissue smears. all other cultures and stains were negative. conclusions: these data do not provide evidence that ic is associated with infection or colonization by a single microorganism. however, they do generate the hypothesis that the prevalence of microorganisms, especially bacteria at low concentrations, is greater in the urine of ic patients than of control subjects. if these results are confirmed by other controlled studies, the question of whether the presence of these organisms is a cause or a result of ic should be addressed.

TI  == immunobiological activities of bacteria isolated from the root canals of postendodontic teeth with persistent periapical lesions.
AB  == although intraradicular bacteria are widely considered to be the primary etiological agents of periapical lesions, the immunobiological properties of the  species in question are not adequately known. the aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the pathobiological properties of the 10 most frequently isolated endodontopathic bacterial species. using cellular components of the pathogens obtained by sonic extraction, we have investigated their ability to induce monocyte migration, interleukin 1 production, mitogenic responses of lymphocytes, and the polyclonal activation of b lymphocytes. it was found that all of the tested species enhanced the migration of monocytes and induced mitogenesis in b lymphocytes. the polyclonal activation of b cells and the induction of interleukin 1 by monocytes were found to be stronger in gram-negative anaerobes. furthermore, all of the tested species excluding bacteroides oralis were poor t cell mitogens. these findings show that a wide range of pathobiological properties are attributable to the most frequently isolated endodontic pathogens. it thus seems plausible that a battery of complex  immunological responses induced by such microbes lead to the formation of persistent periapical lesions.
