TI  == [protease activity of microflora in the oral cavity of patients with periodontitis].
AB  == microbial spectrum and non-specific as well as specific iga1 protease activity of isolated microorganisms were investigated in gingival liquid of patients with periodontitis. microorganisms from the gingival liqud of these patients belonged  to conditional-pathogenic obligate and facultatively anaerobic bacteria. 24 strains of microorganisms have been identified. nonspecific proteolytic activity  was found in the following microorganisms: actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, aerococcus viridans, bifidobacterium longum, neisseria subflave, streptococcus parvulus, eubacterium alactolyticum, lactobaccilus catenoforme, bacillus spp. specific iga1-protease activity and lack of proteolytic activity towards igg was found in streptococcus acidominimus, streptococcus hansenii, streptococcus salivarius, leptotrychia buccalis, staphylococcus haemolyticus and  neisseria sicca. no proteolytic activity was found in cultivation medium of eubacterium alactolyticum (1 strain), prevotella buccalis, aerococcus viridans and streptococcus sanguis.

TI  == decontamination effects of low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge.  part ii: new insights.
AB  == the second part of our paper presents the results of experiments with the decontamination of surfaces by low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge in air at atmospheric pressure. a simple device is described and the effects of the corona discharge on model microorganisms, viz. the yeast candida albicans, gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, neisseria sicca, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, gram-positive bacteria deinococcus radiodurans, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus sanguinis, and vegetative and spore forms of geobacillus stearothermophilus are discussed. a similar microbicidal effect after about one-minute exposure was observed in all vegetative forms of the microorganisms. measurement in growth inhibition zones on a semisolid medium was used to determine the dependence of the microbicidal effect on exposure time and the distance between electrodes. counting of colonies served to assess the microbicidal effect of the discharge on contaminated inert surfaces observable after more than 1 min exposure. geobacillus stearothermophilus spores were found to have several times lower susceptibility to the action of the discharge and the microbicidal effect was observed only after an 8 min exposure. reaction with the iodide reagent did not unambiguously demonstrate the difference between ozone and singlet oxygen as presumed active components of the corona. the area distribution of reactive oxygen species was determined; it was found to differ from the wartburg law depending on exposure time. qualitative evidence was obtained on the penetration  of the reactive oxygen species into the semisolid medium.

TI  == bacteria in human mouths involved in the production and utilization of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == earlier studies have demonstrated that pure cultures of oral streptococci produce hydrogen peroxide but none has found any free peroxide in dental plaque or salivary sediment despite streptococci being major components of their mixed bacterial populations. the absence of peroxide in plaque and sediment could be due to the dominance of its destruction over its formation by bacterial constituents. to identify which of the oral bacteria might be involved in such a  possibility, pure cultures of 27 different oral bacteria were surveyed (as well as dental plaque and sediment) for their peroxide-forming and peroxide-removing capabilities. peroxide production was measured for each of the pure cultures by incubation with glucose at low and high substrate concentrations (2.8 and 28.0 mm) for 4 h and with the ph kept at 7.0 by a ph-stat. removal of hydrogen peroxide was assessed in similar experiments where peroxide at 0, 29.4, 147.2 or  294.4 mm [0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1% (w/v)] replaced the glucose. hydrogen peroxide formation was seen with only three of the bacteria tested, streptococcus sanguis  i and ii (sanguis and oralis), and strep. mitior (mitis biotype i); levels of hydrogen peroxide between 2.2 and 9.8 mm were produced when these micro-organisms were grown aerobically and 1.1 and 3.9 mm when grown anaerobically. earlier reports indicate that such levels were usually sufficient to inhibit the growth of many plaque bacteria. the amounts formed were similar at the two glucose levels tested, suggesting that maximum peroxide production is reached at low glucose concentration. none of the three peroxide-producing organisms was able to utilize hydrogen peroxide but five of the other 24 tested, neisseria sicca, haemophilus segnis, h. parainfluenzae, actinomyces viscosus and staphylococcus epidermidis, could readily do so, as could the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment and dental plaque, both of which contain relatively high numbers of these peroxide-utilizing micro-organisms. the ability of the bacteria in plaque and sediment to degrade hydrogen peroxide was considerable and extremely rapid; peroxide removal and usually complete within the first 15 min of the incubation even when its initial level was as high as 294.4 mm. this almost overwhelming ability to remove peroxide was confirmed when peroxide-producing and -using cultures were mixed and when each of eight salivary sediments was incubated with  glucose and with peroxide at concentrations up to 294.4 mm. in the glucose incubations, no hydrogen peroxide was observed, indicating dominance of microbial peroxide removers over hydrogen peroxide producers.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == comparative adhesion of seven species of streptococci isolated from the blood of  patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro.
AB  == the adhesion to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro of 21 strains of streptococci isolated from the blood of patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis (sabe)  was measured. the species, in order of greatest adhesion, were streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus milleri, streptococcus sanguis, dextran-positive streptococcus mitior, dextran-negative streptococcus mitior and  streptococcus salivarius. individual strains within species, however, cannot be assumed to be representative of their species and may exhibit unusually high or low adhesion. adhesion depended upon both bacterial concentration and period of contact. there was no simple relationship between ability to adhere and liability to cause endocarditis. formation of dextran did not increase adhesion. the streptococci were more adhesive than strains of escherichia coli and neisseria sicca and less adhesive than strains of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes.

TI  == viability of six species of normal oropharyngeal bacteria after exposure to cigarette smoke in vitro.
AB  == bacteria in culture medium at 37 degrees c were subjected to eight puffs of smoke from one cigarette, and viable cell counts were done at intervals ranging from 0  min to 3 h after exposure to smoke. the cigarette contained 23.0 mg of tar and 1.4 mg of nicotine. each 25.0 ml puff of smoke from a mechanical smoking apparatus was passed over a 1.0 ml suspension of bacteria dispersed over a 25 cm2 surface in a sterile flask. filtered air was in contact with the suspension between puffs, and during the intervals between smoke treatment and viable cell counts being done. there was a marked decrease in numbers of viable branhamella catarrhalis at 15 min after exposure to smoke, and by 1 h there were no viable cells in suspensions which originally contained 10(7) bacteria. no reduction in the number of viable branhamella catarrhalis occurred in an untreated suspension  of the micro-organism. there was a marked decrease in viable neisseria perflava at 30 min, and by 3 h there were no viable cells. there was a 4 to 5 log10 reduction of viable neisseria sicca compared with untreated bacteria at 3 h after exposure to smoke. streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguis were less susceptible to the harmful action of cigarette smoke, and by 3 h there were 1 to 2 log10 differences in viable cell counts between smoke-treated and untreated bacteria. non-filter cigarette smoke had a greater detrimental effect on all species of bacteria studied than smoke from filter-tipped cigarettes.

TI  == viridins, bacteriocins of alpha-hemolytic streptococci: isolation, characterization, and partial purification.
AB  == bacteriocin-like activities were detected in 78% of 120 alpha-hemolytic streptococcal isolates. inhibitory substances from three such isolates (one streptococcus sanguis strain and two s. mitis strains) were investigated further  and termed viridins (a, b, and c). the viridins were unique among bacteriocins of gram-positive bacteria in that they inhibited many gram-negative bacteria in addition to inhibition of a variety of gram-positive organisms. viridins were obtained in a cell-free state only after mechanical disruption of bacteriocinogenic cells but could not be isolated from supernatant fluids of cultures of such bacteria or from freeze-thaw liquor of agar on which the bacteria had been grown. viridin b could be partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and by gel filtration on a sephadex g-100 column. this bacteriocin had some unusual properties including heat lability, a narrow ph range of activity, and lack of adsorptive capacity to susceptible bacteria. although viridin b was bactericidal to a neisseria sicca strain, it was only bacteriostatic against a coagulase-negative staphylococcus.
