TI  == antioxidative potential of folate producing probiotic lactobacillus helveticus cd6.
AB  == folate producing lactobacillus sp. cd6 isolated from fermented milk showed 98% similarity with lactobacillus helveticus based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. it was found to produce a folic acid derivative 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate (5-methf). the intracellular cell-free extract of strain demonstrated antioxidative activity with the inhibition rate of ascorbate autoxidation in the range of 27.5% +/- 3.7%. it showed highest metal ion chelation ability for fe(2+) (0.26 +/- 0.06 ppm) as compared to cu(2+). the dpph  (alpha,alpha-diphenyl-beta-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity for intact cells were found to be 24.7% +/- 10.9% proved its antioxidative potential. furthermore, it demonstrated 14.89% inhibition of epinephrine autoxidation, 20.9  +/- 1.8 mug cysteine equivalent reducing activity and 20.8% +/- 0.9% hydroxyl radical scavenging effect. the strain was evaluated for probiotic properties as per who and fao guidelines. it showed 90.61% survival at highly acidic condition  (ph 2.0), 90.66% viability in presence of synthetic gastric juice and 68% survivability at 0.5% bile concentration for 24 h. it was susceptible to many antibiotics which reduces the prospect to offer resistance determinants to other  organisms if administered in the form of probiotic preparations. it showed in vitro mucus binding and antimicrobial activity against enteric pathogens like salmonella typhimurium (ncim 2501), streptococcus pyogenes (ncim 2608), and staphylococcus aureus (ncim 5021) and moreover it showed non- hemolytic activity  on sheep blood agar.

TI  == in vitro functional and immunomodulatory properties of the lactobacillus helveticus mimlh5-streptococcus salivarius st3 association that are relevant to the development of a pharyngeal probiotic product.
AB  == the use of proper bacterial strains as probiotics for the pharyngeal mucosa is a  potential prophylactic strategy for upper respiratory tract infections. in this context, we characterized in vitro the functional and immunomodulatory properties of the strains lactobacillus helveticus mimlh5 and streptococcus salivarius st3 that were selected during previous investigations as promising pharyngeal probiotics. in this study, we demonstrated in vitro that strains mimlh5 and st3,  alone and in combination, can efficiently adhere to pharyngeal epithelial cells,  antagonize streptococcus pyogenes, and modulate host innate immunity by inducing  potentially protective effects. in particular, we found that the strains mimlh5 and st3 activate u937 human macrophages by significantly inducing the expression  of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha). nonetheless, the induction of the anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (il-10) by mimlh5 or st3 was never lower than that of tnf-alpha, suggesting that these bacteria can potentially exert a regulatory rather than a proinflammatory effect. we also found that the strains mimlh5 and st3 induce cyclooxygenase 2 (cox-2) expression and demonstrated that toll-like receptor 2 (tlr-2) participates in the recognition of the strains mimlh5 and st3 by u937 cells. finally, we observed that these microorganisms grow efficiently when cocultured in milk, suggesting that the preparation of a milk-based fermented product containing both mimlh5 and st3 can be a practical solution for the administration of these bacteria. in conclusion, we propose the combined use of l. helveticus mimlh5 and s. salivarius st3 for the preparation of novel products that display probiotic properties for the pharyngeal mucosa.

TI  == a dairy bacterium displays in vitro probiotic properties for the pharyngeal mucosa by antagonizing group a streptococci and modulating the immune response.
AB  == the probiotic approach represents an alternative strategy in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, not only at the intestinal level but also at other sites of the body where the microbiota plays a role in the maintenance of physiological homeostasis. in this context, we evaluated in vitro the potential abilities of probiotic and dairy bacteria in controlling streptococcus pyogenes infections at the pharyngeal level. initially, we analyzed bacterial adhesion to  fadu hypopharyngeal carcinoma cells and the ability to antagonize s. pyogenes on  fadu cell layers and hacat keratinocytes. due to its promising adhesive and antagonistic features, we studied the dairy strain lactobacillus helveticus mimlh5, also through in vitro immunological experiments. first, we performed quantification of several cytokines and measurement of nf-kappab activation in fadu cells. mimlh5 efficiently reduced the induction of interleukin-6 (il-6), il-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), in a dose-dependent manner. after stimulation of cells with il-1beta, active nf-kappab was still markedly lowered. nevertheless, we observed an increased secretion of il-6, gamma interferon (ifn-gamma), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) under these conditions. these effects were associated with the ability of mimlh5 to enhance the expression of the heat shock protein coding gene hsp70.  in addition, mimlh5 increased the gm-csf/g-csf ratio. this is compatible with a switch of the immune response toward a th1 pathway, as supported by our observation that mimlh5, once in contact with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, triggered the secretion of tnf-alpha and il-2. in conclusion, we propose mimlh5 as a potential probiotic bacterium for the human pharynx, with promising antagonistic and immunomodulatory properties.

TI  == extracellular arginine aminopeptidase from streptococcus gordonii fss2.
AB  == streptococcus gordonii is a primary etiological agent in the development of subacute bacterial endocarditis (sbe), producing thrombus formation and tissue damage on the surfaces of heart valves. this is ironic, considering its normal role as a benign inhabitant of the oral microflora. however, strain fss2 of s. gordonii has been found to produce several extracellular aminopeptidase- and fibrinogen-degrading activities during growth in a ph-controlled batch culture. in this report, we describe the purification, characterization, and partial cloning of a predicted serine class arginine aminopeptidase (rap) with some cysteine class characteristics. isolation of this enzyme by anion-exchange, gel filtration, and isoelectric focusing chromatography yielded a protein monomer of  approximately 70 kda, as shown by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization, gel filtration, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. nested-pcr cloning enabled the isolation of a 324-bp-long dna fragment encoding the 108-amino-acid n terminus of rap. culture activity profiles and n-terminal sequence analysis indicated the export of this protein from the cell surface. homology was found with a putative dipeptidase from streptococcus pyogenes and nonspecific dipeptidases from lactobacillus helveticus and lactococcus lactis. we believe that rap may serve as a critical factor for arginine acquisition during nutrient stress in vivo and also in the proteolysis of host proteins and peptides during sbe pathology.

TI  == multi-domain, cell-envelope proteinases of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the multi-domain, cell-envelope proteinases encoded by the genes prtb of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, prth of lactobacillus helveticus, prtp of lactococcus lactis, scpa of streptococcus pyogenes and csp of streptococcus agalactiae have been compared using multiple sequence alignment, secondary structure prediction and database homology searching methods. this comparative analysis has led to the prediction of a number of different domains in these cell-envelope proteinases, and their homology, characteristics and putative function are described. these domains include, starting from the n-terminus, a pre-pro-domain for secretion and activation, a serine protease domain (with a smaller inserted domain), two large middle domains a and b of unknown but possibly regulatory function, a helical spacer domain, a hydrophilic  cell-wall spacer or attachment domain, and a cell-wall anchor domain. not all domains are present in each cell-envelope proteinase, suggesting that these multi-domain proteins are the result of gene shuffling and domain swapping during evolution.
