antimicrobial activities of eucalyptus leaf extracts and flavonoids from eucalyptus maculata.
aims: we investigated the antimicrobial activities of eucalyptus leaf extracts to find effective antibacterial agents. methods and results: the antimicrobial activities of leaf extracts from 26 species of eucalyptus were measured. extracts of eucalyptus globulus, e. maculata and e. viminalis significantly inhibited the growth of six gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, mrsa, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, propionibacterium acnes), and of a fungus (trichophyton mentagrophytes), but they did not show strong antibacterial activity against gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida). 2',6'-dihydroxy-3'-methyl-4'-methoxy-dihydrochalcone, eucalyptin and 8-desmethyl-eucalyptin, isolated from e. maculata extracts, exhibited potent antimicrobial activities against seven micro-organisms with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) ranging from 1.0 to 31 mg l(-1). conclusions: the eucalyptus extracts and three compounds from e. maculata were found to be effective against micro-organisms that cause food poisoning, acne and athlete's foot. significance and impact of the study: this study shows potential uses of extracts from e. globulus, e. maculata and e. viminalis, and antimicrobial compounds isolated from e. maculata.
