TI  == pediatric acute dacryocystitis.
AB  == purpose: to review and summarize the symptomatology, microbiology, special clinical entities, management, complications, and outcomes of pediatric acute dacryocystitis. methods: the author performed a pubmed search of all articles published in english on acute dacryocystitis. pediatric subpopulations of these articles were reviewed along with the scant literature of direct references to neonatal and pediatric acute dacryocystitis. data reviewed included demographics, presentations, microbiological work up, management, complications, and outcomes.  results: acute dacryocystitis is not very common in the pediatric age groups and  occurs mostly as a complication of congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction. the  age of onset is usually in the neonatal period with a female preponderance. the clinical spectrum ranges from classic pediatric acute dacryocystitis to meningitis. staphylococcus aureus is the commonest isolate. occasionally acquired etiologies and rare organisms like pantoea sp., epstein-barr virus, and sporothrix are implicated in the etiopathogenesis. the diagnosis is usually clinical aided by laboratory investigations. better antibiotics, well-established laboratory techniques and surgical modalities, and improved patient care logistics have contributed to good outcomes; however, complications are still being noted although infrequently. conclusions: pediatric acute dacryocystitis is a distinct entity with unique features of its own. it is a serious infection that warrants careful evaluation and immediate management. in the era of antibiotic resistance, microbiological work up of pediatric acute dacryocystitis is very useful for subsequent treatment. surgical challenges in the pediatric age group are distinct and the outcomes are good if standard protocols are followed.

TI  == synergistic activity of biocides and antibiotics on resistant bacteria from organically produced foods.
AB  == synergism between biocides and antibiotics was investigated in 20 biocide and antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains that were previously isolated from organically produced foods, according to their antimicrobial resistance profiles. most of the antibiotic/biocide combinations yielded synergistic interactions, reducing the inhibitory concentrations of biocides and antibiotics by 4- to 16-fold. among enterococci, synergism with biocides was detected for amoxicillin  (am), cefuroxime (cx), erythromycin (em), ciprofloxacin (cp), and trimethoprim/sulphametoxazol (t/s). among staphylococci, interactions were synergistic (am) and either synergistic or indifferent (cx and em, depending on biocide). among the three methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus clinical strains included in the study, the combinations of methicillin and triclosan or hexachlorophene acted synergistically in all strains, but interactions were either synergistic or indifferent for the other biocides, depending on the strain. all combinations tested were synergistic for lactobacillus (am, cx, em, and cp) and micrococcus (am, em). in salmonella, interactions were indifferent (am, cx, em, and cp) or synergistic (t/s). synergism with biocides was also detected in klebsiella isolates (am, cx, and t/s), enterobacter sp. (am, cx, em,  and t/s), pantoea (am, cx, em, cp, and t/s), and chryseobacterium sp. (em). these results suggest that combinations of biocides and antibiotics may open new possibilities to combat antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == nature of bacteria found on some wards in sultan qaboos university hospital, oman.
AB  == this study aims to determine what objects lying in the hospital environment or brought in from outside contribute to the introduction of bacteria associated with nosocomial infections. one hundred swab specimens collected from children's  toys, sinks, door handles, telephone handsets and flowers brought into the hospital were plated on different culture media. colonial growth on the media was purified and identified subsequently using standard bacteriological methods. of the 100 samples cultured, 61 (61%) grew a range of bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=14, 23.0%), acinetobacter spp. (n=13, 21.3%), serratia spp. (n=9, 14.7%), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=9, 14.7%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=4, 6.6%), staphylococcus aureus (n=4, 6.6%), enterobacter cloacae (n=3, 4.9%), pantoea sp. (n=2, 3.3%), chryseobacterium sp. (n=2, 3.3%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1, 1.6%). although all the serratia, enterobacter, klebsiella and pantoea species isolates showed varying degrees of resistance to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and cefotaxime, all were resistant to ampicillin. chryseobacterium and stenotrophomonas species isolates were resistant to amikacin, imipenem, gentamicin and ceftazidime, to which only three isolates of pseudomonas species were resistant. all the staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to methicillin. although there has been no major outbreak of a nosocomial infection in the hospital, it is strongly recommended that effective control measures (e.g., sampling the hospital water supply, disinfecting children's toys, use of appropriate hand washing and checking some of the disinfectants for presence of bacteria) are needed. these measures are necessary  to ensure that the antibiotic-resistant strains identified in this study are not  allowed to spread in the hospital.

TI  == 16s rdna-based identification of bacteria from conjunctival swabs by pcr and dgge fingerprinting.
AB  == purpose: establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. methods: from 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and dna was extracted. fragments of 200 bp, spanning the v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rdna, were amplified by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). for phylogenetic identification, dgge bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16s rdna clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened  by dgge. sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the embl database. furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from  conventional cultivation. results: 16s rdna could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. the following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: staphylococcus (n = 8),  corynebacterium (n = 7), propionibacterium (n = 7), streptococcus (n = 6), bacillus (n = 2), acinetobacter (n = 3), pseudomonas (n = 3), proteus (n = 1), and brevundimonas (n = 1). four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. they had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of pantoea and enterobacter (n = 1), kingella and neisseria (n = 1), serratia and aranicola (n = 1), and leuconostoc and weissella (n = 2), respectively. culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), corynebacteria (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), streptococcus sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). in total, 45% of  the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were pcr positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. no sample positive by culture gave negative results by pcr. conclusions: 16s rdna sequence analyses and dgge fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.
