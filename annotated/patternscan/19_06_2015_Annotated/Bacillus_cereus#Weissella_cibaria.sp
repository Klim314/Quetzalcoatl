TI  == study of lactic acid bacteria community from raw milk of iranian one humped camel and evaluation of their probiotic properties.
AB  == background: camel milk is amongst valuable food sources in iran. on the other hand, due to the presence of probiotic bacteria and bacteriocin producers in camel milk, probiotic bacteria can be isolated and identified from this food product. objectives: the objectives of the present research were the isolation and molecular identification of lactic acid bacteria from camel milk and evaluation of their probiotic properties. materials and methods: a total of ten samples of camel milk were collected from the golestan province of iran under aseptic conditions. bacteria were isolated by culturing the samples on selective  medium. isolates were identified by amplification of the 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer (its) region between the 16s and 23s rrna genes by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and were then screened and grouped by the amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra) method. to evaluate probiotic properties, representative isolates of different ardra profiles were analyzed. the antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) against pediococcus pentosaceus, escherichia coli and bacillus cereus was examined by the agar diffusion assay. acid and bile tolerance of isolates were evaluated. results: a total of 64 isolates were analyzed based on biochemical tests and morphological characteristics. the most frequently isolated lab was enterococci. weissella, leuconostoc, lactobacilli and pediococci were less frequently found. based on restriction analysis of the its, the isolates were grouped into nine different ardra patterns that were identified by ribosomal dna sequencing as p. pentosaceus, enterococcus faecium strain y-2, e. faecium strain jz1-1, e. faecium strain e6, e. durans, e. lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus casei and weissella cibaria. the results showed that antimicrobial activity of the tested isolates was remarkable and p. pentosaceus showed the most antibacterial activity. in addition, e. durans, e. lactis, l. casei and p. pentosaceus were selected as probiotic bacteria. conclusions: this study revealed the presence of  bacteriocin-producing bacteria and probiotic bacteria in camel milk from the golestan province of iran.

TI  == glucan and fructan production by sourdough weissella cibaria and lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == after a large screening on sourdough lactic acid bacteria, exopolysaccharide (eps)-forming strains of weissella cibaria, lactobacillus plantarum, and pediococcus pentosaceus were selected. after 6 days of incubation at 30 degrees c, the synthesis of eps in mrs-based broth ranged from 5.54 to 7.88 mg ml-1. eps  had an apparent molecular mass of ca. 104 da. as shown by carbohydrate consumption, the synthesis of eps was found from sucrose only. two types of homopolysaccharides were synthesized: glucans simultaneously with growth and fructans after 1 day of incubation. two protein bands of ca. 180-200 kda were in  situ detected on sds-page gels incubated with sucrose. pcr products of ca. 220 bp were found for l. plantarum pl9 (100% of identity to putative priming glycosyltransferase of l. plantarum wcfs1) and w. cibaria wc4 (80% of identity to putative glycosyltransferase, epsd, of bacillus cereus g9241) by using hybrid primers for the priming gtf genes. degenerated primers dexreur and dexreuv showed a unique pcr product, and the predicted amino acid sequences were identical for w. cibaria wc4 and l. plantarum pl9. the sequence had similarity with polysaccharide biosynthesis glycosyltransferases. w. cibaria wc4 or l. plantarum  lp9 synthesized ca. 2.5 g kg-1 eps during sourdough fermentation with sucrose added. compared to the sourdough started with an eps-negative strain, the sourdough started with w. cibaria wc4 or l. plantarum lp9 increased the viscosity, and the resulting bread had higher specific volume and lower firmness. the synthesis of eps by selected sourdough lactic acid bacteria could be considered as a useful tool to replace the additives for improving the textural properties of baked goods.
