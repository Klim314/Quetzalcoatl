TI  - [Urinary tract infections in children--etiologic agents and susceptibility to antibiotics].
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common clinical problem in pediatric hospitals. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of UTIs during two different time periods (from February 1999 to March 2000, and from April 2000 to September 2001) in pediatric patients treated in ambulatory or hospitalized in new children hospital. The frequency of occurrence of ESBL--producing Gram-negative rods increased during second period study. The isolated ESBL--producing strains were resistant also to aminoglicosides and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazol Gram-negative rods were predominant microorganisms. Isolated organisms from urine samples included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus penneri, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundi, Serratia spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, Enterococcus spp. Streptococcus spp, and Candida spp. Enterococcus spp. were isolated from urine samples in 20% of cases. Only 9.4% of isolated Enterococcus spp. were high-level aminoglicoside resistant (HLAR) strains. No vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. were isolated. Among coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS) methicillin resistant strains (MRCNS) were isolated in 43.3%.
TI  - A survey of the aerobic bacteria in the feces of captive raptors.
AB  - Feces of 47 captive raptors belonging to the order Falconiformes or Strigiformes  were cultured for bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria, which were cultured from the feces of 45 of the 47 raptors, were the most common isolates. A wide variety of species were identified, including a newly described genus (Moellerella wisconsensis), two newly described species (Escherichia fergusonii and Proteus penneri), and a member of a newly described enteric group (CDC Enteric group 41). Additional organisms identified that have not been reported in previous bacteriological surveys of raptors were Salmonella heidelberg, Salmonella braenderup, Morganella morganii, Yersinia ruckeri, Serratia spp., and Kluyvera sp. Escherichia coli, isolated from the feces of 42 of the 47 raptors, was the most frequently recovered. Streptococcus faecalis, the second most common isolate, was cultured from 30 birds. Several differences were observed between fecal bacteria isolated from raptors fed commercially prepared chicken and those isolated from raptors not fed chicken. The most obvious difference was that birds fed chicken had more varied gram-negative bacterial species and in greater numbers per fecal sample. The potential for the isolated bacteria from raptors as pathogens in humans and avian species is discussed.
