TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - special references to bacteria isolated between april 2011 and march 2012].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2011 to march 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus  spp., in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by parvimonas micra, collinsella aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus and finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, e. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by p micra and l. acidophilus, in this order. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides caccae, b. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus and b. wadsworthia, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus  spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.

TI  == dynamic microbe and molecule networks in a mouse model of colitis-associated colorectal cancer.
AB  == bacterial colonisation of the gut is involved in the development of colitis-associated colorectal cancer. however, it remains unclear how the gut microbiota dynamically shifts correlating with colorectal carcinogenesis. here, we reveal the longitudinal shifts in the microbial community that occur with colitis-associated colorectal cancer. high-throughput sequencing results for the  bacterial 16s rrna gene (v3 region) were compared for azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulphate-treated mice and control mice. we found that microbial community structure was significantly altered by chronic colitis. microbes in the species streptococcus luteciae, lactobacillus hamster, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides ovatus were increased during colorectal carcinogenesis. histological  measurements for a molecular network including six interconnected key factors from inflammation to cancer, namely p65, p53, cox-2, ppargamma, ccr2 and beta-catenin, indicated that the microbiome modifications were correlated with molecular pathogenesis of colitis-associated colorectal cancer. phylotype modifications after each aom/dss cycle were identified. a longitudinal microbial  network was then constructed for the gut microbiome and showed that the phylotype shifts during this process were complex and highly dynamic. this work may provide a deeper understanding of the role of the microbiota and microbe-host interactions in colitis-associated colorectal cancer.

TI  == structural segregation of gut microbiota between colorectal cancer patients and healthy volunteers.
AB  == despite a long-suspected role in the development of human colorectal cancer (crc), the composition of gut microbiota in crc patients has not been adequately  described. in this study, fecal bacterial diversity in crc patients (n=46) and healthy volunteers (n=56) were profiled by 454 pyrosequencing of the v3 region of the 16s ribosomal rna gene. both principal component analysis and unifrac analysis showed structural segregation between the two populations. forty-eight operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified by redundancy analysis as key  variables significantly associated with the structural difference. one otu closely related to bacteroides fragilis was enriched in the gut microbiota of crc patients, whereas three otus related to bacteroides vulgatus and bacteroides uniformis were enriched in that of healthy volunteers. a total of 11 otus belonging to the genera enterococcus, escherichia/shigella, klebsiella, streptococcus and peptostreptococcus were significantly more abundant in the gut  microbiota of crc patients, and 5 otus belonging to the genus roseburia and other butyrate-producing bacteria of the family lachnospiraceae were less abundant. real-time quantitative pcr further validated the significant reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut microbiota of crc patients by measuring the copy numbers of butyryl-coenzyme a coa transferase genes (mann-whitney test,  p<0.01). reduction of butyrate producers and increase of opportunistic pathogens  may constitute a major structural imbalance of gut microbiota in crc patients.

TI  == isolation and identification of mixed linked beta -glucan degrading bacteria in the intestine of broiler chickens and partial characterization of respective 1,3-1,4-beta -glucanase activities.
AB  == media with 1,3-1,4-beta -glucans as selective markers were used for isolation of  non-starch-polysaccharide (nsp) degrading bacteria from the intestinal tract of broiler chicken. formerly unknown 1,3-1,4-beta endoglucanase activities in various bacterial species were identified in this study. e. faecium , streptococcus , bacteroides and clostridium strains seem to be responsible for degradation of mixed linked beta -glucans in the small intestine and in the hind  gut of chickens. strict anaerobic bacteria (bacteroides ovatus , b. uniformis , presumably b. capillosus and clostridium perfringens ) as well as an unidentified bacterium with 98% 16s rdna homology to an uncultered chicken cecum bacterium were isolated. additionally, streptococcus bovis with 1,3-1,4-beta -endoglucanase activity was also detected. different 1,3-1,4-beta -endoglucanase activity profiles were observed in sds/page zymograms.

TI  == a case of subacute necrotizing fasciitis.
AB  == we report a 48-year-old woman who developed necrotizing groin fasciitis with insidious onset. before she visited us, she had been unsuccessfully treated with  several kinds of antibiotics by other doctors for one month, because of a small ulcer covered by blackish necrotic tissue. she was referred to us because of high fever, an ulcer on the left labium majus, and a cellulitis-like lesion with severe pain on the lower abdomen. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), streptococcus intermedius, and bacteroides uniformis were isolated from the wound. after aggressive debridement on the eighth day after admission of the  whole indurated area and the fascia of the underlying muscle, healthy granulation tissue covered the defect, and the wound was finally closed with a skin graft long-term administration of antibiotics along with insufficient and delayed surgical treatment were considered to have caused the full development of this disease.

TI  == role of bacteroides uniformis in susceptibility of ta:cf# 1 mice to infection by  treponema hyodysenteriae.
AB  == among the various strains and colonies of mice tested specific-pathogen-free (spf) ta:cf#1 mice exhibited the highest susceptibility to treponema hyodysenteriae infection. staphylococcus epidermidis 1047, streptococcus faecalis 2039, lactobacillus murinus 3010, escherichia coli 1049, and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 3008 were administered to the ta:cf#1 mice. b. uniformis ik, which appeared to colonize in the breeding facility under spf conditions, was isolated from the cecal content of a ta:cf#1 mouse and identified in the mouse flora. germfree mice were infected with these six bacteria and challenged with t. hyodysenteriae dj70p3 to elucidate the causal relationship between these bacteria and the sensitivity of mice to t. hyodysenteriae infection. no cecal lesions were observed in gnotobiotic mice either monoassociated with t. hyodysenteriae dj70p3  or b. uniformis ik or inoculated with t. hyodysenteriae dj70p3 combined with the  5 a.m. strains. gross cecal lesions appeared only in mice inoculated with t. hyodysenteriae dj70p3 combined with b. uniformis ik. a new spf mouse colony (cf#1/b ta) established from gnotobiotic mice by inoculation with b. uniformis ik and the 5 laboratory stock cultures was as susceptible to t. hyodysenteriae as the original ta:cf#1 mice. this suggests that b. uniformis ik plays an important  role in the high susceptibility of ta:cf#1 mice to t.hyodysenteriae.

TI  == identification of bacteroides fragilis by indirect immunofluorescence.
AB  == rabbit antiserum against live or heat-killed bacteroides fragilis nctc 9343 bacteria was titrated against hot phenol water-extracted polysaccharide antigens  from five different species of the 'b. fragilis group' of bacteria using an enzyme immunoassay and shown to be specific for the b. fragilis nctc 9343 polysaccharide. when the antiserum was used in indirect immunofluorescence, 97.1% of 244 b. fragilis strains were correctly identified. only 8 of the other 312 bacteroides strains were stained by the anti-b fragilis serum. the 'cross-reactive' bacteriodes strains all belonged to the "b. fragilis group" of bacteria (i.e., b; distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, and  b. vulgatus). none of the 425 aerobic enteric bacteria representing salmonella, e. coli, proteus, yersinia, shigella, klebsiella, enterobacter, citrobacter, and  pseudomonas were positive using the anti-b. fragilis serum. likewise, all the 59  gram-positive strains representing streptococcus, bacillus, peptostreptococcus, peptococcus, propionibacterium, lactobacillus, eubacterium, and clostridium did not stain. our data shows in accordance with other findings [11], that b. fragilis strains possess a species-specific cell envelope antigen(s) which promises to be important for production of antisera, making a rapid identification of the species possible.
