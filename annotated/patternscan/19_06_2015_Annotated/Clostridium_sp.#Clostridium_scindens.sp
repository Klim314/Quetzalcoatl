TI  == phylogeny of human intestinal bacteria that activate the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota is essential for the conversion of the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (sdg) via secoisolariciresinol (seco) to  the enterolignans enterodiol (ed) and enterolactone (el). however, knowledge of the species that catalyse the underlying reactions is scant. therefore, we focused our attention on the identification of intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of sdg. strains of bacteroides distasonis, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides ovatus and clostridium cocleatum, as well as the newly isolated strain clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db, deglycosylated sdg. demethylation of seco was catalysed by strains of butyribacterium methylotrophicum, eubacterium callanderi, eubacterium limosum and peptostreptococcus productus. dehydroxylation of seco was catalysed by strains of clostridium scindens and eggerthella lenta. finally, the newly isolated strain ed-mt61/pyg-s6 catalysed the dehydrogenation of ed to el. the results indicate that the activation of sdg involves phylogenetically diverse bacteria, most of which are members of the dominant human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == assignment of eubacterium sp. vpi 12708 and related strains with high bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylating activity to clostridium scindens and proposal of clostridium hylemonae sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  == unknown eubacterium-like organisms vpi 12708 and five strains (y-1113, i-10, m-18, th-82 and 36s) had high bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylating activity; the unknown clostridium-like organisms tn-271t and tn-272 also had the same activity. analysis of their 16s rdna sequences demonstrated that all strains belong to cluster xiva of the genus clostridium (collins et al., 1994). strain vpi 12708 and five other strains (y-1113, i-10, m-18, th-82 and 36s) formed a single cluster and strains tn-271t and tn-272 formed another single cluster. clostridium scindens jcm 6567t was the most closely related species for two clusters in the phylogenetic tree. values for dna-dna similarities among c. scindens jcm 6567t, strain vpi 12708 and the other five strains were greater than 70%, showing that these micro-organisms were a single species. therefore, we identified strain vpi  12708 and the five other strains as c. scindens. in addition, dna-dna similarities among c. scindens jcm 6567t, strain tn-271t and strain n-272 revealed that strains tn-271t and tn-272 were distinct from c. scindens jcm 6567t. on the basis of phylogenetic analysis and dna-dna similarity data, it was  concluded that strains tn-271t and tn-272 are members of a new species of the genus clostridium, for which the name clostridium hylemonae is proposed. the type strain is strain tn-271t (= jcm 10539t).

TI  == identification and characterization of a bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylation operon  in clostridium sp. strain to-931, a highly active 7alpha-dehydroxylating strain isolated from human feces.
AB  == clostridium sp. strain to-931 can rapidly convert the primary bile acid cholic acid to a potentially toxic compound, deoxycholic acid. mixed oligonucleotide probes were used to isolate a gene fragment encoding a putative bile acid transporter from clostridium sp. strain to-931. this dna fragment had 60% nucleotide sequence identity to a known bile acid transporter gene from eubacterium sp. strain vpi 12708, another bile acid-7alpha-dehydroxylating intestinal bacterium. the dna (9.15 kb) surrounding the transporter gene was cloned from clostridium sp. strain to-931 and sequenced. within this larger dna fragment was a 7.9-kb region, containing six successive open reading frames (orfs), that was encoded by a single 8.1-kb transcript, as determined by northern blot analysis. the gene arrangement and dna sequence of the clostridium sp. strain to-931 operon are similar to those of a eubacterium sp. strain vpi 12708 bile acid-inducible operon containing nine orfs. several genes in the eubacterium sp. strain vpi 12708 operon have been shown to encode products required for bile  acid 7alpha-dehydroxylation. in clostridium sp. strain to-931, genes potentially  encoding bile acid-coenzyme a (coa) ligase, 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase,  bile acid 7alpha-dehydratase, bile acid-coa hydrolase, and a bile acid transporter were similar in size and exhibited amino acid homology to similar gene products from eubacterium sp. strain vpi 12708 (encoded by baib, baia, baie, baif, and baig, respectively). however, no genes similar to eubacterium sp. strain vpi 12708 biah or baii were found in the clostridium sp. strain to-931 bai operon, and the two putative eubacterium sp. strain vpi 12708 genes, baic and baid, were arranged in one continuous orf in clostridium sp. strain to-931. intergene regions showed no significant dna sequence similarity, but primer extension analysis identified a region 115 bp upstream from the first orf that exhibited 58% identity to a bai operator/promoter region identified in eubacterium sp. strain vpi 12708. these results indicate that the gene organization, gene product amino acid sequences, and promoters of the bile acid-inducible operons of clostridium sp. strain to-931 and eubacterium sp. strain vpi 12708 are highly conserved.

TI  == sequencing and expression of a gene encoding a bile acid transporter from eubacterium sp. strain vpi 12708.
AB  == eubacterium sp. strain vpi 12708 expresses inducible bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylation activity via a multistep pathway. the genes encoding several of the inducible proteins involved in the pathway have been previously mapped to a bile acid-inducible (bai) operon in eubacterium sp. strain vpi 12708. we now report the cloning, sequencing, and characterization of the baig gene, which is part of the bai operon. the predicted amino acid sequence of the baig polypeptide shows significant homology to several membrane transport proteins, including sugar and antibiotic resistance transporters, which are members of the  major facilitator superfamily. hydrophilicity plots of baig show a high degree of similarity to class k and l teta proteins from gram-positive bacteria, and, like  these classes of teta proteins, baig has 14 proposed transmembrane domains. the baig gene was cloned into escherichia coli and shown to confer an energy-dependent bile acid uptake activity. primary bile acids were preferentially transported into e. coli cells expressing this gene, with at least sevenfold and fourfold increases in the uptake of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, respectively, over control reactions. less transport activity was observed with cholylglycine, 7-oxocholic acid, and deoxycholic acid. the transport activity was inhibited by the proton ionophores carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and nigericin but not by the potassium ionophore valinomycin, suggesting that the transport is driven by the proton motive force across the cell membrane. in summary, we have cloned, sequenced, and expressed a bile acid-inducible bile acid transporter from eubacterium sp. strain vpi 12708. to our knowledge, this is the first report of the cloning and expression of a gene encoding a procaryotic bile acid transporter.

TI  == expression and characterization of a c24 bile acid 7 alpha-dehydratase from eubacterium sp. strain vpi 12708 in escherichia coli.
AB  == the intestinal bacterium eubacterium sp. strain vpi 12708 has been shown to have  a bile acid 7 alpha/7 beta-dehydroxylation pathway. a large bile acid inducible (bai) operon encoding at least 9 open reading frames has been cloned and sequenced from this bacterium. the baie gene from this operon has been subcloned  and expressed in e. coli and found to encode a bile acid 7 alpha-dehydratase (ba7 alpha d). the purified ba7 alpha d was shown to have a calculated subunit mass of 19 kd and a relative native molecular weight of 36,000. the km and vmax for 7 alpha, 12 alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholenoic acid was 0.16 mm and 0.48 nmol/min per mg protein, respectively. of the substrates tested, the ba7 alpha d used only 7 alpha, 12 alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholenoic acid and 7 alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholenoic acid as substrates. a molecular modeling program  (sybyl) was used to calculate the energy differences between the various intermediates in the 7 alpha-dehydroxylation pathway. a marked energy difference  (-9.4 kcal/mol) was observed between 7 alpha, 12 alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholenoic acid and 12 alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4,6-choldienoic acid, possibly accounting for the apparent irreversibility of the bile acid 7 alpha-dehydratase reaction under our experimental conditions. no significant amino acid sequence homologies were found between ba7 alpha d and other proteins  in the data base; however, ba7 alpha d does contain a lipocalin signature sequence, possibly indicating a bile acid binding domain. the bile acid 7 alpha-dehydratase appears to be a unique enzyme in the bacterial bile acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylation pathway.
