TI  == a novel multi-strain probiotic and synbiotic supplement for prevention of clostridium difficile infection in a murine model.
AB  == the protective effect of a multi-strain probiotic and synbiotic formulation was evaluated in c57bl/6 mice infected with clostridium difficile (cd) nap1/027. antibiotic-treated mice were divided into the following four groups: group 1, fed with a synbiotic formulation consisting of lactobacillus plantarum f44, l. paracasei f8, bifidobacterium breve 46, b. lactis 8:8, galacto-oligosaccharides,  isomalto-oligosaccharides, and resistant starch; group 2, fed with the same four  probiotic strains as group 1; group 3, fed with the same prebiotic supplements as group 1 for 7 days before cd infection; and group 4 (control group) antibiotic treated and infected with nap1/027 strain. feces and cecal contents were collected for microbial cell viability, quantitative pcr (qpcr), toxin analyses and histopathology. synbiotics- and probiotics-fed mice showed a significant increase in total bifidobacteria (p < 0.05). the total lactobacilli count was increased in group 1. tests for cecal toxins were negative in group 2 mice, whereas one sample each from group 1 and 3 was positive. qpcr of cecal contents showed significant reduction in nap1/027 dna copies in groups 1 and 2 and significantly higher numbers of b. breve 46, l. plantarum f44, and l. paracasei f8 in groups 1 and 2 (p < 0.05); these changes were much less pronounced in groups 3 and 4. our findings indicate that the newly developed synbiotic or multi-strain probiotic formulation confers protection against nap1/027 infection  in c57bl/6 mice. this holds promise for performing human studies.

TI  == role of lactobacillus in the prevention of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
AB  == background: clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (cdad) is a major public health problem because of significant morbidity and mortality, and many clinicians pay attention to lactobacillus as a potentially effective treatment. the purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of lactobacillus in the prevention of cdad. methods: the databases medline, the cochrane central register of controlled trials, metaregister of controlled trials, national institutes of health, cnki, vip, and wanfang data were searched to locate all reported randomized controlled trials (rct) from 1990 to december 2012. only rct  in english and chinese using lactobacillus for the prevention of documented cdad  were considered for study inclusion. the data was analyzed by review manager and  spss software. results: seven placebo-controlled rcts that evaluated the prevention of cdad, which included 1486 subjects, accorded with inclusion and exclusion criteria. the mean age of the subjects ranged from 4.15 to 64.75 years  and the proportion of male subjects ranged from 42.0% to 59.1%. the total daily dose of lactobacillus ranged from 1.2x10(9)-1.2x10(12) colonyforming units (cfu). a low risk of bias was attributed to two studies and four studies evaluated a medium-level risk of bias. the combined risk ratio (rr) of developing cdad was significantly lower in subjects who received lactobacillus compared with subjects who received placebo (rr 0.38, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.22-0.67). a combination regimen of lactobacillus acidophilus (l. acidophilus) and lactobacillus casei (l. casei) (rr 0.05, 95% ci 0.01-0.36) showed significant effect sizes for the prevention of cdad, while single regimens of lactobacillus plantarum (l. plantarum) and lactobacillus rhamnosus (l. rhamnosus) did not. across all trials, positive significant effects of lactobacillus were observed in the elderly subgroup (rr 0.05, 95% ci 0.01-0.36). whether the 1x10(12)-9x10(12) cfu/d lactobacillus could prevent cdad significantly or not was unclear. conclusion: there is a sufficient evidence to recommend lactobacillus (l. acidophilus and l. casei) as a prevention therapy for cdad.

TI  == protective effect of a mixture of kefir-isolated lactic acid bacteria and yeasts  in a hamster model of clostridium difficile infection.
AB  == the objective of this work was to test the protective effect of a mixture (mm) constituted by kefir-isolated microorganisms (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus kefir, lc. lactis, kluyveromyces marxianus and saccharomyces cerevisiae) in a hamster model of infection with clostridium difficile, an anaerobic gram-positive bacterium that causes diarrhoea. placebo or mm was administered ad libitum in drinking water from day 0 to the end of treatment. hamsters received orally 200 mug of clyndamicin at day 7 and then were infected with 1 x 10(8) cfu of c. difficile by gavage. development of diarrhoea and death  was registered until the end of the protocol. surviving animals were sacrificed at day 16, and a test for biological activity of clostridial toxins and histological stainings were performed in caecum samples. six of seven infected animals developed diarrhoea and 5/7 died at the end of the experimental protocol. the histological sections showed oedema and inflammatory infiltrates with neutrophils and crypt abscesses. in the group of animals infected and treated with mm1/1000, only 1 of 7 hamsters showed diarrhoea and none of them died. the histological sections showed only a slight thickening of the mucosa with presence of lymphocytic infiltrate. these results demonstrate that an oral treatment with  a mixture of kefir-isolated bacteria and yeasts was able to prevent diarrhoea and enterocolitis triggered by c. difficile.

TI  == in vitro inhibition of clostridium difficile and clostridium perfringens by commercial probiotic strains.
AB  == probiotics have gained importance in human and veterinary medicine to prevent and control clostridial enteric disease. limited information is available on the ability of different probiotic bacteria used in food products to inhibit clostridium difficile and clostridium perfringens. the objective of this study was to examine the in vitro inhibitory effects of selected commercial bacterial strains on pathogenic clostridia and their growth characteristics under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. the inhibitory effects of 17 commercial strains of lactobacillus (n = 16) and bifidobacterium (n = 1) on the reference strains of c. difficile and c. perfringens were assessed by an agar well diffusion assay and by a broth culture inhibition assay using cell-free supernatant harvested at different growth phases, with and without ph neutralization. to study growth characteristics, probiotic strains were cultivated in different acid and bile environments, and growth in the modified media was compared to growth in standard medium. in the agar well diffusion assay, supernatant obtained from two probiotic strains inhibited the growth of both reference and clinical strains of c. perfringens. this effect as seen when supernatant was assessed with and without ph neutralization. supernatants obtained from 10 probiotic strains inhibited c. difficile only when supernatant was added without ph neutralization. in the broth culture inhibition assay, growth of c. perfringens and c. difficile was inhibited by supernatant without ph neutralization from 5 and 10 probiotic strains, respectively. all potential probiotic strains were able to grow at ph 4.0 and in  the presence of 0.15% and 0.3% bile but none were able to grow or survive at ph 2.0. altogether five probiotic strains [lactobacillus plantarum (n = 2), lactobacillus rhamnosus (n = 2), bifidobacterium animalis lactis (n = 1)] were shown to inhibit all strains of c. difficile and c. perfringens. the inhibitory effect was probiotic strain-specific. two strains showed a ph-independent inhibitory effect likely due to production of either antibiotics or bacteriocins  inhibiting c. perfringens only. these strains have favourable growth characteristics for use as probiotics and their efficacy as prophylactic or therapeutic measures against clostridial enteric disease should be further evaluated by clinical trials in animals.

TI  == kefir-isolated lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis inhibits the cytotoxic effect of  clostridium difficile in vitro.
AB  == kefir is a dairy product obtained by fermentation of milk with a complex microbial population and several health-promoting properties have been attributed to its consumption. in this work, we tested the ability of different kefir-isolated bacterial and yeast strains (lactobacillus kefir, lb. plantarum, lactococcus lactis subps. lactis, saccharomyces cerevisiae and kluyveromyces marxianus) or a mixture of them (mm) to antagonise the cytopathic effect of toxins from clostridium difficile (tcda and tcdb). cell detachment assays and f-actin network staining using vero cell line were performed. although incubation with microbial cells did not reduce the damage induced by c. difficile spent culture supernatant (scs), lc. lactis cidca 8221 and mm supernatants were able to inhibit the cytotoxicity of scs to vero cells. fraction of lc. lactis cidca 8221  supernatant containing components higher than 10 kda were responsible for the inhibitory activity and heating of this fraction for 15 min at 100 degrees c completely abrogated this ability. by dot-blot assay with anti-tcda or anti-tcdb  antibodies, concentration of both toxins seems to be reduced in scs treated with  lc. lactis cidca 8221 supernatant. however, protective effect was not affected by treatment with proteases or proteases-inhibitors tested. in conclusion, we demonstrated that kefir-isolated lc. lactis cidca 8221 secreted heat-sensitive products able to protect eukaryotic cells from cytopathic effect of c. difficile  toxins in vitro. our findings provide new insights into the probiotic action of microorganisms isolated from kefir against virulence factors from intestinal pathogens.

TI  == a meta-analysis of probiotic efficacy for gastrointestinal diseases.
AB  == background: meta-analyses on the effects of probiotics on specific gastrointestinal diseases have generally shown positive effects on disease prevention and treatment; however, the relative efficacy of probiotic use for treatment and prevention across different gastrointestinal diseases, with differing etiology and mechanisms of action, has not been addressed. methods/principal findings: we included randomized controlled trials in humans that used a specified probiotic in the treatment or prevention of pouchitis, infectious diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, helicobacter pylori, clostridium difficile disease, antibiotic associated diarrhea, traveler's diarrhea, or necrotizing enterocolitis. random effects models were used to evaluate efficacy as pooled relative risks across the eight diseases as well as across probiotic species, single vs. multiple species, patient ages, dosages, and length of treatment. probiotics had a positive significant effect across all eight gastrointestinal diseases with a relative risk of 0.58 (95% (ci) 0.51-0.65). six  of the eight diseases: pouchitis, infectious diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome,  helicobacter pylori, clostridium difficile disease, and antibiotic associated diarrhea, showed positive significant effects. traveler's diarrhea and necrotizing enterocolitis did not show significant effects of probiotcs. of the 11 species and species mixtures, all showed positive significant effects except for lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, and bifidobacterium infantis. across all diseases and probiotic species, positive significant effects of probiotics were observed for all age groups, single vs. multiple species, and  treatment lengths. conclusions/significance: probiotics are generally beneficial  in treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal diseases. efficacy was not observed for traveler's diarrhea or necrotizing enterocolitis or for the probiotic species l. acidophilus, l. plantarum, and b. infantis. when choosing to use probiotics in the treatment or prevention of gastrointestinal disease, the type of disease and probiotic species (strain) are the most important factors to  take into consideration.

TI  == effects of probiotics and antibiotics on the intestinal homeostasis in a computer controlled model of the large intestine.
AB  == background: antibiotic associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile infection are frequent complications of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. probiotic bacteria are used as therapeutic and preventive agents in these disorders, but the exact functional mechanisms and the mode of action are poorly understood. the effects of clindamycin and the probiotic mixture vsl#3 (containing the 8 bacterial strains streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) consecutively or in combination were investigated and compared to controls without therapy using a standardized human fecal microbiota in a computer-controlled in vitro model of large intestine. microbial metabolites (short chain fatty acids, lactate, branched chain fatty acids, and ammonia) and the intestinal microbiota were analyzed. results: compared to controls and combination therapy, short chain fatty acids and lactate, but also ammonia and branched chain fatty acids, were increased under probiotic therapy. the metabolic pattern under combined therapy with antibiotics and probiotics had the most beneficial and consistent effect on intestinal metabolic profiles. the intestinal microbiota showed a decrease in several indigenous bacterial groups under antibiotic therapy, there was no significant recovery of these groups when the antibiotic therapy was followed by administration of probiotics. simultaneous application of anti- and probiotics had a stabilizing effect on the intestinal microbiota with increased bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. conclusions: administration of vsl#3 parallel with the clindamycin therapy had a beneficial and stabilizing effect on the intestinal metabolic homeostasis by decreasing toxic metabolites and protecting the endogenic microbiota from destruction. probiotics could be a reasonable strategy in prevention of antibiotic associated  disturbances of the intestinal homeostasis and disorders.

TI  == intestinal lactoflora in estonian and norwegian patients with antibiotic associated diarrhea.
AB  == the disruption of intestinal microbiota is an important risk factor for the development of clostridium difficile caused antibiotic associated diarrhea (aad). the role of intestinal lactoflora in protection against c. difficile is unclear.  fecal samples (n = 74) from aad patients were investigated for c. difficile and lactobacilli by culture and real-time pcr. lactobacilli were identified by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus pcr (eric-pcr) and sequencing of  16s rrna. in c. difficile negative cases we found somewhat higher counts of intestinal lactobacilli (5.02 vs. 2.15 cfu log(10)/g; p = 0.053) by culture and more frequently lactobacillus plantarum (33.3% vs. 9.4%; p = 0.03) as compared with positive ones. results of total counts of lactobacilli comparing estonian and norwegian samples were conflicting by culture and pcr. we found higher colonization of norwegian aad patients with l. plantarum (21% vs. 5%, p = 0.053)  and estonians with lactobacillus gasseri (19% vs. 2%, p = 0.023). particular lactobacilli (e.g. l. plantarum) may have a role in protection against c. difficile, whereas the meaning of total counts of lactobacilli remains questionable. in different persons and nations, different lactobacilli species may have a protective role against c. difficile.

TI  == treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with probiotics. an etiopathogenic approach at last?
AB  == irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is the most common functional digestive disorder,  and may affect 11-20% of the adult population in industrialized countries. in accordance with rome iii criteria (2006) ibs involves abdominal pain and bowel habit disturbance, which are not explained by structural or biochemical abnormalities. several hypotheses attempt to account for the pathophysiology of ibs, but the etiology still remains uncertain or obscure, perhaps multifactorial. abnormalities in colonic microflora have recently been suggested in such patients, as has abnormal small-intestine bacterial overgrowth (sibo), or in particular a significant reduction in the amount of intraluminal bifidobacteria or lactobacilli, with consequences like the production of colonic gas, and motility or sensitivity disturbances of the intestinal tract. the disorder is difficult to treat, and the wide spectrum of non-drug and drug treatments shows our ignorance about the cause of the condition. newer drugs, both pro- and anti-serotonin, have failed to show long-term efficacy or have been withdrawn due to concerns about harmful effects. recent research has provided increasing support for the idea that disturbances of intestinal microbiota occur in patients with ibs, and that such abnormalities may contribute to ibs symptoms. studies in  scandinavian countries in the last ten years emphasize the role of probiotics in  the modulation of intestinal microbiota, and as a consequence in the regulation of the motility and hypersensitivity of the digestive tract. although results between studies are difficult to compare because of differences in study design,  probiotic dose, strain, and duration of therapy, some studies show symptom improvement. lactobacilli are found among the normal bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract, and lactobacillus plantarum (lp) is one of the species frequently isolated from the human mucosa, which is capable of surviving the low  ph of the stomach and duodenum, resisting the effect of bile acids in the upper small intestine when ingested, and temporarily colonizing the gastrointestinal tract by binding to the intestinal and colonic mucosa. concurrent with colonization by lp there is a decrease in bacterial groups with gas-producing ability, such as veillonella spp. and clostridia spp. evidence has now accumulated to suggest the efficacy of certain probiotics like lp299v, which may  be capable of bringing about a significant reduction in pain, abdominal distension and flatulence, while increasing health-related quality of life in ibs.

TI  == intake of lactobacillus plantarum reduces certain gastrointestinal symptoms during treatment with antibiotics.
AB  == goals: to examine if intake of lactobacillus plantarum can prevent gastrointestinal side effects in antibiotic-treated patients. background: diarrhea is a common side effect of treatment with antibiotics. some studies indicate that the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea can be reduced by administration of certain probiotic microorganisms. study: patients treated for infections at a university hospital infectious diseases clinic were randomized to daily intake of either a fruit drink with l. plantarum 299v (10(10) colony forming units/d) or a placebo drink, until a week after termination of antibiotic treatment. subjects recorded the number and consistency of stools as well as gastrointestinal symptoms until up to 3 weeks after last intake of test drink. fecal samples were collected before the first intake of test drink and after termination of antibiotic therapy and analyzed for clostridium difficile toxin. results: clinical characteristics on admission were similar in the 2 groups. the  overall risk of developing loose or watery stools was significantly lower among those receiving l. plantarum [odds ratio (or), 0.69; 95% confidence interval (ci), 0.52-0.92; p=0.012], as was development of nausea (or, 0.51; 95% ci, 0.30-0.85; p=0.0097). diarrhea defined as > or =3 loose stools/24 h for > or =2 consecutive days was unaffected by the treatment (or, 1.4; 95% ci, 0.33-6.0; p=0.86). no significant differences regarding carriage of toxin producing c. difficile were observed between the groups. conclusions: our results indicate that intake of l. plantarum could have a preventive effect on milder gastrointestinal symptoms during treatment with antibiotics.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of rep3123 against clostridium difficile and other  anaerobic intestinal bacteria.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine the anaerobic spectrum of activity of rep3123, a novel diaryldiamine that inhibits bacterial methionyl-trna synthetases in gram-positive bacteria. methods: fifty recent clinical isolates of clostridium difficile from patients diagnosed with c. difficile infection and 223 other intestinal normal flora anaerobes were tested for their susceptibility to rep3123 and four or five comparator agents by the agar dilution method using supplemented brucella agar with 5% laked sheep blood. results: all strains of c.  difficile were inhibited by 0.5-1 mg/l rep3123, including those resistant to moxifloxacin and clindamycin. rep3123 lacked activity against many normal flora anaerobes in the gut, including clostridium ramosum, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli of the lactobacillus casei-rhamnosus-plantarum group and gram-negative anaerobes. conclusions: rep3123 demonstrated good potency against c. difficile, but limited  activity against many other intestinal anaerobic species, thus, in theory, maintaining the colonization resistance barrier.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum 299v reduces colonisation of clostridium difficile in critically ill patients treated with antibiotics.
AB  == background: the incidence of clostridium difficile-associated disease (cdad) in hospitalised patients is increasing. critically ill patients are often treated with antibiotics and are at a high risk of developing cdad. lactobacillus plantarum 299v (lp299v) has been found to reduce recurrence of cdad. we investigated intensive care unit (icu) patients with respect to the impact of lp299v on c. difficile colonisation and on gut permeability and parameters of inflammation and infection in that context. methods: twenty-two icu patients were given a fermented oatmeal gruel containing lp299v, and 22 received an equivalent  product without the bacteria. faecal samples for analyses of c. difficile and lp299v were taken at inclusion and then twice a week during the icu stay. other cultures were performed on clinical indication. infection and inflammation parameters were analysed daily. gut permeability was assessed using a sugar probe technique. results: colonisation with c. difficile was detected in 19% (4/21) of  controls but in none of the lp299v-treated patients (p<0.05). conclusions: enteral administration of the probiotic bacterium lp299v to critically ill patients treated with antibiotics reduced colonisation with c. difficile.

TI  == probiotics for treatment of clostridium difficile-associated colitis in adults.
AB  == background: probiotics are live microorganisms consisting of non-pathogenic yeast and bacteria that are believed to restore the microbial balance of the gastrointestinal tract altered by infection with clostridium difficile (c. difficile). objectives: to assess the efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of  antibiotic associated c. difficile colitis. search strategy: the databases medline, embase, the cochrane central register of controlled trials and cochrane  ibd/fbd specialized trials register were searched to locate all published reports from 1966 to 2007. selection criteria: randomized, prospective studies using probiotics alone or in conjunction with conventional antibiotics for the treatment of documented c. difficile colitis were eligible for inclusion. data collection and analysis: data extraction and analysis was done independently by two authors. main results: four studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. the four studies examined the use of probiotics in conjunction with conventional antibiotics (vancomycin or metronidazole) for the treatment of recurrence or an initial episode of c. difficile colitis in adults.  the studies were small in size and had methodological problems. a statistically significant benefit for probiotics combined with antibiotics was found in one study. mcfarland 1994 found that patients receiving s. boulardii were significantly less likely than patients receiving placebo to experience recurrence of c. difficile diarrhea (rr 0.59; 95% ci 0.35 to 0.98). no benefit of probiotics treatment was found in the other studies. authors' conclusions: there  is insufficient evidence to recommend probiotic therapy as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy for c. difficile colitis. there is no evidence to support the  use of probiotics alone in the treatment of c. difficile colitis.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum 299v enhances the concentrations of fecal short-chain fatty acids in patients with recurrent clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea.
AB  == our objective was to document how intake of lactobacillus plantarum 299v affects  the concentrations of fecal organic acids during and after metronidazole treatment in 19 patients with recurrent clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. fecal samples were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. after intake  of metronidazole a significant decrease in total short-chain fatty acids was seen in the placebo group (from 77.1 to 45.5 micromol/g; p=0.028) but not in the lactobacillus group (79.8-60.4 micromol/g). in addition, a statistically significant difference between treatment groups was noted for butyrate (5.6-1.2 micromol/g in the placebo group vs. 7.6-5.6 micromol/g in the lactobacillus group; p=0.047). at the end of the study and after cessation of placebo or lactobacillus, the total short-chain fatty acids rose to the same levels as before antibiotic treatment in the placebo group. both treatment groups showed a  significant decrease in concentrations of succinate at the end of the study in comparison to the time when metronidazole intake was stopped (6.3-1.5 micromol/g  in the placebo group versus 9.3-0.9 micromol/g in the lactobacillus group; p=0.028). the present study of fecal samples from a clinical trial is the first to demonstrate that administration of lactobacillus plantarum 299v reduces the negative effects of an antibiotic on colonic fermentation. the intake of this probiotic strain may thereby provide an additional benefit for patients with recurrent clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea.

TI  == antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
AB  == aim: to develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. methods and results: the antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lactobacillus plantarum 299v and lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium lactis bb12, bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). bacterial  fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. pyelonephritic escherichia coli was highly suppressed by gg and both bifidobacteria strains. lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and me-3 were the most  effective against salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while me-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. the highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for lact. fermentum me-3 (p < 0.05). no efficient antagonist against clostridium difficile was found. the positive correlations between the ph, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics  were assessed. conclusions: developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of lactobacillus and/or bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. significance and impact of the study: screening lactobacillus and bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy  studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.

TI  == in vitro activities of the new semisynthetic glycopeptide telavancin (td-6424), vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, and four comparator agents against anaerobic gram-positive species and corynebacterium spp.
AB  == telavancin is a new semisynthetic glycopeptide anti-infective with multiple mechanisms of action, including inhibition of bacterial membrane phospholipid synthesis and inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. we determined the in vitro activities of telavancin, vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ampicillin against 268 clinical isolates of anaerobic gram-positive organisms and 31 corynebacterium strains using agar dilution methods according to national committee for clinical laboratory standards procedures. plates with daptomycin were supplemented with ca(2+) to 50 mg/liter. the mics at which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited (mic(90)s) for telavancin and vancomycin were as follows: actinomyces spp. (n = 45), 0.25 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium difficile (n = 14), 0.25 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium ramosum (n =  16), 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium innocuum (n = 15), 4 and 16 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium clostridioforme (n = 15), 8 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; eubacterium group (n = 33), 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively; lactobacillus spp. (n = 26), 0.5 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; propionibacterium spp. (n = 34), 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively; peptostreptococcus spp. (n  = 52), 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively; and corynebacterium spp. (n = 31),  0.03 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. the activity of td-6424 was similar to that of quinupristin-dalfopristin for most strains except c. clostridioforme and lactobacillus casei, where quinupristin-dalfopristin was three- to fivefold more  active. daptomycin had decreased activity (mic > 4 microg/ml) against 14 strains  of actinomyces spp. and all c. ramosum, eubacterium lentum, and lactobacillus plantarum strains. linezolid showed decreased activity (mic > 4 microg/ml) against c. ramosum, two strains of c. difficile, and 15 strains of lactobacillus  spp. imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam were active against >98% of strains. the mics of ampicillin for eight clostridium spp. and three strains of l. casei were >1 microg/ml. the mic(90) of td-6424 for all strains tested was </=2 microg/ml. td-6424 has potential for use against infections with gram-positive anaerobes and deserves further clinical evaluation.

AB  == indigenous intestinal microflora (including lactobacilli) has an important role in protection against clostridium difficile infection. to assess in vitro interaction between lactobacilli and c. difficile, antagonistic activity of 50 intestinal lactobacillus spp. strains against 23 pathogenic c. difficile strains  was determined. phenotypic properties of c. difficile strains [production of short-chain fatty acids (scfas) and toxin a, and antimicrobial susceptibility] and lactobacilli (production of scfas and h(2)o(2)) were investigated. five lactobacilli (lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus plantarum species) were antagonistic to all c. difficile strains, 18 were antagonistic to some c. difficile strains and 27 showed no antagonistic activity. this antagonistic activity was strain-specific and seemed to correlate with h(2)o(2) and lactic acid production. c. difficile strains that were more sensitive to lactobacilli (n = 9) usually produced higher toxin levels and more scfas, and were more resistant to antibiotics, than strains that were resistant to lactobacilli (n = 14). compatibility of c. difficile strain properties (resistance to lactobacilli or antibiotics) with intestinal microecological conditions (e.g. presence of antagonistic lactobacilli, concentration of antibiotics) may determine expression of disease.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum 299v for the treatment of recurrent clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed to analyse the ability of  lactobacillus plantarum 299v to prevent further recurrent episodes of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (rcdad). recurrence of clinical symptoms (main outcome) was seen in 4 of 11 patients who received metronidazole in combination with l. plantarum 299v and in 6 of 9 treated with metronidazole in combination with placebo. the lactobacilli treatment had no side-effects. although the small  sample size does not allow any conclusion to be drawn concerning the efficacy of  l. plantarum in patients with rcdad, these results may contribute to the ongoing  discussion about the benefits of probiotics in patients with rcdad and encourage  the performance of larger multicentre studies.
