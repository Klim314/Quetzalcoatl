TI == oral microbiota shift after 12-week supplementation with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289; a randomized control trial.
AB == background: lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. methods and findings: oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna hypervariable region v3-v4 after 12 weeks of daily lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289 consumption. forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 cfu of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). presence of l. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific pcr. tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. a total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. after removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the human oral microbiome database. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. streptococcus was the most common genus and the s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group comprised the dominant species. the number of observed species was unaffected by l. reuteri exposure. however, subjects who had consumed l. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and pcr detected l. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. l. reuteri intake correlated with increased s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group and campylobacter concisus, granulicatella adiacens, bergeyella sp. hot322, neisseria subflava, and sr1 [g-1] sp. hot874 detection and reduced s. mutans, s. anginosus, n. mucosa, fusobacterium periodicum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, and prevotella maculosa detection. this effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. conclusions: l. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. the biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02311218.

TI == extensive description and comparison of human supra-gingival microbiome in root caries and health.
AB == knowledge of the polymicrobial etiology of root caries is limited. to conduct a comprehensive research study on root caries, we utilized 454-pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene libraries and quantitative pcr to compare supra-gingival bacterial communities from healthy sites and carious sites of 21 patients with root caries (patient-controls and patient-cases) and the sites of 21 healthy individuals (healthy-controls) from two nursing homes. healthy-controls and patient-cases showed no significant differences in terms of biomass, species richness, and species diversity. however, as for beta diversity based on either community membership metric (unweighted unifrac) or community structure metric (weighted unifrac), healthy-controls and patient-cases were clearly distinguished from each other, appearing more variable in the community membership and structure in root caries microbiome but relatively conserved in the health microbiome. the patient-controls group was at an intermediate stage between healthy-controls and patient-cases, but was more inclined to the former. demonstrated in both relative abundance and prevalence of species in health and root caries, propionibacterium acidifaciens, streptococcus mutans, olsenella profusa, prevotella multisaccharivorax, and lactobacillus crispatus were found to be most associated with root caries, whereas delftia acidovorans, bacteroidetes[g-2] sp., lachnospiraceae[g-3] sp., and prevotella intermedia are most associated with health. our study provides a basis for further elucidating the microbial etiology of root caries in the elderly.

TI == comparison of bacterial culture and 16s rrna community profiling by clonal analysis and pyrosequencing for the characterization of the dentine caries-associated microbiome.
AB == culture-independent analyses have greatly expanded knowledge regarding the composition of complex bacterial communities including those associated with oral diseases. a consistent finding from such studies, however, has been the under-reporting of members of the phylum actinobacteria. in this study, five pairs of broad range primers targeting 16s rrna genes were used in clonal analysis of 6 samples collected from tooth lesions involving dentine in subjects with active caries. samples were also subjected to cultural analysis and pyrosequencing by means of the 454 platform. a diverse bacterial community of 229 species-level taxa was revealed by culture and clonal analysis, dominated by representatives of the genera prevotella, lactobacillus, selenomonas, and streptococcus. the five most abundant species were: lactobacillus gasseri, prevotella denticola, alloprevotella tannerae, s. mutans and streptococcus sp. hot 070, which together made up 31.6 % of the sequences. two samples were dominated by lactobacilli, while the remaining samples had low numbers of lactobacilli but significantly higher numbers of prevotella species. the different primer pairs produced broadly similar data but proportions of the phylum bacteroidetes were significantly higher when primer 1387r was used. all of the primer sets underestimated the proportion of actinobacteria compared to culture. pyrosequencing analysis of the samples was performed to a depth of sequencing of 4293 sequences per sample which were identified to 264 species-level taxa, and resulted in significantly higher coverage estimates than the clonal analysis. pyrosequencing, however, also underestimated the relative abundance of actinobacteria compared to culture.

TI == identification of the microbiota in carious dentin lesions using 16s rrna gene sequencing.
AB == while mutans streptococci have long been assumed to be the specific pathogen responsible for human dental caries, the concept of a complex dental caries-associated microbiota has received significant attention in recent years. molecular analyses revealed the complexity of the microbiota with the predominance of lactobacillus and prevotella in carious dentine lesions. however, characterization of the dentin caries-associated microbiota has not been extensively explored in different ethnicities and races. in the present study, the bacterial communities in the carious dentin of japanese subjects were analyzed comprehensively with molecular approaches using the16s rrna gene. carious dentin lesion samples were collected from 32 subjects aged 4-76 years, and the 16s rrna genes, amplified from the extracted dna with universal primers, were sequenced with a pyrosequencer. the bacterial composition was classified into clusters i, ii, and iii according to the relative abundance (high, middle, low) of lactobacillus. the bacterial composition in cluster ii was composed of relatively high proportions of olsenella and propionibacterium or subdominated by heterogeneous genera. the bacterial communities in cluster iii were characterized by the predominance of atopobium, prevotella, or propionibacterium with streptococcus or actinomyces. some samples in clusters ii and iii, mainly related to atopobium and propionibacterium, were novel combinations of microbiota in carious dentin lesions and may be characteristic of the japanese population. clone library analysis revealed that atopobium sp. hot-416 and p. acidifaciens were specific species associated with dentinal caries among these genera in a japanese population. we summarized the bacterial composition of dentinal carious lesions in a japanese population using next-generation sequencing and found typical japanese types with atopobium or propionibacterium predominating.

TI == salivary microbiota and metabolome associated with celiac disease.
AB == this study aimed to investigate the salivary microbiota and metabolome of 13 children with celiac disease (cd) under a gluten-free diet (treated celiac disease [t-cd]). the same number of healthy children (hc) was used as controls. the salivary microbiota was analyzed by an integrated approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods. metabolome analysis was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction. compared to hc, the number of some cultivable bacterial groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (p < 0.05) differed in the saliva samples of the t-cd children. as shown by community-level catabolic profiles, the highest shannon's diversity and substrate richness were found in hc. pyrosequencing data showed the highest richness estimator and diversity index values for hc. levels of lachnospiraceae, gemellaceae, and streptococcus sanguinis were highest for the t-cd children. streptococcus thermophilus levels were markedly decreased in t-cd children. the saliva of t-cd children showed the largest amount of bacteroidetes (e.g., porphyromonas sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, and prevotella nanceiensis), together with the smallest amount of actinobacteria. t-cd children were also characterized by decreased levels of some actinomyces species, atopobium species, and corynebacterium durum. rothia mucilaginosa was the only actinobacteria species found at the highest level in t-cd children. as shown by multivariate statistical analyses, the levels of organic volatile compounds markedly differentiated t-cd children. some compounds (e.g., ethyl-acetate, nonanal, and 2-hexanone) were found to be associated with t-cd children. correlations (false discovery rate [fdr], <0.05) were found between the relative abundances of bacteria and some volatile organic compounds (vocs). the findings of this study indicated that cd is associated with oral dysbiosis that could affect the oral metabolome.

TI == dental caries and microbiota in children with black stain and non-discoloured dental plaque.
AB == aim: we aimed to assess caries experience and microbiota in systemically healthy  children with black stain (bs) and non-discoloured plaque. methods: forty-six children with bs and 47 counterparts with non-discoloured plaque aged 7.9 +/- 1.3 years were clinically examined. dental caries was scored using who criteria. samples of bs and non-discoloured dental plaque were collected from tooth surfaces. the dna of the samples was extracted and real-time pcr was performed to determine the total number of bacteria and the species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus sp., actinomyces naeslundii, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. results: children with bs had lower dmft (p = 0.013), lower dt values (p = 0.005) and a tendency to lower caries prevalence (p = 0.061) than children with non-discoloured plaque. plaque samples of the bs group contained higher numbers of a. naeslundii (p = 0.005) and lower numbers of f. nucleatum (p = 0.001) and lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.001) compared to the non-discoloured plaque samples of the control group. comparing the children with bs and non-discoloured plaque, higher counts for a. naeslundii (p = 0.013) were observed in caries-free children with bs while in caries-affected children with bs, lower counts of f. nucleatum (p = 0.007) were found. counts of lactobacillus sp. were higher in non-discoloured plaque samples than in bs of caries-free and caries-affected children. conclusion: results suggest that the different microbial composition of bs might be associated with the lower caries experience in affected subjects. the role of black-pigmented bacteria associated with periodontitis needs further studies.

TI == frequency of periodontal pathogens in equivalent peri-implant and periodontal clinical statuses.
AB == objectives: this study tested the hypotheses that there is: (1) higher bacterial  frequency in peri-implantitis/periodontitis, followed by mucositis/gingivitis and peri-implant/periodontal health; (2) similar bacterial frequency between comparable peri-implant and periodontal clinical statuses. design of study: the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was evaluated in peri-implant (n=53) and periodontal (n=53) health; mucositis (n=50), gingivitis (n=50), peri-implantitis (n=50) and periodontitis (n=50). results: the pattern of peri-implant bacterial frequency was not as expected (peri-implantitis>mucositis>health). except for p. intermedia (p>0.05), bacterial frequency was higher in peri-implantitis than health (p<0.05). the frequency of p.gingivalis and red complex species were higher in peri-implantitis than mucositis (p<0.05). in periodontal samples, t. forsythia and t. denticola showed the expected pattern of frequency (periodontitis>gingivitis>health). the frequencies of c. rectus and t. forsythia were higher in healthy teeth/gingivitis than healthy implants/mucositis, respectively (p<0.05). the frequency of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were similar between periodontitis and peri-implantitis (p>0.05) while all other species occurrences were higher in periodontitis than peri-implantitis (p<0.05). conclusions: bacterial frequency increased from peri-implant/periodontal health to peri-implantitis/periodontitis but not from mucositis/gingivitis to peri-implantitis/periodontitis. there was a trend towards higher bacterial frequency in teeth than implants.

TI == comparison of endotoxin levels found in primary and secondary endodontic infections.
AB == introduction: this clinical study was conducted to compare the levels of endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides [lpss]) found in primary and secondary endodontic infections with apical periodontitis by correlating lps contents with clinical/radiographic findings. in addition, the presence of target gram-negative anaerobic bacteria was also investigated. methods: samples were taken from 15 root canals with primary infections and 15 with secondary infections by using paper points. the limulus amebocyte lysate assay was used to quantify endotoxins, and the polymerase chain reaction technique (16s rdna) was used for bacterial investigation. results: endotoxins were detected in 100% of the root canal samples collected from primary (15/15) and secondary (15/15) infections with median values of 7.49 eu/ml and 3.96 eu/ml, respectively (p < .05). the median value of endotoxins found in the presence of clinical symptoms was significantly higher than in asymptomatic teeth with primary infections (p < .05). a positive correlation was found between endotoxin contents and a larger size of the radiolucent area (>3 mm) (p < .05). prevotella nigrescens (10/15, 4/15), fusobacterium nucleatum (5/15, 1/15), treponema denticola (3/15, 1/15), and treponema socranskii (5/15, 1/15) were detected in teeth with primary and secondary infections, respectively. p. endodontalis was present only in teeth with primary infections (5/15). conclusions: teeth with primary endodontic infections had higher contents of endotoxins and a more complex gram-negative bacterial community than teeth with secondary infections. moreover, the levels of endotoxins were related to the severity of bone destruction in periapical tissues as well as the development of clinical features in teeth with primary infections.

AB == five strains of anaerobic, gram-negative bacilli isolated from the human oral cavity were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests and were found to comprise a homogeneous group. phylogenetic analysis of full-length 16s rrna gene sequences showed that these strains represented a novel group within the family prevotellaceae, and the most closely related species was prevotella tannerae. p. tannerae and the novel taxon are deeply branched from the genus prevotella, with sequence identities to the type strain of the type species of prevotella, prevotella melaninogenica, of 82.2 and 85.6 %, respectively. the novel genus alloprevotella gen. nov. is proposed to accommodate the novel species alloprevotella rava gen. nov., sp. nov. and the previously named prevotella tannerae moore et al. 1994 as alloprevotella tannerae gen. nov., comb. nov. the type species is alloprevotella tannerae. the type strain of alloprevotella rava is 81/4-12(t) ( = dsm 22548(t) = ccug 58091(t)) and the type strain of alloprevotella tannerae is atcc 51259(t) = ccug 34292(t) = cip 104476(t) = nctc 13073(t). alloprevotella rava is weakly to moderately saccharolytic and produces moderate amounts of acetic acid and major amounts of succinic acid as end products of fermentation. strains are sensitive to 20 % bile and hydrolyse gelatin. the principal cellular long-chain fatty acids are anteiso-c15 : 0, iso-c15 : 0, c16 : 0, iso-c17 : 0 and iso-c17 : 0 3-oh. the g+c content of the dna of the type strain is 47 mol%.

TI == pattern of distribution of prevotella species/phylotypes associated with healthy  gingiva and periodontal disease.
AB == the purpose of the present study was to obtain diverse profiles of prevotella species associated with gingival sites in an isolated aboriginal and an urban community by phylogenetic analysis and to establish patterns of association of identified prevotella species in gingival sites. species/phylotypes identified from the phylogenetic analysis of near full-length bacteroidetes 16s rrna gene sequences cloned from subgingival plaque samples obtained from an aboriginal community were compared with those from an ethnically diverse urban metropolitan population suffering from periodontal disease. specific primer sets were designed and validated for 22 distinct prevotella species from the 24 species/phylotypes identified from both populations. within the isolated aboriginal community, gingival sites in adults were colonised by a mean of 15 different prevotella species. prevotella sp. oral clone p4pb24, prevotella intermedia, prevotella oralis, prevotella denticola and prevotella sp. strain p4p62 had the highest association with increasing probing depth in diseased sites (p < 0.05). p. intermedia and prevotella sp. oral clone p4pb24, the prevotella species significantly associated with increasing probing depth in diseased gingival sites and also strongly associated with p. gingivalis load (p < 0.05) in diseased gingival sites, showed significant correlation for co-colonisation (r = 0.6). prevotella sp. oral clone b31fd, showing strong association with p. gingivalis load (p < 0.05) in diseased gingival sites, showed no significant correlation for co-colonisation with any other prevotella species. this study provides a comprehensive analysis of prevotella species associated with gingival sites for the informative evaluation of the epidemiology of infection by this genus.

AB == objectives: this study aims to assess the effects of rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse with or without adjunct tongue scraping on volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) in breath air, and the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue. material and methods: a randomized single-masked controlled clinical trial with a cross-over study design over 14 days including 21 subjects was performed. bacterial samples from the dorsum of the tongue were assayed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: no halitosis (identified by vsc assessments) at day 14 was identified in 12/21 subjects with active rinse alone, in 10/21 with adjunct use of tongue scraper, in 1/21 for negative control rinse alone, and in 3/21 in the control and tongue scraping sequence. at day 14, significantly lower counts were identified only in the active rinse sequence (p < 0.001) for 15/78 species including, fusobacterium sp., porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and tannerella forsythia. a decrease in bacteria from baseline to day 14 was found in successfully treated subjects for 9/74 species including: p. gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica, s. aureus, and treponema denticola. baseline vsc scores were correlated with several bacterial species. the use of a tongue scraper combined with active rinse did not change the levels of vsc compared to rinsing alone. conclusions: vsc scores were not associated with bacterial counts in samples taken from the dorsum of the tongue. the active rinse alone containing zinc and chlorhexidine had effects on intra-oral halitosis and reduced bacterial counts of species associated with malodor. tongue scraping provided no beneficial effects on the microbiota studied. clinical relevance: periodontally healthy subjects with intra-oral halitosis benefit from daily rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse.

AB == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI == correlation network analysis applied to complex biofilm communities.
AB == the complexity of the human microbiome makes it difficult to reveal organizational principles of the community and even more challenging to generate testable hypotheses. it has been suggested that in the gut microbiome species such as bacteroides thetaiotaomicron are keystone in maintaining the stability and functional adaptability of the microbial community. in this study, we investigate the interspecies associations in a complex microbial biofilm applying systems biology principles. using correlation network analysis we identified bacterial modules that represent important microbial associations within the oral community. we used dental plaque as a model community because of its high diversity and the well known species-species interactions that are common in the oral biofilm. we analyzed samples from healthy individuals as well as from patients with periodontitis, a polymicrobial disease. using results obtained by checkerboard hybridization on cultivable bacteria we identified modules that correlated well with microbial complexes previously described. furthermore, we extended our analysis using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim), which includes a large number of bacterial species, among them uncultivated organisms present in the mouth. two distinct microbial communities appeared in healthy individuals while there was one major type in disease. bacterial modules in all communities did not overlap, indicating that bacteria were able to effectively re-associate with new partners depending on the environmental conditions. we then identified hubs that could act as keystone species in the bacterial modules. based on those results we then cultured a not-yet-cultivated microorganism, tannerella sp. ot286 (clone bu063). after two rounds of enrichment by a selected helper (prevotella oris ot311) we obtained colonies of tannerella sp. ot286 growing on blood agar plates. this system-level approach would open the possibility of manipulating microbial communities in a targeted fashion as well as associating certain bacterial modules to clinical traits (e.g.: obesity, crohn's disease, periodontal disease, etc).

TI == rna-oligonucleotide quantification technique (roqt) for the enumeration of uncultivated bacterial species in subgingival biofilms.
AB == approximately 35% of the species present in subgingival biofilms are as yet uncultivated, so their role in periodontal pathogenesis is unknown. the aim of the present study was to develop a high throughput method to quantify a wide range of cultivated and uncultivated taxa in subgingival biofilm samples associated with periodontal disease or health. oligonucleotides targeting the 16s ribosomal dna gene were designed, synthesized and labeled with digoxigenin. these probes were hybridized with the total nucleic acids of pure cultures or subgingival biofilm samples. target species included cultivated taxa associated with periodontal health and disease, as well as uncultivated species, such as tm7 sp. ot 346, mitsuokella sp. ot 131 and desulfobulbus sp. ot 041. sensitivity and specificity of the probes were determined. a universal probe was used to assess total bacterial load. sequences complementary to the probes were used as standards for quantification. chemiluminescent signals were visualized after film exposure or using a ccd camera. in a pilot clinical study, 266 subgingival plaque samples from eight periodontally healthy people and 11 patients with periodontitis were examined. probes were specific and sensitivity reached 10(4) cells. fusobacterium nucleatum ss. polymorphum and actinomyces gerencseriae were the most abundant cultivated taxa in clinical samples. among uncultivated/unrecognized species, mitsuokella sp. ot 131 and prevotella sp. ot 306 were the most numerous. porphyromonas gingivalis and desulfobulbus sp. ot 041 were only detected in patients with periodontitis. direct hybridization of total nucleic acids using oligonucleotide probes permitted the quantification of multiple cultivated and uncultivated taxa in mixed species biofilm samples.

AB == real-time pcr analysis of the total bacterial load in advanced carious lesions has shown that the total load exceeds the number of cultivable bacteria. this suggests that an unresolved complexity exists in bacteria associated with advanced caries. in this report, the profile of the microflora of carious dentine was explored by using dna extracted from 10 lesions selected on the basis of comparable total microbial load and on the relative abundance of prevotella spp. using universal primers for the 16s rrna gene, pcr amplicons were cloned, and approximately 100 transformants were processed for each lesion. phylogenetic analysis of 942 edited sequences demonstrated the presence of 75 species or phylotypes in the 10 carious lesions. up to 31 taxa were represented in each sample. a diverse array of lactobacilli were found to comprise 50% of the species, with prevotellae also abundant, comprising 15% of the species. other taxa present in a number of lesions or occurring with high abundance included selenomonas spp., dialister spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium spp., members of the lachnospiraceae family, olsenella spp., bifidobacterium spp., propionibacterium sp., and pseudoramibacter alactolyticus. the mechanisms by which such diverse patterns of bacteria extend carious lesions, including the aspect of infection of the vital dental pulp, remain unclear.

TI == detection and characterization of beta-lactamase genes in subgingival bacteria from patients with refractory periodontitis.
AB == fifty-three beta-lactamase-producing strains of oral bacteria isolated from patients with refractory periodontitis in norway and usa were screened for the presence of the bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(oxa), bla(ampc), bla(cfxa), and bla(cepa/cbla) genes by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the pcr products were characterized by direct sequencing of the amplified dna. thirty-four of the 53 enzyme-producing strains (64%) were positive in one of the pcr assays. all beta-lactamase-producing prevotella and capnocytophaga spp. were cfxa positive. tem-type beta-lactamases were identified in one strain each of escherichia coli and neisseria sp., and one strain of citrobacter freundii possessed an ampc-type beta-lactamase. screening for gene cassettes and genes known to be associated with integrons did not reveal the presence of integrons in these oral bacteria. sequence analyses showed that most cfxa positive prevotella and capnocytophaga isolates from patients with refractory periodontitis harboured variants of the cfxa2 and cfxa3 enzyme. the present study also showed that many different genetic determinants of beta-lactamase production are found in bacteria isolated from refractory periodontitis, many of which remain to be characterized.

TI == substance p enhances expression of lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory factors in dental pulp cells.
AB == to examine how substance p (sp) is related with dental pulp inflammation, we examined the effects of sp on expression of genes for inflammatory factors in human dental pulp cell cultures. using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we found that prevotella intermedia lipopolysaccharide (lps) induced expression of sp and sp-receptor mrnas, and that somatostatin inhibited the lps-induced expression of sp mrna. we also found that sp enhanced lps-induced stimulation of nf-kappab binding activity. in addition, sp induced expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and interleukin-10 receptor mrnas. in contrast, sp inhibited expression of interferon-gamma receptor mrna. these results suggest that sp may play a regulatory role in the immunological response of dental pulp tissue to pathogenic bacteria.

TI == beta-lactamase production and antimicrobial susceptibility of subgingival bacteria from refractory periodontitis.
AB == this study assessed the extent of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in subgingival plaque samples obtained from 25 patients with refractory marginal periodontitis in the usa. beta-lactamase-positive isolates were characterized using commercial diagnostic kits and partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. the susceptibilities to different antimicrobial agents were tested and, in addition, the isolates were screened for the presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 18 (72%) patients. the most prominent beta-lactamase-producing organisms belonged to the anaerobic genus prevotella. other enzyme-producing anaerobic strains were fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus sp. facultative bacteria, such as burkholderia spp., ralstonia pickettii, capnocytophaga spp., bacillus spp., staphylococcus spp. and neisseria sp., were also detected among the enzyme-producers. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ampicillin and amoxicillin were in the range 1.5-256 micrograms/ml and 4-256 micrograms/ml, respectively, for the isolates of the prevotella species. all prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole, but they showed variable resistance to tetracyclines. two of the prevotella isolates had high mics of cefotaxime and ceftazidime. esbl activity was not detected in any of the beta-lactamase-producing isolates by the etest method. thus, our study demonstrated a wide variety of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria that may play a role in refractory periodontal disease.

AB == two bacterial strains, ehs11(t) and epsa11(t), which were isolated from the human oral cavity, were characterized in terms of phenotypic and biochemical characteristics, cellular fatty acid profiles and phylogenetic position based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed that each of the isolates belonged to a novel species of the genus prevotella. strain ehs11(t) was related to prevotella loescheii (about 95 % similarity), whereas strain epsa11(t) was related to prevotella oris (about 94 % similarity). both strains were obligately anaerobic, non-pigmented, non-spore-forming, non-motile, gram-negative rods. the cellular fatty acid composition of strain epsa11(t) was very similar to that of p. oris jcm 8540(t). on the other hand, the cellular fatty acid composition of strain ehs11(t) was significantly different from those of other prevotella species. the predominant fatty acids in strain ehs11(t) are c(18 : 1)omega9c, c(16 : 0) and c(16 : 0) 3-oh, whereas other prevotella species, except for p. loescheii jcm 8530(t), possess anteiso-c(15 : 0), iso-c(17 : 0) 3-oh and c(18 : 1)omega9c. the predominant fatty acids in p. loescheii jcm 8530(t) are anteiso-c(15 : 0), c(16 : 0) and c(18 : 1)omega9c. dna-dna hybridization experiments revealed a genomic distinction of strains ehs11(t) and epsa11(t) from p. loescheii jcm 8530(t) and p. oris jcm 8540(t). on the basis of these data, two novel prevotella species are proposed: prevotella shahii sp. nov. and prevotella salivae sp. nov. the type strains of p. shahii and p. salivae are ehs11(t) (=jcm 12083(t)=dsm 15611(t)) and epsa11(t) (=jcm 12084(t)=dsm 15606(t)), respectively.

TI == microbiological examination of infected dental root canals.
AB == objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the root canal microbiota of primary and secondary root-infected canals and the association of constituent species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. methods: microbial samples were taken from 60 root canals, 41 with necrotic pulp tissues (primary infection) and 19 with failed endodontic treatment (secondary infection). strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation and identification. results: a total of 224 cultivable isolates were recovered belonging to 56 different bacterial species. individual root canals yielded a maximum of 10 bacterial species. of the bacterial isolates, 70% were either strict anaerobes or microphilic. the anaerobes most frequently isolated were: peptostreptococcus micros (35%), fusobacterium necrophorum (23.3%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.7%), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (16.7%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (5%). the root canal microflora of untreated teeth with apical periodontitis was found to be mixed, comprising gram-negative and gram-positive and mostly anaerobic microorganisms and usually containing more than 3 species per canal. on the other hand, facultative anaerobic and gram-positive bacteria predominated in canals with failed endodontic treatment, which harbored 1-2 species per canal. suggested relationships were found between anaerobes, especially gram-negatives, and the presence or history of pain, tenderness to percussion and swelling (p<0.05). in particular, associations were found between: a) pain (n=29) and p. micros (p<0.01), p. intermedia/nigrescens and eubacterium spp. (both p<0.05); b) history of pain (n=31) and p. micros (p<0.01) porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); c) tenderness to percussion (n=29) and porphyromonas spp. (p<0.01), peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.001); d) swelling (n=20) and peptostreptococcus spp. (p<0.01), porphyromonas and enterococcus spp. (p<0.05); e) wet canals (n=33) and porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); f) purulent exudate (n=20) and porphyromonas, peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); previous endodontic treatment and enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus spp., p. micros, f. necrophorum (p<0.05). conclusions: our findings indicate potential complex interactions of species resulting in characteristic clinical pictures which cannot be achieved by individual species alone. they also indicate that the microbiota of primary infected canals with apical periodontitis differs in number and in species from the secondary infected canals by using the culture technique.

TI == bacteremia following surgical dental extraction with an emphasis on anaerobic strains.
AB == our aim was to investigate bacteremia caused by surgical extraction of partly erupted mandibular third molars. from 16 young adults, bacterial samples were taken from the third-molar pericoronal pocket and post-operatively from the extraction socket, and blood samples were drawn from the ante-cubital vein up to 30 min after surgery. of the subjects, 88% had detectable bacteremia-50% 1 min after the incision, 44% immediately after extraction. the respective percentages at 10, 15, and 30 min were 44%, 25%, and 13%. blood cultures contained 31 species (74% anaerobes), with 3.9 +/- 2.6 species isolated per subject. most prevalent were the anaerobes prevotella, eubacterium, and peptostreptococcus sp. and the aerobes viridans-group streptococci and streptococcus milleri group. any species found in the blood was also isolated from the mouth, from 93% of the pericoronal pockets and from 43% of the extraction sockets. surgical dental extraction clearly causes bacteremia of a high frequency and lasting longer than thus far assumed.

TI == lethal photosensitization in microbiological treatment of ligature-induced peri-implantitis: a preliminary study in dogs.
AB == this pilot study evaluated, by culture testing, the effectiveness of lethal photosensitization for the microbiological treatment of peri-implantitis in dogs. experimental peri-implantitis was induced by ligature placement for 2 months. following ligature removal, plaque control was instituted by scrubbing with 0.12% chlorhexidine daily for 12 months. subsequently, mucoperiosteal flaps were elevated for scaling the implant surface. microbial samples were obtained with paper points before and after treatment of implant surfaces by means of 100 microg/ml toluidine blue o (tbo,) and were exposed, for 80 s, to light with a wavelength of 685 nm from a 50 mw gaalas diode laser. the mean initial and final bacterial counts were 7.22 +/- 0.20 and 6.84 +/- 0.44 cfu/ml, respectively for tvc (p < 0.0001); 6.19 +/- 0.45 and 3.14 +/- 3.29 cfu/ml for p. intermedia/nigrescens (p = 0.001); 5.98 +/- 0.38 and 1.69 +/- 2.90 cfu/ml for fusobacterium spp. (p = 0.001); and 6.07 +/- 0.22 to 1.69 +/- 2.94 cfu/ml for beta-hemolytic streptococcus (p = 0.0039). it may be concluded that lethal photosensitization resulted in a reduction of the bacterial count. complete elimination of bacteria was achieved in some samples.

AB == purpose: the goal of this study was to evaluate microbiota and radiographic peri-implant bone loss associated with ligature-induced peri-implantitis. materials and methods: thirty-six dental implants with 4 different surfaces (9 commercially pure titanium, 9 titanium plasma-sprayed, 9 hydroxyapatite, and 9 acid-etched) were placed in the edentulous mandibles of 6 dogs. after 3 months with optimal plaque control, abutment connection was performed. on days 0, 20, 40, and 60 after placement of cotton ligatures, both microbiologic samples and periapical radiographs were obtained. the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, campylobacter spp, capnocytophaga spp, fusobacterium spp, beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and candida spp were evaluated culturally. results: p intermedia/nigrescens was detected in 13.89% of implants at baseline and 100% of implants at other periods. p gingivalis was not detected at baseline, but after 20 and 40 days it was detected in 33.34% of implants and at 60 days it was detected in 29.03% of dental implants. fusobacterium spp was detected in all periods. streptococci were detected in 16.67% of implants at baseline and in 83.34%, 72.22%, and 77.42% of implants at 20, 40, and 60 days, respectively. campylobacter spp and candida spp were detected in low proportions. the total viable count analysis showed no significant differences among surfaces (p = .831), although a significant difference was observed after ligature placement (p < .0014). however, there was no significant qualitative difference, in spite of the difference among the periods. the peri-implant bone loss was not significantly different between all the dental implant surfaces (p = .908). discussion and conclusions: these data suggest that with ligature-induced peri-implantitis, both time and periodontal pathogens affect all surfaces equally after 60 days.

TI == microbial susceptibility to calcium hydroxide pastes and their vehicles.
AB == the aim of this study was to investigate the susceptibility of some microorganisms commonly isolated from root canals to calcium hydroxide in combination with several vehicles by the agar diffusion method. stainless-steel cylinders were placed on each inoculated agar medium. the test medications and their controls were placed inside the cylinders. the zones of growth inhibition were measured and recorded after the incubation period for each plate, and the results were analyzed statistically. enterococcus faecalis was most resistant, whereas the anaerobic porphyromonas endodontalis was more susceptible to all medications, followed by p. gingivalis and prevotella intermedial intermedia. ca(oh)2 + cmcp + glycerin showed significantly larger mean zones of inhibition when compared with the other medications. we conclude that anaerobic gram-negative bacteria are more susceptible to calcium hydroxide pastes than facultative gram-positive microorganisms.

TI == high prevalence of cfxa beta-lactamase in aminopenicillin-resistant prevotella strains isolated from periodontal pockets.
AB == this prospective study was designed to investigate amoxicillin-resistant oral anaerobes, and to identify their beta-lactamase-encoding genes. three subgingival bacterial samples were collected from 12 patients suffering from periodontitis. one to seven beta-lactamase-producing strains were obtained from each patient, mostly belonging to the prevotella genus (bacteroides eggerthii, 2/35 strains; prevotella sp., 33/35 strains). pcr assays were used to detect cfxa and cepa/cbla, the genes encoding class a/group2e beta-lactamases previously described in the bacteroides fragilis group. the present investigation confirmed the role of prevotella species as beta-lactamase producers in periodontal pockets. additionally, this pcr screening showed (1): the high prevalence of cfxa beta-lactamase production by aminopenicillin-resistant prevotella (32/33: 97.0% positive strains) vs. cepa/cbla (1/33: 3.0% positive strains), and (2) the presence of cfxa in the periodontal reservoir in the absence of antimicrobial therapy during the previous 6 months.

AB == background: although extensive microbial analyses have been performed from subgingival plaque samples of periodontitis patients, systematic analysis of subgingival microbiota has not been carried out in a korean population so far. the purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of major putative periodontopathogens in korean patients by culture-independent methods. methods: a total of 244 subgingival plaque samples (5 sites in each participant) were taken from 29 advanced adult periodontitis (ap) patients and 20 periodontally healthy subjects. ap samples were obtained from the 4 deepest periodontal pockets (> or =6 mm probing depth [pd]) and 1 healthy site (< or =3 mm pd) in each patient. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) of 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) of subgingival plaque bacteria was performed with eubacterial primers. aliquots of pcr products were then applied on nylon membranes and hybridized with specific oligonucleotide probes labeled with digoxigenin. results: all diseased sites harbored fusobacterium sp., while porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema sp., and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 96% of 116 diseased sites. peptostreptococcus micros, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia were present in 82%, 74%, and 71% of diseased sites, respectively. in sites of periodontally healthy subjects, fusobacterium sp. was present in the highest proportion (58%). treponema sp., p. gingivalis, and b. forsythus were detected in 22%, 18%, and 18% of healthy sites, respectively. p. micros, p. intermedia, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were found in 8%, 2%, and 1% of healthy sites, respectively. the prevalence of the periodontopathogens, with the exceptions of fusobacterium sp. and b. forsythus, was significantly higher in the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects (p <0.05). conclusions: using highly sensitive methods relying on 16s ribosomal rna-based oligonucleotide probes, we confirmed the strong association of 7 putative periodontopathogens with ap patients in a korean population. with the exceptions of fusobacterium sp. and b. forsythus, all the periodontopathogens were significantly more associated with the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects.

TI == mutant analysis of prevotella sp. plaa-lacz fusion protein expression in escherichia coli: support for an essential role of the stem-loop.
AB == this study investigated the involvement of rna folding in the synthesis of a fusion protein with beta-galactosidase activity. the coding gap region of the prevotella loescheii adhesin gene plaa was fused in-frame with the escherichia coli lacz gene on plasmid psk105. n-terminal sequencing of the expressed plaa-lacz protein indicated that it resulted from translational initiation at a fortuitous ribosomal-binding site within the plaa sequence at nt 570. specific mutations were introduced in the stem-loop region that precedes the gap sequence. analysis of stem-loop mutants, together with the introduction of compensatory mutations that restored activity, supports a requirement for stem-loop formation within the plaa sequence preceding the translational initiation site. a mutation reducing the predicted size of the loop, but preserving the stem structure, inactivated fusion protein synthesis. a suppressor mutation predicted to restore the size of the loop restored efficient fusion protein synthesis. in addition, the sequence preceding the translational start site of the plaa-lacz fusion has several similarities to sequences that function as translational enhancers in prokaryotes. these include a stem-loop structure, an a-u rich region preceding the initiation codon, and a region of homology to 16s rrna.

TI == succession of putative peri-implant pathogens after root-form and plate-form implant placement in partially dentate adult monkeys.
AB == this report describes the succession of putative peri-implant pathogens in partially dentate monkeys after dental implantation and prosthetic reconstruction. tooth and implant (6 root-end form, 4 blade-vent implants) sites in eight monkeys were monitored microbiologically and clinically during the pre-implant stage, abutment connection stage, bridge placement stage, and three and six months after the bridge placement stage. tooth and implant sites were cleaned monthly post-extraction. microbiological studies included dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and primary phenotypic characterization of culture isolates. after implant surgery, the median proportion of several putative peri-implant pathogens studied were significantly elevated. following fixture placement, p. intermedia replaced p. melaninogenica as the predominant black pigmented anaerobic bacilli (bpab) in the mouth. after abutment connection stage, levels of p. intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatun, haemophilus sp. and spirochetes were significantly elevated at implant and tooth sites. three months after bridge installations, p. intermedia and a. actinomycetemcomitans remained significantly elevated at implant sites. at six months after bridge installation, levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans declined significantly relative to levels at three months. porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes were not significantly elevated although their levels correlated with gingival redness. p. intermedia, porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes levels correlated significantly with probing depth. correlation was detected between p. gingivalis and spirochetes; and between a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum. our studies show a transitional increase in levels of several organisms resembling putative pathogens of human peri-implant infection, associated with implant placements in partially edentulous mouths and supports early prophylactic interventions to control their levels.
