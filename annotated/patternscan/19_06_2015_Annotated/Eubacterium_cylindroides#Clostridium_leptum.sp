TI  == comparative analysis of gastric bacterial microbiota in mongolian gerbils after long-term infection with helicobacter pylori.
AB  == quantitative (qt) real time pcr using 16srdna primers is useful for determination of the bacterial composition of the gastric microbiota in mongolian gerbils. the  aim of this study was to determine the change in the gastric microbiota after long-term infection with helicobacter pylori. one year after inoculation with h.  pylori, five gerbils were determined as h. pylori-positive and 6 gerbils h. pylori-negative by culture and real time qt pcr methods. the gastric microbiota of each group of gerbils was also compared with that of 6 gerbils uninfected with h. pylori. dna from the atopobium cluster, bifidobacterium spp., clostridium coccoides group, clostridium leptum subgroup, enterococcus spp. and lactobacillus spp. were detected in the gastric mucus of both infected and uninfected gerbils.  in contrast, eubacterium cylindroides group and prevotella spp. were detected only in h. pylori-negative gerbils. the numbers of c. leptum subgroup, c. coccoides group and bifidobacterium spp. in gastric mucus of h. pylori-negative mongolian gerbils were significantly lower than those in non-infected gerbils. the results obtained suggest that the composition of gastric indigenous microbiota in mongolian gerbils may be disturbed by long-term infection with h. pylori, and that these changes may in fact inhibit h. pylori infection.
