TI  == extensive description and comparison of human supra-gingival microbiome in root caries and health.
AB  == knowledge of the polymicrobial etiology of root caries is limited. to conduct a comprehensive research study on root caries, we utilized 454-pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene libraries and quantitative pcr to compare supra-gingival bacterial  communities from healthy sites and carious sites of 21 patients with root caries  (patient-controls and patient-cases) and the sites of 21 healthy individuals (healthy-controls) from two nursing homes. healthy-controls and patient-cases showed no significant differences in terms of biomass, species richness, and species diversity. however, as for beta diversity based on either community membership metric (unweighted unifrac) or community structure metric (weighted unifrac), healthy-controls and patient-cases were clearly distinguished from each other, appearing more variable in the community membership and structure in root  caries microbiome but relatively conserved in the health microbiome. the patient-controls group was at an intermediate stage between healthy-controls and  patient-cases, but was more inclined to the former. demonstrated in both relative abundance and prevalence of species in health and root caries, propionibacterium  acidifaciens, streptococcus mutans, olsenella profusa, prevotella multisaccharivorax, and lactobacillus crispatus were found to be most associated  with root caries, whereas delftia acidovorans, bacteroidetes[g-2] sp., lachnospiraceae[g-3] sp., and prevotella intermedia are most associated with health. our study provides a basis for further elucidating the microbial etiology of root caries in the elderly.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly irish subjects.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects,  using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus),  gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to  growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.
