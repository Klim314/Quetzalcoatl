TI  == screening of species-specific lactic acid bacteria for veal calves multi-strain probiotic adjuncts.
AB  == the selection of promising specific species of lactic acid bacteria with potential probiotic characteristics is of particular interest in producing multi  species-specific probiotic adjuncts in veal calves rearing. the aim of the present work was to select and evaluate in vitro the functional activity of lactic acid bacteria, bifidobacterium longum and bacillus coagulans strains isolated from veal calves in order to assess their potential use as multi species-specific probiotics for veal calves. for this purpose, bacterial strains  isolated from faeces collected from 40 healthy 50-day-calves, were identified by  riboprinter and 16s rrna gene sequence. the most frequent strains belonged to the species b. longum, streptococcus bovis, lactobacillus animalis and streptococcus  macedonicus. among these, 7 strains were chosen for testing their probiotic characteristics in vitro. three strains, namely l. animalis sb310, lactobacillus  paracasei subsp. paracasei sb137 and b. coagulans sb117 showed varying individual but promising capabilities to survive in the gastrointestinal tract, to adhere, to produce antimicrobial compounds. these three selected species-specific bacteria demonstrated in vitro, both singularly and mixed, the functional properties needed for their use as potential probiotics in veal calves.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
