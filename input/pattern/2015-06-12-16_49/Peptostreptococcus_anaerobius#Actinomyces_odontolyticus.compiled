TI  - Antimicrobial properties of self-etching primer-bonding systems.
AB  - Self-etching primers are now considered the new generation of dentin bonding systems that modify and incorporate the bacteria-containing smear layer into their bonding mechanism. The antibacterial effects of the self-etching primers Clearfil SE Bond, Mac Bond, Imperva FL Bond, One-Up BondF and Prompt L-Pop were evaluated using the bacteria Streptococcus mutans ATCC25175, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus catenaforme, Lactobacillus jensenii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Clostridium ramosum, Prevotella oris, Prevotella denticola and Fusobacterium nucleatum, with a disk diffusion method. A single-bottle total-etch dentin adhesive (Excite) was used for comparisons and chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as the positive control. After incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed. One-Up BondF, Prompt L-Pop and Excite showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. The bonding agents of Clearfil SE Bond, Mac Bond and Imperva FL Bond were unable to inhibit the growth of Lactobacillus jensenii and Actinomyces odontolyticus, while the primers of these systems produced inhibition halos to all tested microorganisms greater than that of chlorhexidine.
TI  - Peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, mediastinitis, and nonclostridial anaerobic myonecrosis: a case report.
AB  - Peritonsillar abscess is a potentially life-threatening complication of acute tonsillitis. On occasion, peritonsillar abscess can extend to neck spaces and/or to the mediastinum. We describe a case of a patient with a peritonsillar abscess that extended to the neck, producing bilateral retropharyngeal abscesses and myonecrosis of the strap muscles. Culture of a specimen of the necrotic muscle yielded Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella buccae, Lactobacillus catenaforme, another Lactobacillus species, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and some nonanaerobes. Culture of the peritonsillar abscess yielded P. intermedia and P. buccae plus P. anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Bifidobacterium dentium, viridans and group F streptococci, and Citrobacter diversus. Culture of the retropharyngeal abscess yielded Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces odontolyticus in addition to most of the aforementioned organisms. The patient underwent repeated drainage and debridement procedures and was treated with various antimicrobial agents and ultimately recovered. This case highlights the polymicrobial nature of peritonsillar abscess and the serious complications that this infection may lead to.
