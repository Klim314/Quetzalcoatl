gassericin a: a circular bacteriocin produced by lactic acid bacteria lactobacillus gasseri.
during the recent years extensive efforts have been made to find out bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria (lab) active against various food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria, and superior stabilities against heat treatments and ph variations. bacteriocins isolated from lab have been grouped into four classes. circular bacteriocins which were earlier grouped among the four groups of bacteriocins, have recently been proposed to be classified into a different class, making it class v bacteriocins. circular bacteriocins are special molecules, whose precursors must be post translationally modified to join the n to c termini with a head-to-tail peptide bond. cyclization appears to make them less susceptible to proteolytic cleavage, high temperature and ph, and, therefore, provides enhanced stability as compared to linear bacteriocins. the advantages of circularization are also reflected by the fact that a significant number of macrocyclic natural products have found pharmaceutical applications. circular bacteriocins were unknown two decades ago, and even to date, only a few circular bacteriocins from a diverse group of gram positive organisms have been reported. the first example of a circular bacteriocin was enterocin as-48, produced by enterococcus faecalis as-48. gassereccin a, produced by lactobacillus gasseri la39, reutericin 6 produced by lactobacillus reuteri la6 and circularin a, produced by clostridium beijerinickii atcc 25,752, are further examples of this group of antimicrobial peptides. in the present scenario, gassericin a can be an important tool in the food preservation owing to its properties of high ph and temperature tolerance and the fact that it is produced by lab l. gasseri, whose many strains are proven probiotic.
bacteriocin production, antibiotic susceptibility and prevalence of haemolytic and gelatinase activity in faecal lactic acid bacteria isolated from healthy ethiopian infants.
the objective of this study was to characterise lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from faecal samples of healthy ethiopian infants, with emphasis on bacteriocin production and antibiotic susceptibility. one hundred fifty lab were obtained from 28 healthy ethiopian infants. the isolates belonged to lactobacillus (81/150), enterococcus (54/150) and streptococcus (15/150) genera. lactobacillus species were more abundant in the breast-fed infants while enterococcus dominated the mixed-fed population. bacteriocin-producing lab species were isolated from eight of the infants. many different bacteriocins were identified, including one new bacteriocin from streptococcus salivarius, avicin a (class iia) from enterococcus avium, one class iia bacteriocin from enterococcus faecalis strains, one unknown bacteriocin from e. faecalis and two unknown bacteriocins from lactobacillus fermentum strains and the two-peptide gassericin t from lactobacillus gasseri isolate. susceptibility tests performed for nine antibiotics suggest that some lactobacilli might have acquired resistance to erythromycin (3 %) and tetracycline (4 %) only. the streptococci were generally antibiotic sensitive except for penicillin, to which they showed intermediate resistance. all enterococci were susceptible to ampicillin while 13 % showed penicillin resistance. only one e. faecalis isolate was vancomycin-resistant. tetracycline (51 %) and erythromycin (26 %) resistance was prevalent among the enterococci, but multidrug resistance was confined to e. faecalis (47 %) and enterococcus faecium (33 %). screening of enterococcal virulence traits revealed that 2 % were beta-haemolytic. the structural genes of cytolysin were detected in 28 % of the isolates in five enterococcal species, the majority being e. faecalis and enterococcus raffinosus. this study shows that bacteriocin production and antibiotic resistance is a common trait of faecal lab of ethiopian infants while virulence factors occur at low levels.
the circular bacteriocins gassericin a and circularin a.
gassericin a, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus gasseri la39, shows antibacterial activity against a number of gram-positive food-borne pathogenic bacteria. circularin a produced by clostridium beijerinckii atcc25752 is active against c. tyrobutyricum, a known cheese-spoilage bacterium. both bacteriocins were purified to homogeneity from culture supernatants by reverse-phase chromatography and the subsequently determined amino acid sequences were used to clone the bacteriocin structural genes. mature gassericin a and circularin a are class v circular bacteriocins comprised of 58 and 69 amino acid residues, respectively. both bacteriocins are resistant to several peptidases and proteases, as are other cyclic bacteriocins. heterologous expression of gassericin a in escherichia coli was used to produce a non-cyclic mature peptide, which was shown to have a specific activity 173-fold lower than the circular molecule. the minimal region for production and secretion of active circularin a is comprised of five genes, as was deduced by heterologous gene expression in enterococcus faecalis. gassericin a and circularin a have limited mutual similarity in their primary sequences. unlike most bacteriocins, including gassericin a, circularin a has a three-amino-acid-leader sequence.
