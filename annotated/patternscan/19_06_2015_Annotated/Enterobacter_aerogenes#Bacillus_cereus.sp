TI  == antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities from jatropha dioica roots.
AB  == the antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of organic extracts obtained from roots of the medicinal plant jatropha dioica (euphorbiaceae) were investigated. in order to evaluate their antimicrobial activity, the organic extracts were tested against clinical isolates of the human pathogens bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella typhimurium, cryptococcus neoformans, candida albicans, candida parapsilosis and sporothrix schenckii. results revealed that the hexane extract possess the stronger activity and a broader microbicide spectrum compared to the acetone and ethanol extracts. the activity of hexane extract may be attributed in part to the presence of beta-sitosterol, the major compound identified by bioautography. the hexane extract, as well as the bioactive fraction were not cytotoxic when assays were profiled against the normal cell lines chang, ok and llcpk-1 (ic50>1000 mug ml(-1)).

TI  == effect of white mustard essential oil on the growth of foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms and the effect of food components on its efficacy.
AB  == antimicrobial preservative compounds are added to foods to target specific pathogens and spoilage organisms. white mustard essential oil (wmeo) is an extract that contains 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate, a compound which has been demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity in limited studies. the objective of  this research was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of wmeo against gram-positive and gram-negative spoilage and pathogenic bacteria and determine the effect of food components on the antimicrobial activity. the bacteria escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, enterobacter  aerogenes, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, and lactobacillus fermentum, as well as the acid- and preservative-resistant yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe, were evaluated. all microorganisms were inhibited by wmeo at 8.3 g/liter (equivalent to 1,000 mg/liter 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate). in general, wmeo was more effective against gram-negative than against gram-positive bacteria. salmonella enteritidis and s. pombe were the most sensitive, with inhibition at as low as 2.1 g/liter. the effects on growth profiles varied but included increased lag phases and lethality, indicating both  bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity. soybean oil had a negative effect on the efficacy of wmeo against l. monocytogenes, and at 5% soybean oil, the antimicrobial activity against salmonella enteritidis was eliminated after 48 h.  sodium caseinate at 1% also negated the antimicrobial effect of wmeo against salmonella enteritidis and decreased its effectiveness against l. monocytogenes.  the presence of starch had no significant effect on the antimicrobial activity of wmeo against l. monocytogenes and salmonella enteritidis. thus, wmeo is effective against a wide range of microorganisms and has potential to be used in foods, depending upon the target microorganism and food components present.

TI  == efficacy of commercial natural antimicrobials alone and in combinations against pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  == microbial control strategies are needed in the food industry to prevent foodborne illnesses and outbreaks and prolong product shelf life. the aim of this study was to investigate and compare the efficacy of the commercial natural antimicrobials  white mustard essential oil (wmeo), citrus flavonoid and acid blend (cfab), olive extract (oe), nisaplin (a compound containing nisin), and lauric arginate (lae) alone and in combinations against foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms. mics of individual and combined antimicrobials against escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, enterobacter aerogenes, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were determined at ph 6.0 and 25 degrees c. wmeo was most effective against b. cereus and s. aureus, with mics of 250 and 500 mg/liter, respectively. cfab inhibited all tested microorganisms, requiring only 12 to 35 mg/liter for gram-positive bacteria. for  oe, 2,000 mg/liter was needed to achieve microbial inhibition. nisaplin at 400 to 1,200 mg/liter inhibited only gram-positive bacteria. lae was effective at low concentrations and required only 20 to 50 mg/liter to inhibit all tested microorganisms. when wmeo was combined with other antimicrobials, the effects were usually additive except for wmeo plus nisaplin and wmeo+oe, which had synergistic activity against l. monocytogenes and salmonella enteritidis, respectively. an antagonistic effect was observed for wmeo+cfab against e. aerogenes. for wmeo+lae+cfab, additive antimicrobial effects were noted against all strains tested except s. aureus, where a synergistic effect occurred. these findings suggest that these commercial natural antimicrobials have potential to enhance food safety by inhibiting foodborne pathogens and extending product shelf life.

TI  == bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  == thirty one bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. using species-specific pcr  and 16s rrna gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as l. plantarum and l. fermentum, respectively. cluster analysis of rapd-pcr fingerprints revealed two main groups (g1 and g2) plus the l. fermentum isolate c4-13. group g1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (g1-1, g1-2) each with several branches, plus the l. plantarum isolate c11. group g2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. using pcr amplification with specific  primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in l. plantarum c11 were  identified in the isolates. the number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. the l. fermentum isolate ec11 also contained the plndefg genes. pcr  amplification of dna from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with dna from the control strain l. plantarum wcfs1. amplification  products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with hindiii, ecori and kpni in separate reactions. cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for ecori and hindii digest profiles, and an  identical profile for all kpni digests. the l. fermentum ec11 isolate clustered with l. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. the results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. however, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may  present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, enterobacter aerogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could  be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.

TI  == succession of dominant and antagonistic lactic acid bacteria in fermented cucumber: insights from a pcr-based approach.
AB  == the goal of the investigation was to study the succession of major groups of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and their antagonism in salt-fermented cucumber using  pcr. in a direct detection method as well as a short enrichment process, pcr enabled detection of leuconostoc and lactobacillus during early hours of fermentation. subsequently, lactobacillus and pediococcus emerged as the dominant genera. nucleic acid sequence of culture-independent clones confirmed the detection of pediococcus as a dominant genera emerging during late stages of fermentation. pcr also revealed time-dependent emergence of mesentericin, pediocin and plantaricin a producers and accounted for the lab succession in the  fermenting samples. a total of 328 lab isolates were obtained collectively from 30 cucumber samples, of which pcr could identify an overwhelming 186 lactobacillus isolates followed by 113 pediococcus and 29 leuconostoc isolates, respectively. based on antimicrobial assay against target strain leuconostoc mesenteroides nrrl b640, 28% of the lab were bacteriocin producers, of which pediocin producers were substantial, followed by plantaricin a and mesentericin producers. the bacteriocins elaborated by the isolates were active against a large number of gram-positive target lab strains and pathogenic bacteria including bacillus cereus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == differential activity of a lectin from solieria filiformis against human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == a lectin isolated from the red alga solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). the lectin (500 microg/ml) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus sp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/ml but the lectin (10-1000 microg/ml) had no effect on  the growth of the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and b. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. it is possible that the interaction of s. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium b. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml. the stimulation of the growth of b.  cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/ml), its hapten. thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. the present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

AB  == the recovery of bacteria and the speed of detection of microbial growth in platelet concentrates (pc) were studied, comparing a novel automated blood culture system (bact/alert) with two traditional methods. full-scale experiments  were performed with a total of 33 units of pc (average content 320 x 10(9) platelets per unit) obtained from pooled buffy coats. six strains known as possible pc contaminants were tested: s. epidermidis, s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, b. cereus, e. aerogenes, and s. sanguis. using an inoculum of 50-98 bacteria/ml,  bacterial contamination was detected in all of 11 pcs on 132 sampling occasions.  with a small inoculum (0.3-9 bacteria/ml), the bacterial contamination was detected in all pcs in which abundant growth appeared, but failed to be detected  in some instances where the bacterial content was very small. all of 11 uninoculated pc controls were negative. with the automated method the time for detection of a culture-positive pc was 6-16 h, clearly shorter than with the two  manual-visual systems. the new system provides a rapid, reliable, and labour-saving method for screening of bacterial contamination in pcs. this would  increase safety particularly if the present 5-day shelf life were extended.

TI  == the role of microorganisms in psoriasis.
AB  == the microflora of 297 psoriasis patients was extensively examined. throat, urine, and skin surfaces from scalp, ears, chest, face, axillary, submammary, umbilical, upper back, inguinal crease, gluteal-fold, perirectal, vaginal, pubis, penis, scrotal, leg, hands, feet, finger, and toenail areas were cultured for aerobic bacteria, yeast, and dermatophytes. antibody levels to streptococcal enzymes were performed (streptolysin-o, dnase-b, hyaluronidase, streptozyme). giemsa smears and koh preparations were also used to determine yeast and dermatophyte presence. associated organisms thought to provoke a psoriatic attack were as follows: streptococcal groups a, b, c, d, f, g, s viridans, s pneumoniae; klebsiella pneumoniae, oxytoca; escherichia coli; enterobacter cloacae, e aerogenes, e agglomerans; proteus mirabilis, p vulgaris; citrobacter freundii, c diversus; morganella morganii; pseudomonas aeruginosa, p maltiphilia, p putida; serratia marcescens; acinetobacter calbio aceticus, a luoffi; flavobacterium specie; cdc groups ve-1, ve-2, e-o2; bacillus subtilis, cereus; staphylococcus aureus; candida albicans, c parapsilosis; torulopsis, glabrata; rhodotorula and dermatophytes. one or more antistreptococal enzyme tests was positive in 50% of patients. titers to hepatitis e were elevated in one patient and to hiv in two patients.

TI  == microbiological quality and public health significance of ice-cream.
AB  == fifty samples of ice-cream were subjected to microbiological examination. of these 72% had total viable count over 10(6)/g while 66% had coliform count between 10(2)-10(3)/g. the micro-organisms isolated were escherichia coli (46%),  enterobacter aerogenes (34%), staphylococcus aureus (26%), proteus species (16%), streptococcus faecalis (12%), citrobacter species (10%) and bacillus cereus (4%). the results showed that commercially prepared ice-cream sold in the market was not satisfactory for human consumption and preventive measures should be enforced for the supply of satisfactory products.

TI  == a preliminary survey of aerobic bacteria in breast milk of mothers from the low-income group in nigeria.
AB  == the aerobic bacteria colonizing breast milk of the low-income group in nigeria were quantified to assess its suitability for use in milk banks. in parallel, the nutritional and health status of donating mothers and their infants were assessed by physicians. the aerobic bacteria contained in the specimens included streptococcus salivarius, bacillus cereus, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermides. in general, the microbial load found in these milk samples is lower than levels considered dangerous. an analysis of the results showed that 50% of the mother's milk is contaminated, 17% of which was infected with primary pathogens. there was no correlation between demographic data, nutritional or health status of either mother or infant and microbial load  in mother's milk. milk obtained from this socio-economic group, is therefore, considered safe for use in milk banks.

TI  == ceftazidime, a pseudomonas-active cephalosporin: in-vitro antimicrobial activity  evaluation including recommendations for disc diffusion susceptibility tests.
AB  == the in-vitro qualities of ceftazidime, as compared to other beta-lactams and three other antimicrobials (amikacin, gentamicin and chloramphenicol), were evaluated in a multilaboratory, multiphasic study in the united states. a total of 12,986 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference dilution methods in six medical centres over 45-60 days. ceftazidime was superior to the comparison cephalosporin (cefamandole) and comparable in spectrum and activity to gentamicin against enterobacteriaceae. of 8038 enteric bacilli tested, over 98% had ctaz mics < or = 8 mg/l with a mode of < or = 0.12 mg/l. only citrobacter freundii and enterobacter aerogenes had ceftazidime mic(90s) in the resistant range ( > or =32 mg/l). staphylococcus aureus strains were less susceptible to ceftazidime (mode mic 8 mg/l) compared to cefamandole or gentamicin. ceftazidime was more effective than cefamandole or gentamicin against the beta-haemolytic streptococci and the pneumococcus. more than 90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, most other pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by ceftazidime at concentrations of 8  mg/l. in other comparative studies ceftazidime was found remarkably similar in spectrum to cefotaxime, cefoperazone and moxalactam against the enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci and streptococcus spp. enterobacter cloacae was the only enteric species having ceftazidime mic90 >8 mg/l. only cefsulodin (mode  mic 2 mg/l) and cefoperazone (mode mic 4 mg/l) shared the ceftazidime activity against ps. aeruginosa. ceftazidime mic(50s) for neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were 0.03-0.06 and 0.015 mg/l, respectively. ceftazidime was found to be bactericidal against most strains at or one doubling dilution above the mic, and was relatively unaffected  by increasing inoculum concentration (some strain variations). it perfused readily into bacterial cells and was effective against the majority of strains resistant to currently available cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. beta-lactamases of types i-v and bacillus cereus failed to significantly hydrolyse ceftazidime. ceftazidime inhibited only type i ent. cloacae beta-lactamase hydrolysis. disc diffusion tests favour the use of a 30 microg ceftazidime disc for the methods described by the national committee clinical laboratory standards (nccls). quality control data are presented. tentative 30 microg disc interpretive criteria, based on susceptible mics of < or =8 mg/l(> 17 mm) and resistant > or =32 mg/l ( < or =13 mm), resulted in < 1% (false resistance or false susceptible) interpretive error rates. staph. aureus was the  species most commonly found to have strains with indeterminate ceftazidime zones  or mics. we found ceftazidime to possess one of the widest clinically usable antimicrobial spectrum by in-vitro testing of any beta-lactam tested and to be most comparable to broad-spectrum aminoglycosides such as amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin.

TI  == effect of ph on the antimicrobial activity of some triphenylmethane dyes.
AB  == four common dyes were tested as inhibitors of four types of bacteria over the ph  range 5.0-9.0. inhibition of the gram-negative types, salmonella anatum and enterobacter aerogenes, was markedly affected by the ph of the medium. these organisms tolerated concentrations of crystal violet and ethyl violet about 100-fold higher at ph 5.0 than at ph 9.0. above ph 7.0 brilliant green (bg) and malachite green (mg) were precipitated as their respective carbinols and lost their inhibitory properties with these two organisms. two gram-positive types, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus, were more sensitive to dyes and results were less affected by ph. the carbinol forms of mg and bg were nearly as  inhibitory to these organisms as the ionized forms.

TI  == [characterization by zymograms of r factor-determined beta-lactamases: plasmids of defined and undefined compatibility groups (author's transl)].
AB  == an easy biochemical method is described, discriminating the beta-lacta-mases coded by various r factors. electrophoretic mobility and substrate affinity of beta-lactamases were studied simultaneously for 7 different penicillins and cephalosporins. they are i like r factors assigned into different compatibility groups (n, p, com6, com7, com8, x and com 9), five r factors isolated from piglets faeces and one r factor, ru1, originated from enterobacter aerogenes. three electrophoretic types of beta-lactamases were determinated: 1) beta-lactamase which migrates towards the anode (enzyme coded by bacillus cereus  chromosome); 2) beta-lactamase of weak cathodic mobility (e. g. r6k); 3) beta-lactamase which migrates rapidly towards the cathode (e. g. r46, r71). escherichia coli k12 strains synthesize a penicillinase of this third type, destroying penicillin g. the enzymatic and physicochemical properties are not modified by host bacteria, suggesting the possibility to study the plasmid in wild bacteria.

TI  == dense growth of aerobic bacteria in a bench-scale fermentor.
AB  == escherichia coli b, escherichia coli mre 600, escherichia coli k 12-3300, pseudomonas fluorescens, and aerobacter aerogenes were grown exponentially in a bench-scale fermentor to cell concentrations in the range of 20 to 41 g dry cells/liter at 30 degrees c and 30 to 55 g dry cells/liter at 25 degrees c. the high cell concentrations were achieved in a growth system previously described for growth of escherichia coli w (biotechnol. bioeng., 16, 933 (1974); ibid. 17,  227 (1975)). various enzyme activity levels in the high-concentration cells were  compared to those in cells grown in conventional low-density cultures. no significant differences were found. the culture supernatants were found to be essentially free of high-molecular weight metabolic or cell lysis products. yield constants for glucose, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus were also determined in the dense cultures and some of their relations to the growth conditions are discussed.

TI  == thin-layer chromatographic technique for rapid detection of bacterial phospholipases.
AB  == silica gel thin-layer chromatography was employed to detect lecithinase activity  induced from bacterial resting cell preparations induced from bacterial resting cell preparations incubated at 37 c for 4 h in the presence of purified egg yolk  lecithin. bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa hydrolyzed lecithin with the formation of free fatty acids as the sole lipid-soluble product. in none of the escherichia coli and citrobacter freundii strains tested could lecithinase activity be detected. four  among eight strains of enterobacter aerogenes and one among 12 strains of proteus tested produced negligible amounts of free fatty acid.

TI  == analysis of bacterial biotin-proteins.
AB  == the biotin-protein populations in several bacterial strains were analyzed by solubilization of [3h]biotin-labeled cells with sodium dodecylsulfate followed by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels containing the detergent. a variety of patterns of biotin-labeled polypeptide chains was seen, ranging from a single biotin-protein in escherichia coli, corresponding to the biotin carboxyl carrier  protein component of acetyl-coa carboxylase, to multiple species in enterobacter  aerogenes, pseudomonas citronellolis, bacillus cereus, propionibacterium shermanii, lactobacillus plantarum, and mycobacterium phlei, which probably represent subunits of multiple biotin-dependent enzymes present in these organisms. in the case of pseudomonas citronellolis two major biotin-containing polypeptides with approximate molecular weights of 65 000 and 25 000 were shown to correspond to the biotin carboxyl carrier components of pyruvate carboxylase and acetyl-coa carboxylase, respectively. thus in the case of pseudomonas citronellolis two different biotin-dependent enzymes in the same cell do not share common biotin carboxyl carrier subunits.

TI  == rapid and sensitive detection of bacteria by gas chromatography.
AB  == a gas chromatograph fitted with electron capture and flame ionization detectors was employed for the rapid detection of bacteria by analysis for their metabolic  products. the presence of proteus vulgaris, streptococcus faecalis, s. liquefaciens, escherichia coli b, bacillus cereus, and b. popilliae was detected  in 2 to 4 hr in media inoculated with less than 10(4) cells per ml, whereas a 7-  to 12-hr growth period was required for the detection of products formed in cultures of serratia marcescens, aerobacter aerogenes, e. coli k-12, staphylococcus aureus, and salmonella typhimurium. metabolites elaborated by the  equivalent of less than a single cell of b. cereus, s. faecalis, p. vulgaris, or  e. coli b were sensed by the electron capture detector. the flame ionization detector was generally not as sensitive. volatile metabolites were identified, and their concentrations were determined.

TI  == effects in hyperoxia upon microorganisms. i. membrane culture technique for exposing cells directly to test atmospheres.
AB  == a membrane culture technique was developed for directly exposing microorganisms to test atmospheres. inhibition and killing were calculated from comparisons with air-grown cultures. direct colony counts were used with low inocula. with mass inocula, plate colony counts and optical-density measurements were made on resuspended filter populations. bacteria, including escherichia coli, were more sensitive to oxygen than previously reported. with inocula of a few hundred cells per membrane, five of seven species failed to produce colonies while exposed to oxygen at one atmosphere. upon reincubation in air, the survival of five species  ranged from near 0 to 12% of the cells. aerobacter aerogenes was neither inhibited nor killed. with this technique, bacteria are in direct contact with the test atmosphere and cells which survive are detected but do not obscure the response of other cells in the population.

TI  == the purification and properties of a penicillinase whose synthesis is mediated by an r-factor in escherichia coli.
AB  == 1. the penicillinase (beta-lactamase) from escherichia coli strain tem has been purified and its activity against a range of penicillin and cephalosporin derivatives measured. 2. the enzyme shows little resemblance to penicillinases from bacillus cereus, bacillus licheniformis and staphylococcus aureus. 3. the molecular weight of the enzyme is 16700+/-5%, which is about half the value obtained for other penicillinases. 4. the enzyme is most similar in properties to a crude preparation of a penicillinase from klebsiella (aerobacter) aerogenes, but clearly different from crude enzyme preparations from other strains of e. coli. 5. since penicillinase synthesis in e. coli strain tem is mediated by an r-factor known to infect many other species of enterobacteriaceae, the appearance of similar enzymes in other gramnegative species is not surprising.

TI  == repression of staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria. ii. causes of inhibition.
AB  == two food bacteria, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas sp. cs-1, inhibited an enterotoxigenic strain of staphylococcus aureus, apparently by out-competing it for nutrients. five others, bacillus cereus, proteus vulgaris, escherichia coli h-52, aerobacter aerogenes, and achromobacter sp., inhibited by means of antibiotic substances which were seitz-filterable, dialyzable, and stable at 90 c for 10 min. inhibition was not caused by changes in ph, oxidation-reduction potential, or production of peroxide or fatty acids. the concentrated antibiotic  material from e. coli h-52 contained amino acids but not peptides and was especially effective against staphylococci and micrococci.

TI  == repression of staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria. i. effect of environmental  factors on inhibition.
AB  == the effects of environmental factors on the inhibition of an enterotoxin-producing strain of staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria were investigated. type of medium and temperature of incubation were important factors in determining the amount of inhibition. the ph range of maximal inhibition was found to be 7.4 to 6.2. availability of oxygen was not a factor. as the ratios of inhibitor to staphylococcus were increased from 1:1 to 10:1 and 100:1, the amount of inhibition was markedly increased. inhibition occurred in custard, where it increased with increasing ratios of effector to staphylococcus. the repression of the staphylococcus in all media usually was sufficient to be of practical significance.
