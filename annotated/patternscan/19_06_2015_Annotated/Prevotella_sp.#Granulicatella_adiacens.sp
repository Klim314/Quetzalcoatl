TI  == oral microbiota shift after 12-week supplementation with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289; a randomized control trial.
AB  == background: lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. methods and findings: oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna hypervariable region v3-v4 after 12 weeks of daily lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289 consumption. forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 cfu of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). presence of l. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific pcr. tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. a total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. after removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the human oral microbiome database. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. streptococcus was the most common genus and the s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group comprised the dominant species. the number of observed species was unaffected by l. reuteri exposure. however, subjects who had consumed l. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and pcr detected l. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. l. reuteri intake correlated with increased s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group and campylobacter concisus, granulicatella adiacens, bergeyella sp. hot322, neisseria subflava, and sr1 [g-1] sp. hot874 detection and reduced s. mutans, s. anginosus, n. mucosa, fusobacterium periodicum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, and prevotella maculosa detection. this effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. conclusions: l. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. the biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02311218.

TI  == salivary microbiota associated with immunoglobulin a nephropathy.
AB  == this study aimed at investigating the salivary microbiota of 28 patients affected by immunoglobulin a nephropathy (igan). fourteen healthy volunteers (hc) were used as control. compared to hc, the number of some cultivable bacteria groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in the salivary samples of igan patients. total bacteria from salivary samples of igan patients and hc subjects were analyzed by pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene. paired t test showed no significant (p > 0.05) differences of alpha-diversity parameters (otu,  ace, chao1, and shannon index) between the salivary samples of hc and igan patients. the difference for the community structure was further analyzed using three phylogeny-based beta-diversity measures. compared to hc, the ratio between  firmicutes/proteobacteria markedly decreased in igan patients. gemella haemolysins, granulicatella adiacens, and veillonella parvula were positively associated (p < 0.05) with hc. within the phylum bacteroidetes, prevotella species (prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, prevotella pallens, and prevotella salivae) were the highest in hc. the only exception was for prevotella aurantiaca. compared to hc, the percentage of abundance of some species, belonging to pasteurellaceae family (e.g., haemophylus parainfluenzae), increased in igan patients. fusobacteriaceae (fusobacterium) and corynebacterium sp. also differed between the salivary samples of hc and igan patients.

TI  == microbial signature profiles of periodontally healthy and diseased patients.
AB  == aim: to determine microbial profiles that discriminate periodontal health from different forms of periodontal diseases. methods: subgingival biofilm was obtained from patients with periodontal health (27), gingivitis (11), chronic periodontitis (35) and aggressive periodontitis (24), and analysed for the presence of >250 species/phylotypes using homim. microbial differences among groups were examined by mann-whitney u-test. regression analyses were performed to determine microbial risk indicators of disease. results: putative and potential new periodontal pathogens were more prevalent in subjects with periodontal diseases than periodontal health. detection of porphyromonas endodontalis/porphyromonas spp. (or 9.5 [1.2-73.1]) and tannerella forsythia (or  38.2 [3.2-450.6]), and absence of neisseria polysaccharea (or 0.004 [0-0.15]) and prevotella denticola (or 0.014 [0-0.49], p < 0.05) were risk indicators of periodontal disease. presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (or 29.4 [3.4-176.5]), cardiobacterium hominis (or 14.9 [2.3-98.7]), peptostreptococcaceae sp. (or 35.9 [2.7-483.9]), p. alactolyticus (or 31.3 [2.1-477.2]), and absence of fretibacterium spp. (or 0.024 [0.002-0.357]), fusobacterium naviforme/fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii (or 0.015 [0.001-0.223]), granulicatella adiacens/granulicatella elegans (or 0.013 [0.001-0.233], p < 0.05) were associated with aggressive periodontitis. conclusion: there were specific microbial signatures of the subgingival biofilm that were able to distinguish between microbiomes of periodontal health and diseases. such profiles may be used to establish risk of disease.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.
