TI  == antimicrobial activity of brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of three brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. the extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. the propolis extracts inhibited the growth of fibrobacter succinogenes s85, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1, ruminococcus albus  7, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens d1, prevotella albensis m384, peptostreptococcus sp. d1, clostridium aminophilum f and streptococcus bovis pearl11, while r. albus 20, prevotella bryantii b(1)4 and ruminobacter amylophilus h18 were resistant to all  the extracts. the inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (c. aminophilum f and peptostreptococcus sp. d1) being the most sensitive. inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. the extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (llos c3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. the major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and artepillin c) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains.  only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.

TI  == effects of disodium fumarate on ruminal fermentation and microbial communities in sheep fed on high-forage diets.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate effects of disodium fumarate (df) on fermentation characteristics and microbial populations in the rumen of hu sheep fed on high-forage diets. two complementary feeding trials were conducted. in trial 1, six hu sheep fitted with ruminal cannulae were randomly allocated to a 2 x 2 cross-over design involving dietary treatments of either 0 or 20 g df daily.  total dna was extracted from the fluid- and solid-associated rumen microbes, respectively. numbers of 16s rdna gene copies associated with rumen methanogens and bacteria, and 18s rdna gene copies associated with rumen protozoa and fungi were measured using real-time pcr, and expressed as proportion of total rumen bacteria 16s rdna. ruminal ph decreased in the df group compared with the control (p < 0.05). total volatile fatty acids increased (p < 0.001), but butyrate decreased (p < 0.01). addition of df inhibited the growth of methanogens, protozoa, fungi and ruminococcus flavefaciens in fluid samples. both ruminococcus albus and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens populations increased (p < 0.001) in particle-associated samples. trial 2 was conducted to investigate the adaptive response of rumen microbes to df. three cannulated sheep were fed on basal diet for 2 weeks and continuously for 4 weeks with supplementation of df at a level of 20 g/day. ruminal samples were collected every week to analyze fermentation parameters and microbial populations. no effects of df were observed on ph, acetate and butyrate (p > 0.05). populations of methanogens and r. flavefaciens decreased in the fluid samples (p < 0.001), whereas addition of df stimulated the population of solid-associated fibrobacter succinogenes. population of r. albus increased in the 2nd to 4th week in fluid-associated samples and was threefold higher in the 4th week than control week in solid samples. analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprints revealed that there were significant changes in rumen microbiota after adding df. ten of 15 clone sequences from cut-out bands appearing in both the 2nd and the 4th week were 94% to 100% similar to prevotella-like bacteria, and four sequences showed 95% to 98% similarity to selenomonas dianae. another 15 sequences were obtained from bands, which appeared in the 4th week only. thirteen of these 15 sequences showed 95% to 99% similarity to clostridium sp., and the other two showed 95% and 100% similarity to ruminococcus sp. in summary, the microorganisms positively responding to df addition were the cellulolytic bacteria, r. albus, f. succinogenes and b. fibrisolvens as well as proteolytic bacteria, b. fibrisolvens, p. ruminicola and  clostridium sp.

TI  == molecular diversity of the foregut bacteria community in the dromedary camel (camelus dromedarius).
AB  == the molecular diversity of the foregut bacterial community in the dromedary camel (camelus dromedarius) in central australia was investigated through comparative analyses of 16s rrna gene sequences prepared from the foregut contents of 12 adult feral camels fed on native vegetation. a total of 267 full-length 16s rrna  gene clones were examined, with 151 operational taxonomic units (otus) identified at a 99% species-level identity cut-off criterion. the prediction of actual diversity in the foregut of the dromedary camel using the chaol approach was 238  otus, while the richness and evenness of the diversity estimated using shannon index was 4.84. the majority of bacteria in the current study were affiliated with the bacterial phylum firmicutes (67% of total clones) and were related to the classes clostridia, bacilli and mollicutes, followed by the bacteroidetes (25%) that were mostly represented by the family prevotellaceae. the remaining phyla were represented by actinobacteria, chloroflexi, cynophyta, lentisphaerae,  planctomycetes, proteobacteria and sphirochaetes. moreover, 11 clones of cultivated bacteria were identified as brevundimonas sp., butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, prevotella sp. and ruminococcus flavefaciens. the novelty in this foregut environment is remarkable where 97% of the otus were distantly related to any known sequence in the public database.

TI  == dominant bacterial communities in the rumen of gayals (bos frontalis), yaks (bos  grunniens) and yunnan yellow cattle (bos taurs) revealed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the dominant rumen bacteria in gayals, yaks and yunnan yellow cattle were investigated using pcr-dgge approach. the analysis of dgge profiles, identification of dominant bands and phylogenetic analysis 16s rdna sequences in  dgge profiles were combined to reveal the dominant bacterial communities and compared the differences between those cattle species. dgge profiles revealed that gayals had the most abundant dominant bacteria and the lowest similarity of  intraspecies between individuals than other two cattle species. a total of 45 sequences were examined and sequence similarity analysis revealed that gayals had the most sequences appeared to uncultured bacteria, accounting for 85.0% of the total sequences, yaks and yunnan yellow cattle had 44.4 and 68.8% uncultured bacterial sequences, respectively. according to phylogenetic analysis, the rumen  dominant bacteria of gayals were mainly phylogenetically placed within phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes, and the known bacteria were mainly belonged to the  genera lachnospiraceae bacterium, ruminococcus flavefaciens and clostridium celerecrescens. moreover, the dominant bacteria of yaks were also mainly belonged to phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes, and the known dominant bacteria were including ruminococcus flavefaciens, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, schwartzia succinivorans and clostridiales bacterium, most of them are common rumen bacteria. in addition, the dominant bacteria in yunnan yellow cattle were belonged to phyla firmicutes, bacteroidetes and actinobacteria, and the known dominant bacteria containing prevotella sp., staphylococci lentus, staphylococcus xylosus and corynebacterium casei. present study first detected staphylococcus lentus and staphylococcus xylosus in the rumen of cattle.

TI  == detection and identification of rumen bacteria constituting a fibrolytic consortium dominated by fibrobacter succinogenes.
AB  == a fibrolytic consortium, dominated by the rumen cellulolytic bacterium fibrobacter succinogenes, was artificially constructed on hay stems to detect and identify rumen bacteria that can potentially interact with f. succinogenes. consortium-bacterial members were determined by dgge and sequencing analysis targeted bacterial 16s rdna. an artificial consortium was formed in a 2-step incubation of hay stems; the first step with group 1, 2 or 3 f. succinogenes strains, the second step with rumen fluid. after consortium formation, morphologically different bacteria were observed in association with f. succinogenes. dgge exhibited more than 30 bands, the pattern of which depended on the f. succinogenes group. sequencing suggested that butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, clostridium sp., f. succinogenes group 2, prevotella  ruminicola and unclassified bacteroides were prominent in the group 1 consortium  and that treponema bryantii, b. fibrisolvens, acinetobacter sp, and wolinella succinogenes were prominent in the group 2 consortium. however, in the group 3 consortium, f. succinogenes-like bacteria were microscopically undetectable, whereas cellulolytic ruminococcus albus and f. succinogenes group 1 were prominent, suggesting that the group 3 cannot be a core member of this consortium. this study is the first attempt to identify bacterial members of a fibrolytic consortium dominated by a specific bacterium.

TI  == expression and export of a ruminococcus albus cellulase in butyrivibrio fibrisolvens through the use of an alternative gene promoter and signal sequence.
AB  == ruminococcal cellulase (ruminococcus albus f-40 endoglucanase egi) was successfully expressed in butyrivibrio fibrisolvens ob156c, using the erm promoter from pambeta1. a newly identified signal peptide coding region of xyna from b. fibrisolvens 49 allowed efficient translocation of the foreign egi into the extracellular fraction. first, b. fibrisolvens xyna with or without its own putative signal peptide (xyna sp) coding region was cloned into a shuttle vector  to transform b. fibrisolvens ob156c. both plasmids caused a 2- to 2.4-fold increase in xylanase activity. the transformant expressing xyna with the signal peptide showed a significantly higher proportion of activity in the extracellular fraction than the transformant with xyna lacking the signal peptide (75% vs. 19%), demonstrating the significance of xyna sp in the translocation of the expressed enzyme. second, using the xyna sp coding region, secretion of egi was attempted in b. fibrisolvens. since the signal peptide of r. albus egi did not function in b. fibrisolvens, it was replaced with the xyna sp. a high activity variant of egi containing the xyna sp was transcribed using the erm promoter, resulting in a 27-fold increase in endoglucanase activity, most of which (>93%) was in the extracellular fraction of the b. fibrisolvens transformant. egi without the xyna sp was scarcely detected in the extracellular fraction (<10%).

TI  == fermentation of isolated pectin and pectin from intact forages by pure cultures of rumen bacteria.
AB  == studies on the rate and extent of galacturonic acid and isolated pectin digestion were carried out with nine strains of rumen bacteria (butyrivibrio fibrisolvens h10b and d16f, bacteroides ruminicola 23 and d31d, lachnospira multiparus d15d, peptostreptococcus sp. d43e, b. succinogenes a3c, ruminococcus flavefaciens b34b, and r. albus 7). only three strains, 23, d16f, and d31d, utilized galacturonic acid as a sole energy source, whereas all strains except a3c and h10b degraded (solubilized) and utilized purified pectin. nutrient composition of the basal medium and separate sterilization of the substrate affected the rate and extent of fermentation for both substrates. pectin degradation and utilization were measured with two maturity stages each of intact bromegrass and alfalfa. for bromegrass i, all strains tested (b34b, 23, d16f, d31d, d15d, and d43e) degraded  a considerable amount of pectin and, with the exception of b34b, utilized most of what was degraded. similar, but lower, results were obtained with bromegrass ii,  except for the two strains of b. ruminicola, 23 and d31d, which were unable to degrade and utilize pectin from this forage. all strains were able to degrade and utilize pectin from both maturity stages of alfalfa; however, values were considerably lower for strains 23 and d31d. synergism studies, in which a limited utilizing strain, b34b, was combined with the limited degrading strain, d31d, resulted in a slight increase in degradation and a very marked increase in utilization of the pectin in all four forages. similar results were obtained on both alfalfa substrates with a combination of strains b34b and d16f; however, no  increases were observed with this combination on bromegrass.
