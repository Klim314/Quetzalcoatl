antimicrobial susceptibility of escherichia coli f4, pasteurella multocida, and streptococcus suis isolates from a diagnostic veterinary laboratory and recommendations for a surveillance system.
antimicrobial susceptibility data on escherichia coli f4, pasteurella multocida,  and streptococcus suis isolates from ontario swine (january 1998 to october 2010) were acquired from a comprehensive diagnostic veterinary laboratory in ontario, canada. in relation to the possible development of a surveillance system for antimicrobial resistance, data were assessed for ease of management, completeness, consistency, and applicability for temporal and spatial statistical analyses. limited farm location data precluded spatial analyses and missing demographic data limited their use as predictors within multivariable statistical models. changes in the standard panel of antimicrobials used for susceptibility testing reduced the number of antimicrobials available for temporal analyses. data consistency and quality could improve over time in this and similar diagnostic laboratory settings by encouraging complete reporting with sample submission and by modifying database systems to limit free-text data entry. these changes could make more statistical methods available for disease surveillance and cluster detection.
adhesion of bacterial pathogens to soil colloidal particles: influences of cell type, natural organic matter, and solution chemistry.
bacterial adhesion to granular soil particles is well studied; however, pathogen  interactions with naturally occurring colloidal particles (<2 mum) in soil has not been investigated. this study was developed to identify the interaction mechanisms between model bacterial pathogens and soil colloids as a function of cell type, natural organic matter (nom), and solution chemistry. specifically, batch adhesion experiments were conducted using nom-present, nom-stripped soil colloids, streptococcus suis sc05 and escherichia coli wh09 over a wide range of solution ph (4.0-9.0) and ionic strength (is, 1-100 mm kcl). cell characterization techniques, freundlich isotherm, and derjaguin-landau-verwey-overbeek (dlvo) theory (sphere-sphere model) were utilized to quantitatively determine the interactions between cells and colloids. the adhesion coefficients (kf) of s. suis sc05 to nom-present and nom-stripped soil colloids were significantly higher than e. coli wh09, respectively. similarly, kf values of s. suis sc05 and e. coli wh09 adhesion to nom-stripped soil colloids were greater than those colloids with nom-present, respectively, suggesting nom inhibits bacterial adhesion. cell adhesion to soil colloids declined with increasing ph and enhanced with rising is (1-50 mm). interaction energy calculations indicate these adhesion trends can be explained by dlvo-type forces, with s. suis sc05 and e. coli wh09 being weakly adhered in shallow secondary energy minima via polymer bridging and charge heterogeneity. s. suis sc05 adhesion decreased at higher is 100 mm, which is attributed to the change of hydrophobic effect and steric repulsion resulted from the greater presence of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) on s. suis sc05 surface as compared to e. coli wh09. hence, pathogen adhesion to the colloidal material is determined by a combination of dlvo, charge heterogeneity, hydrophobic and polymer interactions as a function of solution chemistry.
multiple-class antimicrobial resistance surveillance in swine escherichia coli f4, pasteurella multocida and streptococcus suis isolates from ontario and the impact of the 2004-2006 porcine circovirus type-2 associated disease outbreak.
the objective of this work was to describe trends in multiple-class antimicrobial resistance present in clinical isolates of escherichia coli f4, pasteurella multocida and streptococcus suis from ontario swine 1998-2010. temporal changes in multiple-class resistance varied by the pathogens examined; significant yearly changes were apparent for the e. coli and p. multocida data. although not present in the e. coli data, significant increases in multiple-class resistance within p. multocida isolates occurred from 2003 to 2005, coinciding with the expected increase in antimicrobials used to treat clinical signs of porcine circovirus associated disease (pcvad) before it was confirmed. prospective temporal scan statistics for multiple-class resistance suggest that significant clusters of increased resistance may have been found in the spring of 2004; months before the identification of the pcvad outbreak in the fall of 2004.
zinc as an agent for the prevention of biofilm formation by pathogenic bacteria.
aims: biofilm formation is important for the persistence of bacteria in hostile environments. bacteria in a biofilm are usually more resistant to antibiotics and disinfectants than planktonic bacteria. our laboratory previously reported that low concentrations of zinc inhibit biofilm formation of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of zinc on growth and biofilm formation of other bacterial swine pathogens. methods and results: to determine the effect of zinc on biofilm formation, biofilms were grown with or without zinc in 96-well plates and stained with crystal violet. at micromolar concentrations (0-250 mu mol l(-1)), zinc weakly inhibited bacterial growth and it effectively blocked biofilm formation by a. pleuropneumoniae, salmonella typhymurium and haemophilus parasuis in a dose-dependent manner. additionally, biofilm formation of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus suis was slightly inhibited by zinc. however, zinc did not disperse preformed biofilms. to determine whether zinc inhibits biofilm formation when poly-n-acetylglucosamine (pga) is present, pga was detected with the lectin wheat germ agglutinin. only a. pleuropneumoniae and staph. aureus biofilms were found to contain pga. conclusion: zinc used at nonbactericidal concentrations can inhibit biofilm formation by several gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial swine pathogens. significance and impact of study: the antibiofilm activity of zinc could provide a tool to fight biofilms, and the nonspecific inhibitory effect may well extend to other important human and animal bacterial pathogens.
characterization and determination of holin protein of streptococcus suis bacteriophage smp in heterologous host.
background: holins are a group of phage-encoded membrane proteins that control access of phage-encoded endolysins to the peptidoglycan, and thereby trigger the lysis process at a precise time point as the 'lysis clock'. smp is an isolated and characterized streptococcus suis lytic phage. the aims of this study were to determine the holin gene, holsmp, in the genome of smp, and characterized the function of holin, holsmp, in phage infection. results: holsmp was predicted to encode a small membrane protein with three hydrophobic transmembrane helices. during smp infections, holsmp was transcribed as a late gene and holsmp accumulated harmlessly in the cell membrane before host cell lysis. expression of holsmp in escherichia coli induced an increase in cytoplasmic membrane permeability, an inhibition of host cell growth and significant cell lysis in the presence of lysmp, the endolysin of phage smp. holsmp was prematurely triggered by the addition of energy poison to the medium. holsmp complemented the defective lambda s allele in a non-suppressing escherichia coli strain to produce phage plaques. conclusions: our results suggest that holsmp is the holin protein of phage smp and a two-step lysis system exists in smp.
bacterial carbonic anhydrases as drug targets: toward novel antibiotics?
carbonic anhydrases (cas, ec 4.2.1.1) are metalloenzymes which catalyze the hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons. many pathogenic bacteria encode such enzymes belonging to the alpha-, beta-, and/or gamma-ca families. in the last decade, the alpha-cas from neisseria spp. and helicobacter pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from escherichia coli, h. pylori,mycobacterium tuberculosis, brucella spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, and haemophilus influenzae have been cloned and characterized in detail. for some of these enzymes the x-ray crystal structures were determined, and in vitro and in vivo inhibition studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates reported. although efficient inhibitors have been reported for many such enzymes, only for neisseria spp., h. pylori, b. suis, and s. pneumoniae enzymes it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. thus, bacterial cas represent promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.
bactericidal activity of porcine neutrophil secretions.
antimicrobial proteins in neutrophil granules exert their bactericidal activity both within the neutrophil phagolysosome and as components of neutrophil extracellular traps. this study evaluated the bactericidal activity of porcine neutrophil secretions against four bacterial pathogens of swine. porcine neutrophils were treated with or without phorbol myristate acetate (pma), then the resulting supernatants were incubated with escherichia coli k-12, streptococcus suis, actinobacillus suis, or pasteurella multocida, and the surviving colony forming units were enumerated. supernatants of pma-activated neutrophils killed an average of 95% of e. coli k-12 cells, relative to supernatants from untreated neutrophils. inhibition of elastase activity using chloromethylketone (cmk) prior to pma stimulation significantly reduced the bactericidal activity of the neutrophil supernatants; 57% of the pma-induced bactericidal activity against e. coli k-12 was estimated to be elastase-dependent. the same neutrophil supernatants had lower bactericidal activity against s. suis, a. suis, and p. multocida, with 30%, 36% and 13% reduction in bacterial numbers, respectively. the cathelicidin porcine myeloid antimicrobial peptide (pmap)-36 and lactotransferrin were among the proteins identified in the supernatants of pma-stimulated neutrophils by mass spectrometry. these findings imply that elastase-activated proteins, such as cathelicidins, are partially responsible for the bactericidal effect of porcine neutrophil secretions, but non-elastase-dependent proteins such as lactoferrin may also contribute. further, the secretions of activated neutrophils were effective in killing the avirulent e. coli k-12 but were less effective against the other bacteria tested, suggesting that these pathogens may have evolved mechanisms to resist neutrophil-mediated killing.
additions of killed whole cell bacteria preparations to freund complete adjuvant  alter laying hen antibody response to soluble protein antigen.
passive transfer of antibodies from hen to egg has value to both the producer of  commercial polyclonal egg antibody and the producer of hatching eggs. water-in-oil emulsions are commonly amended with immune stimulants such as mycobacteria (e.g., freund complete adjuvant; fca) to increase antibody production to soluble protein antigens (spa). recent discoveries of the mechanisms by which microbial products act as adjuvants led us to hypothesize that additions of killed whole cell bacteria (bacterins) to fca could improve antibody responses to spa. all injections used in each experiment were water-in-oil emulsions (50:50) containing 3 mg/ml of phospholipase a(2) (pla(2)) immunogen. additionally, all primary control and treatment injections contained heat-killed mycobacterium butyricum immunogens from fca. in addition to pla(2) and fca, primary treatment injections contained various microbial bacterin immunogens. hence, the experimental treatment of all experiments was addition of a commercial source of microbial bacterin to fca for the primary injection only. booster injections were the same as the primary control injections except freund incomplete adjuvant replaced fca. anti-body titers to pla(2) in yolk were determined by elisa. bacterins tested as additives to fca were escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus suis, and corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. escherichia coli bacterin added to fca decreased egg yolk antibody titer to spa by 23% in hens of different ages and strains (p < 0.0001). in a second experiment, a 51% decrease in antibody production associated with e. coli bacterin was sustained for several weeks after the primary immunization (p = 0.003). staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus suis combined with fca increased egg yolk antibody 62 and 51%, respectively (p < 0.05), and corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis had no effect. in conclusion, the addition of bacterin to fca can influence hen antibody response to spa as measured in egg yolks. it is hypothesized that the difference in antibody production may be related to the composition of various pathogen associated molecular patterns in the primary injection.
expression and characterization of recombinant gallinacin-9 and gallinacin-8 in escherichia coli.
gallinacins (gal) are antimicrobial peptides that play significant roles in innate immunity in chickens. two gal genes--gal-8 and gal-9--were cloned and sequenced from chicken liver and tongue, respectively, by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). in addition, the mrna expression of these genes has been demonstrated across a panel of chicken tissues. it was demonstrated that gal-9 mrna was highly expressed in the tongue and small intestine and moderately expressed in the chicken proventriculus, lung, liver, heart, spleen, and thymus. however, gal-8 mrna was highly expressed in the chick small intestine and liver, and moderately expressed in the chick tongue, and lung. the recombinant fusion proteins containing gal-9 or gal-9 and gal-8, namely rgal-9 and rgal-9-gal-8, were produced and purified, respectively. both rgal-9 and rgal-9-gal-8 were expressed as insoluble bodies and exhibited the expected antimicrobial activity against escherichia coli and pathogenic streptococci suis cab strain, as determined by the measurement of the inhibition zone and a liquid growth inhibition assay.
inhibition of p-fimbriated escherichia coli adhesion by multivalent galabiose derivatives studied by a live-bacteria application of surface plasmon resonance.
objectives: uropathogenic p-fimbriated escherichia coli adheres to host cells by  specific adhesins recognizing galabiose (galalpha1-4gal)-containing structures on cell surfaces. in search of agents inhibiting this first step of infection, the inhibition potency of a set of synthetic mono- and multivalent galabiose compounds was evaluated. in order to mimic the flow conditions of natural infections, a live-bacteria application of surface plasmon resonance (spr) was established. methods and results: for the measurement of the binding of e. coli to a surface containing galabiose, live bacteria were injected over the flow cell, and the inhibition of adhesion caused by the galabiose inhibitors was recorded. quantitative binding data were recorded in real-time for each inhibitor. the results were compared with those of conventional static haemagglutination and elisa-based cell adhesion assays. compared with the gram-positive streptococcus suis bacteria, which also bind to galabiose and whose binding inhibition is strongly dependent on the multivalency of the inhibitor, e. coli inhibition was only moderately affected by the valency. however, a novel octavalent compound was found to be the most effective inhibitor of e. coli papg(j96) adhesion, with an ic50 value of 2 microm. conclusions: measurement of bacterial adhesion by spr is an efficient way to characterize the adhesion of whole bacterial cells and allows the characterization of the inhibitory potency of adhesion inhibitors under dynamic flow conditions. under these conditions, multivalency increases the anti-adhesion potency of galabiose-based inhibitors of p-fimbriated e. coli adhesion and provides a promising approach for the design of high-affinity anti-adhesion agents.
species selectivity of new siderophore-drug conjugates that use specific iron uptake for entry into bacteria.
siderophores selectively bind ferric iron and are involved in receptor-specific iron transport into bacteria. several types of siderophores were synthesized, and growth-promoting or inhibitory activities when they were conjugated to carbacephalosporin, erythromycylamine, or nalidixic acid were investigated. overall, 11 types of siderophores and 21 drug conjugates were tested against seven different bacterial species: escherichia coli, bordetella bronchiseptica, pasteurella multocida, pasteurella haemolytica, streptococcus suis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. in some species, the inhibitory activities of the drug conjugates were associated with the ability of the bacteria to use the siderophore portion of the molecules for growth promotion in disc diffusion tests (0.04 mumol of conjugate or siderophore per disc). e. coli used catechol-based siderophore portions as well as hydroxamate-based tri-delta-oh-n-oh-delta-n-acetyl-l-ornithine ferric iron ligands for growth under iron-restricted conditions achieved by supplemental ethylenediamine di (o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) (100 micrograms/ml) and was sensitive to carbacephalosporin conjugated to these siderophore types (up to a 34-mm-diameter inhibition zone). b. bronchiseptica used desferrioxamine b and an isocyanurate-based or trihydroxamate in addition to catechol-based siderophore portions for promotion but was not inhibited by beta-lactam conjugates partly because of the presence of beta-lactamase. p. multocida and p. haemolytica did not use any of the synthetic siderophores for growth promotion, and the inhibitory activities of some conjugates seemed partly linked to their ability to withhold iron from these bacteria, since individual siderophore portions showed some antibacterial effects. individual siderophores did not promote s. suis growth in restrictive conditions, but the type of ferric iron ligands attached to beta-lactams affected inhibitory activities. the antibacterial activities of the intracellular-acting agents erythromycylamine and nalidixic acid were reduced or lost, even against s. aureus and s. epidermidis, when the agents were conjugated to siderophores. conjugate-resistant e. coli mutants showed the absence of some iron-regulated outer membrane proteins in gel electrophoresis profiles and in specific phage or colicin sensitivity tests, implying that the drugs used outer membrane receptors of ferric complexes to get into cells.
interpretive criteria for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of ceftiofur against bacteria associated with swine respiratory disease.
ceftiofur, an extended-spectrum cephalosporin, is active against a variety of animal pathogens, including organisms associated with swine respiratory disease. however, minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoint and disk diffusion interpretive criteria have not been established for swine pathogens. susceptibility tests were performed by broth microdilution mic and disk diffusion methods on 246 bacterial species that cause swine respiratory disease. ceftiofur was active against salmonella sp., pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, streptococcus suis, and escherichia coli but was not active against bordetella bronchiseptica measured by mic. based on pharmacokinetic studies of ceftiofur in swine after a single intramuscular injection of 3 or 5 mg/kg body weight of ceftiofur and on the mic and disk diffusion data, we recommend mic breakpoints and disk diffusion distances, respectively, of < or = 2 micrograms/ml and > or = 21 mm for susceptible, 4 micrograms/ml and 18-20 mm for intermediate, and > or = 8 micrograms/ml and > or = 17 mm for resistant classification for swine pathogens. when these breakpoints were applied to data from a previous study using bovine pathogens, only 1 minor interpretive error occurred.
