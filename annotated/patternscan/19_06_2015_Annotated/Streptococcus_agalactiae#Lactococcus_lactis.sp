TI  == overexpression, purification, crystallization and preliminary x-ray diffraction of the nisin resistance protein from streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  == nisin is a 34-amino-acid antimicrobial peptide produced by lactococcus lactis belonging to the class of lantibiotics. nisin displays a high bactericidal activity against various gram-positive bacteria, including some human-pathogenic  strains. however, there are some nisin-non-producing strains that are naturally resistant owing to the presence of the nsr gene within their genome. the encoded  protein, nsr, cleaves off the last six amino acids of nisin, thereby reducing its bactericidal efficacy. an expression and purification protocol has been established for the nsr protein from streptococcus agalactiae coh1. the protein was successfully crystallized using the vapour-diffusion method in hanging and sitting drops, resulting in crystals that diffracted x-rays to 2.8 and 2.2 a, respectively.

TI  == group b streptococcus pili mediate adherence to salivary glycoproteins.
AB  == group b streptococcus (gbs) is a leading cause of neonatal sepsis, pneumonia and  meningitis, and is responsible for a rising number of severe invasive infections  in adults. for all disease manifestations, colonisation is a critical first step. gbs has frequently been isolated from the oropharynx of neonates and adults. however, little is understood about the mechanisms of gbs colonisation at this site. in this study it is shown that three gbs strains (coh1, nem316, 515) have capacity to adhere to human salivary pellicle. heterologous expression of gbs pilus island (pi) genes in lactococcus lactis to form surface-expressed pili demonstrated that gbs pi-2a and pi-1 pili bound glycoprotein-340 (gp340), a component of salivary pellicle. by contrast, pi-2b pili did not interact with gp340. the variation was attributable to differences in capacities for backbone and ancillary protein subunits of each pilus to bind gp340. furthermore, while gbs strains were aggregated by fluid-phase gp340, this mechanism was not mediated by pili, which displayed specificity for immobilised gp340. thus pili may enable  gbs to colonise the soft and hard tissues of the oropharynx, while evading an innate mucosal defence, with implications for risk of progression to severe diseases such as meningitis and sepsis.

TI  == investigation of the antimicrobial activity of bacillus licheniformis strains isolated from retail powdered infant milk formulae.
AB  == this study investigated the potential antimicrobial activity of ten bacillus licheniformis strains isolated from retail infant milk formulae against a range of indicator (lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus bulgaricus and listeria innocua)  and clinically relevant (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli) microorganisms. deferred antagonism assays confirmed that all b. licheniformis isolates show antimicrobial activity against the gram-positive target organisms.  pcr and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analyses indicated that four of the b. licheniformis isolates produce the bacteriocin lichenicidin. the remaining six isolates demonstrated a higher antimicrobial potency than lichenicidin-producing strains. further analyses identified a peptide of ~1,422 da as the most likely bioactive responsible for the antibacterial activity of these six isolates. n-terminal sequencing of the ~1,422 da peptide from one strain identified it as ilpeitxifhd. this peptide shows a high homology to the non-ribosomal peptides bacitracin and subpeptin, known to be produced by bacillus spp. subsequent pcr analyses demonstrated that the six b. licheniformis isolates may harbor the genetic machinery needed for the synthesis of a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase similar  to those involved in production of subpeptin and bacitracin, which suggests that  the ~1,422 da peptide might be a variant of subpeptin and bacitracin.

TI  == identification of a group b streptococcal fibronectin binding protein, sfba, that contributes to invasion of brain endothelium and development of meningitis.
AB  == group b streptococcus (gbs) is currently the leading cause of neonatal meningitis. this is due to its ability to survive and multiply in the bloodstream and interact with specialized human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hbmec), which constitute the blood-brain barrier (bbb). the exact mechanism(s) of gbs-bbb penetration is still largely unknown. we and others have shown that gbs interacts with components of the extracellular matrix. in this study, we demonstrate that gbs of representative serotypes binds immobilized and cell surface fibronectin and identify a putative fibronectin binding protein, streptococcal fibronectin binding protein a (sfba). allelic replacement of sfba in the gbs chromosome resulted in a significant decrease in ability to bind fibronection and invade hbmec compared with the wild-type (wt) parental strain. expression of sfba in the noninvasive strain lactococcus lactis was sufficient to promote fibronectin binding and hbmec invasion. furthermore, the addition of an antifibronectin antibody or an rgd peptide that blocks fibronectin binding to integrins significantly reduced invasion of the wt but not the sfba-deficient mutant strain, demonstrating the importance of an sfba-fibronectin-integrin interaction for gbs cellular invasion. using a murine model of gbs meningitis, we also observed that wt gbs penetrated the brain and established meningitis more frequently than did the deltasfba mutant strain. our data suggest that gbs sfba plays an important role in bacterial interaction with bbb endothelium and the pathogenesis of streptococcal meningitis.

TI  == a widespread bacteriophage abortive infection system functions through a type iv  toxin-antitoxin mechanism.
AB  == bacterial abortive infection (abi) systems are 'altruistic' cell death systems that are activated by phage infection and limit viral replication, thereby providing protection to the bacterial population. here, we have used a novel approach of screening abi systems as a tool to identify and characterize toxin-antitoxin (ta)-acting abi systems. we show that abie systems are encoded by bicistronic operons and function via a non-interacting (type iv) bacteriostatic ta mechanism. the abie operon was negatively autoregulated by the antitoxin, abiei, a member of a widespread family of putative transcriptional regulators. abiei has an n-terminal winged-helix-turn-helix domain that is required for repression of abie transcription, and an uncharacterized bi-functional c-terminal domain, which is necessary for transcriptional repression and sufficient for toxin neutralization. the cognate toxin, abieii, is a predicted nucleotidyltransferase (ntase) and member of the dna polymerase beta family. abieii specifically bound gtp, and mutations in conserved ntase motifs (i-iii) and a newly identified motif (iv), abolished gtp binding and subsequent toxicity. the abie systems can provide phage resistance and enable stabilization of mobile  genetic elements, such as plasmids. our study reveals molecular insights into the regulation and function of the widespread bi-functional abie abi-ta systems and the biochemical properties of both toxin and antitoxin proteins.

TI  == bsab, a novel adherence factor of group b streptococcus.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus [gbs]) is a leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis, peripartum infections in women, and invasive infections in chronically ill or elderly individuals. gbs can be isolated from the gastrointestinal or genital tracts of up to 30% of healthy adults, and infection is thought to arise from invasion from a colonized mucosal site. accordingly, bacterial surface components that mediate attachment of gbs to host  cells or the extracellular matrix represent key factors in the colonization and infection of the human host. we identified a conserved gbs gene of unknown function that was predicted to encode a cell wall-anchored surface protein. deletion of the gene and a cotranscribed upstream open reading frame (orf) in gbs strain 515 reduced bacterial adherence to vk2 vaginal epithelial cells in vitro and reduced gbs binding to fibronectin-coated microtiter wells. expression of the gene product in lactococcus lactis conferred the ability to adhere to vk2 cells,  to fibronectin and laminin, and to fibronectin-coated me-180 cervical epithelial  cells. expression of the recombinant protein in l. lactis also markedly increased biofilm formation. the adherence function of the protein, named bacterial surface adhesin of gbs (bsab), depended both on a central bid1 domain found in bacterial  intimin-like proteins and on the c-terminal portion of the bsab protein. expression of bsab in gbs, like that of several other adhesins, was regulated by  the csrrs two-component system. we conclude that bsab represents a newly identified adhesin that participates in gbs attachment to epithelial cells and the extracellular matrix.

TI  == intensive mutagenesis of the nisin hinge leads to the rational design of enhanced derivatives.
AB  == nisin a is the most extensively studied lantibiotic and has been used as a preservative by the food industry since 1953. this 34 amino acid peptide contains three dehydrated amino acids and five thioether rings. these rings, resulting from one lanthionine and four methyllanthionine bridges, confer the peptide with  its unique structure. nisin a has two mechanisms of action, with the n-terminal domain of the peptide inhibiting cell wall synthesis through lipid ii binding and the c-terminal domain responsible for pore-formation. the focus of this study is  the three amino acid 'hinge' region (n 20, m 21 and k 22) which separates these two domains and allows for conformational flexibility. as all lantibiotics are gene encoded, novel variants can be generated through manipulation of the corresponding gene. a number of derivatives in which the hinge region was altered have previously been shown to possess enhanced antimicrobial activity. here we take this approach further by employing simultaneous, indiscriminate site-saturation mutagenesis of all three hinge residues to create a novel bank of nisin derivative producers. screening of this bank revealed that producers of peptides with hinge regions consisting of aak, nai and sls displayed enhanced bioactivity against a variety of targets. these and other results suggested a preference for small, chiral amino acids within the hinge region, leading to the  design and creation of producers of peptides with hinges consisting of aaa and saa. these producers, and the corresponding peptides, exhibited enhanced bioactivity against lactococcus lactis hp, streptococcus agalactiae atcc 13813, mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155 and staphylococcus aureus rf122 and thus represent the first example of nisin derivatives that possess enhanced activity as a consequence of rational design.

TI  == nsr from streptococcus agalactiae confers resistance against nisin and is encoded by a conserved nsr operon.
AB  == nisin is a lantibiotic produced by lactococcus lactis (l. lactis), which is active against many gram-positive bacteria. however, in various pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria, the presence of a nisin resistance protein (nsr) confers  resistance against nisin. here, we show that nsr from streptococcus agalactiae (sansr) confers 20-fold resistance when expressed in l. lactis. we also show that sansr is encoded by an operon structure comprising of a lipoprotein and an atp-binding cassette transporter as well as a two-component system that is putatively involved in expression and regulation. this organization of the operon is conserved in several (non)pathogenic strains that do not produce nisin themselves.

TI  == nuclease a (gbs0661), an extracellular nuclease of streptococcus agalactiae, attacks the neutrophil extracellular traps and is needed for full virulence.
AB  == most bacteria of the genus streptococcus are opportunistic pathogens, and some of them produce extracellular dnases, which may be important for virulence. genome analyses of streptococcus agalactiae (gbs) neonate isolate nem316 revealed the presence of seven genes putatively encoding secreted dnases, although their functions, if any, are unknown. in this study, we observed that respiration growth of gbs led to the extracellular accumulation of a putative nuclease, identified as being encoded by the gbs0661 gene. when overproduced in lactococcus lactis, the protein was found to be a divalent cation-requiring, ph-stable and heat-stable nuclease that we named nuclease a (nuca). substitution of the histidine(148) by alanine reduced nuclease activity of the gbs wild-type strain,  indicating that nuca is the major nuclease ex vivo. we determined that gbs is able to degrade the dna matrix comprising the neutrophil extracellular trap (net). the nuca(h148a) mutant was impaired for this function, implicating nuca in the virulence of gbs. in vivo infection studies confirmed that nuca is required for full infection, as the mutant strain allowed increased bacterial clearance from lung tissue and decreased mortality in infected mice. these results show that nuca is involved in net escape and is needed for full virulence.

TI  == characterization of a new camp factor carried by an integrative and conjugative element in streptococcus agalactiae and spreading in streptococci.
AB  == genetic exchanges between streptococci occur frequently and contribute to their genome diversification. most of sequenced streptococcal genomes carry multiple mobile genetic elements including integrative and conjugative elements (ices) that play a major role in these horizontal gene transfers. in addition to genes involved in their mobility and regulation, ices also carry genes that can confer  selective advantages to bacteria. numerous elements have been described in s. agalactiae especially those integrated at the 3' end of a trna(lys) encoding gene. in strain 515 of s. agalactiae, an invasive neonate human pathogen, the ice (called 515_trna(lys)) is functional and carries different putative virulence genes including one encoding a putative new camp factor in addition to the one previously described. this work demonstrated the functionality of this camp factor (camp factor ii) in lactococcus lactis but also in pathogenic strains of veterinary origin. the search for co-hemolytic factors in a collection of field strains revealed their presence in s. uberis, s. dysgalactiae, but also for the first time in s. equisimilis and s. bovis. sequencing of these genes revealed the prevalence of a species-specific factor in s. uberis strains (uberis factor) and  the presence of a camp factor ii encoding gene in s. bovis and s. equisimilis. furthermore, most of the camp factor ii positive strains also carried an element  integrated in the trna(lys) gene. this work thus describes a camp factor that is  carried by a mobile genetic element and has spread to different streptococcal species.

TI  == development of a reverse line blot hybridization method for detection of some streptococcal/lactococcal species, the causative agents of zoonotic streptococosis/lactococosis in farmed fish.
AB  == background and objective: streptococcosis/lactococcosis is the cause of high morbidity and mortality in aquaculture sector and to date a number of species of  streptococcus and lactococcus genera including s. iniae, s. agalactiae, s. dysagalactiae, s. parauberis, s. feacalis, l. garvieae and l. lactis have been discriminated as the cause of disease in aquatic animals. despite the use of diagnostic molecular methods for each of these bacterial species, no data is available on a suitable, rapid and simple simultaneous detection tool for these pathogens. this paper describes a simultaneous detection method which is pcr based on a reverse line blot (rlb) for rapid detection and differentiation of four species of genera of streptococcus and lactococcus genera consisting of s. iniae, s. agalactiae, s. parauberis and l. garvieae the most important agents of  the disease in fish. materials and methods: a reverse line blot (rlb) assay was developed for the simultaneously identification of four species of streptococcus/lactococcusconsisting of s. iniae, s. parauberis, s. agalactiaeand  lactococcusgarvieae. the assay employs one set of primer pair for specific amplification of the 16s rrna gene. these were designed based on the nucleotide sequences of 16s rrna gene sharing a homology region with streptococcus spp. and  lactococcus spp. dna was extracted from the pure bacterial colonies and amplified. a membrane was prepared with specific oligonucleotide for each bacterial species. pcr products were then hybridized to a membrane. results and conclusion: the amplification resulted in pcr product of 241 bp in length. no cross-reactions were observed between any of the tested bacterial species, and mixed dnas from these four bacterial species were correctly identified. this rlb  method is a suitable technique for a simultaneous detection of these species of bacterial fish pathogens that are some of the main causes of streptococcal/lactococcal infections in both freshwater and marine aquatic animals, and so we recommend its use for integrated epidemiological monitoring of streptococcosis/lactococcis in aquaculture industry.

TI  == microbial diversity, dynamics and activity throughout manufacturing and ripening  of castelmagno pdo cheese.
AB  == the diversity, dynamics and activity of castelmagno pdo cheese microbiota were studied in three batches produced in a floor valley farm, in the grana valley (northwest italy), during the wintertime. samples of milk, curd and cheese (core  and subsurface) at different ripening time were submitted to both culture-dependent and -independent analysis. in particular, dna and rna directly  extracted from the matrices were studied by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and reverse transcription (rt)-pcr-dgge. culture-dependent methods highlighted the initial dominance of a thermophilic streptococcal population with the species streptococcus thermophilus and s. agalactiae. then, mesophilic lactococci occurred among isolates during manufacturing, with lactococcus lactis which was also well represented in the first month of castelmagno pdo ripening. at this point and throughout the ripening, lactobacilli prevailed in cheese samples, represented from lactobacillus plantarum and lb. casei. culture-independent analysis underlined the undoubted role of l. lactis, actively involved in both castelmagno pdo manufacturing and ripening. despite lb. helveticus was never isolated on selective media, a dgge band referred to this microorganism was detected, at rna level, in samples from ripened cheeses. on the other hand, lb. plantarum was widely isolated from the plates, among lactobacilli, but never detected by direct analysis. due to the importance of microbiota in the sensory richness and properties of traditional cheeses, new information have been added, in this work, on microbial diversity of castelmagno  pdo cheese.

TI  == expression of the streptococcus agalactiae virulence-associated protease cspa in  a soluble, active form utilizing the gram-positive host, lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the heterologous expression of streptococcal genes in common gram-negative hosts  may be complicated by low-level expression, toxicity to the host, formation of inclusion bodies, and mislocalization of the encoded proteins. biochemical study  of the streptococcus agalactiae virulence-associated cell-envelope protease (cep) cspa, as well as other ceps, has been limited by the lack of effective expression systems. in this study, we present a simple strategy to express cspa as a catalytically active exoprotein. a recombinant allele of cspa, cspadeltacwa, was  engineered to eliminate the dispensable cell-wall anchor. the cspadeltacwa allele was expressed in the gram-positive organism, lactococcus lactis, using an established, plasmid-based, nisin-inducible expression system. after induction, nearly all of the exoprotein observable by sds-page corresponded to cspadeltacwa. cspadeltacwa-containing medium exhibited similar fibrinolytic activity as whole cells of gbs, indicating the recombinant protein was active. characterization of  cspadeltacwa indicated that like some other ceps, it is n-terminally processed, exists predominantly as a dimer, and has the ability to cleave itself at its c-terminus. taken together, this work presents an efficient strategy for expression of cspa that could be applied to other streptococcal proteins that are not amenable to expression using common gram-negative hosts.

TI  == lactococcus lactis produces short-chain quinones that cross-feed group b streptococcus to activate respiration growth.
AB  == quinones are essential components of the respiration chain that shuttle electrons between oxidoreductases. we characterized the quinones synthesized by lactococcus lactis, a fermenting bacterium that activates aerobic respiration when a haem source is provided. two distinct subgroups were characterized: menaquinones (mk)  mk-8 to mk-10, considered as hallmarks of l. lactis, are produced throughout growth. mk-3 and demethylmk-3 [(d)mk-3] are newly identified and are present only late in growth. production of (d)mk-3 was conditional on the carbon sugar and on  the presence of carbon catabolite regulator gene ccpa. electron flux driven by both (d)mk fractions was shared between the quinol oxidase and extracellular acceptors o(2), iron and, with remarkable efficiency, copper. purified (d)mk-3, but not mk-8-10, complemented a menb defect in l. lactis. we previously showed that a respiratory metabolism is activated in group b streptococcus (gbs) by exogenous haem and mk, and that this activity is implicated in virulence. here we show that growing lactococci donate (d)mk to gbs to activate respiration and stimulate growth of this opportunist pathogen. we propose that conditions favouring (d)mk production in dense microbial ecosystems, as present in the intestinal tract, could favour implantation of (d)mk-scavengers like gbs within the complex.

TI  == efficacy of nisin in treatment of clinical mastitis in lactating dairy cows.
AB  == nisin is an antimicrobial polypeptide produced by lactococcus lactis and is believed nontoxic to humans. the objective of this study was to evaluate a nisin-based formulation for the treatment of bovine clinical mastitis in lactating dairy cattle. a total of 92 cows with 107 clinically mastitic quarters  were randomly assigned to nisin- (48 cows with 51 quarters) and gentamicin (gm)-treated (44 cows with 56 quarters) groups. in the nisin-treated group, cows  received an intramammary infusion of nisin at a dose of 2,500,000 iu; in the gm-treated group, intramammary infusion of gm was administered at a dose of 0.8 g. results indicated that nisin offered a clinical cure rate similar to gm (90.2  vs. 91.1%) and no difference in bacteriological cure rate than gm-treated group (60.8 vs. 44.6%, respectively). proportion of the quarters with milk somatic cell counts <500,000 cells/ml was not different in the nisin-treated group (50.0 and 47.8%) compared with the gm-treated group (33.3 and 37.3%) 1 and 2 wk after treatment. of 17 staphylococcus aureus isolates, 82.5% were resistant to penicillin, and 35.3% to gm, but none of them to nisin. nisin therapy eliminated  54.5% (6 of 11) of s. aureus imi, whereas gm eliminated 33.3% (2 of 6). nisin in  milk (4.5 +/- 0.8 iu/ml) was detected only at 12 h following intramammary infusion, which was much lower than the upper limit (500 mg/ml) allowed as preservative in milk by the china authority. because of its efficacy in the treatment of bovine clinical mastitis, especially resistant staph. aureus-caused  imi, as well as its safety in humans, nisin deserves further study to clarify its effects on mastitis caused by different mastitis pathogens on a larger scale.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with fish and the fish farm environment, established by amplified rrna gene restriction analysis.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria have become a major source of concern for aquaculture in recent decades. in addition to true pathogenic species of worldwide significance, such as streptococcus iniae and lactococcus garvieae, several species have been reported to produce occasional fish mortalities in limited geographic areas, and  many unidentifiable or ill-defined isolates are regularly isolated from fish or fish products. to clarify the nature and prevalence of different fish-associated  bacteria belonging to the lactic acid bacterium group, a collection of 57 isolates of different origins was studied and compared with a set of 22 type strains, using amplified rrna gene restriction analysis (ardra). twelve distinct  clusters were delineated on the basis of ardra profiles and were confirmed by sequencing of soda and 16s rrna genes. these clusters included the following: lactococcus raffinolactis, l. garvieae, lactococcus l., s. iniae, s. dysgalactiae, s. parauberis, s. agalactiae, carnobacterium spp., the enterococcus "faecium" group, a heterogeneous enterococcus-like cluster comprising indiscernible representatives of vagococcus fluvialis or the recently recognized  v. carniphilus, v. salmoninarum, and aerococcus spp. interestingly, the l. lactis and l. raffinolactis clusters appeared to include many commensals of fish, so opportunistic infections caused by these species cannot be disregarded. the significance for fish populations and fish food processing of three or four genetic clusters of uncertain or complex definition, namely, aerococcus and enterococcus clusters, should be established more accurately.

AB  == a novel streptococcus pneumoniae plasmid (pspnp1; 5413bp) has been isolated from  the multidrug-resistant clone poland(23f)-16, and its complete nucleotide sequence has been determined. sequence analysis predicted seven co-directional open reading frames and comparative analyses revealed that plasmid pspnp1 is different to pdp1, the only previously described pneumococcal plasmid, whereas it is highly similar to pst08, a plasmid from streptococcus thermophilus. a double-stranded origin for replication similar to the replication origin of the pc194/pub110 family was located upstream of the putative rep gene (orf2). it also contained a 144-bp region with over 60% identity to the single-stranded origin type a of the streptococcus agalactiae plasmid pmv158/pls1. detection of single-stranded dna by southern blot analysis indicated that pspnp1 replicates via a rolling circle mechanism. interestingly, the product of orf1 has a putative zonular occludens toxin conserved domain present in toxigenic strains of vibrio cholerae. real-time pcr assays revealed that this orf was expressed. hybridization experiments showed that the pspnp1 replicon was unusual among other examined antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal clones, although the recombinant plasmids based on pspnp1 were able to replicate in bacillus subtilis and lactococcus lactis.

TI  == isolation and identification of a paenibacillus polymyxa strain that coproduces a novel lantibiotic and polymyxin.
AB  == a new bacterial strain, displaying potent antimicrobial properties against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, was isolated from food. based on its phenotypical and biochemical properties as well as its 16s rrna gene sequence, the bacterium was identified as paenibacillus polymyxa and it was designated as strain osy-df. the antimicrobials produced by this strain were isolated from the fermentation broth and subsequently analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. two antimicrobials were found: a known antibiotic, polymyxin e1, which is active against gram-negative bacteria, and an  unknown 2,983-da compound showing activity against gram-positive bacteria. the latter was purified to homogeneity, and its antimicrobial potency and proteinaceous nature were confirmed. the antimicrobial peptide, designated paenibacillin, is active against a broad range of food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, including bacillus spp., clostridium sporogenes, lactobacillus spp., lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, listeria spp., pediococcus cerevisiae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae. furthermore, it  possesses the physico-chemical properties of an ideal antimicrobial agent in terms of water solubility, thermal resistance, and stability against acid/alkali  (ph 2.0 to 9.0) treatment. edman degradation, mass spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance were used to sequence native and chemically modified paenibacillin. while details of the tentative sequence need to be elucidated in future work, the peptide was unequivocally characterized as a novel lantibiotic,  with a high degree of posttranslational modifications. the coproduction of polymyxin e1 and a lantibiotic is a finding that has not been reported earlier. the new strain and associated peptide are potentially useful in food and medical  applications.

TI  == use of lactococcus lactis expressing pili from group b streptococcus as a broad-coverage vaccine against streptococcal disease.
AB  == recent data indicate that the human pathogen group b streptococcus (gbs) produces pilus-like structures encoded in genomic islands with similar organization to pathogenicity islands. on the basis of the amino acid sequence of their protein components, 3 different types of pili have been identified in gbs, at least 1 of  which is present in all isolates. we recently demonstrated that recombinant pilus proteins protect mice from lethal challenge with gbs and are thus potential vaccine candidates. here, we show that gbs pilin island 1, transferred into the nonpathogenic microorganism lactococcus lactis, leads to pilus assembly. we also  show that systemically or mucosally delivered lactococcus expressing pilin island 1 protects mice from challenge with gbs isolates carrying pilus 1. furthermore, lactococci engineered to express hybrid pili containing gbs pilus 1 and pilus 2 components confer protection against strains expressing either of the 2 pilus types. these data pave the way to the design of pilus-based, multivalent live vaccines against streptococcal pathogens.

TI  == adherence to and invasion of human brain microvascular endothelial cells are promoted by fibrinogen-binding protein fbsa of streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae is a frequent cause of bacterial sepsis and meningitis in neonates. during the course of infection, s. agalactiae colonizes and invades  a number of host compartments, thereby interacting with different host tissues. deletion of the fbsa gene, encoding the fibrinogen protein fbsa, significantly impaired the adherence and invasion of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hbmec) by s. agalactiae. the adherence and invasiveness of an fbsa deletion mutant were restored by reintroducing the fbsa gene on an expression vector. heterologous expression of fbsa in lactococcus lactis enabled this bacterium to adhere to but not to invade hbmec, suggesting that fbsa is a streptococcal adhesin. finally, host cell adherence and invasion were significantly blocked in competition experiments with either purified fbsa fusion protein or a monoclonal antibody directed against the fibrinogen-binding epitope  of fbsa. the s. agalactiae fbsa mutant induced a release of the neutrophil chemoattractant interleukin-8 (il-8) equal to that induced by the wild type. taken together, our studies demonstrate that fbsa promotes the adherence of s. agalactiae to hbmec but that fbsa neither mediates the bacterial invasion into host cells nor plays a role in il-8 release for hbmec.

TI  == the fibrinogen receptor fbsa promotes adherence of streptococcus agalactiae to human epithelial cells.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae is a major cause of bacterial pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis in human neonates. during the course of infection, s. agalactiae adheres to a variety of epithelial cells but the underlying mechanisms are only poorly understood. the present report demonstrates the importance of the fibrinogen receptor fbsa for the streptococcal adherence and invasion of epithelial cells. deletion of the fbsa gene in various s. agalactiae strains substantially reduced their binding of soluble fibrinogen and their adherence to  and invasion of epithelial cells, indicating a role of fbsa in these different processes. the adherence and invasiveness of an fbsa deletion mutant were partially restored by reintroducing the fbsa gene on an expression vector. heterologous expression of fbsa in lactococcus lactis enabled this bacterium to adhere to but not to invade epithelial cells, suggesting that fbsa is a streptococcal adhesin. flow cytometry experiments revealed a dose-dependent binding of fbsa to the surface of epithelial cells. furthermore, tissue culture experiments exhibited an intimate contact of fbsa-coated latex beads with the surfaces of human epithelial cells. finally, host cell adherence and invasion were significantly blocked in competition experiments with either purified fbsa protein or a monoclonal antibody directed against the fibrinogen-binding epitope  of fbsa. taken together, our studies demonstrate that fbsa promotes the adherence of s. agalactiae to epithelial cells but that fbsa does not mediate the bacterial invasion into host cells. our results also indicate that fibrinogen-binding epitopes within fbsa are involved in the adherence of s. agalactiae to epithelial cells.

TI  == fbsa, a fibrinogen-binding protein from streptococcus agalactiae, mediates platelet aggregation.
AB  == the bacterium streptococcus agalactiae is an etiologic agent in the pathogenesis  of endocarditis in humans. fbsa, a fibrinogen-binding protein produced by this pathogen, is considered an important virulence factor. in the present study we provide evidence that s agalactiae clinical isolates bearing fbsa attach to fibrinogen and elicit a fibrinogen-dependent aggregation of platelets. mutants of s agalactiae lacking the fbsa gene lost the ability to attach to fibrinogen and to aggregate platelets. plasmid-mediated expression of fbsa restored the capability for fibrinogen binding and platelet aggregation in s agalactiae fbsa mutants, and allowed lactococcus lactis to interact with fibrinogen and to aggregate human platelets. moreover, a monoclonal anti-fbsa antibody inhibited bacterial adherence to fibrinogen and s agalactiae-induced platelet aggregation.  platelet aggregation was inhibited by aspirin, prostaglandin e(1,) the peptide rgds, and the antibody abciximab, demonstrating the specificity of platelet aggregation by s agalactiae and indicating an involvement of integrin glycoprotein iib/iiia in the induction of platelet aggregation. aggregation was also dependent on anti-fbsa igg and could be inhibited by an antibody against the platelet fcgammariia receptor. these findings indicate that fbsa is a crucial factor in s agalactiae-induced platelet aggregation and may therefore play an important role in s agalactiae-induced endocarditis.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

TI  == sequence of the 50-kb conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis re25.
AB  == the complete 50,237-bp dna sequence of the conjugative and mobilizing multiresistance plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis re25 was determined. the plasmid had 58 putative open reading frames, 5 of which encode resistance to 12 antimicrobials. chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and the 23s rna methylase are identical to gene products of the broad-host-range plasmid pip501 from streptococcus agalactiae. in addition, a 30.5-kb segment is almost identical to pip501. genes encoding an aminoglycoside 6-adenylyltransferase, a streptothricin  acetyltransferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase are arranged in tandem on a 7.4-kb fragment as previously reported in tn5405 from staphylococcus  aureus and in pjh1 from e. faecalis. one interrupted and five complete is elements as well as three replication genes were also identified. pre25 was transferred by conjugation to e. faecalis, listeria innocua, and lactococcus lactis by means of a transfer region that appears similar to that of pip501. it is concluded that pre25 may contribute to the further spread of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms via food into the human community.

TI  == isolation and characterization of a streptococcus thermophilus plasmid closely related to the pmv158 family.
AB  == twenty-two streptococcus thermophilus strains used for milk fermentations were analyzed for their plasmid content and 13 of them (59%) were found to contain one or two plasmids. fifteen s. thermophilus plasmids were divided into four groups using dna homology. ten plasmids were classified within group a and they shared homologies with all the previously sequenced s. thermophilus plasmids. three plasmids (group b) hybridized with each other and two plasmids only hybridized with themselves (groups c and d). single-stranded dna was detected within strains containing plasmids of groups a, c, and d, indicating that they replicate via a rolling-circle mode. the only plasmid of group c, named psmq172, was further characterized. this 4230-bp plasmid replicates in escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus salivarius and does not confer phage resistance. comparisons with databases showed that psmq172 was related to pmv158 of streptococcus agalactiae and to pssu1 of streptococcus suis. these results suggest that genetic exchanges may have occurred between pathogenic and nonpathogenic streptococci.

TI  == characterization of the cryptic plasmid psbo2 isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1 and construction of a new shuttle vector.
AB  == a cryptic plasmid designated psbo2 (3582 bp) was isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1. the psbo2 contained putative sites for a double-strand origin (dso), a small transcriptional repressor protein (cop), countertranscribed rnas (ctrnas),  and a replication protein (rep), which were similar to those from pmv158 and pls1, which were isolated from s. agalactiae, and pwvo1, isolated from lactococcus lactis. the putative single-strand origin (sso) of psbo2 was similar  to per341 and pst1, which were isolated from s. thermophilus. recombinant plasmid designated psbe2 was constructed to bind pecm184 vector and the dna fragment containing sso, dso, cop, ctrnas, and rep of psbo2. when psbe2 was introduced into s. bovis 12-u-1 and no8, the plasmids in the transformants had deleted the 160-bp fragment between sso and dso. this plasmid, designated psbe2a, was capable of transforming escherichia coli and s. bovis strains 12-u-1 and no8 on high frequency; therefore, psbe2a is an effective shuttle vector.

TI  == group b streptococci and other gram-positive cocci bind to cytokeratin 8.
AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) adhere to surface receptors present on epithelial cells; these receptors include fibronectin and laminin. to identify other possible receptors, plasma membranes from a549 cells, a respiratory tract epithelial cell line, were prepared. these plasma membranes were tested in a protein blot analysis using radiolabeled gbs as a probe. gbs adhered to two species, with molecular masses of 50 kda (p50) and 57 kda (p57). we concluded that p50 and p57 correspond to two forms of cytokeratin 8 (ck8) on the basis of the following results: (i) protein blot results demonstrated that p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with two forms of ck8 after separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page); (ii) p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with ck8 after separation by two-dimensional page; (iii) ck8 in solution bound to gbs, as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of proteins from a549 lysates that bound to gbs in a liquid-phase assay; and (iv) radiolabeled gbs bound to a549 lysate-derived ck8 that had been captured in anti-ck8-coated microtiter wells. ck8 bound to coh1-13, an acapsular mutant of coh1, demonstrating that adherence is not mediated by capsular polysaccharide. trypsin-treated gbs did not bind to ck8, indicating that adherence is mediated via a protein on the surface of gbs. soluble ck8 bound to six of six gbs strains  tested. soluble ck8 also bound to staphylococcus aureus, lactococcus lactis, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pyogenes. we hypothesize that adherence  of gbs to cytokeratin may be important for maintenance of colonization at sites of keratinized epithelium, such as the vagina, or for adherence of these bacteria to damaged epithelial cells at other sites.

TI  == use of the lactococcal nisa promoter to regulate gene expression in gram-positive bacteria: comparison of induction level and promoter strength.
AB  == we characterized the regulated activity of the lactococcal nisa promoter in strains of the gram-positive species streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and bacillus subtilis. nisa promoter activity was dependent on the proteins nisr and nisk, which constitute a two-component signal transduction system that responds to the  extracellular inducer nisin. the nisin sensitivity and inducer concentration required for maximal induction varied among the strains. significant induction of the nisa promoter (10- to 60-fold induction) was obtained in all of the species studied at a nisin concentration just below the concentration at which growth is  inhibited. the efficiency of the nisa promoter was compared to the efficiencies of the spac, xyla, and laca promoters in b. subtilis and in s. pyogenes. because  nisa promoter-driven expression is regulated in many gram-positive bacteria, we expect it to be useful for genetic studies, especially studies with pathogenic streptococci in which no other regulated promoters have been described.

TI  == identification and characterization of the eps (exopolysaccharide) gene cluster from streptococcus thermophilus sfi6.
AB  == we report the identification and characterization of the eps gene cluster of streptococcus thermophilus sfi6 required for exopolysaccharide (eps) synthesis. this report is the first genetic work concerning eps production in a food microorganism. the eps secreted by this strain consists of the following tetrasaccharide repeating unit:-->3)-beta-d-galp-(1-->3)-[alpha-d-galp-(1-->6)]-beta-d- d-galp-(1-->3)-alpha-d-galp-d-galpnac-(1-->. the genetic locus the genetic locus  was identified by tn916 mutagenesis in combination with a plate assay to identify eps mutants. sequence analysis of the gene region, which was obtained from subclones of a genomic library of sfi6, revealed a 15.25-kb region encoding 15 open reading frames. eps expression in the non-eps-producing heterologous host, lactococcus lactis mg1363, showed that within the 15.25-kb region, a region with  a size of 14.52 kb encoding the 13 genes epsa to epsm was capable of directing eps synthesis and secretion in this host. homology searches of the predicted proteins in the swiss-prot database revealed high homology (40 to 68% identity) for epsa, b, c, d, and e and the genes involved in capsule synthesis in streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus agalactiae. moderate to low homology (37 to 18% identity) was detected for epsb, d, f, and h and the genes involved in capsule synthesis in staphylococcus aureus for epsc, d, and e and the genes involved in exopolysaccharide i (epsi) synthesis in rhizobium meliloti for epsc to epsj and the genes involved in lipopolysaccharide synthesis in members of the  enterobacteriaceae, and finally for eps k and lipb of neisseria meningitidis. genes (epsj, epsl, and epsm) for which the predicted proteins showed little or no homology with proteins in the swiss-prot database were shown to be involved in eps synthesis by single-crossover gene disruption experiments.

AB  == a blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as x-static) was used in these experiments. this fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. at ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. the rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in x-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of  tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. when bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees c as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for pseudomonas, klebsiella, staphylococcus, and streptococcus species. the rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. the rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that x-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.

AB  == bacteriological and cytological examinations have been carried out on samples from 6,808 cows belonging to 339 herds in four danish dairy districts. after a discussion of differences between the districts as regards intensivity of mastitis control, public health surveillance, etc., definitions are given of certain terms, such as presence of bacteria, infection, pathogenic versus non-pathogenic (less pathogenic) organisms. the rate of infection with pathogenic organisms varies between districts from 23% to32% on a cow basis, and from 8% to  12% on a quarter basis. a comparison, on a cow basis, of the occurrence of pathogens as recorded in 1955/58 in three danish surveys comprising 11 dairy districts, with the occurrence as recorded in four districts in 1972, showed a decline in incidence of between 7 and 9 percentage units. together with the decline in incidence a definite change in the composition of the udder flora has  taken place during that period. in particular, there was a pronounced fall in the occurrence of group b, c, g, and l streptococci, and a relative increase in the occurrence of staphylococcus aureus. a comparison, on a quarter basis, with the occurrence of pathogens in 30 english herds subjected through three years to intensive mastitis control, including systematic treatment of dry cows, teat dipping, and weekly inspection, showed that by such a programme a slightly lower  level of infection was reached than in the 399 danish herds which had been subjected to collective control for 10-15 years. the annual financial loss per cow suffering from mastitis being estimated at d.kr. 600.-, the reduction noted in the occurrence of bacteria in cows' udders implies an annual national saving of d.kr. 42 million on account of the danish mastitis control. the total annual expenditure on danish mastitis control is estimated at d.kr. 9million expenses would rise to some 70 million d.kr. if all registered cows were to be treated on  drying-off, and if general teat dipping was to be carried out.
