TI  == distinct polymicrobial populations in a chronic foot ulcer with implications for  diagnostics and anti-infective therapy.
AB  == background: polymicrobial infections caused by combinations of different bacteria are being detected with an increasing frequency. the evidence of such complex infections is being revealed through the use of novel molecular and culture-independent methods. considerable progress has been made in the last decade regarding the diagnostic application of such molecular techniques. in particular, 16s rdna-based sequencing and even metagenomic analyses have been successfully used to study the microbial diversity in ecosystems and human microbiota. here, we utilized denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) as a diagnostic tool for identifying different bacterial species in complex clinical samples of a patient with a chronic foot ulcer. case presentation: a 45-year-old female suffered from a chronic 5x5cm large plantar ulcer located in the posterior calcaneal area with subcutaneous tissue infection  and osteomyelitis. the chronic ulcer developed over a period of 8 years. culture  and dhplc revealed a distinct and location-dependent polymicrobial infection of the ulcer. the analysis of a superficial biopsy revealed a mixture of staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, and fusobacterium nucleatum, whereas the tissue-deep biopsy harbored a mixture of four different bacterial species, namely gemella morbillorum, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides fragilis, and arcanobacterium haemolyticum. conclusions: this clinical case highlights the difficulties in assessing polymicrobial infections where a mixture of fastidious, rapid and slow growing bacteria as well as anaerobes exists as structured communities within the tissue architecture of chronic wound infections. the diagnosis of this multilayered polymicrobial infection led to a microbe-adapted antibiotic therapy, targeting the polymicrobial nature of this infection in addition to a standard local wound treatment. however, a complete wound closure could not be achieved due to the long-lasting extensive destruction of tissue.

TI  == evaluation of the subgingival microbiota of alcoholic and non-alcoholic individuals.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of alcoholic and non-alcoholic individuals. methods: the study was conducted with 49 alcoholic and 49 non-alcoholic males of the philippe  pinel institute, rio de janeiro, brazil. the subjects were selected by convenience and two criteria were used to diagnose alcohol dependence: the cage (cut-down, annoyed, guilt, eyes-opener) questionnaire and the international statistical classification of diseases, 10th edition (who). subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 4 sites, 2 with probing depth (pd) >/= 4 mm and 2 sites with pd < 4 mm. the presence and levels of 45 bacterial taxa were analysed  using the checkerboard technique. results: the prevalence of bacterial species was not significantly different between groups. however, alcoholics showed significantly higher mean counts of aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis (adjusted p < 0.001). moreover, alcoholics harboured significantly higher mean levels of capnocytophaga sputigena, fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, f. nuc. nucleatum, gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, p. gingivalis, streptococcus gordonii, and tannerella forsythia at sites with pd < 4 mm or >/= 4 mm compared to non-alcoholics (p </= 0.001). of interest, shallow sites of alcoholics presented  significantly higher mean levels of f. nuc. vincentii, f. nuc nucleatum, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythia than sites with pd >/= 4 mm of non-alcoholics (p </= 0.001). conclusions: alcoholics and non-alcoholics present a diverse and complex  microbiota; however, alcoholics harbour significantly higher levels of periodontopathic species in the subgingival microbiota than non-alcoholics.

TI  == comparison of the use of the halimeter and the oral chroma in the assessment of the ability of common cultivable oral anaerobic bacteria to produce malodorous volatile sulfur compounds from cysteine and methionine.
AB  == objective: to compare the use of the halimeter and the oral chroma to assess the  ability of common oral anaerobic bacteria isolated from the kuwaiti population to produce volatile sulfur compounds (vscs). materials and methods: broth cultures of common anaerobes isolated from supragingival plaque were centrifuged and pellets resuspended in phosphate buffer (ph 7.7) with an optical density od(550)  of 0.3. 100 mul of this suspension and 870 mul of buffer were added in 2 sterile  15-ml head space vials. reaction was initiated by addition of 30 mul of 33 mml-methionine and l-cysteine, respectively, in each vial and incubation at 37 degrees c for 90 min. 500 mul of 3 m phosphoric acid was added to tubes and was kept aside for 10 min. production of vscs was measured using the halimeter and the oral chroma. results: the major vsc producers identified by both halimeter and oral chroma with l-cystenine as substrate were campylobacter ureolyticus, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and gemella morbillorum. the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide recorded by both halimeter and oral chroma were essentially identical. with l-methionine as substrate, both halimeter and oral chroma identified different complements of anaerobes with c. ureolyticus,p. gingivalis,fusobacterium nucleatum and p. intermedia as major vsc producers. the  concentrations of methyl mercaptan recorded by the halimeter were lower compared  to those assessed by the oral chroma. conclusion: the results suggest that the oral chroma may produce a more comprehensive assessment of vsc production by oral microflora than the halimeter.

TI  == periodontal status of patients with dentin dysplasia type i: report of three cases within a family.
AB  == background: dentin dysplasia type i (ddi) is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation. it is characterized by clinically normal-appearing crowns; obliteration of pulp chambers; and short, blunted and malformed roots that are commonly associated with periodontal attachment loss (pal). in this context, we report three cases within a family with similar clinical and radiographic features of ddi but with differing microbiologic and periodontal conditions. methods: a 42-year-old white female and her two daughters (25 and 10 years of age) presented with a diagnosis of ddi. probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), visible plaque, and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. subgingival biofilm samples were randomly collected and analyzed by checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization. results: the mother presented 34.9% of sites with pd > or  =4 mm, 41.3% of sites with cal > or =4 mm, and 57% of sites with bop; both daughters presented no sites with pd or cal >3 mm and <10% of sites with bop. microbiologic analysis detected gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, and staphylococcus aureus in > or =50% of the mother's samples. the daughters showed  high levels (>10(4) bacterial cells) of some periodontopathic bacteria, including members of the red (porphyromonas gingivalis) and orange (fusobacterium periodonticum and f. nucleatum polymorphum) complexes and beneficial species of the yellow (streptococcus gordonii) and purple (veillonella parvula) complexes. the mother presented high mean levels only for four tested species (n. mucosa, prevotella melaninogenica, treponema denticola, and v. parvula). conclusion: a combination of radiographs, microbiologic analysis, and preventive professional monitoring care is important to avoid pal and to provide oral health in patients  with ddi.

TI  == effects of glass ionomer and microfilled composite subgingival restorations on periodontal tissue and subgingival biofilm: a 6-month evaluation.
AB  == background: this 6-month study evaluated the effects of resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (rmgi) and microfilled composite (mc) subgingival restorations on periodontal tissues and subgingival biofilm. methods: fifty-four  periodontally healthy patients were assigned as follows: group 1 (n = 18), root exposure (re) without non-carious cervical lesions (nccl) treated with coronally  positioned flap (cpf); group 2 (n = 18), re with nccl treated rmgi restorations plus cpf; group 3 (n = 18), re with nccl treated with mc restorations plus cpf. probing depth (pd), visible local plaque score (pl), and local bleeding on probing (bop) were assessed at baseline and 6 months after surgeries. restored and non-restored root recoverage (rr) was assessed at 6 months. each experimental tooth was subgingivally sampled (baseline and 6 months) and analyzed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: clinical results showed no significant differences among the groups regarding pl, bop, and pd at baseline and 6 months. the rr means were similar among the groups at 6 months. intragroup  analyses revealed that the proportions of 10 periodontopathogens decreased at 6 months for the control group. for the rmgi group, there was a significant decrease in the proportions of nine periodontopathogens. for the mc group, there  was a significant increase in the proportions of fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum and gemella morbillorum and a decrease in five periodontopathogens. intergroup analyses showed an increase in the proportion of f. nucleatum polymorphum for the mc group. conclusions: in a 6-month evaluation, well-finished rmgi or mc subgingival restorations did not negatively affect periodontal health. furthermore, rmgi seems to exert more positive effects on the subgingival biofilm composition than mc.

TI  == bacteria recovered from dental pulp induce apoptosis of lymph node cells.
AB  == apoptosis is critical in the pathogenesis of several infectious diseases. the induction of apoptosis was assessed in mouse lymph node cells by four bacteria recovered from infected human dental pulp: gemella morbillorum, clostridium butyricum, fusobacterium nucleatum and bifidobacterium adolescentis. smaller lymph nodes and smaller numbers of cells were observed after experimental dental  pulp infection with c. butyricum, suggesting that this bacterium induces cell death. apoptosis was evaluated by determination of cell ploidy and detection of dna degradation in cells cultured with killed bacteria. paraformaldehyde-killed c. butyricum and heat-killed g. morbillorum induced substantial cell death, while f. nucleatum and b. adolescentis induced cell death at lower levels. no bacterial preparations induced apoptosis in cells from mice genetically deficient for tumour necrosis factor receptor p55 (tnfrp55), implicating this receptor directly or indirectly as a mediator in the process. it was concluded that apoptosis may be induced during periapical lesions of pulpal origin.

TI  == coaggregation profiles of the microflora from root surface caries lesions.
AB  == bacterial coaggregation reactions between different species and the auto aggregation of the same species are associated with the initiation and development of dental plaque and biofilms. as no such data is available on isolates from root caries lesions, we evaluated, by a visual, semi-quantitative scoring system and a spectrophotometric, quantitative assay, the coaggregation of 22 different wild-type microbial species comprising ten bacterial genera and a single candida spp. the quantitative coaggregation assay we used proved to be a more sensitive method than the semi-quantitative, visual evaluation as the results yielded the percent coaggregation. fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus bovis ii/2 and gemella morbillorum were observed having higher degrees of autoaggregation than the other examined strains. significant levels of inter-species coaggregation was seen between: (1) actinomyces spp. and veillonella spp.; (2) actinomyces israelii and peptostreptococcus prevotii; (3) campylobacter gracilis and actinomyces spp.; (4) prevotella intermedia and nine different species; and (5) fusobacterium nucleatum and six other species. the single candida albicans isolate did not coaggregate to a significant extent with any of the 21 bacterial isolates studied. scanning electron microscopy observation of the coaggregation interactions between bacterial pairs having strong coaggregation reactions revealed varying adhesive patterns. our findings on coaggregation amongst these isolates imply existence of multiple interactions between the coaggregation-inducing bacterial species in root caries. in particular, actinomyces spp., veillonella spp., prevotella spp. and fusobacterium spp. appear to play a significant role in this context.

TI  == cytokine production in response to endodontic infection in germ-free mice.
AB  == this study evaluated the cytokine profiles (type 1 or type 2) that are triggered  by and modulate endodontic periapical infections in the root canal system of germ-free mice. microorganisms isolated from two patients with pulpal necrosis were inoculated into two groups of experimental animals: group i (gemella morbillorum) and group ii (bifidobacterium adolescentis, fusobacterium nucleatum  and clostridium butyricum). in vitro, g. morbillorum induced type 1 cytokine synthesis, while the modulation processed in vivo seemed to have the opposite effect, with a reduction in the basal levels of il-12 and ifn-gamma, il-4-independent down-modulation. in vitro, microorganisms from group ii, in poly-infection, induced a reduction of type 1 cytokine levels from day 10 to day  20, which seemed to be modulated via il-4. in vivo, however, a predominance of the immune response to one species over the others occurred.

TI  == implantation of bacteria from human pulpal necrosis and translocation from root canals in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine whether microorganisms recovered from infected human root canals were able to survive and translocate to a local lymph  node when experimentally inoculated into the root canal system of germ-free mice. the microorganisms isolated from two patients with pulpal necrosis were inoculated in two groups of experimental animals; group i (gemella morbillorum) and group ii (bifidobacterium adolescentis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and clostridium butyricum). g. morbillorum showed the highest frequency of colonization and translocation to the draining lymph node. in group ii only f. nucleatum and c. butyricum colonized and translocated when inoculated in tri-association. when the bacteria from group ii were inoculated in monoinfection all three species colonized the root canal of germ-free mice and translocated to  the draining lymph node, but with different frequencies. we conclude that selective mechanisms occur in which some bacterial species are fit to survive, multiply, and translocate in the germ-free mouse model.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  == eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. the aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). the samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. forty-one different microbial species were isolated. gemella morbillorum and peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while p. micros, streptococcus intermedius, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loeschei, p. melaninogenica and selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. the bacterial species s. constellatus, g. morbillorum and p. magnus were  isolated in greater numbers in incisors and p. micros, s. intermedius, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides egertheii, b. forsythus, p. oralis and s. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. cluster i was predominated by s. constellatus, s. mitis, s. sanguis, g. morbillorum, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; cluster ii was predominated by s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea and p. intermedia; cluster iii was predominated by s. mitis, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum,  p. loeschei, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; and finally cluster iv was predominated by s. sanguis, c. gingivalis, veillonella parvula, campylobacter gracilis, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia. the bacterial species s. constellatus,  p. micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, eikenella corrodens and f. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while s. intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.
