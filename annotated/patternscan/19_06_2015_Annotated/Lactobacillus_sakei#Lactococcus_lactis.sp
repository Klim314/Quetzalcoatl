TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria during fermentation of a traditional chinese fish product, chouguiyu (stinky mandarinfish).
AB  == chouguiyu, or stinky mandarinfish, is a traditional chinese fermented fish product made of mandarinfish by spontaneous fermentation at the anaerobic condition with low-salt concentration. in order to get a primary understanding of the microbial community presenting in the chouguiyu fermentation, 61 cultures of  lactic acid bacteria (lab) from various fermentation period were isolated using mrs agar plates and characterized based on a combination of phenotypic and genotypic approaches including amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra) and 16s rrna partial gene sequencing analysis. eight distinct bacterial species belonging to 6 genera were identified in total. among them, lactobacillus sakei was the dominant species (63%) during the fermentation, which exhibited great variety in phenotypic tests but unique genotypic characters. meanwhile, the other lab species including lactococcus (lc.) garvieae, lc. lactis, lc. raffinolactis, vagococcus sp., enterococcus hermanniensis, macrococcus caseolyticus as well as streptococcus parauberis were also recovered from the different fermentation periods, especially at the initial point of the fermentation. this seems to be the 1st report investigating the lab composition involved in chouguiyu fermentation and the data obtained in this study may be valuable for selecting starter culture for chouguiyu industrial-scale production.

TI  == microbial ecology dynamics during rye and wheat sourdough preparation.
AB  == the bacterial ecology during rye and wheat sourdough preparation was described by 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing. viable plate counts of presumptive lactic acid bacteria, the ratio between lactic acid bacteria and yeasts, the rate of acidification, a permutation analysis based on biochemical and microbial features, the number of operational taxonomic units (otus), and diversity indices all together demonstrated the maturity of the sourdoughs during 5 to 7 days of propagation. flours were mainly contaminated by metabolically active genera (acinetobacter, pantoea, pseudomonas, comamonas, enterobacter, erwinia, and sphingomonas) belonging to the phylum proteobacteria or bacteroidetes (genus chryseobacterium). their relative abundances varied with the flour. soon after 1  day of propagation, this population was almost completely inhibited except for the enterobacteriaceae. although members of the phylum firmicutes were present at very low or intermediate relative abundances in the flours, they became dominant  soon after 1 day of propagation. lactic acid bacteria were almost exclusively representative of the firmicutes by this time. weissella spp. were already dominant in rye flour and stably persisted, though they were later flanked by the lactobacillus sakei group. there was a succession of species during 10 days of propagation of wheat sourdoughs. the fluctuation between dominating and subdominating populations of l. sakei group, leuconostoc spp., weissella spp., and lactococcus lactis was demonstrated. other subdominant species such as lactobacillus plantarum were detectable throughout propagation. as shown by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) analysis, saccharomyces cerevisiae dominated throughout the sourdough propagation. notwithstanding variations due to environmental and technology determinants, the results of this  study represent a clear example of how the microbial ecology evolves during sourdough preparation.

TI  == cloning, production, and functional expression of the bacteriocin sakacin a (saka) and two saka-derived chimeras in lactic acid bacteria (lab) and the yeasts pichia pastoris and kluyveromyces lactis.
AB  == mature sakacin a (saka, encoded by sapa) and its cognate immunity protein (saki,  encoded by sapia), and two saka-derived chimeras mimicking the n-terminal end of  mature enterocin p (entp/saka) and mature enterocin a (enta/saka) together with saki, were fused to different signal peptides (sp) and cloned into the protein expression vectors pnz8048 and pmg36c for evaluation of their production and functional expression by different lactic acid bacteria. the amount, antimicrobial activity, and specific antimicrobial activity of saka and its chimeras produced by lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris nz9000 depended on the sp and the expression vector. only l. lactis nz9000 (pnups), producing entp/saka, showed higher bacteriocin production and antimicrobial activity than the natural  saka-producer lactobacillus sakei lb706. the lower antimicrobial activity of the  saka-producer l. lactis nz9000 (pnus) and that of the enta/saka-producer l. lactis nz9000 (pnuas) could be ascribed to secretion of truncated bacteriocins. on the other hand, of the lb. sakei lb706 cultures transformed with the pmg36c-derived vectors only lb. sakei lb706 (pgus) overproducing saka showed a higher antimicrobial activity than lb. sakei lb706. finally, cloning of saka and  entp/saka into ppiczalphaa and pklac2 permitted the production of saka and entp/saka by recombinant pichia pastoris x-33 and kluyveromyces lactis gg799 derivatives although their antimicrobial activity was lower than expected from their production.

TI  == microbial succession and metabolite changes during long-term storage of kimchi.
AB  == kimchi is often stored for a long period of time for a diet during the winter season because it is an essential side dish for korean meals. in this study ph, abundance of bacteria and yeasts, bacterial communities, and metabolites were monitored periodically to investigate the fermentation process of kimchi for 120  d. bacterial abundance increased quickly with a ph decrease after an initial ph increase during the early fermentation period. after 20 d, ph values became relatively stable and free sugars were maintained at relatively constant levels,  indicating that kimchi fermentation by lactic acid bacteria (lab) was almost completed. after that time, a decrease in bacterial abundance and a growth in saccharomyces occurred concurrently with increased free sugar consumption and production of glycerol and ethanol. finally, after 100 d, the growth of candida was observed. community analysis using pyrosequencing revealed that diverse lab including leuconostoc citreum, leuconostoc holzapfelii, lactococcus lactis, and weissella soli were present during the early fermentation period, but the lab community was quickly replaced with lactobacillus sakei, leuconostoc gasicomitatum, and weissella koreensis as the fermentation progressed. metabolite analysis using (1) h-nmr showed that organic acids (lactate, acetate, and succinate) as well as bioactive substances (mannitol and gamma-aminobutyric acid  (gaba)) were produced during the kimchi fermentation, and leuconostoc strains and lactobacillus sakei were identified as the producers of mannitol and gaba, respectively.

TI  == the efficacy of nisin can drastically vary when produced in situ in model cheeses.
AB  == nisin, a bacteriocin produced by strains of lactococcus lactis, has a broad inhibitory effect against gram-positive bacteria. this study investigated the efficacy of nisin z against lactobacillus sakei when produced by a nisin-producing strain l. lactis in model cheeses manufactured with ultrafiltrated milk. these cheeses, containing 0, 4 or 10% of gelatin in their dry matter, were inoculated with both strains. measurement of lb. sakei loss of viability was an indirect indicator of nisin in situ efficacy. after 24 h, the loss of viability of lb. sakei was from 0.73 +/- 0.14 to 3.30 +/- 0.60 log(10) cfu g(-1) in the cheeses with 0 and 10% of gelatin, respectively, indicating a better in situ efficacy of nisin when gelatin was incorporated. however, the concentration of nisin produced by lactococcus was similar (3.5 mug g(-1)) in all model cheeses when measured using an enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (elisa).  the growth of lactococcus was slightly improved when gelatin was incorporated, leading to a higher lactate concentration, which is one of the factors explaining the increased nisin efficacy. these results reinforced previous observations that prediction of nisin efficacy in complex food systems remains difficult.

TI  == identification and characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from mixed pasture of timothy and orchardgrass, and its badly preserved silage.
AB  == in order to understand the relationship between lactic acid bacteria (lab) species and silage fermentation, a total of 65 lab strains isolated from mixed pasture of timothy (phleum pratense l.) and orchardgrass (dactylis glomerata l.), and its badly preserved silages were subjected to phenotypic and genetic analysis. according to these analyses, the isolates were divided into 13 groups,  including enterococcus gallinarum, lactobacillus acidipiscis, l. coryniformis subsp. coryniformis, l. coryniformis subsp. torquens, l. curvatus, l. paraplantarum, l. plantarum subsp. argentoratensis, l. plantarum subsp. plantarum, l. sakei subsp. carnosus, lactococcus garvieae, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, pediococcus acidilactici, pediococcus pentosaceus, weissella hellenica, weissella paramesenteroides and carnobacterium divergens. this is the first report to document that c. divergens, l. acidipiscis, l. sakei subsp. carnosus, l. garvieae, phenotypically novel l. lactis subsp. cremoris, e. gallinarum and w. hellenica are present in vegetative  forage crops. l. plantarum group strains were most frequently isolated from the badly preserved silages. some isolates showed a wide range of growth preferences  for carbohydrate utilization, optimal growth ph and temperature in vitro, indicating that they have a high growth potential. these results are useful in understanding the diversity of lab associated with decayed silage of timothy and  orchardgrass.

TI  == genotypic and phenotypic characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from italian ryegrass silage.
AB  == twenty-three lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from three cultivars (akiaoba, nagahahikari and tachiwase) of italian ryegrass (lolium multiflorum lam.) silage  were precisely characterized by a combination of phenotypic tests, genotypic 16s  ribosomal dna sequencing and rapid pcr-based analyses, focusing on their useful phenotypes for silage preparation as inoculants. we successfully identified both  at the species and subspecies levels: phenotypically novel lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus coryniformis subsp. torquens,  lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum, lactobacillus sakei subsp. carnosus, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum and pediococcus parvulus. this is the first report to elucidate the presence of lactobacillus coryniformis ssp. torquens and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum in italian ryegrass silages. physiological and biochemical tests revealed that phenotypic characteristics are different among the different strains of the same species and subspecies, and that the isolates show unique and diverse phenotypes related to fermentation factors, such as available carbohydrates, optimal growth ph and temperature. these results suggest that, for various well-preserved silage preparations, the isolates may be useful in producing novel inoculants corresponding to their optimally climatic and ecological niches.

TI  == protein expression vector and secretion signal peptide optimization to drive the  production, secretion, and functional expression of the bacteriocin enterocin a in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == replacement of the leader sequence (ls) of the bacteriocin enterocin a (ls(enta)) by the signal peptides (sp) of the protein usp45 (sp(usp45)), and the bacteriocins enterocin p (sp(entp)), and hiracin jm79 (sp(hirjm79)) permits the production, secretion, and functional expression of enta by different lactic acid bacteria (lab). chimeric genes encoding the sp(usp45), the sp(entp), and the sp(hirjm79) fused to mature enta plus the enta immunity genes (enta+entia) were cloned into the expression vectors pnz8048 and pmsp3545, under control of the inducible p(nisa) promoter, and in pmg36c, under control of the constitutive p(32) promoter. the amount, antimicrobial activity, and specific antimicrobial activity of the enta produced by the recombinant lactococcus lactis, enterococcus faecium, e. faecalis, lactobacillus sakei and pediococcus acidilactici hosts varied depending on the signal peptide, the expression vector, and the host strain. however, the antimicrobial activity and the specific antimicrobial activity of the enta produced by most of the lab transformants was lower than expected from their production. the supernatants of the recombinant l. lactis nz9000 (pnzuai) and l. lactis nz9000 (pnzhai), overproducers of enta, showed a 1.2- to 5.1-fold higher antimicrobial activity than that of the natural producer  e. faecium t136 against different listeria spp.

TI  == isolation and characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ripe mulberries in taiwan.
AB  == the objective of this study was to isolate, characterize, and identify lactic acid bacteria (lab) from ripe mulberries collected in taiwan. ripe mulberry samples were collected at five mulberry farms, located in different counties of taiwan. eighty-eight acid-producing cultures were isolated from these samples, and isolates were divided into classes first by phenotype, then into groups by restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis and sequencing of 16s ribosomal dna (rdna). phenotypic and biochemical characteristics led to identification of four bacterial groups (a to d). weissella cibaria was the most  abundant type of lab distributed in four mulberry farms, and lactobacillus plantarum was the most abundant lab found in the remaining farm. ten w. cibaria and one lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis isolate produced bacteriocins against the indicator strain lactobacillus sakei jcm 1157(t). these results suggest that  various lab are distributed in ripe mulberries and w. cibaria was the most abundant lab found in this study.

TI  == microbiota analysis of caspian sea yogurt, a ropy fermented milk circulated in japan.
AB  == we analyzed the microbiota of domestic ropy fermented milk, caspian sea yogurt (or 'kasupikai yohguruto' in japanese), circulated in japan. we collected six varieties from five localities. lactococcus (l) lactis ssp. cremoris was isolated from all samples as the dominant strain at levels of 10(8)-10(9) cfu/g. we show this strain produces an extracellular polysaccharide (eps) that causes the unique characteristic viscosity of the product. from analysis of the rapd pattern of 60  bacterial isolates from the six samples, we found that 59 strains from a total of 60 isolates were identical and produced this viscosity. furthermore, pfge analysis of representative strains from each sample indicated that the isolates could be classified into four subgroups. this suggests these l. lactis ssp. cremoris strains found in caspian sea yogurt may have been slightly mutated during subculture in japan. in addition, lactobacillus (l.) sakei ssp. sakei were isolated from three samples; l. plantarum, gluconoacetobacter sacchari and acetobacter aceti were isolated from two samples; and l. paracasei, l. kefiri, leuconostoc (leu.) mesenteroides were isolated from one sample.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus sakei r1333 isolated  from smoked salmon.
AB  == strain r1333, isolated from commercially available smoked salmon, was identified  as lactobacillus sakei based on biochemical tests, sugar fermentation reactions (api 50 chl), pcr with species-specific primers and sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. strain r1333 produces a 3811 kda class iia bacteriocin, active against streptococcus caprinus, streptococcus macedonicus, streptococcus spp., l. sakei,  lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, listeria innocua, listeria ivanovii subsp. ivanovii and listeria monocytogenes. the mode of activity against l. innocua 2030c and l. ivanovii subsp. ivanovii atcc 19119 was bactericidal, resulting in cell lysis and enzyme- and dna-leakage. the highest level of activity (1600 au/ml) was recorded when cells were grown at 30 degrees c in mrs broth (initial ph 6.5). only 800 au/ml was recorded when strain r1333 was grown in mrs without tween 80. lower levels of bacteriocin production were recorded when strain r1333  was grown in mrs at 20 degrees c. peptide r1333 adsorbs at low levels (200 au/ml) to producer cells. purification of bacteriocin r1333 was performed by 60% ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by separation on a seppak c(18) column and reverse-phase hplc on a nucleosil c(18) column with a linear gradient from 0.1% tfa to 90% acetonitryl. a molecular mass of 3811 kda was determined by mass  spectrometry. based on mass spectrometry and sequencing of the pcr amplified fragment targeting the sakg gene, l. sakei r1333 is a potential producer of sakacin g. this is the first report of the identification of sakacin g produced by l. sakei isolated from smoked salmon.

TI  == high-level expression of lactobacillus beta-galactosidases in lactococcus lactis  using the food-grade, nisin-controlled expression system nice.
AB  == in this work the overlapping genes (lacl and lacm) encoding heterodimeric beta-galactosidases from lactobacillus reuteri , lb. acidophilus , lb. sakei , and lb. plantarum were cloned into two different nisin-controlled expression (nice) vectors and expressed using lactococcus lactis nz9000 and nz3900 as hosts. the lacl gene, encoding the large subunit of the beta-galactosidases, was fused translationally downstream of the nisin-inducible promoter nisa. chloramphenicol  was employed as selection marker for the standard system using l. lactis nz9000,  whereas lactose utilization based on the complementation of the lacf gene was used as a dominant selection marker for the food-grade system employing l. lactis nz3900. comparison of the standard and the food-grade expression system, differing only in their selection markers, gave considerable differences in volumetric beta-galactosidase activity, ranging from 1.17 to 14 ku/l of fermentation broth, depending on both the origin of the laclm genes and the selection marker used. the occurrence of codons less frequently used by l. lactis especially at the beginning of the lacl gene could be an explanation for the significant differences between the expression levels of laclm from different origins, while plasmid stability might cause the difference obtained when employing the different selection markers.

TI  == inhibition by lactobacillus sakei of other species in the flora of vacuum packaged raw meats during prolonged storage.
AB  == the abilities of five lactobacillus sakei strains and one lactococcus lactis strain to retain inhibitory activity against several target organisms in the flora of product during 12 weeks storage of vacuum-packaged lamb and beef was investigated. l. sakei strains were generally found capable of developing dominant populations on both beef and lamb. l. lactis 75 grew poorly on lamb did  not inhibit co-inoculated brochothrix thermosphacta. lamb inoculated with the sakacin-a producer l. sakei lb706 had lower listeria monocytogenes populations than lamb inoculated with a bacteriocin-negative variant. in beef packs inoculated with clostridium estertheticum spores and l. sakei strain 27, 44 or 63, the development of blown-pack spoilage was delayed by up to one week. campylobacter jejuni inoculated onto beef was recovered from fewer packs when it  was co-inoculated with 3000 cfu cm(-2) of l. sakei strain 27, 44 or 63. observed  inhibition did not always correlate with inhibition observed in earlier media-based studies, supporting the view that functionality identified using simple media-based screening methods may not be replicated in the complex environment of stored foods, and vice-versa. these findings further define a set  of l. sakei strains with potential for the extended bio-preservation of minimally processed fresh beef and lamb.

TI  == polyphasic taxonomic studies of lactic acid bacteria associated with tunisian fermented meat based on the heterogeneity of the 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic spacer region.
AB  == the objective of this work was to investigate the structure and diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in traditionally fermented meat collected  from different areas of tunisia. a polyphasic study, which involves phenotypic tests and ribosomal dna-based techniques, was used to identify gram-positive and  catalase-negative isolates. pcr amplification of the 16s-23s rdna isr of 102 isolates and other reference lab strains gave (1) one type of rrn operon (m-isr)  for lactococci, (2) two types of rrn operon (s-isr and m-isr) for enterococci, (3) two types of rrn operon (s-isr and l-isr) for lactobacilli, and (4) three pcr amplicons (s-isr, m-isr, and l-isr) obtained for pediococcus spp. and weissella genus. the clustering and comparison of isr-rflp profiles given by the isolates with those given by reference lab strains, allowed their identification as lactococcus lactis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus sanguinicola, enterococcus hawaiiensis, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus alimentarius, pediococcus pentosaceus, and weissella confusa. combined 16s-23s rdna isr and rflp patterns can be considered as a good potential target for a rapid and reliable differentiation between isolates of lab and provided further information on the organization of their rrn operons.

TI  == biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in french wheat sourdough as determined by molecular characterization using species-specific pcr.
AB  == the lactic acid microflora of nine traditional wheat sourdoughs from the midi-pyrenees area (south western france) was previously isolated and preliminary characterized using conventional morphological and biochemical analysis. however, such phenotypic methods alone are not always reliable and have a low taxonomic resolution for identification of lactic acid bacteria species. in the present study, a total of 290 lab isolates were identified by pcr amplification using different sets of specific primers in order to provide a thorough characterization of the lactic flora from these traditional french sourdoughs. overall, the lab isolates belonged to 6 genera: lactobacillus (39%, 8 species), pediococcus (38%, 1 species), leuconostoc (17%, 2 species), weissella (4%, 2 species), lactococcus (1%, 1 species) and enterococcus (<1%, 1 species) and 15 different species were detected: l. plantarum, l. curvatus, l. paracasei, l. sanfranciscensis, l. pentosus, l. paraplantarum, l. sakei, l. brevis, p. pentosaceus, l. mesenteroides, l. citreum, w. cibaria, w. confusa, l. lactis and  e. hirae. facultative heterofermentative lab represent more than 76% of the total isolates, the main species isolated herein correspond to l. plantarum and p. pentosaceus. obligate heterofermentative lactobacilli (l. sanfranciscencis, l. brevis) represent less than 3% of the total isolates whereas leuconostoc and weissella species represent 21% of the total isolates and have been detected in eight of the nine samples. detection of some lab species was preferentially observed depending on the isolation culture medium. the number of different species within a sourdough varies from 3 to 7 and original associations of hetero- and homofermentative lab species have been revealed. results from this study clearly confirm the diversity encountered in the microbial community of traditional sourdough and highlight the importance of lab cocci in the sourdough  ecosystem, along with lactobacilli.

TI  == inhibition of uropathogens by lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairy foods and  cow's intestine in western nigeria.
AB  == a total of 96 lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from african indigenous fermented products and cow's intestines to study their inhibitory capability against multi-drug-resistant uropathogens. escherichia coli accounted for approximately 45% of isolated uropathogens, followed by staphylococcus spp. (20%). the gram negative uropathogens were highly resistant to quinolones, co-trimoxazole, teicoplanin and some beta-lactams, while the staphylococcus spp.  showed high resistance to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams and macrolides. twenty-four lab isolates were selected based on their antimicrobial activity against two uropathogenic staphylococcus aureus strains and bacteriocin production. lab strains showing antimicrobial activity were grouped into smaller  groups through amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). representative strains were identified as weissella spp., enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus brevis through sequencing of 16s rdna. the weissella spp. and l. brevis strains demonstrated remarkable inhibitory activity  against seven strains of gram negative uropathogens. two strains of l. lactis produced a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance active against lactobacillus sakei. in this study, an unusual high rate of co-trimoxazole, quinolones and macrolides resistance among uropathogens from south west nigeria was discovered.  based on their sensitivity to weissella spp., there is a potential for using these lab as a natural approach for the protection against the uropathogens assayed.

TI  == development of a new method for the detection of lactic acid bacteria capable of  protecting ham against enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == aims: challenge trials seem to be the best assessment approach to evaluate the potency of food protective cultures. however, this method is time consuming and often difficult to implement. here, we describe the development of the 'sequential culturing method', a new method for the screening of strains as protective cultures. methods and results: the sequential culturing method is based on the simulation, in a meat simulation medium (named bhi5l200), of the inhibition of enterobacteriaceae by lactobacillus, observed previously in situ. results obtained with this sequential culturing method were in good agreement with those of the challenge test on sliced cooked ham and confirmed the antagonistic potency of lactobacillus. the results obtained from the screening of 187 lactic acid bacteria (lab) indicated that lactobacillus sakei, lactococcus lactis diacetylactis and carnobacterium spp. were strong inhibitors of enterobacteriaceae whereas pediococcus spp., leuconostoc spp., weisselia spp. and other species of lactobacillus and lactococcus, did not possess the same inhibitory capacity. conclusions: sequential culturing method appeared to be a useful tool to rapidly select lab cultures which are good candidates for bioprotection of meat. significance and impact of the study: sequential culturing method and simulating media could efficiently mimic challenge test experiments in the selection of potential protective culture for all types of food, on the condition to have the appropriate simulating media, corresponding to the food for which protective cultures were searched.

TI  == diversity of the bacterial community found in samma-narezushi (saury narezushi) revealed by the 16s rrna gene clone library.
AB  == narezushi is one of japanese traditional foods and is made by fermenting salted fish meat and cooked rice together. in this study, the microbial diversity of samma-narezushi (narezushi using saury, cobolabis saira) was analyzed by the 16s  ribosomal rna gene (rdna) clone library. randomly selected 89 clones were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. the sequences were classified into 12 operational taxonomy units (otus) at the 97% identity threshold. most of the clones (89%) were lactic acid bacteria (lab) and included lactobacillus sakei, leuconostoc gelidum, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and l. pisium. the most predominant clone was l. sakei at 72% of the clones. the second most abundant clone was l. gelidum. these results suggest that l. sakei mainly contributes to the lactic acid fermentation process, taste and flavor of samma-narezushi. the present study showed that the culture independent method is useful for the microbial diversity analysis of narezushi.

AB  == the low-copy-number plasmid prv500, belonging to the pucl287 group of theta-type  plasmids, was previously isolated from lactobacillus sakei and characterized. we  show here that the replicon of this plasmid enables replication also in enterococcus faecalis and bacillus subtilis but not in lactococcus lactis. a 1.25 kb region encompassing the iterons and the repa gene was sufficient for replication, copy-number control and relative stable maintenance in l. sakei. functional implications of host or plasmid-borne factors in the maintenance of pucl287-type plasmids are discussed. the minimal replicon from prv500 was fused to pbluescript for constructing the shuttle e. coli/lactobacilli cloning vector prv610. prv610 enables the white/blue lacz alpha-complementation in e. coli. the  cassettes for selection (erythromycin resistance) and replication (iterons and repa gene) are each bordered by unique restriction sites for easy replacement if  needed. derivatives in which chloramphenicol or tetracycline resistance replaced  erythromycin resistance were constructed. in order to allow inducible gene expression, a copper-inducible promoter was placed on the prv613 derivative. expression of the downstream reporter gene lacz was shown to be induced by 30 microm cuso(4).

TI  == isolation and characteristics of lactic acid bacteria from koshu vineyards in japan.
AB  == aims: to isolate, characterize and identify lactic acid bacteria (lab) in the vineyards where koshu grapes, a primary wine grape cultivar in japan, are grown.  methods and results: sixty samples, including leaves, undamaged grape berries and soil under damaged berries, were collected at four koshu vineyards in yamanashi prefecture, japan. one hundred and 15 acid-producing cultures were isolated from  these samples, and the isolates were divided into classes by phenotype and then into groups by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of 16s ribosomal dna (rdna). phenotypic and biochemical characteristics identified seven different bacterial groups (a to g). lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis was the most abundant type of lab distributed in three koshu vineyards, and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides was the most abundant lab found in the remaining vineyard. forty-six isolates produced bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (blis) against the indicator strain lactobacillus sakei jcm 1157(t). conclusions: these results suggest that various lab are distributed in koshu vineyards, of which a large number produce blis. significance and impact of the study: this is the first report describing the distribution and varieties of lab  that exist in koshu vineyards.

TI  == cloning and heterologous production of hiracin jm79, a sec-dependent bacteriocin  produced by enterococcus hirae dch5, in lactic acid bacteria and pichia pastoris.
AB  == hiracin jm79 (hirjm79), a sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by enterococcus hirae dch5, was cloned and produced in lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and pichia pastoris. for heterologous production of hirjm79 in lactic acid bacteria (lab), the hirjm79 structural gene (hirjm79), with or without the hirjm79 immunity gene (hirijm79),  was cloned into the plasmid pmg36c under the control of the constitutive promoter p(32) and into the plasmid pnz8048 under the control of the inducible p(nisa) promoter. for the production of hirjm79 in p. pastoris, the gene encoding the mature hirjm79 protein was cloned into the ppiczalphaa expression vector. the recombinant plasmids permitted the production of biologically active hirjm79 in the supernatants of l. lactis il1403, l. lactis nz9000, l. sakei lb790, e. faecalis jh2-2, and p. pastoris x-33, the coproduction of hirjm79 and nisin a in  l. lactis dpc5598, and the coproduction of hirjm79 and enterocin p in e. faecium  l50/14-2. all recombinant lab produced larger quantities of hirjm79 than e. hirae dch5, although the antimicrobial activities of most transformants were lower than that predicted from their production of hirjm79. the synthesis, processing, and secretion of hirjm79 proceed efficiently in recombinant lab strains and p. pastoris.

TI  == isolation of lactic acid bacteria with inhibitory activity against pathogens and  spoilage organisms associated with fresh meat.
AB  == the use of lactic acid bacteria (lab) as protective cultures in vacuum-packed chill-stored meat has potential application for assuring and improving food quality, safety and market access. in a study to identify candidate strains suitable for evaluation in a meat model, agar-based methods were employed to screen 181 chilled meat and meat process-related lab for strains inhibitory to pathogens and spoilage organisms of importance to the meat industry. six meat-derived strains, including lactobacillus sakei and lactococcus lactis, were  found to be inhibitory to one or more of the target strains listeria monocytogenes, brochothrix thermosphacta, campylobacter jejuni and clostridium estertheticum. the inhibitory agents appeared to be either cell-associated or molecules released extracellularly with bacteriocin-like properties. variations detected in the antimicrobial activity of lab associated with changes to test parameters such as substrate composition underlined the importance of further in  situ evaluation of the inhibitory strains in stored meat trials.

TI  == method for reliable isolation of lactobacillus sakei strains originating from tunisian seafood and meat products.
AB  == in tunisia, several food products derived from meat or seafood are naturally processed, without any addition of bacterial starters. such fermented, dried-cured, salted, or marinated products, as well as the raw meat or fish may thus provide a source to isolate the natural microflora colonizing such environments. we isolated lactic acid bacteria from a representative range of flesh-foods sold or manufactured in different parts of tunisia, and selectively searched for lactobacillus sakei, a lactic acid bacterium potentially useful as starter or protective culture. eighty six (86) strains were isolated from various seafood (anchovy, sardine, sole, mullet, and octopus), or meat (pork, veal, beef, sheep, chicken, and turkey) products that were either fresh, or transformed by different traditional processes. several methods were used in order to develop a  rapid and reliable protocol for the direct identification of l. sakei. amplified  ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra) classified the various isolates into 9 distinct groups. search for the presence of the l. sakei specific kata gene indicated that all positive isolates were grouped in the same ardra group. sequencing of 16s rdna confirmed those isolates as l. sakei. those 22 different l. sakei strains represent 25.6% of the total isolates, while other isolates found in the different ardra groups were tentatively ascribed to lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis/garviae, enterococcus avium, streptococcus parauberis, hafnia alvei, pediococcus pentosaceus, and lactobacillus curvatus through 16s rdna sequencing. a fast and reliable method to isolate and discriminate l. sakei from complex food environments is proposed.

TI  == enhancement of the immune response and protection induced by probiotic lactic acid bacteria against furunculosis in rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss).
AB  == we analysed the effect of probiotic strains on the cellular and humoral immune responses of rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss), and their capacity to prevent furunculosis during a challenge trial. probiotic strains (lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis clfp 100, leuconostoc mesenteroides clfp 196, and lactobacillus sakei clfp 202) were administered orally to fish for 2 weeks at 10(6) cfu g(-1) of feed. in  comparison to untreated control fish, the phagocytic activity of head kidney leukocytes and the alternative complement activity in serum were significantly greater in all probiotic groups at the end of the second week. with the exception of the group fed with lactobacillus sakei, superoxide anion production was also significantly increased in the probiotic groups. analysis of lysozyme activity did not exhibit any significant difference in the probiotic and control groups. fifteen days after the start of the probiotic feeding, fish were challenged with  aeromonas salmonicida ssp. salmonicida. the fish supplemented with probiotics exhibited survival rates ranging from 97.8% to 100%, whereas survival was 65.6% in fish not treated with the probiotics. these results demonstrate that probiotic supplementation to fish can reduce the severity of furunculosis, and suggest that this reduction may be associated with enhanced humoral and cellular immune response.

TI  == optimization of conditions for profiling bacterial populations in food by culture-independent methods.
AB  == in this study we used culture-independent methods to profile bacterial populations in food products. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and  fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) were employed in order to identify bacterial species without the need of isolation and biochemical identification. the protocols used to extract the dna, subsequently subjected to pcr amplification for dgge, as well as the hybridization procedure for fish, were optimised. moreover, an extensive study on the primers and probes to be used for  the direct detection and identification of microorganisms commonly found in food, was carried out. meat and cheese samples, fresh or processed, were subjected to dgge and fish analysis and the results obtained highlighted how the processing in food industry is decreasing the bacterial biodiversity. not only processed cheese or meat but also fermented products were dominated by only one or few species. lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus curvatus and brochothrix thermosphacta were the main species found in meat products, while in cheese(s) lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and leuconostoc spp. were repeatedly detected. the results obtained by the two culture-independent methods used always correlated well.

TI  == changes in intestinal microbiota and humoral immune response following probiotic  administration in brown trout (salmo trutta).
AB  == we studied the effect of several lactic acid bacteria (lab) on the humoral response of brown trout (salmo trutta). lab groups (lactococcus (lc.) lactis ssp. lactis, lactobacillus (lb.) sakei and leuconostoc (leu.) mesenteroides) were administered orally at 10(6) colony-forming units/g feed to brown trout for 2 weeks, after which fish were switched to an unsupplemented feed. blood and intestinal samples were taken from the onset of feeding supplemented diets at 1,  2, 3 and 4 weeks. during the lab-feeding period, lc. lactis ssp. lactis, lb. sakei and leu. mesenteroides persisted in the fish intestines, but the number of  lab slowly decreased in the intestines after changing to the unsupplemented diet. only lb. lactis ssp. lactis and leu. mesenteroides were detected at levels above  1 x 10(2) colony-forming units/g at the end of the fourth week. in comparison to  untreated control fish, the alternative complement activity in the serum was found to be significantly greater in all lab groups at the end of the second week. groups supplemented with lc. lactis ssp. lactis and leu. mesenteroides exhibited an elevated level of lysozyme activity at the end of the third week, but the group supplemented with lb. sakei did not exhibit any significant change  in lysozyme activity. serum immunoglobulin levels were higher compared with the control group, but there was no significant difference between the lab and control groups.

TI  == common mechanisms of target cell recognition and immunity for class ii bacteriocins.
AB  == the mechanisms of target cell recognition and producer cell self-protection (immunity) are both important yet poorly understood issues in the biology of peptide bacteriocins. in this report, we provide genetic and biochemical evidence that lactococcin a, a permeabilizing peptide-bacteriocin from lactococcus lactis, uses components of the mannose phosphotransferase system (man-pts) of susceptible cells as target/receptor. we present experimental evidence that the immunity protein lcia forms a strong complex with the receptor proteins and the bacteriocin, thereby preventing cells from being killed. importantly, the complex between lcia and the man-pts components (iiab, iic, and iid) appears to involve an on-off type mechanism that allows complex formation only in the presence of bacteriocin; otherwise no complexes were observed between lcia and the receptor proteins. deletion of the man-pts operon combined with biochemical studies revealed that the presence of the membrane-located components iic and iid was sufficient for sensitivity to lactococcin a as well as complex formation with lcia. the cytoplasmic component of the man-pts, iiab, was not required for the biological sensitivity or for complex formation. furthermore, heterologous expression of the lactococcal man-pts operon rendered the insensitive lactobacillus sakei susceptible to lactococcin a. we also provide evidence that,  not only lactococcin a, but other class ii peptide-bacteriocins including lactococcin b and some listeria-active pediocin-like bacteriocins also target the man-pts components iic and iid on susceptible cells and that their immunity proteins involve a mechanism in producer cell self-protection similar to that observed for lcia.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

[piraino, p., ricciardi, a., lanorte, m. t., malkhazova, i., parente, e., 2002. a new procedure for data reduction in electrophoretic fingerprints of whole-cell proteins. biotechnol. lett. 24, 1477-1482]. hierarchical cluster analysis provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns but was unable to discriminate some species (leuconostoc, lb. sakei/lb. curvatus, lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus, lb. plantarum/lb. paraplantarum, lc. lactis/lc. raffinolactis). a 7x7 kohonen self-organizing map (ksom), trained with the patterns of the reference strains, provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns and was able to discriminate more species than hierarchical cluster analysis. the map was used in predictive mode to identify unknown strains and provided results which in 85.5% of cases matched the classification obtained by hierarchical cluster analysis. two supervised tools, linear discriminant analysis and a 23:5:2 bayesian network  were proven to be highly effective in the discrimination of sds-page patterns of  lc. lactis from those of other species. we conclude that data reduction by logistic weighting coupled to traditional multivariate statistical analysis or artificial neural networks provide an effective tool for the classification and identification of lactic acid bacteria on the basis of sds-page patterns of whole cell proteins.

TI  == molecular characterization and regulatory analysis of dnak operon of halophilic lactic acid bacterium tetragenococcus halophila.
AB  == we have cloned and characterized the dnak operon of tetragenococcus halophila jcm5888. nucleotide sequence analysis of cloned fragments showed that the dnak operon consists of four open reading frames with the organization hrca-grpe-dnak-dnaj. two regulatory circe (controlling inverted repeat of chaperone expression) elements were identified in the region up-stream of hrca. the t. halophila dnak encoded a protein of 618 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 67 kda. the deduced amino acid sequence of t. halophila dnak showed high similarities with those of the corresponding dnak homologues of lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus sakei and bacillus subtilis. using a pet expression system, the t. halophila dnak was overexpressed in escherichia coli and the purified dnak was found to exhibit atpase and refolding activities. northern hybridization analysis revealed that the transcription of the dnak gene  was induced by heat shock, and several transcripts were detected including a tetra-cistronic mrna with a maximum size of 4.9-kb which corresponds to the transcript of the complete dnak operon. the amount of dnak transcripts increased  about 3.5-fold at high nacl concentration of 3-4 m, but not at the same kcl concentrations. these results suggest that the cloned dnak acts as a functional molecular chaperone and plays an important role in salinity adaptation.

AB  == in this study, a polyphasic approach was used to study the ecology of fresh sausages and to characterize populations of lactic acid bacteria (lab). the microbial profile of fresh sausages was monitored from the production day to the  10th day of storage at 4 degrees c. samples were collected on days 0, 3, 6, and 10, and culture-dependent and -independent methods of detection and identification were applied. traditional plating and isolation of lab strains, which were subsequently identified by molecular methods, and the application of pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) to dna and rna extracted directly from the fresh sausage samples allowed the study in detail of the changes in the bacterial and yeast populations during storage. brochothrix thermosphacta and lactobacillus sakei were the main populations present. in particular, b. thermosphacta was present throughout the process, as determined by both dna and rna analysis. other bacterial species, mainly staphylococcus xylosus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and l. curvatus, were detected by dgge. moreover, an uncultured bacterium and an uncultured staphylococcus sp. were present, too. lab strains isolated at day 0 were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, l. casei, and enterococcus casseliflavus, and on day 3 a strain of leuconostoc mesenteroides was identified. the remaining strains isolated belonged to l. sakei. concerning the yeast ecology, only debaryomyces hansenii was established in the fresh sausages. capronia mansonii was initially present, but it was not detected after the first 3 days. at last, l. sakei isolates were characterized by randomly amplified polymorphic dna pcr and repetitive dna element pcr. the results obtained underlined how different populations took over  at different steps of the process. this is believed to be the result of the selection of the particular population, possibly due to the low storage temperature employed.

TI  == efficacy of nisin in combination with protective cultures against listeria monocytogenes scott a in tofu.
AB  == nisin can be used as a biopreservative to control growth of listeria monocytogenes in various minimally processed foods. tofu is an example of a non-fermented soybean product, which may allow growth of listeria at refrigeration temperatures and in which nisin may be applied to prevent multiplication of listeria. the efficacy of nisin against listeria may be compromised by the emergence of spontaneous nisin-resistant mutants. exposure of  l. monocytogenes scott a to nisin in a culture medium or in a food product results in an initial reduction of listeria population which is followed by regrowth of survivors to nisin during further incubation. in vitro studies using  standard i nutrient broth showed that enterococcus faecium bfe 900-6a and lactobacillus sakei lb 706-1a used as protective cultures in combination with nisin were able to suppress proliferation of listeria cells not killed by nisin at 10 degrees c. growth and bacteriocin production of these two strains and a third protective culture, lactococcus lactis bfe 902 was also observed in soymilk and tofu at 10 degrees c. inoculation studies with tofu prepared with nisin and protective cultures showed that lower amounts of nisin are required for an effective inhibition of l. monocytogenes scott a when either e. faecium bfe 900-6a or lc. lactis bfe 902 are used in addition. the combination of nisin with  these bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (lab) resulted in a complete suppression of listerial growth in homemade tofu stored at 10 degrees c for 1 week. lb. sakei lb 706-1a was less effective and did not prevent a slight increase of l. monocytogenes scott a numbers during storage.

AB  == exopolysaccharides (epss) produced by lactic acid bacteria, which are common in fermented foods, are claimed to have various beneficial physiological effects on  humans. although the biodegradability of epss is important in relation to the bioactive properties, knowledge on this topic is limited. therefore, the biodegradability of eight epss, six of which were produced by lactic acid bacteria, was compared with microorganisms from human feces or soil. eps-degradation was determined from the decrease in polysaccharide-sugar concentration and by high-performance size exclusion chromatography (hpsec). xanthan, clavan, and the epss produced by streptococcus thermophilus sfi 39 and sfi 12 were readily degraded, in contrast to the epss produced by lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris b40, lactobacillus sakei 0-1, s. thermophilus sfi20, and lactobacillus helveticus lh59. clearly, the susceptibility of exopolysaccharides  to biological breakdown can differ greatly, implying that the physiological effects of these compounds may also vary a lot.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of gram-positive bacteria based on grpe, encoded by the dnak operon.
AB  == the dnak operon in gram-positive bacteria includes grpe, dnaj and, in some members, hrca as well. both dnak and dnaj have been utilized for constructing phylogenetic relationships among various organisms. multiple copies exist for dnak and dnaj genes in some bacterial genera, as opposed to a single gene copy for grpe and for hrca, according to the currently available data. here, we present a partial protein-based phylogenetic tree for gram-positive bacteria, derived by using the amino acid sequence identity of grpe; the results are compared with the phylogenetic trees generated from 5s rrna, 16s rrna, dnak and dnaj sequences. our results indicate three main groupings: two are within low-g+c dna gram-positive bacteria comprising bacillus species and staphylococcus aureus  on the one hand and streptococcus species/lactococcus lactis/enterococcus faecalis/lactobacillus sakei on the other hand; the mycobacterium species and streptomyces coelicolor, belonging to the high-g+c dna gram-positive bacteria, form the third cluster. this hierarchical arrangement is in close agreement with  that obtained with 16s rrna and dnak sequences but not dnaj-based phylogeny.
