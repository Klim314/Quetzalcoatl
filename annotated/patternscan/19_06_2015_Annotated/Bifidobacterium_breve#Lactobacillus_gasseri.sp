TI  == rna of enterococcus faecalis strain ec-12 is a major component inducing interleukin-12 production from human monocytic cells.
AB  == interleukin-12 (il-12) is an important cytokine for the immunomodulatory effects  of lactic acid bacteria (lab). using murine immune cells, we previously reported  that the rna of enterococcus faecalis ec-12, a lab strain exerting probiotic-like beneficial effects, is the major il-12-inducing immunogenic component. however, it was recently revealed that bacterial rna can be a ligand for toll-like receptor (tlr) 13, which is only expressed in mice. because tlr13 is not expressed in humans, the immuno-stimulatory and -modulatory effects of lab rna in human cells should be augmented excluding tlr13 contribution. in experiment 1 of  this study, the role of lab rna in il-12 induction in human immune cells was studied using three lab strains, e.faecalis ec-12, lactobacillus gasseri jcm5344, and bifidobacterium breve jcm1192. rnase a treatment of heat-killed lab significantly decreased the il-12 production of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells on stimulation, while rnase iii treatment revealed virtually no effects. further, il-12 production against heat-killed e. faecalis ec-12 was abolished by depleting monocytes. these results demonstrated that single stranded rna (ssrna) of lab is a strong inducer of il-12 production from human monocytes.  in experiment 2, major receptor for ssrna of e. faecalis ec-12 was identified using thp-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line. the type of rna molecules of e. faecalis ec-12 responsible for il-12 induction was also identified. il-12 production induced by the total rna of e. faecalis ec-12 was significantly reduced by the treatment of sirna for tlr8 but not for tlr7. furthermore, both 23s and 16s rrna, but not mrna, of e. faecalis ec-12 markedly induced il-12 production from thp-1 cells. these results suggested that the recognition of ssrna of e. faecalis ec-12 was mediated by tlr8 and that rrna was the rna molecule that exhibited il-12-inducing ability in human cells.

TI  == lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in human breast milk: influence of antibiotherapy and other host and clinical factors.
AB  == objective: the objective of this work was to study the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria population in human milk of healthy women, and to investigate the  influence that several factors (including antibioteraphy during pregnancy and lactation, country and date of birth, delivery mode, or infant age) may exert on  such population. methods: a total of 160 women living in germany or austria provided the breast milk samples. initially, 66 samples were randomly selected and cultured on mrs-cys agar plates. then, the presence of dna from the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium, and from most of the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species that were isolated, was assessed by qualitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using genus- and species-specific primers. results: lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could be isolated from the milk of 27 (40.91%) and 7 (10.61%), respectively, of the 66 cultured samples. on the contrary, lactobacillus and bifidobacterium sequences were detected by pcr in 108 (67.50%) and 41 (25.62%), respectively, of the 160 samples analyzed. the lactobacillus species most frequently isolated and detected was l salivarius (35.00%), followed by l fermentum (25.00%) and l gasseri (21.88%), whereas b breve (13.75%) was the bifidobacterial species most commonly recovered and whose  dna was most regularly found. the number of lactobacilli- or bifidobacteria-positive samples was significantly lower in women who had received antibiotherapy during pregnancy or lactation. conclusions: our results suggest that either the presence of lactobacilli and/or bifidobacteria or their dna may constitute good markers of a healthy human milk microbiota that has not been altered by the use of antibiotics.

TI  == characterization of intestinal bacteria tightly bound to the human ileal epithelium.
AB  == in order to perform selective isolation of bacteria tightly bound to the human gut, ileal biopsies of healthy volunteers were treated to wash out the mucus layer and loosely bound bacterial cells. rod-shaped anaerobic bacteria that had remained attached to the epithelial cells were isolated and identified at the species level. one isolate was identified as belonging to the bifidobacterium breve species, while all the others were lactobacilli of only two species, lactobacillus mucosae and lactobacillus gasseri. members of these species were found previously in intestinal samples, but their predominance among bacteria strictly associated with the epithelium was not suspected before and suggests that these species may represent a specific subpopulation of tissue-bound bacteria. physiological analysis indicated that all isolates were able to produce antimicrobials, grow and form biofilm in simulated intestinal fluid after exposure to gastric conditions. some isolates were able to degrade mucin while none showed cytotoxicity in vitro on ht29 cells. the tight association of the strains isolated with ileal epithelial cells is presumably indicative of a direct interaction with the host cells. for this reason and for the absence of cytotoxicity in vitro, those isolates can be proposed as potential probiotic strains for human use.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of atopobium vaginae.
AB  == background: previous studies have indicated that a recently described anaerobic bacterium, atopobium vaginae is associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv). thus far the four isolates of this fastidious micro-organism were found to be highly resistant to metronidazole and susceptible for clindamycin, two antibiotics preferred for the treatment of bv. methods: nine strains of atopobium vaginae, four strains of gardnerella vaginalis, two strains of lactobacillus iners and one strain each of bifidobacterium breve, b. longum, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l.  jensenii were tested against 15 antimicrobial agents using the etest. results: all nine strains of a. vaginae were highly resistant to nalidixic acid and colistin while being inhibited by low concentrations of clindamycin (range: < 0.016 microg/ml), rifampicin (< 0.002 microg/ml), azithromycin (< 0.016-0.32 microg/ml), penicillin (0.008-0.25 microg/ml), ampicillin (< 0.016-0.94 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (0.023-0.25 microg/ml) and linezolid (0.016-0.125 microg/ml). we found a variable susceptibility for metronidazole, ranging from 2  to more than 256 microg/ml. the four g. vaginalis strains were also susceptible for clindamycin (< 0.016-0.047 microg/ml) and three strains were susceptible to less than 1 microg/ml of metronidazole. all lactobacilli were resistant to metronidazole (> 256 microg/ml) but susceptible to clindamycin (0.023-0.125 microg/ml). conclusion: clindamycin has higher activity against g. vaginalis and  a. vaginae than metronidazole, but not all a. vaginae isolates are metronidazole  resistant, as seemed to be a straightforward conclusion from previous studies on  a more limited number of strains.

TI  == the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora of the human intestine: composition and succession.
AB  == lactobacillus and bifidobacterial cultures are increasingly used as probiotics in pharmaceuticals and in foods. the selection of strains is performed often for technological rather than for microecological reasons. detailed reports about species and strains composition of these microorganisms in the intestinal microflora of man are rare. our investigations were performed with samples originating from infants and adults, taken from faeces and from upper sections of the intestinal tract including mouth and stomach, and from caecum and colon. post mortem cases as well as test subjects under physiological conditions were analyzed using an automatic capsule system sampling at defined times in different parts of the intestinal tract. the fate of selected strains after oral intake was studied, too. furthermore, influences of the microflora originating from food were considered. the identification of autochthonous (indigenous) and allochthonous (transient) species could be achieved with descriptions of new species in the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. l. gasseri and l. reuteri proved to be predominant autochthonous lactobacillus species in infants as well as in adults. both species were occasionally present even in the stomach. this was also the case with an anaerobic lactic acid bacterium, previously named  catenabacterium catenaforme, later classified as l. ruminis, a non-motile variant of this species. the bifidobacterial microflora differed in composition between infants and adults and in different stages of the host's life. up to 5 species or special strains of bifidobacteria could be present in different, individually fixed, combinations. species typical for infants were b. bifidum, b. infantis, b. breve, and b. parvulorum. typical for adults were 4 different variants of b. adolescentis. b. bifidum and b. longum could often be found in both groups, but in lower numbers. b. longum showed some oxygen tolerance whereas b. bifidum and b. adolescentis required strict anaerobic and fastidious conditions for cultivation. the autochthonous lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora in man will remain stable life-long. with lactobacilli, however, some successions may be caused by transient species derived from food or from the oral cavity, thus giving the impression of an altered microflora. nevertheless l. gasseri, l.  reuteri, l. ruminis, and to some degree, l. salivarius, may be present as autochthonous species all of the time. with bifidobacteria, a decreasing tendency in counts and in multiple composition in elderly people exists. furthermore, this microflora is also influenced by consumption habits, which are probably caused by geographical circumstances.

TI  == lactobacillus- and bifidobacterium-mediated antigenotoxicity in the colon of rats.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are proposed to have several beneficial effects, including the inactivation of carcinogens. we have studied the potential of lactobacillus acidophilus (from a commercially available yogurt), lactobacillus gasseri (p79), lactobacillus confusus (dsm20196), streptococcus thermophilus (ncim 50083), bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium longum (from human infant stool) to prevent the induction of dna damage by n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng, 7.5 mg/kg body wt) in colon cells of  the rat. using the new technique of single cell microgel electrophoresis, all investigated strains were antigenotoxic toward mnng after a single dose of 10(10) viable cells/kg body wt p.o. eight hours before the carcinogen. one-half and one-tenth of this initial dose resulted in a loss of protective activity. high doses of heat-treated l. acidophilus strains were also not antigenotoxic. one mechanism of the preventive effect could be that bacterial metabolites or components are responsible. accordingly, selected examples were investigated in vitro in colon cells of the rat. metabolically active l. acidophilus cells, as well as an acetone extract of the culture, prevented mnng-induced dna damage. different cell fractions from l. acidophilus (cytoplasm, cell wall skeleton, cell wall) were devoid of antigenotoxic activity, whereas the peptidoglycan fraction and whole freeze-dried cells were antigenotoxic. as a second carcinogen, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh) was used. a dose- and time-response study was first performed to assess the effects of dmh in several segments of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract. exposure for 16 hours to 15 or 25 mg dmh/kg body wt  p.o. induced dna damage in cells of the distal colon of rats, whereas no cytotoxicity was seen. pretreatment orally with lab on four consecutive mornings  before dmh gavage (8 hours after the last lab application) revealed that l. acidophilus, l. confusus, l. gasseri, b. longum, and b. breve inhibited the genotoxic effect of dmh. one of four s. thermophilus and one of three lactobacillus delbrueckeii ssp. bulgaricus strains were also protective. heat-treated l. acidophilus did not inhibit dmh-induced genotoxicity. a few aliquots of the colon cells were processed immunohistochemically for the presence of the "proliferation cell nuclear antigen" (pcna). dmh treatment did not increase pcna, nor was there any modulation by lab. the effect of l. acidophilus  on foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes (phase i and phase ii) in liver and colon cells of rats revealed only one parameter to be modulated, namely, a two- to three-fold increase in the levels of nadph-cytochrome p-450 reductase. the meaning of this finding, in terms of possible chemoprevention by lab, remains unclear. in conclusion, our studies show that most, but not all, lab tested could strongly inhibit genotoxicity in the gi tract of the rat and that viable lab organisms are required for the protective effect in vivo. the comet assay technique is a powerful tool to elucidate such in vivo antigenotoxic activities in tumor target tissues.

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.
