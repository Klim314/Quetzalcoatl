TI  == in vitro fermentation of lactulose by human gut bacteria.
AB  == lactulose has been known as a prebiotic that can selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. recent studies have indicated that streptococcus mutans, clostridium perfringens, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii are also able to utilize lactulose. however, the previous studies mainly focused  on the utilization of lactulose by individual strains, and few studies were designed to identify the species that could utilize lactulose among gut microbiota. this study aimed to identify lactulose-metabolizing bacteria in the human gut, using in silico and traditional culture methods. the prediction results suggested that genes for the transporters and glycosidases of lactulose are well distributed in the genomes of 222 of 453 strains of gastrointestinal-tract bacteria. the screening assays identified 35 species with  the ability to utilize lactulose, of which cronobacter sakazakii, enterococcus faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas putida were reported for the first time to be capable of utilizing lactulose. in addition, significant correlations between lactulose and galactooligosaccharide metabolism were found.  thus, more attention should be paid to bacteria besides bifidobacteria and lactobacilli to further investigate the relationship between functional oligosaccharides and gut bacteria.

TI  == maldi-tof identification of the human gut microbiome in people with and without diarrhea in senegal.
AB  == background: in africa, there are several problems with the specific identification of bacteria. recently, maldi-tof mass spectrometry has become a powerful tool for the routine microbial identification in many clinical laboratories. methodology/principal findings: this study was conducted using feces from 347 individuals (162 with diarrhea and 185 without diarrhea) sampled in health centers in dakar, senegal. feces were transported from dakar to marseille, france, where they were cultured using different culture conditions. the isolated colonies were identified using maldi-tof. if a colony was unidentified, 16s rrna sequencing was performed. overall, 2,753 isolates were tested, allowing for the identification of 189 bacteria from 5 phyla, including 2 previously unknown species, 11 species not previously reported in the human gut,  10 species not previously reported in humans, and 3 fungi. 2,718 bacterial isolates (98.8%) out of 2,750 yielded an accurate identification using mass spectrometry, as did the 3 candida albicans isolates. thirty-two bacterial isolates not identified by maldi-tof (1.2%) were identified by sequencing, allowing for the identification of 2 new species. the number of bacterial species per fecal sample was significantly higher among patients without diarrhea (8.6+/-3) than in those with diarrhea (7.3+/-3.4; p = 0.0003). a modification of  the gut microbiota was observed between the two groups. in individuals with diarrhea, major commensal bacterial species such as e. coli were significantly decreased (85% versus 64%), as were several enterococcus spp. (e. faecium and e.  casseliflavus) and anaerobes, such as bacteroides spp. (b. uniformis and b. vulgatus) and clostridium spp. (c. bifermentans, c. orbiscindens, c. perfringens, and c. symbosium). conversely, several bacillus spp. (b. licheniformis, b. mojavensis, and b. pumilus) were significantly more frequent among patients with  diarrhea. conclusions/significance: maldi-tof is a potentially powerful tool for  routine bacterial identification in africa, allowing for a quick identification of bacterial species.

TI  == effects of a probiotic, enterococcus faecium, on growth performance, intestinal morphology, immune response, and cecal microflora in broiler chickens challenged  with escherichia coli k88.
AB  == the effects of feeding dehydrated enterococcus faecium on growth performance, immune response, and cecal microflora in broiler chickens challenged with escherichia coli k88 were investigated. two hundred eighty-eight 1-d-old birds were randomly assigned to 4 treatments: negative control birds (n-con) fed a basal diet and not challenged with e. coli k88; positive control birds (p-con) fed a basal diet and challenged with e. coli k88; birds fed a basal diet including dehydrated e. faecium (ef) at 1 x 10(9) cfu/kg of feed and challenged with e. coli k88; and birds fed a basal diet including the antibiotic colistine sulfate (anti) at 10 mg/kg of feed and challenged with e. coli k88. birds fed e.  faecium had greater (p < 0.05) bw on d 14, 21, and 28 and greater (p < 0.05) jejunal villus height on d 21 and 28 compared with birds on the other treatments. jejunal crypt depth was decreased (p < 0.05) in birds fed either e. faecium or antibiotic compared with p-con treatment birds on d 10, 21, and 28. birds fed e.  faecium had a greater (p < 0.05) concentration of il-4 in their jejunal mucosa than did those in the n-con treatment group on d 10, 14, and 21. infected birds,  with or without e. faecium feeding, had a higher (p < 0.05) tumor necrosis factor-alpha and secreted iga in their jejunal mucosa than did those in the n-con treatment group on d 10 and 14. birds fed e. faecium had lower (p < 0.05) concentrations of e. coli on d 14 and 28, less (p < 0.05) clostridium perfringens on d 28, greater lactobacillus counts on d 14 and 21, and greater (p < 0.05) bifidobacterium in their cecal contents on d 21 than did the p-con birds. these results suggest that e. faecium can promote growth performance, improve intestinal morphology, and beneficially manipulate the cecal microflora in broilers challenged with e. coli k88.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

TI  == antimicrobial activity of essential oils from mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar  diffusion method. the essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against gram-positive (listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus epidermidis) and  gram-negative strains (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for most essential oils examined, s. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while p. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. in general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.

TI  == effects of antibiotics on bacterial species composition and metabolic activities  in chemostats containing defined populations of human gut microorganisms.
AB  == the composition and metabolic activities of the human colonic microbiota are modulated by a number of external factors, including diet and antibiotic therapy. changes in the structure and metabolism of the gut microbiota may have long-term  consequences for host health. the large intestine harbors a complex microbial ecosystem comprising several hundreds of different bacterial species, which complicates investigations on intestinal physiology and ecology. to facilitate such studies, a highly simplified microbiota consisting of 14 anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, clostridium butyricum, c. perfringens, c. bifermentans, c. innocuum, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus) was used in this investigation. ampicillin [9.2 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to two chemostats  operated at different dilution rates (d; 0.10 h(-1) and 0.21 h(-1)), and metronidazole [76.9 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to a third vessel (d = 0.21 h(-1)). perturbations in bacterial physiology and metabolism were sampled over a  48-h period. lactobacillus acidophilus and c. bifermentans populations did not establish in the fermentors under the imposed growth conditions. ampicillin resulted in substantial reductions in bacteroides and c. perfringens populations  at both dilution rates. metronidazole strongly affected bacteroides communities but had no effect on bifidobacterial communities. the bacteriostatic effect of ampicillin on bifidobacterial species was growth rate dependent. several metabolic activities were affected by antibiotic addition, including fermentation product formation and enzyme synthesis. the growth of antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria in the large bowel may enable them to occupy ecological niches left vacant after antibiotic administration, preventing colonization by pathogenic species.

TI  == a probiotics-containing biscuit modulates the intestinal microbiota in the elderly.
AB  == objectives: evaluation of the impact of a biscuit containing the probiotics bifidobacterium longum bar33 and lactobacillus helveticus bar13 on the intestinal microbiota in the elderly. design: randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. participants: thirty-two elderly volunteers living in italy. the group was composed of 19 women and 13 men aged between 71 and 88 years (mean 76). intervention: subjects were randomized in two groups consuming one dose of the probiotics-containing biscuit or placebo once a day for 30 days. measurements: for each subject the intestinal microbiota was characterized using the phylogenetic microarray platform htf-microbi.array before and after intervention. results: our data demonstrated that one-month consumption of a probiotics-containing biscuit was effective in redressing some of the age-related dysbioses of the intestinal microbiota. in particular, the probiotic treatment reverted the age-related increase of the opportunistic pathogens clostridium cluster xi, clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecium  and the enteropathogenic genus campylobacter. conclusion: the present study opens the way to the development of elderly-tailored probiotic-based functional foods to counteract the age-related dysbioses of the intestinal microbiota.

TI  == the effect of glyphosate on potential pathogens and beneficial members of poultry microbiota in vitro.
AB  == the use of glyphosate modifies the environment which stresses the living microorganisms. the aim of the present study was to determine the real impact of  glyphosate on potential pathogens and beneficial members of poultry microbiota in vitro. the presented results evidence that the highly pathogenic bacteria as salmonella entritidis, salmonella gallinarum, salmonella typhimurium, clostridium perfringens and clostridium botulinum are highly resistant to glyphosate. however, most of beneficial bacteria as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, bacillus badius, bifidobacterium adolescentis and lactobacillus spp. were found to be moderate to highly susceptible. also campylobacter spp. were found to be susceptible to glyphosate. a reduction of beneficial bacteria in the  gastrointestinal tract microbiota by ingestion of glyphosate could disturb the normal gut bacterial community. also, the toxicity of glyphosate to the most prevalent enterococcus spp. could be a significant predisposing factor that is associated with the increase in c. botulinum-mediated diseases by suppressing the antagonistic effect of these bacteria on clostridia.

TI  == reversible monensin adaptation in enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium perfringens of cattle origin: potential impact on human food safety.
AB  == objectives: to determine the stability/reversibility and mechanism of monensin adaptation in monensin-treated cattle isolates compared with reference bacterial  isolates, exposed in vitro to high monensin concentrations. methods: we evaluated the potential for cattle-origin strains of clostridium perfringens, enterococcus  faecium and enterococcus faecalis exposed to monensin in vivo (in vivo monensin-exposed isolates) to maintain or achieve the ability to grow in the presence of high monensin concentrations (in vitro monensin-adapted isolates). twenty-one consecutive subcultures of the in vitro monensin-adapted strains were  performed, and monensin mics were determined for the 3rd, 7th, 14th and 21st subcultures (subcultured isolates). sds-page and transmission electron microscopy (tem) were used to determine protein expression and visualize extracellular morphology changes. results: monensin-non-exposed isolates did not display monensin adaptation during in vitro monensin exposure. in contrast, in vivo monensin-exposed isolates displayed monensin adaptation enabling growth at 32x mic. upon consecutive subculturing, monensin mics returned to baseline, or one dilution above, for the monensin-adapted strains. sds-page identified overexpression of a 14 kda protein (c. perfringens) and a 20.5 kda protein (e. faecium and e. faecalis) in the monensin-adapted isolates. tem demonstrated that  in vitro monensin-adapted strains had a significantly thicker cell wall or glycocalyx compared with in vivo monensin-exposed or subcultured isolates. conclusions: in vivo monensin-exposed isolates of c. perfringens, e. faecium and  e. faecalis have the ability to grow in the presence of high monensin concentrations in vitro. this is associated with an increased thickening of the cell wall or glycocalyx that is reversible upon serial passage, suggesting a phenotypically expressed, but not genetically stable, trait.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic activities of animal intestinal strains against swine-associated pathogens.
AB  == a wide range of enteropathogens cause costly diarrhoeal diseases in fattening piglets and account for food-related infections in humans. the objective of this  study was to screen beneficial bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract  of various animal sources for antagonistic activity against diverse pathogens associated with hazardous pig production times. using agar spot assays, 15 well-characterized strains belonging to lactobacillus, enterococcus, bifidobacterium and bacillus were studied for inhibition of clostridium perfringens type a, various serovars of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, as well as brachyspira pilosicoli. strong antagonists were further analyzed by studying their cell-free supernatants with and without ph neutralization, proteinase k and catalase treatment. enterobacteriaceae were effectively inhibited by lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus reuteri strains, independent from the animal source, and on a lower level by single strains belonging to lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus amylovorus and bifidobacterium thermophilum, due to organic acid production. the bacillus subtilis strain was found to produce an anti-clostridial and anti-brachyspira metabolite of proteinaceous nature. homofermentative lactobacilli and b. thermophilum could suppress the growth of b. pilosicoli, the causative agent of intestinal spirochaetosis, whereas heterofermentative strains belonging to l. reuteri and l. mucosae had no effect. the lactic acid bacteria exerted their activity primarily by organic acid release, except one enterococcus faecium and l. amylovorus strain, which exhibited antagonism through joint activity of lactate and hydrogen peroxide. the findings of this study provide a basis for further in vitro studies and encourage feeding studies to evaluate the antagonistic potential of promising strains in pig production.

TI  == presence of pathogens and indicator microbes at a non-point source subtropical recreational marine beach.
AB  == swimming in ocean water, including ocean water at beaches not impacted by known point sources of pollution, is an increasing health concern. this study was an initial evaluation of the presence of indicator microbes and pathogens and the association among the indicator microbes, pathogens, and environmental conditions at a subtropical, recreational marine beach in south florida impacted by non-point sources of pollution. twelve water and eight sand samples were collected during four sampling events at high or low tide under elevated or reduced solar insolation conditions. the analyses performed included analyses of  fecal indicator bacteria (fib) (fecal coliforms, escherichia coli, enterococci, and clostridium perfringens), human-associated microbial source tracking (mst) markers (human polyomaviruses [hpyvs] and enterococcus faecium esp gene), and pathogens (vibrio vulnificus, staphylococcus aureus, enterovirus, norovirus, hepatitis a virus, cryptosporidium spp., and giardia spp.). the enterococcus concentrations in water and sand determined by quantitative pcr were greater than the concentrations determined by membrane filtration measurement. the fib concentrations in water were below the recreational water quality standards for three of the four sampling events, when pathogens and mst markers were also generally undetectable. the fib levels exceeded regulatory guidelines during one  event, and this was accompanied by detection of hpyvs and pathogens, including detection of the autochthonous bacterium v. vulnificus in sand and water, detection of the allochthonous protozoans giardia spp. in water, and detection of cryptosporidium spp. in sand samples. the elevated microbial levels were detected at high tide and under low-solar-insolation conditions. additional sampling should be conducted to further explore the relationships between tidal and solar  insolation conditions and between indicator microbes and pathogens in subtropical recreational marine waters impacted by non-point source pollution.

TI  == comparison of molecular markers to detect fresh sewage in environmental waters.
AB  == human-specific bacteroides hf183 (hs-hf183), human-specific enterococci faecium esp (hs-esp), human-specific adenoviruses (hs-avs) and human-specific polyomaviruses (hs-pvs) assays were evaluated in freshwater, seawater and distilled water to detect fresh sewage. the sewage spiked water samples were also tested for the concentrations of traditional fecal indicators (i.e., escherichia  coli, enterococci and clostridium perfringens) and enteric viruses such as enteroviruses (evs), sapoviruses (svs), and torquetenoviruses (tvs). the overall  host-specificity of the hs-hf183 marker to differentiate between humans and other animals was 98%. however, the hs-esp, hs-avs and hs-pvs showed 100% host-specificity. all the human-specific markers showed >97% sensitivity to detect human fecal pollution. e. coli, enterococci and, c. perfringens were detected up to dilutions of sewage 10(-5), 10(-4) and 10(-3) respectively. hs-esp, hs-avs, hs-pvs, svs and tvs were detected up to dilution of sewage 10(-4) whilst evs were detected up to dilution 10(-5). the ability of the hs-hf183 marker to detect fresh sewage was 3-4 orders of magnitude higher than that of the hs-esp and viral markers. the ability to detect fresh sewage in freshwater, seawater and distilled water matrices was similar for human-specific bacterial and viral marker. based on our data, it appears that human-specific molecular markers are sensitive measures of fresh sewage pollution, and the hs-hf183 marker appears to be the most sensitive among these markers in terms of detecting fresh  sewage. however, the presence of the hs-hf183 marker in environmental waters may  not necessarily indicate the presence of enteric viruses due to their high abundance in sewage compared to enteric viruses. more research is required on the persistency of these markers in environmental water samples in relation to traditional fecal indicators and enteric pathogens.

TI  == qnr-like pentapeptide repeat proteins in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == objectives: to study the role of qnr-like pentapeptide repeat proteins (prps) from several gram-positive species with quinolone resistance in vitro. methods: a pcr-based strategy was used to clone and express genes coding for qnr-like prps in enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, bacillus cereus and b. subtilis in escherichia coli dh10b. mic values of nalidixic acid and fluoroquinolones were determined for reference strains and e. coli dh10b harbouring recombinant plasmids containing genes coding for prps. results: amino acid identity of qnr-like prps in gram-positive strains compared with that of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants qnra1, qnrb1 and qnrs1 was in the range of 16%  to 22%. recombinant plasmids coding for qnr-like prps conferred reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (in the range of 0.016 to 0.064 mg/l for ciprofloxacin) and nalidixic acid (from 6 to 12 mg/l), depending on the antimicrobial agent and prp. the prp from b. subtilis showed no protective effect. conclusions: the prps analysed conferred a reduced susceptibility phenotype in e. coli; the data provide further evidence of the possible roles in  quinolone resistance of prps from different gram-positive species. these gram-positive species may constitute a reservoir for qnr-like quinolone resistance proteins.

TI  == ecological characterization of the colonic microbiota of normal and diarrheic dogs.
AB  == we used terminal restriction fragment polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis to assess (1) stability of the fecal microbiota in dogs living in environments characterized by varying degrees of exposure to factors that might alter the microbiota and (2) changes in the microbiota associated with acute episodes of diarrhea. results showed that the healthy canine gi tract harbors potential enteric pathogens. dogs living in an environment providing minimal exposure to factors that might alter the microbiota had similar microbiotas; the microbiotas  of dogs kept in more variable environments were more variable. substantial changes in the microbiota occurred during diarrheic episodes, including increased levels of clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium. when diet and medications of a dog having a previously stable microbiota were changed repeatedly, the microbiota also changed repeatedly. temporal trend analysis showed directional changes in the microbiota after perturbation, a return to the starting condition, and then fluctuating changes over time.

AB  == media with 1,3-1,4-beta -glucans as selective markers were used for isolation of  non-starch-polysaccharide (nsp) degrading bacteria from the intestinal tract of broiler chicken. formerly unknown 1,3-1,4-beta endoglucanase activities in various bacterial species were identified in this study. e. faecium , streptococcus , bacteroides and clostridium strains seem to be responsible for degradation of mixed linked beta -glucans in the small intestine and in the hind  gut of chickens. strict anaerobic bacteria (bacteroides ovatus , b. uniformis , presumably b. capillosus and clostridium perfringens ) as well as an unidentified bacterium with 98% 16s rdna homology to an uncultered chicken cecum bacterium were isolated. additionally, streptococcus bovis with 1,3-1,4-beta -endoglucanase activity was also detected. different 1,3-1,4-beta -endoglucanase activity profiles were observed in sds/page zymograms.

TI  == microarray-based detection of 90 antibiotic resistance genes of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == a disposable microarray was developed for detection of up to 90 antibiotic resistance genes in gram-positive bacteria by hybridization. each antibiotic resistance gene is represented by two specific oligonucleotides chosen from consensus sequences of gene families, except for nine genes for which only one specific oligonucleotide could be developed. a total of 137 oligonucleotides (26  to 33 nucleotides in length with similar physicochemical parameters) were spotted onto the microarray. the microarrays (arraytubes) were hybridized with 36 strains carrying specific antibiotic resistance genes that allowed testing of the sensitivity and specificity of 125 oligonucleotides. among these were well-characterized multidrug-resistant strains of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and lactococcus lactis and an avirulent strain of bacillus  anthracis harboring the broad-host-range resistance plasmid pre25. analysis of two multidrug-resistant field strains allowed the detection of 12 different antibiotic resistance genes in a staphylococcus haemolyticus strain isolated from mastitis milk and 6 resistance genes in a clostridium perfringens strain isolated from a calf. in both cases, the microarray genotyping corresponded to the phenotype of the strains. the arraytube platform presents the advantage of rapidly screening bacteria for the presence of antibiotic resistance genes known  in gram-positive bacteria. this technology has a large potential for applications in basic research, food safety, and surveillance programs for antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

AB  == 2-aminobiphenyl (2-abp), 3-aminobiphenyl (3-abp) and 4-aminobiphenyl (4-abp), but not benzidine (bz) and biphenyl (bp), were found to be inhibitory to the growth of human intestinal bacteria bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, b. bifidium atcc 11863, clostridium perfringens atcc 13124, escherichia coli atcc 25922, e. coli atcc 35218, enterobacter cloacae atcc 13047 and salmonella typhimurium ta98, ta100, yg1041 at 10-200 microg/ml in culture broth. bacteroides distasonis atcc 8503, b. fragilis atcc 25285, b. theataiotaomicron atcc 29741, c. paraputrificum  atcc 26780, c. clostridiiforme atcc 25537, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 and enterococcus faecium atcc 19434 were not inhibited by the above mentioned compounds in concentrations up to 200 microg/ml. the ames salmonella/microsome assay was employed to test the mutagenicity of the above-mentioned compounds using strains ta98 and ta100 in the presence and absence of aroclor 1254-induced  rat s9 mix. it was found that 4-abp was mutagenic to both ta98 and ta100, and bz  was mutagenic to ta98 in the presence of rat s9 mix. 2-aminobiphenyl, 3-abp, and  bp were not mutagenic to both strains tested. 2-aminobiphenyl and 3-abp are chemical isomers of 4-abp and are as strong as 4-abp in inhibiting the growth of  intestinal bacteria but not as mutagenic as 4-abp. evidence suggested that the mechanism of growth inhibition is not involved with the interaction of dna that causes mutations, but rather on the electron transport system of these organisms.

TI  == interaction between probiotic lactic acid bacteria and canine enteric pathogens:  a risk factor for intestinal enterococcus faecium colonization?
AB  == selected probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab) have been shown to elicit positive  health effects particularly in humans. competitive exclusion of pathogens is one  of the most important beneficial health claims of probiotic bacteria. the effect  of probiotic lab on competitive exclusion of pathogens has been demonstrated in humans, chicken and pigs. in this study we evaluated the ability of certain lab strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium lactis bb12, lactobacillus pentosus uk1a, l. pentosus sk2a, enterococcus faecium m74 and e. faecium sf273) to inhibit the adhesion of selected canine and zoonotic pathogens (staphylococcus intermedius, salmonella typhimurium atcc 14028, clostridium perfringens and campylobacter jejuni) to immobilised mucus isolated from canine jejunal chyme in  vitro. adhesion of c. perfringens was reduced significantly by all tested lab strains, between 53.7 and 79.1% of the control without lab, the lab of canine origin yielding the best reduction. the adhesion of s. typhimurium and s. intermedius were not significantly altered by any of the lab included in the study. both enterococci tested significantly enhanced the adhesion of c. jejuni,  to 134.6 and 205.5% of the control without lab. e. faecium may thus favor the adhesion and colonization of c. jejuni in the dog's intestine, making it a potential carrier and possibly a source for human infection. enhanced c. jejuni adhesion is a new potential risk factor of enterococci. our results further emphasize the importance of safety guidelines to be established for the probiotics intended for animal use.

TI  == linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. it has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus (gisa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, peptostreptococcus spp. and bacteroidesfragilis. in controlled phase iii studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. further phase iii studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (sstis). in these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments,  including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated sstis. oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated sstis  or community-acquired pneumonia. linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. the most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. conclusions: linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of s. aureus (including gisa), enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis (including vre). in controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as  effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. as the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among s. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.

TI  == linezolid.
AB  == linezolid is an oxazolidinone antibacterial agent that acts by inhibiting the initiation of bacterial protein synthesis. cross-resistance between linezolid and other inhibitors of protein synthesis has not been demonstrated. linezolid has a  wide spectrum of activity against gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant pneumococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. anerobes such as clostridium spp., peptostreptococcus spp. and prevotella spp. are also susceptible to linezolid. linezolid is bacteriostatic against most susceptible organisms but displays bactericidal activity against some strains of pneumococci, bacteroides fragilis and c. perfringens. in clinical trials involving hospitalised patients with skin/soft tissue infections (predominantly s. aureus), intravenous/oral linezolid (up to 1250 mg mg/day) produced clinical success in >83% of individuals. in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, success rates were >94%. preliminary clinical data also indicate that twice daily intravenous/oral linezolid 600 mg is as effective as intravenous vancomycin 1 g in the treatment of patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia and in those with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci. moreover, linezolid 600 mg twice daily produced >85% clinical/microbiological cure in vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections. linezolid is generally well tolerated and gastrointestinal disturbances are the most commonly occurring adverse events. no clinical evidence of adverse reactions as a result of monoamine oxidase inhibition has been reported.

TI  == quinupristin/dalfopristin: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is the first parenteral streptogramin antibacterial agent, and is a 30:70 (w/w) ratio of 2 semisynthetic pristinamycin derivatives. the combination has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref), drug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci, clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus spp. the combination also has good activity against selected gram-negative respiratory tract pathogens including moraxella catarrhalis, legioniella pneumophila and mycoplasma pneumoniae. quinupristin/dalfopristin has poor activity against e. faecalis. the  combination is bactericidal against staphylococci and streptococci, although constitutive erythromycin resistance can affect its activity. as for many other agents, quinupristin/dalfopristin is generally bacteriostatic against e. faecium. in patients with methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) or vref infections participating in prospective emergency-use trials, quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5  mg/kg every 8 or 12 hours achieved clinical or bacteriological success in > or =64% of patients. emergence of resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin was uncommon (4% of patients) in those with vref infections. quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5 mg/kg 8- or 12-hourly also achieved similar clinical success rates to comparator agents in patients with presumed gram-positive complicated skin and skin structure infections or nosocomial pneumonia (administered in combination with aztreoman) in 3 large multicentre randomised trials. systemic adverse events associated with quinupristin/dalfopristin include gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea), rash and pruritus. myalgias and arthralgias also occur at an overall  incidence of 1.3%, although higher rates (2.5 to 31%) have been reported in patients with multiple comorbidities. venous events are common if the drug is administered via a peripheral line; however, several management options (e.g. use of central venous access, increased infusion volume) may help to minimise their occurrence. hyperbilirubinaemia has been documented in 3.1% of quinupristin/dalfopristin recipients versus 1.3% of recipients of comparator agents. quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibits cytochrome p450 3a4 and therefore has  the potential to increase the plasma concentrations of substrates of this enzyme. conclusions: quinupristin/dalfopristin, the first parenteral streptogramin, offers a unique spectrum of activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria. in serious gram-positive infections for which there are other treatment options available, the spectrum of activity and efficacy of quinupristin/ dalfopristin should be weighed against its tolerability and drug interaction profile. however, in vref or unresponsive mrsa infections, where few proven treatment options exist, quinupristin/dalfopristin should be considered as a treatment of choice for these seriously ill patients.

AB  == purpose: prospective evaluation of the rate of bacteremia attributed to invasive  radiological techniques. methods: aerobic and anerobic blood cultures were obtained in 100 patients (62 men, 38 women; mean age 65 +/- 14 years) undergoing  intra-arterial angiography (n = 50), pta (n = 30) or percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (ptcd; n = 20). samples were taken before the treatment (t0), immediately after puncture of the vessel or bile duct (t2), and 30 min after the  termination of the procedure (t3). results: the overall rate of bacteremia was 18%. during diagnostic angiography a 16% rate of temporary bacteremia (no positive t3 samples) was observed. during pta the rate was 27% (no clinically significant infectious disease) and during ptcd the rate was 10% (5% cholangitis  with septicemia). we isolated staphylococci (s. epidermidis: n = 7, s. species: n = 3, s. aureus: n = 1), streptococci (n = 2), propionibacterium acnes (n = 5), e. coli (n = 1), enterococcus faecium (n = 1), enterobacter species (n = 1), and clostridium perfringens (n = 1). apart from the one patient with cholangitis no clinical infectious complication occurred. conclusion: temporary bacteremia is rather frequent during invasive radiological procedures. strictly aseptic conditions and antibiotic prophylaxis, specially in case of implantation of a permanent foreign body, is warranted.

TI  == growth of a human intestinal desulfovibrio desulfuricans in continuous cultures containing defined populations of saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting bacteria.
AB  == ecological and physiological effects of the sulphate-reducing bacterium (srb) desulfovibrio desulfuricans on other intestinal organisms were investigated in anaerobic chemostats (dilution rate approximately 0.2 h-1). reproducible defined  bacterial communities were used in these experiments, comprising 14 different saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting species: bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis, bif. pseudolongum, bif. infantis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bact. vulgatus, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, cl. butyricum, cl. innocuum, cl. bifermentans. lactobacillus and cl. bifermentans populations never rose above minimum detection limits (log10 2.0 and 4.0, respectively) under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. inclusion of des. desulfuricans in bacterial cultures (c. log10 8.4 viable cells ml-1) resulted in marked reductions (i.e. greater than 1 log) in planktonic cell population densities of several species, particularly bif. longum, cl. perfringens and bif. pseudolongum. the two bacteroides species were unaffected by des. desulfuricans, while numbers of cl. butyricum increased. extensive wall growth developed in the srb culture, consisting mainly of des. desulfuricans (log10 9.2 viable cells ml-1), bact. thetaiotaomicron and bact. vulgatus, with lesser numbers of facultative anaerobes, cl. perfringens and bif. longum. wall growth was associated with a reduction in planktonic cell mass and increased acid production by the cultures.  chemotaxonomic study of chemostat microbiotas, on the basis of cellular fatty acid methyl ester (fame) analyses, showed the existence of characteristic bacteroides (c15) and bifidobacterial (c18) markers, but desulfovibrio markers (i-c15:0, c16:0, i-c17:1) could be identified. the metabolic activities of saccharolytic organisms were altered in the srb chemostat, including synthesis of a number of hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown, such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, together with several mucinolytic enzymes. high concentrations of sulphide (8.2 mmol 1-1) were  detected in the srb chemostat, suggesting that this metabolite may have been inhibitory to some species. saccharolytic organisms growing in the srb fermenter  utilized more starch, but less galactose-containing polymers, which correlated with the observed glycosidase activities. profound differences were also recorded with respect to fermentation product formation in the chemostats, where a major switch to acetate production occurred in the srb culture, with concomitant reductions in propionate, butyrate and lactate, which is an important electron donor for desulfovibrios.

TI  == biochemical and genetic characterization of enterocin p, a novel sec-dependent bacteriocin from enterococcus faecium p13 with a broad antimicrobial spectrum.
AB  == enterocin p is a new bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium p13 isolated from a spanish dry-fermented sausage. enterocin p inhibited most of tested spoilage and food-borne gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, such as listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium botulinum. enterocin p is produced during growth in mrs broth from 16 to 45 degrees c; it is heat resistant (60 min at 100 degrees c; 15 min at 121 degrees c) and can withstand exposure to ph between 2.0 and 11.0, freeze-thawing, lyophilization, and long-term storage at 4 and -20 degrees c. the bacteriocin was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, cation-exchange, hydrophobic-interaction, and reverse-phase liquid chromatography. the sequence of 43 amino acids of the n terminus was obtained by  edman degradation. dna sequencing analysis of a 755-bp region revealed the presence of two consecutive open reading frames (orfs). the first orf encodes a 71-amino-acid protein containing a hydrophobic n-terminal sec-dependent leader sequence of 27 amino acids followed by the amino acid sequence corresponding to the purified and sequenced enterocin p. the bacteriocin is apparently synthesized as a prepeptide that is cleaved immediately after the val-asp-ala residues (positions -3 to -1), resulting in the mature bacteriocin consisting of 44 amino  acids, and with a theoretical molecular weight of 4,493. a second orf, encoding a putative immunity protein composed of 88 amino acids with a calculated molecular  weight of 9,886, was found immediately downstream of the enterocin p structural gene. enterocin p shows a strong antilisterial activity and has the consensus sequence found in the pediocin-like bacteriocins; however, enterocin p is processed and secreted by the sec-dependent pathway.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

AB  == a total of 4000 bacterial strains were isolated from milk, cheese and from different samples taken on the farm (silage, faeces) and screened for their antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes. only eight of the almost 4000 strains exhibited inhibitory activity in the cell-free supernatant fluid. two different enterococcus strains (rzs c5 and rzs c13) were chosen for further study. plasmid profile analysis of both revealed that rzs c5 contained a 4 kb plasmid while rzs c13 contained a 23 kb plasmid. the inhibitory compounds were proteinaceous and active against all listeria spp. tested while most of the lactic acid bacteria were insensitive. weak inhibition was also detected against  clostridium perfringens and some bacillus spp. cross-inhibition tests showed different profiles. the bacteriocins were heat-resistant and were very stable during storage, especially at low ph values. their molecular weight was estimated at +/- 3.0 kda. addition of 200 au/ml of bacteriocin resulted in an initial rapid decrease of the number of viable l. monocytogenes cells followed by slower a logarithmic decrease.

AB  == sequence determination of the flanking regions of the vancomycin resistance van gene cluster carried by pip816 in enterococcus faecium bm4147 revealed similarity to transposons of the tn3 family. imperfect inverted repeats (36 of 38 bp) delineated a 10,851-bp element designated tn1546. the 4-kb region located upstream from the vanr gene contained two open reading frames (orf) transcribed in opposite directions. the deduced amino acid sequence of orf1 (988 residues) displayed, respectively, 56 and 42% identity to those of the transposases of tn4430 from bacillus thuringiensis and of tn917 from enterococcus faecalis. the product of orf2 (191 residues) was related to the resolvase of tn917 (33% amino acid identity) and to the res protein (48%) of plasmid pip404 from clostridium perfringens. tn1546 transposed consecutively in escherichia coli from plasmid puc18 into pox38 and from pox38 into various sites of pbr329. transposition was replicative, led to the formation of cointegrates, and produced a 5-bp duplication at the target site. southern hybridization and dna amplification revealed the presence of tn1546-related elements in enterococci highly resistant  to glycopeptides. analysis of sequences surrounding these elements indicated that transposition plays a role in dissemination of the van gene cluster among replicons of human clinical isolates of e. faecium.

AB  == the thermal inactivation of salmonella thompson, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens, candida zeylanoides, enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis was accelerated by the addition of sodium isoascorbate (1 mmol/l) to phosphate-buffer heating medium but not to complex food mixtures. the lethal effect of isoascorbate was nullified by heating under anaerobic conditions or by  the addition of catalase. the scavengers of hydroxyl radicals, mannitol and formate were not protective whereas histidine was. histidine may have protected by slowing the rate of isoascorbate autoxidation, a property common to other amino acids tested. superoxide dismutase was not protective. dehydroascorbic acid also enhanced heat killing and its action was also reversed by catalase. the bactericidal effects of mild heat plus isoascorbate or dehydroascorbic acid both  apparently depend on oxidative processes but their relative effectiveness was not related to their respective rates of oxygen consumption or peroxide production. we speculate that site-specific redox reactions, involving amino-carbonyl intermediates are involved in the inactivation mechanism.
