TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

TI  == in vitro activities of dalbavancin and 12 other agents against 329 aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive isolates recovered from diabetic foot infections.
AB  == tests of dalbavancin's in vitro activity against 209 aerobic and 120 anaerobic isolates from pretreatment diabetic foot infections showed an mic(90) of < or =0.125 microg/ml against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), and 120 anaerobes (clostridium perfringens, other clostridia, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, finegoldia magna,  and anaerococcus prevotii), compared to respective mic(90)s for mssa and mrsa of  0.5 and 1 microg/ml for vancomycin, 4 and 4 microg/ml for linezolid, 0.5 and 0.5  microg/ml for daptomycin, and 0.25 and >8 microg/ml for clindamycin.

TI  == in vitro activities of daptomycin, vancomycin, and penicillin against clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, finegoldia magna, and propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == daptomycin has in vitro activity against gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, although limited numbers of species have been tested. we studied the in vitro activities of daptomycin, vancomycin, and penicillin against more than 100 strains each of clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, finegoldia magna, and propionibacterium acnes. daptomycin etest mics and results from time-kill studies were determined for selected strains. for 392 of 421 strains (93%), daptomycin was inhibitory at < or =1 microg/ml, including 15 of 16 strains of c. difficile with elevated linezolid mics of 8 and 16 microg/ml, all 32 strains with moxifloxacin mics of > or =4 microg/ml, and all 16 strains resistant to clindamycin. daptomycin mics were also < or =1 microg/ml for all 16 f. magna strains resistant to clindamycin and all 32 strains resistant to tetracycline. only one strain, a c. perfringens strain, had a mic of >2 microg/ml to daptomycin. eighty-five and 92.5% of the etest mics were within 1 dilution of the agar dilution method for all drugs at 24 and 48 h, respectively. in time-kill studies, a c. difficile strain was inhibited by both daptomycin and vancomycin at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h; colony counts were decreased by 2.3 to 2.9 log at 24 h. vancomycin was not bactericidal for c. perfringens; however, daptomycin showed bactericidal activity as early as 1 h at four and eight times the mic and at 2 and 4 h at two and four times the mic.

TI  == in vitro activity of oritavancin (ly333328), vancomycin, clindamycin, and metronidazole against clostridium perfringens, propionibacterium acnes, and anaerobic gram-positive cocci.
AB  == using an agar dilution method, we determined the in vitro activity of oritavancin, vancomycin, clindamycin and metronidazole against 114 unique clinical isolates of gram-positive anaerobes. mic(90)s (microg/ml) for oritavancin were as follows: clostridium perfringens 1.0, propionibacterium acnes 0.25, peptostreptococcus anaerobius 0.25, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus 0.5, finegoldia magna 0.25, micromonas. micros 0.25, and anaerococcus prevotii 0.25. on a weight basis, oritavancin is slightly more active than vancomycin against the strains tested. the oritavancin mics are comparable to those previously reported against staphylococci and enterococci. oritavancin shows excellent potential for treatment of infections containing gram-positive anaerobes such as  these.
