TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - special references to bacteria isolated between april 2011 and march 2012].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2011 to march 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus  spp., in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by parvimonas micra, collinsella aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus and finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, e. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by p micra and l. acidophilus, in this order. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides caccae, b. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus and b. wadsworthia, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus  spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.

TI  == identification of pili on the surface of finegoldia magna--a gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
AB  == pili have only been discovered in the major gram-positive pathogens in the past decade and they have been found to play an important role in colonisation and virulence. pili have been shown to have many important functions including attachment to host tissues, mediating bacterial aggregation, biofilm formation and binding to proteins in the extracellular matrix. in this study, sortase-dependent pili have been found to be expressed on the surface of finegoldia magna alb8. f. magna is a gram-positive anaerobic coccus that, primarily, is a commensal of the skin and mucous membranes, but has also been isolated from various clinical infection sites and is associated with soft-tissue abscesses, wound infections and bone and prosthetic joint infections. in this study, f. magna alb8 was found to harbour three sortases at the pilus locus, two  of which bear high similarity to class c sortases in streptococcus pneumoniae. two putative sortase-dependent pili proteins were found in the locus, with one being identified as the major pilus subunit, fmp1 (f. magna pilus subunit 1), due to its high similarity to other major pilus proteins in prominent gram-positive pathogens. the presence of sortase-dependent pili was confirmed experimentally through recombinant production of fmp1 and production of antiserum. the fmp1 antiserum was used in western blot to show the presence of a high molecular weight protein ladder, characteristic of the presence of pili, in trypsin released cell wall surface proteins from f. magna. the presence of sortase-dependent pili was visually confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, which showed the binding of gold labelled anti-fmp1 to individual pilus proteins along the pilus. furthermore, pili could also be found to bind and interact with keratinocytes in the epidermal layer of human skin, suggesting an adhesive role for pili on f. magna. our work represents the first description of  pilus structures in f. magna. this discovery further elucidates f. magna physiology and allows for additional analysis of host-bacterial interactions in future studies.

TI  == [v. a. c. instill(r) therapy - new option in septic thoracic surgery].
AB  == background: the v. a. c. instill(r) therapy is an innovative process for treating chronic wounds that are not optimally accessible to a systemic antibiotic therapy or infected with multi-resistant pathogens. we report on our first experience and applications of v. a. c. instill(r) therapy in the field of septic thoracic surgery. materials and methods: v. a. c. instill therapy was used in 11 cases between 11/2009 and 01/2012. three patients had sternum osteomyelitis (2 mrsa, 1  finegoldia magna). in 3 patients chronic pleural empyema after lobectomy (1 streptococcus viridans, 1 mixed infection with mrsa among others) and after pneumectomy (1 mrsa) were detected. in 2 cases there was an acute pleural empyema with extensive phlegmona in the region of the thoracic soft tissues (2 streptococci). in 1 patient a chronic pleural empyema with mrsa infection was treated. septic arthritis of the sternoclavicular joint with joint destruction and extensive phlegmona in the region of the cervical soft tissues (1 streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 staphylococcus aureus) was treated in 2 patients. in  all cases instillation of the wound was performed with lavasept 0.2 %. swabs of the wound were taken before starting and after ending v. a. c. instill(r) therapy as well as before wound closure. results: mean patient age was 48.8 +/- 18.9 years. v. a. c. instill(r) therapy was performed for 6.5 +/- 1.7 days. instillation time amounted to 21.7 +/- 5.7 s. the duration of action was standardised at 18 min in all cases. in 2 cases (1 mesa, 1 finegoldia) the v. a.  c. instill(r) therapy was repeated. in 10 patients a sterile wound status was achieved before secondary wound closure. all wounds underwent secondary closure without recurrence. conclusions: chronic osteomyelitis with mrsa infections as well as chronically infected residual cavities after empyema surgery and extensive phlegmona are possible indications for v. a. c. instill(r) therapy in order to help eradicating the infection as quickly and as completely as possible.

TI  == an in vitro comparison of two silver-containing antimicrobial wound dressings .
AB  == preclinical studies have shown that release of silver by different wound dressings varies. the purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the antimicrobial activity of silver alginate (sa) and silver carboxymethylcellulose  (scm) dressings. an- timicrobial activity was tested using nine bacterial strains with log10 reduction and corrected zone of inhibition (czoi) as- says. antimicrobial effect was visualized using confocal microscopy (clsm). log10 reduction was comparable between both dressings for staphylococcus aureus ncimb 9518, candida albicans atcc 90028, finegoldia magna nctc 11804t, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa nctc 10662. log10 reduction was higher for scm than sa dressing-exposed escherichia coli (p = 0.035) and p. aeruginosa atcc 15692 (p = 0.032), and lower for scm than sa dressing-exposed streptococcus pyogenes (p = 0.007), peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus (p = 0.045), and s. aureus nctc 8325 (p =  0.012). both dressings were equivalent against four strains (5 to 8 days' activity) in the czoi assay. sa dressing silver activity lasted >24 hours longer  than scm activity when exposed to c. albicans (9 days' activity), e. coli (7 days' activity), f. magna (5 days' activity), and p. asaccharolyticus (5 days' activity), whereas the smc exhibited greater persistence against s. pyogenes (13  days' activity). clsm showed complete kill of s. aureus after 20 hours for both dressings. the results of this study confirm the broad-spectrum, in vitro activity of some dressings containing ionic silver. the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of both wound dressings was comparable, but clinical studies comparing the efficacy and effectiveness of silver-containing dressings to nonionic silver-containing dressings are needed.

TI  == constitutive and inflammation-dependent antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelium are differentially processed and inactivated by the commensal finegoldia magna and the pathogen streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == epithelial linings serve as physical barriers and produce antimicrobial peptides  (amps) to maintain host integrity. examples are the bactericidal proteins midkine (mk) and brak/cxcl14 that are constitutively produced in the skin epidermal layer, where the anaerobic gram-positive coccoid commensal finegoldia magna resides. consequently, this bacterium is likely to encounter both mk and brak/cxcl14, making these molecules possible threats to its habitat. in this study, we show that mk expression is upregulated during inflammation, concomitant with a strong downregulation of brak/cxcl14, resulting in changed antibacterial conditions. mk, brak/cxcl14, and the inflammation-dependent antimicrobial beta-defensins human beta-defensin (hbd)-2 and hbd-3 all showed bactericidal activity against both f. magna and the virulent pathogen streptococcus pyogenes at similar concentrations. sufa, a released protease of f. magna, degraded mk and brak/cxcl14 but not hbd-2 nor hbd-3. cleavage was seen at lysine and arginine residues, amino acids characteristic of amps. intermediate sufa-degraded fragments of mk and brak/cxcl14 showed stronger bactericidal activity against s.  pyogenes than f. magna, thus promoting survival of the latter. in contrast, the cysteine-protease speb of s. pyogenes rapidly degraded all amps investigated. the proteins faf and sic, released by f. magna and s. pyogenes, respectively, neutralized the antibacterial activity of mk and brak/cxcl14, protein faf being the most efficient. quantitation and colocalization by immunoelectron microscopy  demonstrated significant levels and interactions of the molecules in in vivo and  ex vivo samples. the findings reflect strategies used by a permanently residing commensal and a virulent pathogen, the latter operating during the limited time course of invasive disease.

TI  == complete genome sequence of a serotype 11a, st62 streptococcus pneumoniae invasive isolate.
AB  == background: streptococcus pneumoniae is an important human pathogen representing  a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. we sequenced the genome of a  serotype 11a, st62 s. pneumoniae invasive isolate (ap200), that was erythromycin-resistant due to the presence of the erm(tr) determinant, and carried out analysis of the genome organization and comparison with other pneumococcal genomes. results: the genome sequence of s. pneumoniae ap200 is 2,130,580 base pair in length. the genome carries 2216 coding sequences (cds), 56 trna, and 12 rrna genes. of the cdss, 72.9% have a predicted biological known function. ap200 contains the pilus islet 2 and, although its phenotype corresponds to serotype 11a, it contains an 11d capsular locus. chromosomal rearrangements resulting from a large inversion across the replication axis, and  horizontal gene transfer events were observed. the chromosomal inversion is likely implicated in the rebalance of the chromosomal architecture affected by the insertions of two large exogenous elements, the erm(tr)-carrying tn1806 and a functional prophage designated phispn_200. tn1806 is 52,457 bp in size and comprises 49 orfs. comparative analysis of tn1806 revealed the presence of a similar genetic element or part of it in related species such as streptococcus pyogenes and also in the anaerobic species finegoldia magna, anaerococcus prevotii and clostridium difficile. the genome of phispn_200 is 35,989 bp in size and is organized in 47 orfs grouped into five functional modules. prophages similar to phispn_200 were found in pneumococci and in other streptococcal species, showing a high degree of exchange of functional modules. phispn_200 viral particles have morphologic characteristics typical of the siphoviridae family and are capable of infecting a pneumococcal recipient strain. conclusions: the sequence of s. pneumoniae ap200 chromosome revealed a dynamic genome, characterized by chromosomal rearrangements and horizontal gene transfers. the overall diversity of ap200 is driven mainly by the presence of the exogenous elements tn1806 and phispn_200 that show large gene exchanges with other genetic  elements of different bacterial species. these genetic elements likely provide ap200 with additional genes, such as those conferring antibiotic-resistance, promoting its adaptation to the environment.

TI  == assessment of bacterial diversity in the cattle tick rhipicephalus (boophilus) microplus through tag-encoded pyrosequencing.
AB  == background: ticks are regarded as the most relevant vectors of disease-causing pathogens in domestic and wild animals. the cattle tick, rhipicephalus (boophilus) microplus, hinders livestock production in tropical and subtropical parts of the world where it is endemic. tick microbiomes remain largely unexplored. the objective of this study was to explore the r. microplus microbiome by applying the bacterial 16s tag-encoded flx-titanium amplicon pyrosequencing (btefap) technique to characterize its bacterial diversity. pyrosequencing was performed on adult males and females, eggs, and gut and ovary  tissues from adult females derived from samples of r. microplus collected during  outbreaks in southern texas. results: raw data from btefap were screened and trimmed based upon quality scores and binned into individual sample collections.  bacteria identified to the species level include staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus chromogenes, streptococcus dysgalactiae, staphylococcus sciuri, serratia marcescens, corynebacterium glutamicum, and finegoldia magna. one hundred twenty-one bacterial genera were detected in all the life stages and tissues sampled. the total number of genera identified by tick sample comprised:  53 in adult males, 61 in adult females, 11 in gut tissue, 7 in ovarian tissue, and 54 in the eggs. notable genera detected in the cattle tick include wolbachia, coxiella, and borrelia. the molecular approach applied in this study allowed us to assess the relative abundance of the microbiota associated with r. microplus.  conclusions: this report represents the first survey of the bacteriome in the cattle tick using non-culture based molecular approaches. comparisons of our results with previous bacterial surveys provide an indication of geographic variation in the assemblages of bacteria associated with r. microplus. additional reports on the identification of new bacterial species maintained in nature by r. microplus that may be pathogenic to its vertebrate hosts are expected as our understanding of its microbiota expands. increased awareness of the role r. microplus can play in the transmission of pathogenic bacteria will enhance our ability to mitigate its economic impact on animal agriculture globally. this recognition should be included as part of analyses to assess the risk for re-invasion of areas like the united states of america where r. microplus was eradicated.

TI  == bacterial surface protein l binds and inactivates neutrophil proteins s100a8/a9.
AB  == finegoldia magna is an anaerobic bacterial species that is part of the normal human flora on all nonsterile body surfaces, but it is also a significant opportunistic pathogen causing a wide range of infections. some isolates of f. magna that are more frequently associated with clinical infection express protein l, a surface protein containing multiple homologous domains (b1-b5) that bind igs through interactions with ig l chains. the present study shows that the n-terminal a domain of protein l binds s100a8/a9, antibacterial proteins present  in large amounts in the cytoplasm of neutrophils, but also extracellularly in tissues during inflammation. as a result, protein l-expressing f. magna are protected against killing by s100a8/a9. igs and s100a8/a9 were found to interact  independently with protein l, demonstrating that this bacterial surface protein is capable of manipulating both adaptive and innate immune defense mechanisms.

TI  == sufa of the opportunistic pathogen finegoldia magna modulates actions of the antibacterial chemokine mig/cxcl9, promoting bacterial survival during epithelial inflammation.
AB  == the anaerobic bacterium finegoldia magna is part of the human commensal microbiota, but is also an important opportunistic pathogen. this bacterium expresses a subtilisin-like serine proteinase, sufa, which partially degrade the  antibacterial chemokine mig/cxcl9. here, we show that mig/cxcl9 is produced by human keratinocytes in response to inflammatory stimuli. in contrast to the virulent human pathogen streptococcus pyogenes, the presence of f. magna had no enhancing effect on the mig/cxcl9 expression by keratinocytes, suggesting poor detection of the latter by pathogen-recognition receptors. when mig/cxcl9 was exposed to sufa-expressing f. magna, the molecule was processed into several smaller fragments. analysis by mass spectrometry showed that sufa cleaves mig/cxcl9 at several sites in the cooh-terminal region of the molecule. at equimolar concentrations, sufa-generated mig/cxcl9 fragments were not bactericidal against f. magna, but retained their ability to kill s. pyogenes. moreover, the sufa-generated mig/cxcl9 fragments were capable of activating the angiostasis-mediating cxcr3 receptor, which is expressed on endothelial cells, in an order of magnitude similar to that of intact mig/cxcl9. f. magna expresses a surface protein called faf that is released from the bacterial surface by sufa. soluble faf was found to bind and inactivate the antibacterial activity of mig/cxcl9, thereby further potentially promoting the survival of f. magna. the findings suggest that sufa modulation of the inflammatory response could be a mechanism playing an important role in creating an ecologic niche for f. magna, decreasing antibacterial activity and suppressing angiogenesis, thus providing advantage in survival for this anaerobic opportunist compared with competing pathogens during inflammation.

TI  == human serum activity of telithromycin, azithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate against common aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens.
AB  == telithromycin is a new ketolide antimicrobial with a good in vitro activity against both aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens. in this study, we evaluated the antibacterial activity over time of telithromycin (800mg), azithromycin (500mg), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (875/125mg) in serum following  single oral doses of these agents to 10 healthy subjects. inhibitory and bactericidal titers were determined at 2, 6, 12, and 24h after each dose and the  median titer was used to determine antibacterial activity. against two azithromycin-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, both telithromycin (mic=0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml) and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited inhibitory and cidal activity for at least 6h. all three antibiotics provided prolonged (>or=12h) inhibitory activity against strains of hemophilus influenzae (telithromycin mic=4.0 microg/ml). both telithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited rapid and prolonged inhibitory activity (>or=12h) against each of the anaerobes studied (finegoldia [peptostreptococcus] magna peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella bivia, and prevotella melaninogenica). moreover, both agents provided bactericidal activity against both prevotella species. in this ex vivo pharmacodynamic study, we found that telithromycin provided rapid and prolonged antibacterial activity in serum against macrolide-resistant strains of s. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of h. influenzae, and common respiratory anaerobic pathogens. these findings suggest that telithromycin could have clinical utility in the treatment of community-acquired mixed aerobic-anaerobic respiratory tract infections, including chronic sinusitis and aspiration pneumonia.

TI  == [two cases of bartholin's gland abscesses caused by streptococcus pneumoniae and  haemophilus influenzae].
AB  == most of bartholin's gland abscesses have been thought to be caused by microorganisms found in opportunistic infections. however, we have encountered two very interesting cases of bartholin's gland abscesses caused by streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, two major pathogens of respiratory tract infections. in the first case, since abscess formation was not observed due to disintegration, cefdinir (cfdn), 300 mg/day, t.i.d. for 5 days was administered.  the treatment improved clinical symptoms, but relapse occurred 3 days after the administration was discontinued. microbiological examination of pus revealed the  presence of streptococcus pneumoniae and finegoldia magna, and it also showed that the isolated s. pneumoniae was penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp). after an incision and drainage of abscess, cefteram pivoxil (cftm-pi), 300 mg/day t.i.d. for 7 days, was administered, and the cure was confirmed. in the second case, after an incision and drainage of bartholin's gland abscess, amoxicillin (ampc), 750 mg/day, t.i.d. for 5 days, was administered. the treatment improved clinical symptoms temporarily. however, the symptoms deteriorated 7 days after the operation, and the patient was diagnosed with relapse. microbiological examination of pus revealed the presence of haemophilus influenzae and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and it also showed that the isolated h. influenzae was beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae (blnar). after performing additional incision and drainage of abscess again, cftm-pi, 300 mg/day, t.i.d. for 7 days, was administered, and the cure was confirmed. in addition, the analysis of these two cases using pk/pd theory revealed that the time above mic reached 100% with administration of cftm-pi 300mg, t.i.d. suggesting that the dosage is sufficient for treating these infections. there are other cases of external genitalia infections caused by microorganisms usually associated with respiratory tract infections like cases that we are reporting here. therefore, it is necessary to consider a possible infection by drug-resistant bacteria even for a case of external genitalia infection. in addition, it was thought that adjusting dosage and method for administration of antibacterial agents based on pk/pd theory would help to rovide efficient treatment.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin.
AB  == background: telithromycin is one of the ketolides, characterised by a 3-keto group instead of l-cladinose and a c(11)-c(12) carbamate link by an alkyl chain to a pyridinum and imidazolium ring side chain. we evaluated in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin against gynaecological pathogens. methods: in the vitro study, the antibacterial activity of telithromycin against  180 isolates (isolated in the year 2000) of streptococcus agalactiae (n = 33), enterococcus faecalis (n = 22), neisseria gonorrhoeae (n = 30), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (n = 20), finegoldia magna (n = 20), bacteroides fragilis (n = 25) and prevotella bivia (n = 30) was compared with that of erythromycin a, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ampicillin and levofloxacin. in the in vivo study, the efficacy of telithromycin was evaluated using experimental intra-abdominal abscesses in mice caused by b. fragilis (minimum inhibitory concentration of telithromycin 0.5 mg/l). results: in the in vitro study, telithromycin inhibited more than 50% of clinical isolates of s. agalactiae, e. faecalis, n. gonorrhoeae, p. anaerobius, f. magna, b. fragilis and p. bivia at concentrations of 0.016, 0.063, 0.063, 0.032, 0.032, 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. telithromycin inhibited more than 90% of these clinical isolates at concentrations of 0.016, 4, 0.125, 0.063, 0.063, 4 and 1 mg/l, respectively. in the in vivo study, telithromycin inhibited abscess formation and significantly decreased viable cell counts in abscesses in comparison with the untreated group. conclusions: these in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities suggest that telithromycin could be a potential candidate for the treatment of bacterial infections complicated by chlamydial infection.
