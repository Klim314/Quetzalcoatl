TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2010  and march 2011].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2010 to march 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. such as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus avium was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. such as streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus spp. such as staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. such as e. faecalis  and e. faecium was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. such as s. aureus from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli and r aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of parvimonas micra, eggerthella lenta, streptococcus constellatus, gemella morbillorum, and collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed.

TI  == comparison of oral microbiota in tumor and non-tumor tissues of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.
AB  == background: bacterial infections have been linked to malignancies due to their ability to induce chronic inflammation. we investigated the association of oral bacteria in oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc/tumor) tissues and compared with adjacent non-tumor mucosa sampled 5 cm distant from the same patient (n = 10). by using culture-independent 16s rrna approaches, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and cloning and sequencing, we assessed the total bacterial diversity in these clinical samples. results: dgge fingerprints showed  variations in the band intensity profiles within non-tumor and tumor tissues of the same patient and among the two groups. the clonal analysis indicated that from a total of 1200 sequences characterized, 80 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected representing six phyla, firmicutes, bacteroidetes, proteobacteria,  fusobacteria, actinobacteria and uncultivated tm7 in non-tumor and tumor libraries. in combined library, 12 classes, 16 order, 26 families and 40 genera were observed. bacterial species, streptococcus sp. oral taxon 058, peptostreptococcus stomatis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus gordonii, gemella haemolysans, gemella morbillorum, johnsonella ignava and streptococcus parasanguinis i were highly associated with tumor site where as granulicatella adiacens was prevalent at non-tumor site. streptococcus intermedius was present in 70% of both non-tumor and tumor sites. conclusions: the underlying changes in  the bacterial diversity in the oral mucosal tissues from non-tumor and tumor sites of oscc subjects indicated a shift in bacterial colonization. these most prevalent or unique bacterial species/phylotypes present in tumor tissues may be  associated with oscc and needs to be further investigated with a larger sample size.

TI  == the subgingival microbiota of papillon-lefevre syndrome.
AB  == background: there is little information about the microbiologic profiles of periodontal lesions in papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls) and the significance of bacteria in the pathogenesis of periodontitis in these patients. this comprehensive analysis of the subgingival microbiota in patients with pls used 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) clonal analysis and the 16s rrna-based human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: thirteen patients with pls from seven unrelated families volunteered for this microbiologic study. subgingival plaque was collected with sterile paper points from multiple sites with >/=5 mm probing depth, and whole genomic dna was extracted. the 16s rrna genes were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. the samples were then probed for approximately 300 predominant oral bacterial species using the homim. results: the most commonly detected phylotypes in the clonal analysis were gemella morbillorum, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, lachnospiraceae ot 100 (ei074), parvimonas micra, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. as a group, streptococci were commonly detected in these individuals. in the homim analysis, a total of 170 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected, with a range of 40 to 80 species per patient with pls. of these, 12 bacterial species were detected in medium to high levels in >/=50% of the individuals. the high-frequency strains were clustered into eight groups: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter spp., capnocytophaga granulosa, g. morbillorum, p. micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, streptococcus spp., and tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the subgingival microbiota in pls is diverse.  periodontal pathogens commonly associated with chronic and aggressive periodontitis and opportunistic pathogens may be associated with the development  of severe periodontitis in patients with pls.

TI  == evaluation of the subgingival microbiota of alcoholic and non-alcoholic individuals.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of alcoholic and non-alcoholic individuals. methods: the study was conducted with 49 alcoholic and 49 non-alcoholic males of the philippe  pinel institute, rio de janeiro, brazil. the subjects were selected by convenience and two criteria were used to diagnose alcohol dependence: the cage (cut-down, annoyed, guilt, eyes-opener) questionnaire and the international statistical classification of diseases, 10th edition (who). subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 4 sites, 2 with probing depth (pd) >/= 4 mm and 2 sites with pd < 4 mm. the presence and levels of 45 bacterial taxa were analysed  using the checkerboard technique. results: the prevalence of bacterial species was not significantly different between groups. however, alcoholics showed significantly higher mean counts of aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis (adjusted p < 0.001). moreover, alcoholics harboured significantly higher mean levels of capnocytophaga sputigena, fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, f. nuc. nucleatum, gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, p. gingivalis, streptococcus gordonii, and tannerella forsythia at sites with pd < 4 mm or >/= 4 mm compared to non-alcoholics (p </= 0.001). of interest, shallow sites of alcoholics presented  significantly higher mean levels of f. nuc. vincentii, f. nuc nucleatum, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythia than sites with pd >/= 4 mm of non-alcoholics (p </= 0.001). conclusions: alcoholics and non-alcoholics present a diverse and complex  microbiota; however, alcoholics harbour significantly higher levels of periodontopathic species in the subgingival microbiota than non-alcoholics.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents--special reference to bacteria isolated between april 2007 and march 2008].
AB  == bacteria isolated from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from april 2007 to march 2008 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 707 strains including 24 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 181 (79.0%) of 229 patients with surgical infections. three hundred and ninety-five strains were isolated from primary infections, and 288 strains were isolated from postoperative infections.  from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate  of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp., and staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from postoperative infections.  among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae, e. coli and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of parvimonas micra was the highest from primary infections, followed by streptococcus constellatus and gemella morbillorum, and from postoperative infections, anaerococcus prevotii was most predominantly isolated.  among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of both bacteroides fragilis and bilophila wadsworthia were the highest from primary infections, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and campylobacter gracilis, and from postoperative infections, b. thetaiotaomicron was most predominately isolated, followed by b. fragilis, bacteroides caccae and b. wadsworthia in this order. in  this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci, nor multidrug-resistant p aeruginosa. there were nine strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci which show higher mic against teicoplanin more than 4 gg/ml, but all of them had good susceptibilities against various anti-mrsa antibiotics. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == association of streptococcus pluranimalium with valvular endocarditis and septicaemia in adult broiler parents.
AB  == the genus streptococcus consists of more than 60 species, but only streptococcus  equi subspecies zooepidemicus, streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus, streptococcus gallinaceus, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus suis have been isolated from poultry. during investigations of the  aetiology of increased mortality in broiler parent stock at the end of production, pure cultures of streptococcal-like organisms that could not be classified among these six species were obtained from 24 cases of septicaemia or  valvular endocarditis and septicaemia. phenotypic characterization using the api20 strep kit identified the isolates as aerococcus viridans (10), aerococcus urinae (2), leuconostoc species (4), streptococcus salivarius (2), streptococcus  bovis ii 3 (1), enterococcus avium (3), enterococcus faecium (1) or gemella morbillorum (1). however, this identification was misleading as subsequent genetic investigations using pulse field gel electrophoresis and sequencing of 16s rrna genes showed that 19 isolates were classified as streptococcus pluranimalium, while the remaining isolates were e. avium (3), e. faecium (1) or  lactobacillus species (1). misidentification by api20 strep was related to the database provided by the manufacturer, as the phenotypic characteristics could identify these organisms as s. pluranimalium. the isolates of s. pluranimalium belonged to at least three different clones as determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of smai-digested genomic dna. the capacity that these isolates had to colonize the valvular endothelium was suggested by the occurrence of valvular endocarditis in 12 of 19 cases. demonstration of the same clone in all four houses on a farm suggested the pathogenic potential of this organism.

TI  == periodontal status of patients with dentin dysplasia type i: report of three cases within a family.
AB  == background: dentin dysplasia type i (ddi) is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation. it is characterized by clinically normal-appearing crowns; obliteration of pulp chambers; and short, blunted and malformed roots that are commonly associated with periodontal attachment loss (pal). in this context, we report three cases within a family with similar clinical and radiographic features of ddi but with differing microbiologic and periodontal conditions. methods: a 42-year-old white female and her two daughters (25 and 10 years of age) presented with a diagnosis of ddi. probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), visible plaque, and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. subgingival biofilm samples were randomly collected and analyzed by checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization. results: the mother presented 34.9% of sites with pd > or  =4 mm, 41.3% of sites with cal > or =4 mm, and 57% of sites with bop; both daughters presented no sites with pd or cal >3 mm and <10% of sites with bop. microbiologic analysis detected gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, and staphylococcus aureus in > or =50% of the mother's samples. the daughters showed  high levels (>10(4) bacterial cells) of some periodontopathic bacteria, including members of the red (porphyromonas gingivalis) and orange (fusobacterium periodonticum and f. nucleatum polymorphum) complexes and beneficial species of the yellow (streptococcus gordonii) and purple (veillonella parvula) complexes. the mother presented high mean levels only for four tested species (n. mucosa, prevotella melaninogenica, treponema denticola, and v. parvula). conclusion: a combination of radiographs, microbiologic analysis, and preventive professional monitoring care is important to avoid pal and to provide oral health in patients  with ddi.

TI  == subgingival plaque microbiota in hiv positive patients.
AB  == aim: to describe and compare the predominant bacterial and fungal species associated with gingivitis, periodontitis, and linear gingival erythema (lge), in hiv positive subjects with different immune status. methods: viral loads and cd4  levels determined hiv disease status. from pooled subgingival plaque, 16s and 18s rdna were cloned and sequenced to determine species identity. results: one hundred and nine bacterial species were identified from 14 subjects. nearly half  of the species were not cultivable. notably, the classical putative periodontal pathogens, treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia were below the limit of detection and were not detected. species of gemella, dialister, streptococcus and veillonella were predominant. in one hiv positive subject with periodontitis and low viral load, gemella morbillorum, a known opportunistic pathogen, constituted 84% of the clones. saccharomyces cerevisiae was the only fungal species detected in an lge subject and in periodontitis subjects with high viral loads. in periodontitis patients with low viral loads, candida albicans was predominant, while s. cerevisiae was only a minor component. conclusion: these case studies suggest that other bacterial species, rather than  the classical periodontal pathogens, may be involved in periodontal diseases of subjects with hiv. these data are indicative of opportunistic infections in a highly susceptible immunocompromised host.

TI  == gemella endocarditis: consider the colon.
AB  == gemella species, including gemella morbillorum, are part of the normal flora of the human oropharynx, upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract. differentiation of gemella from viridans streptococci in the laboratory may be difficult. although uncommonly pathogenic, they have been implicated in a variety of human infections, most notably infective endocarditis. dental instrumentation  appears to be the usual source of infection. the case is reported of gemella morbillorum native valve endocarditis, which was associated with an underlying colonic carcinoma. an association with colonic neoplasm has been described in three previous cases of endocarditis attributed to gemella. it is well documented that streptococcus bovis endocarditis may occur in the setting of colonic neoplasia. it is suggested that colonic investigation should be considered in patients with gemella endocarditis, in whom no other source is apparent.

TI  == in vitro activity of daptomycin against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == we determined the activity of daptomycin, a recently fda-approved antimicrobial agent, against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria, including viridans group streptococci (16 streptococcus mitis species group, 12 s. mutans species group, 9 s. anginosus species group, 8 s. sanguinis species group, 5 s. salivarius species group) from patients with infective endocarditis, 32 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 32 high-level penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, 38 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (including 1 linezolid-resistant isolate), and the following unusual gram-positive bacteria: 3 listeria monocytogenes, 4 erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, 9 corynebacterium species, 10 abiotrophia/granulicatella species, 2 rothia (stomatococcus) mucilaginosus, and 4 gemella morbillorum. daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)(90) values for the viridans group streptococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, and enterococcus species were 0.5, 0.5, < or =0.125, and 4 microg/ml, respectively. the daptomycin mic range for the unusual gram-positive bacteria was < or =0.125-2 microg/ml. we conclude that daptomycin has in vitro activity against viridans group streptococci associated with endocarditis as well as against several types  of unusual gram-positive bacteria that can cause endocarditis.

TI  == coaggregation profiles of the microflora from root surface caries lesions.
AB  == bacterial coaggregation reactions between different species and the auto aggregation of the same species are associated with the initiation and development of dental plaque and biofilms. as no such data is available on isolates from root caries lesions, we evaluated, by a visual, semi-quantitative scoring system and a spectrophotometric, quantitative assay, the coaggregation of 22 different wild-type microbial species comprising ten bacterial genera and a single candida spp. the quantitative coaggregation assay we used proved to be a more sensitive method than the semi-quantitative, visual evaluation as the results yielded the percent coaggregation. fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus bovis ii/2 and gemella morbillorum were observed having higher degrees of autoaggregation than the other examined strains. significant levels of inter-species coaggregation was seen between: (1) actinomyces spp. and veillonella spp.; (2) actinomyces israelii and peptostreptococcus prevotii; (3) campylobacter gracilis and actinomyces spp.; (4) prevotella intermedia and nine different species; and (5) fusobacterium nucleatum and six other species. the single candida albicans isolate did not coaggregate to a significant extent with any of the 21 bacterial isolates studied. scanning electron microscopy observation of the coaggregation interactions between bacterial pairs having strong coaggregation reactions revealed varying adhesive patterns. our findings on coaggregation amongst these isolates imply existence of multiple interactions between the coaggregation-inducing bacterial species in root caries. in particular, actinomyces spp., veillonella spp., prevotella spp. and fusobacterium spp. appear to play a significant role in this context.

TI  == antibiotic resistance profile of the subgingival microbiota following systemic or local tetracycline therapy.
AB  == background: tetracyclines have been extensively used as adjunctives to conventional periodontal therapy. emergence of resistant strains, however, has been reported. this study evaluated longitudinally the tetracycline resistance patterns of the subgingival microbiota of periodontitis subjects treated with systemic or local tetracycline therapy+scaling and root planing (srp). methods: thirty chronic periodontitis patients were randomly assigned to three groups: srp+500 mg of systemic tetracycline twice/day for 14 days; srp alone and srp+tetracycline fibers (actsite) at four selected sites for 10 days. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from four sites with probing pocket depths (ppd)> or =6 mm in each patient at baseline, 1 week, 3, 6 and 12 months post-therapy. samples were dispersed and diluted in pre-reduced anaerobically sterilized ringer's solution, plated on trypticase soy agar (tsa)+5% blood with or without 4 microg/ml of tetracycline and incubated anaerobically for 10 days. the percentage of resistant microorganisms were determined and the isolates identified by dna probes and the checkerboard method. significance of differences among and within  groups over time was sought using the kruskal-wallis and friedman tests, respectively. results: the percentage of resistant microorganisms increased significantly at 1 week in the tetracycline groups, but dropped to baseline levels over time. the srp+actsite group presented the lowest proportions of resistant species at 6 and 12 months. no significant changes were observed in the srp group. the predominant tetracycline-resistant species included streptococcus  spp., veillonela parvula, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, gemella morbillorum and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa). a high percentage of sites with resistant aa, porphyromonas gingivalis and tanerella forsythensis was observed in all groups at baseline. however, t. forsythensis was not detected in any group and p. gingivalis was not present in the srp+actsite group at 1 year post-therapy. aa was still frequently detected in all groups after therapy. however, the greatest reduction was observed in the srp+actsite group. conclusion: local or systemically administered tetracycline results in transitory selection of subgingival species intrinsically resistant to this drug. although the percentage of sites harboring periodontal pathogens resistant to tetracycline were quite elevated in this population, both therapies were effective in reducing their prevalence over time.

TI  == bacteriological study of root canals associated with periapical abscesses.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to identify microorganisms from root canals  with periapical abscesses and to ascertain the susceptibility of peptostreptococcus prevotii and fusobacterium necrophorum to antimicrobials. study design thirty root canals were microbiologically sampled by using sterile paper points. the concomitant microorganisms were identified through the use of established methods. the susceptibility of p prevotii and f necrophorum to antimicrobials was evaluated by using the e test method. results: a total of 117  different bacterial strains were recovered, including 75 strict anaerobes or microphilic species. the most frequently isolated strict anaerobes were p prevotii, peptostreptococcus micros, and f necrophorum. facultative bacteria such as gemella morbillorum and streptococcus mitis were also found, albeit less frequently. the data revealed that p prevotii and f necrophorum were susceptible  to the tested antibiotics. conclusions: gram-positive anaerobic bacteria predominate in the mixed microbiota of root canals with periapical abscesses. moreover, p prevotii and f necrophorum are susceptible to the tested antibiotics.

TI  == gemella bacteraemia characterised by 16s ribosomal rna gene sequencing.
AB  == aims: to define epidemiology, clinical disease, and outcome of gemella bacteraemia by 16s rrna gene sequencing. to examine the usefulness of the vitek,  api, and atb systems in identifying two gemella species. methods: all alpha haemolytic streptococci other than streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from blood cultures during a six year period were identified by conventional biochemical methods, the vitek system, and the api system. 16s rrna gene sequencing was performed on all isolates identified by both kits as gemella with >or= 95% confidence or by either kit as any bacterial species with < 95% confidence. the atb expression system was used to identify the two isolates that were defined as  gemella species by 16s rrna gene sequencing. results: of the 302 alpha haemolytic streptococci other than s pneumoniae isolated, one was identified as gemella morbillorum, and another as gemella haemolysans by 16s rrna gene sequencing. the  patient with monomicrobial g morbillorum bacteraemia was a 66 year old man with community acquired infective endocarditis with septic thromboemboli. the patient  with g haemolysans bacteraemia was a 41 year old woman with hospital acquired polymicrobial bacteraemia during the neutropenic period of an autologous bone marrow transplant for non-hodgkin's lymphoma, the first case of its kind in the english literature. the api and atb expression systems only identified the second strain as g haemolysans at 94% and 99% confidence, respectively, whereas the vitek system identified none of the two strains correctly at > 70% confidence. conclusions: gemella bacteraemia is uncommon. 16s rrna gene sequencing is the method of choice for identification of gemella and gemella-like isolates.

TI  == bacteriology and antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive cocci isolated from pus specimens of orofacial odontogenic infections.
AB  == we recently reported the beta-lactamase production and antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic gram-negative rods isolated from pus specimens of 93  orofacial odontogenic infections. in this report, we determine the bacteriology and antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria other than anaerobic gram-negative rods, mainly gram-positive cocci, isolated from the same specimens. streptococcus constellatus and peptostreptococcus micros were frequent isolates from all types  of infection examined. peptostreptococcus prevotii, corynebacterium species, and  eubacterium species were recovered only from dentoalveolar infections, while gemella morbillorum was found more frequently in periodontitis than in the other  infections. beta-lactamase-positive strains were detected only in staphylococci.  ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefazolin, cefotaxime, imipenem, erythromycin,  clindamycin and levofloxacin showed high susceptibility rates (> or = 77%) against viridans streptococci, peptostreptococcus and gemella. minocycline showed a high mic90 value against viridans streptococci (32 microg/ml), and metronidazole was effective against peptostreptococcus and gemella. these results provide useful information for the treatment of orofacial odontogenic infections.

TI  == association of early onset periodontitis microbiota with aspartate aminotransferase activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == objectives: the objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the activity of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (ast) in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) using the colorimetric periogard (ptm) test and the subgingival microflora in early onset periodontitis lesions. material and methods: the study population consisted of 25 otherwise healthy individuals exhibiting early onset periodontitis (eop). in each patient four experimental sites were identified comprising one deep periodontal pocket (pd >5 mm) randomly  chosen in each quadrant. bacterial samples were obtained from the experimental sites, consecutively cultured anaerobically and in 10% co(2) using selective and  nonselective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional  biochemical tests and various identification kits. clinical measurements as well  as ast activity, assessed either as positive or negative using the ptm, were recorded at the same sites. results: sixty-two sites exhibited ast positive and 38 ast negative activity. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann whitney u-test) showed that streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides forsythus, camplobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus and selenomonas sputigena were significantly higher in sites with ast-positive activity. the odds ratio of having high prevalence of s. intermedius, p. micros, c. concisus, b. forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus and s.  sputigena in the presence of a positive ast site was very high (range: 3.5-17.0). streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, gemella morbillorum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium varium, eubacterium lentum and prevotella oralis were detected in significantly higher proportions in sites with ast negative activity and manifested a negative odds ratio in the presence of ast positive sites. the logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and bleeding upon probing showed a significant association with ast activity, while plaque and suppuration were not found to be significant predictors of ast activity. the co-infection of porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus and p. micros, or p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and c. rectus were found  to be significantly associated with the ast activity (p<0.001). ast positive sites revealed significantly higher occurrence of co-infections by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. sputigena or by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. intermedius than ast negative sites (p<0.001). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. naeslundii co-infection was found significantly higher in the ast negative sites (p<0.001).  conclusions: the present study found a high level of agreement between the presence of putative periodontal pathogens and positive ast scores at periodontal sites that clinically were considered to be potentially disease active. prospective studies should be performed to confirm the findings.

TI  == recurrent aortic valve endocarditis caused by gemella morbillorum--report of a case and review of the literature.
AB  == gemella morbillorum (g. morbillorum) is part of the commensal flora of the oropharynx and intestinal tract, and on rare occasions causes infective endocarditis. a 55-year-old man with massive aortic regurgitation caused by recurrent infective endocarditis with g. morbillorum had a history of prior endocarditis caused by alpha-hemolytic streptococcus and multiple antibiotic allergies 5 years prior, and was successfully treated by aortic valve replacement. almost all the reported cases of endocarditis caused by g. morbillorum have been bacteriologically cured with antibiotics and this is the first reported case of recurrent endocarditis caused by g. morbillorum in which the initial infection was bacteriologically cured by antibiotics and the secondary infection treated with valve replacement. this organism can be one of the causes of infective endocarditis and prompt surgical repair is mandatory if the infection is refractory or there is progression of congestive heart failure under antibiotic cover.

TI  == immunoglobulin a1 protease activity in gemella haemolysans.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the occurrence and nature of immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease activity in members of the genus gemella and related taxa. among a total of 22 gemella strains belonging to the four species gemella haemolysans, gemella morbillorum, gemella sanguinis, and gemella bergeriae and four reference strains of the species helcococcus kunzii, facklamia hominis, and globicatella sanguinis, iga1 protease activity was an exclusive character of all nine isolates of g. haemolysans. the iga1 protease of g. haemolysans appears to be a metallo-type iga1 protease that cleaves the pro(227)-thr(228) peptide bond in the hinge region of the alpha1 chain like that  of several streptococcus species. phenotypic characterization of the isolates demonstrates that screening for iga1 protease activity provides a valuable means  for species differentiation in this group of bacteria.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  == eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. the aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). the samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. forty-one different microbial species were isolated. gemella morbillorum and peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while p. micros, streptococcus intermedius, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loeschei, p. melaninogenica and selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. the bacterial species s. constellatus, g. morbillorum and p. magnus were  isolated in greater numbers in incisors and p. micros, s. intermedius, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides egertheii, b. forsythus, p. oralis and s. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. cluster i was predominated by s. constellatus, s. mitis, s. sanguis, g. morbillorum, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; cluster ii was predominated by s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea and p. intermedia; cluster iii was predominated by s. mitis, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum,  p. loeschei, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; and finally cluster iv was predominated by s. sanguis, c. gingivalis, veillonella parvula, campylobacter gracilis, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia. the bacterial species s. constellatus,  p. micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, eikenella corrodens and f. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while s. intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.

TI  == abiotrophia elegans strains comprise 8% of the nutritionally variant streptococci isolated from the human mouth.
AB  == ninety-one isolates of nutritionally variant streptococci (nvs) that were previously isolated from the human mouth were regarded as consisting of 7 streptococcus defectivus isolates, 78 streptococcus adjacens isolates, and 6 gemella morbillorum isolates. however, recent references to the taxonomic reclassification of nvs, from s. defectivus to abiotrophia defectiva and from s.  adjacens to abiotrophia adiacens, and the newly introduced species abiotrophia elegans as a third abiotrophia species, emphasize the need for genetic analyses for identification of nvs. when pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) and phylogenetic distances were examined based on 16s rrna gene sequences, the results indicated that 7 of the 91 nvs isolates were closely related to a. elegans. these seven isolates consisted of four isolates previously identified as g. morbillorum and three isolates previously identified as s. adjacens. two isolates previously identified as g. morbillorum were related to a. adiacens. in  biochemical tests, a. elegans and the seven isolates related to it possessed arginine dihydrolase (adh) activity but the other abiotrophia species did not. as a result, a. elegans strains comprised 8% of the 91 nvs isolates. our findings suggest that a. elegans, a. adiacens, and a. defectiva exist in the human mouth in proportions of about 1:11:1 and that a. elegans can be genetically distinguished from the other two abiotrophia species by pcr-rflp analysis of 16s  rrna gene sequences and can be biochemically distinguished by adh activity.

TI  == isolated tricuspid valve endocarditis in nonaddicted patients: a diagnostic challenge.
AB  == isolated native nonrheumatic tricuspid valve endocarditis rarely is described in  the absence of intravenous drug use, intracardiac catheters, or cardiac anomalies. we diagnosed tricuspid valve endocarditis in two elderly nonaddicted patients with recurrent pulmonary infiltrates, anemia, and microscopic hematuria  that occurred during several months and was caused by gemella morbillorum and candida glabrata, respectively. we have reviewed 27 other cases of nonaddicted patients with tricuspid valve endocarditis from the literature and discussed etiology, clinical characteristics, and outcome. mean age was 53.5 years (range,  22 to 74 years old), and 72% had underlying medical conditions. staphylococcus oureus, streptococcus bovis, and candida species were the causative organisms in  70% of the cases. average duration of infection before diagnosis was 9.3 months.  we conclude that isolated tricuspid valve endocarditis in nonaddicted patients occurs mainly in the middle-aged and older persons, mimicking chronic illness and community-acquired pneumonia. in the absence of a history of intravenous drug use, diagnostic delays are common. we suggest that right-sided endocarditis must  be considered in any patient with the "tricuspid syndrome," consisting of recurrent pulmonary events, anemia, and microscopic hematuria. careful evaluation of prior medical records and clinical course can be very helpful. echocardiography and serial blood cultures provide the key to diagnosis.

TI  == isolation and properties of bacteriolytic enzyme-producing cocci from the human mouth.
AB  == one-hundred-and-one bacteriolytic enzyme producing organisms were isolated from various sites of the mouth. all were non-hemolytic, gram-positive, and chain-forming cocci. ninety-one strains, like the reference strains of streptococcus defectivus and s. adjacens, were dependent on pyridoxal for growth  and produced a chromophore. the rapid id32 strep system speciated these isolates  as s. defectivus, s. adjacens or gemella morbillorum. the remaining 10 bacteriolytic isolates were pyridoxal-independent and 8 belonged to s. intermediate. some pyridoxal-independent s. intermedius reference strains including atcc27335t and all group d enterococcus strains tested were also bacteriolytic. thus, bacteriolytic enzyme production is common to nutritionally variant streptococci but not unique to s. defectives and s. adjacens. the nutritionally variant strains generally had arylamidases but not alkaline phosphatase. the s. defectivus strains produced alpha-and beta-galactosidases (biotype 1) whereas the s. adjacens strains generally produced n-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase and some had beta-glucuronidase but others did not  (biotypes 2 and 3). the c. morbillorum strains had no detectable activity of these glycosidases (biotype 4) but produced a chromophore and an arginine dihydrolase, exhibiting a physiological profile atypical of the gemella species.  this indicates the possible presence of an additional phenotypic group or a new species among the nutritionally variant streptococci.

TI  == gemella morbillorum as a cause of septic shock.
AB  == the gram-positive bacterium gemella morbillorum has been recovered from patients  with endocarditis but has rarely been associated with acute fulminant infections. we describe two children with a rapid onset of septic shock, which was fatal in one, following infection with this organism. g. morbillorum is a commensal organism of the upper respiratory tract; it gained access to the bloodstreams in  these patients, and bacteremia occurred. a clinical drawback is that the initial  colonial morphology of this organism leads to presumptive identification as a viridans streptococcus, an organism not commonly associated with septic shock syndrome. resistance of g. morbillorum to penicillin appears to be common; therefore, initial empirical combination therapy (a beta-lactam agent and an aminoglycoside) or vancomycin treatment should be considered.

TI  == [pericarditis caused by gemella morbillorum. description of a case].
AB  == pericardial diseases, in the pediatric age group are rare, and are usually due to viral infection or collagen diseases. since the advent of the antibiotic era, bacterial pericardial has rarely been reported, and the bacteria most commonly involved are staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophylus influenzae and neisseria meningitidis; other pyogenic agents have rarely been isolated in pericarditis. gemella morbillorum, also known as streptococcus morbillorum, is a gram-positive pyogen, usually a saprophite agent of the human gastrointestinal tract, rarely associated with human infections such as arthritis, endocarditis and meningitidis; to our knowledge, it has never been isolated in pericarditis. we report a case of pyogenic pericarditis in an 11-year-old boy, suffering from substernal chest pain for about one year, in which the clinical symptoms, the presence of acute phase proteins, the large amount of fluid within the pericardial space (echocardiographically estimated to  be approximately 18 mm), the lack of improvement in clinical conditions and in laboratory values after therapy (diuretics, broad spectrum antibiotics and steroids) led to the indication for a pericardial drainage with the isolation of  gemella morbillorum. antimicrobial therapy was then modified according to in vitro susceptibility of the gemella morbillorum, with a decisive contribution to  the recovery of the patient, although long-term steroid therapy (5 months) was necessary because of one recurrence of pericardial effusion. this case report shows how gemella morbillorum, usually a saprophit microorganism, can become pathogenic and also underlines the importance of a correct etiologic diagnosis of pericarditis resistent to classical antibiotic therapy.

TI  == treatment of streptococcal endocarditis with a single daily dose of ceftriaxone and netilmicin for 14 days: a prospective multicenter study.
AB  == a 2-week course of ceftriaxone (2 g) plus netilmicin (4 mg/kg), administered as one short daily iv infusion, was evaluated for the treatment of streptococcal endocarditis in an open multicenter study. of the 52 patients, 31 were infected with viridans streptococci, 18 with streptococcus bovis, two with gemella morbillorum, and one with group c streptococcus; 48 patients were assessable. infection was cured in 42 cases, 35 treated medically and seven treated both medically and surgically. five patients died without evidence of active infection, and one relapsed. the bacteriologic failure was due to a strain of g.  morbillorum against which no synergy of ceftriaxone and netilmicin was evident in vitro. the serum creatinine level increased during treatment in four cases, all involving patients > 65 years old who had renal risk factors; in two of these cases, values did not return to baseline during follow-up. of 40 patients assessed for auditory function, only one developed decreased perception of borderline significance. other adverse reactions were mild. this regimen was efficacious, safe, and cost-effective for the treatment of streptococcal endocarditis. however, it must be used with caution for patients with preexisting renal impairment or concomitant exposure to other potentially nephrotoxic agents.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of cefmenoxime against recent fresh clinical isolates from patients in sinusitis].
AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (cmx), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cmx and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates from patients of sinusitis that were obtained in our laboratory from october of 1993 to march of 1994. the results are summarized as follows; 1.  cmx showed strong antimicrobial activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis that were 3 major aerobic bacteria from sinusitis. antimicrobial activities of cmx against benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) and pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) were stronger than those of ampicillin (abpc), and these strong activities suggested that cmx might have strong antimicrobial activities against  beta-lactamase producing h. influenzae and m. (b.) catarrhalis. 2. antimicrobial  activities of cmx against microaerophiles, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus intermedius and gemella morbillorum and against peptostreptococcus  spp., from chronic sinusitis and odontogenic maxillary sinusitis, were stronger than those of most of the control drugs. 3. the mic90's of cmx against isolates from patients of sinusitis were < or = 0.025-0.39 micrograms/ml. these values were lower than transitional concentrations in mucous membrane of maxillary sinus obtained when "1% cmx nasal solution" was used with nebulizer. it appears likely  that sufficient concentrations exceeding mics against main organisms would be obtained by nebulizer treatment using cmx nasal solution.

TI  == detection of tet(m) and tet(o) using the polymerase chain reaction in bacteria isolated from patients with periodontal disease.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction was used to examine 114 tetracycline-resistant anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial isolates from patients with periodontal disease for the tet(m) and tet(o) genes. a 740-base-pair fragment of  the tet(m) gene was amplified from 84 of 114 isolates, and a 519-base-pair fragment of the tet(o) gene was amplified from 13 streptococcal isolates. six of  7 tetracycline-resistant isolates of veillonella spp. and tetracycline-resistant  isolates of eubacterium spp. (n = 3), eubacterium saburreum (n = 1), streptococcus intermedius (n = 5) and gemella morbillorum (n = 2) all harbored the tet(m) gene. the tet(m) and tet(o) negative as well as selected positive isolates were tested for the tet(k) and tet(l) genes using dna probes. all isolates of staphylococcus spp. (n = 11) hybridized with the tet(k) probe. none of the isolates tested hybridized with the probe for tet(l). this is the first report of the tet(m) gene in the facultative bacterium g. morbillorum and in e. saburreum.

TI  == gram-positive cocci isolated from slaughtered poultry.
AB  == gram-positive cocci were found in all meat samples of poultry slaughtered and processed for retail sale, at incidence rates ranging from 10(2) cfu/ml to 1.35 x 10(6) cfu/ml and a mode between 8 x 10(5) and 9 x 10(5) cfu/ml for 75% of the samples. the 93 isolated strains were identified as belonging to the following species: enterococcus faecalis (48 strains), e. faecium (16), e. avium (7), e. durans (4), aerococcus viridans (10), streptococcus morbillorum (2), s. salivarius (1), s. sanguis (1), s. "milleri" (1), s. pneumoniae (1), s. acidominimus (1), and gemella haemolysans (1). these species, which mainly colonize the intestinal tract, but may also be found in other parts of both the human and animal body, are pathogens or potentially such. their presence is an indication of the fecal contamination of meat processed following gutting of slaughtered chickens (endogenous contamination). a count of the gram-positive cocci and enterobacteria detected showed that enterococci were present in a far greater number than coliform bacteria.

TI  == microaerophilic streptococcal infection in children.
AB  == a total of 148 isolates of microaerophilic streptococci (ms) (47 streptococcus constellatus, 43 streptococcus intermedius and five gemella morbillorum) were cultured from 123 children. there were predisposing conditions in 47 (38%) patients of which most common were previous surgery (14), trauma (11), malignancy (9) diabetes (6) and immunodeficiency (5). ms were the only bacteria isolated from 12 (10%) patients and mixed infections were encountered in 111, when the number of isolates varied between two and seven (average 3.0) isolates per specimen. the bacteria most commonly isolated with ms were anaerobic cocci (70 isolates), bacteroides fragilis group (54), pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas (34) and escherichia coli (26). most b. fragilis and e. coli were recovered from intra-abdominal infections, and those of skin and soft tissue adjacent to the rectum. most pigmented prevotella and fusobacteria were isolated  from oropharyngeal, pulmonary, head and neck sites. most ms were recovered from abscesses (43%), the abdominal cavity (17%), sinuses (10%) and chest infections (9%). antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients, in 61 this was combined with surgical drainage or correction. three patients died. these data illustrate that ms can occasionally be associated with infection in children.

AB  == recently, g. haemolysans and s. morbillorum were postulated to be identical organisms, so that consequently their names were synonyms. in the present paper it was demonstrated, that, in spite of many similarities, both species can be differentiated by nitrite reduction, lacking in s. morbillorum, and some further  enzymatic activities as well as by antigenic specificity and certain dissimilarities in morphology, growth conditions and their ability to induce beta-hemolysis. s. morbillorum apparently represents a group of strains with divergent properties and might be assigned to the genus gemella rather than to streptococcus.

TI  == effects of dietary chlortetracycline on the antimicrobial resistance of porcine faecal streptococcaceae.
AB  == breeding pigs and one-half of their progeny were fed antimicrobial-free rations;  the other half of the progeny received rations supplemented with 100 g of chlortetracycline (ctc)/ton. effects of dietary ctc with respect to the distribution of species and biotypes of faecal gram-positive cocci and their relative resistance to 12 antimicrobial agents were studied. diversity of antimicrobial resistance (amr) patterns and modal amr patterns were determined for bacterial species common to all three groups. numerical taxonomic analysis placed 1140 of 1150 isolates (99%) into 10 groups. three of these were biotypes of streptococcus faecium and contained the largest number of isolates (n = 934, 81%). streptococcus faecalis, strep. morbillorum, pediococcus halophilus and gemella haemolysans also were isolated. generally, the proportion of tetracycline-resistant strains for a species or biotype was greater from pigs fed ctc, although differences were not significant (p greater than 0.05). there was a significant difference (p less than 0.05) among all the groups for the percentage of penicillin-resistant strains in a biotype of strep. faecium. overall, 57 and 43 different amr patterns, including 2 to 11 and 1 to 11 resistance determinants, were demonstrated in isolates from control pigs and pigs fed ctc, respectively. modal amr patterns in species and biotypes were the same from both progeny groups, except for strep. faecium. amr pattern diversity was decreased for strains from pigs fed ctc. similar proportions of resistant strains from each group of progeny pigs were accompanied by decreased amr pattern diversity in strains from pigs fed ctc. these results indicated a change in distribution of amr phenotypical patterns, rather than a change in overall frequency of individual resistant phenotypes.
