TI  == yaxab, a yersinia enterocolitica pore-forming toxin regulated by rova.
AB  == the transcriptional regulator rova positively regulates transcription of the yersinia enterocolitica virulence gene inv. invasin, encoded by inv, is important for establishment of y. enterocolitica infection. however, a rova mutant is more  attenuated for virulence than an inv mutant, implying that rova regulates additional virulence genes. when the y. enterocolitica rova regulon was defined by microarray analysis, ye1984 and ye1985 were among the genes identified as being upregulated by rova. since these genes are homologous to xenorhabdus nematophila cytotoxin genes xaxa and xaxb, we named them yaxa and yaxb, respectively. in this work, we demonstrate the effects of yaxab on the course of  infection in the murine model. while a yaxab mutant (deltayaxab) is capable of colonizing mice at the same level as the wild type, it slightly delays the course of infection and results in differing pathology in the spleen. further, we found  that yaxab encode a probable cytotoxin capable of lysing mammalian cells, that both yaxa and yaxb are required for cytotoxic activity, and that the two proteins associate. yaxab-mediated cell death occurs via osmotic lysis through the formation of distinct membrane pores. in silico tertiary structural analysis identified predicted structural homology between yaxa and proteins in pore-forming toxin complexes from bacillus cereus (hbl-b) and escherichia coli (hlye). thus, it appears that yaxab function as virulence factors by inducing cell lysis through the formation of pores in the host cell membrane. this characterization of yaxab supports the hypothesis that rova regulates expression  of multiple virulence factors in y. enterocolitica.

TI  == the xaxab genes encoding a new apoptotic toxin from the insect pathogen xenorhabdus nematophila are present in plant and human pathogens.
AB  == xenorhabdus nematophila, a member of the enterobacteriaceae, kills many species of insects by strongly depressing the immune system and colonizing the entire body. a peptide cytotoxin has been purified from x. nematophila broth growth, and the cytolytic effect on insect immunocytes and hemolytic effect on mammalian red  blood cells of this toxin have been described (ribeiro, c., vignes, m., and brehelin, m. (2003) j. biol. chem. 278, 3030-3039). we show here that this toxin, xenorhabdus alpha-xenorhabdolysin (xax), triggers apoptosis in both insect and mammalian cells. we also report the cloning and sequencing of two genes, xaxab, encoding this toxin in x. nematophila. the expression of both genes in recombinant escherichia coli led to the production of active cytotoxin/hemolysin. however, hemolytic activity was observed only if the two peptides were added in the appropriate order. furthermore, we report here that inactivation of xaxab genes in x. nematophila abolished the major cytotoxic activity present in broth growth, called c1. we also show that these genes are present in various entomopathogenic bacteria of the genera xenorhabdus and photorhabdus, in pseudomonas entomophila, in the human pathogens yersinia enterocolitica and proteus mirabilis, and in the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae. this toxin cannot be classified in any known family of cytotoxins on the basis of amino acid sequences, locus organization, and activity features. it is, therefore, probably  the prototype of a new family of binary toxins.

TI  == low temperature-induced insecticidal activity of yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == the insecticidal toxin complexes (tcs) are produced by several enterobacteriaceae associated with insects, such as photorhabdus luminescens, serratia entomophila and xenorhabdus nematophilus. genome sequences revealed tc-like genes in yersinia spp., but insecticidal activity of this genus associated with the toxins has not  been described. through the search for genes upregulated at low growth temperatures in yersinia enterocolitica strain w22703, a genomic island of 19 kb  termed tc-pai(ye) with homologues of the toxin genes tcaa, tcab, tcac and tccc was identified. southern blot and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis of 34  strains demonstrated that the tc-pai(ye) is present in biovars 2, 3 and 4, but neither in biovars 1a and 1b, nor in five yersinia species apathogenic in humans. using the luxcdabe operon as reporter, the expression of the toxin genes was shown to be completely repressed in cells cultured at 37 degrees c, and to increase by 4.6 orders of magnitude when the growth temperature was decreased gradually to 10 degrees c. these data provide the first indication that temperature is a critical parameter for induction or repression of tc gene transcription. whole-cell extracts of y. enterocolitica strain w22703 cultivated  at 10 degrees c, but not at 30 degrees c, led to insect mortality when fed to manduca sexta larvae, in contrast to an insertional tcaa mutant. overall the results suggest that the tc-pai(ye) could play an important role in the transmission and survival of pathogenic y. enterocolitica strains outside mammalian hosts.
