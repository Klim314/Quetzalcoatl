TI  == microbial dynamics during conversion from supragingival to subgingival biofilms in an in vitro model.
AB  == the development of dental caries and periodontal diseases result from distinct shifts in the microbiota of the tooth-associated biofilm. this in vitro study aimed to investigate changes in biofilm composition and structure, during the shift from a "supragingival" aerobic to a "subgingival" anaerobic profile. biofilms consisting of actinomyces oris, candida albicans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar were aerobically grown in saliva-containing medium on hydroxyapatite discs. after 64 h, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus anginosus were further added along with human serum, while culture conditions were shifted to microaerophilic. after 96 h, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were finally added and the biofilm was grown anaerobically for another 64 h. at the end of each phase, biofilms were harvested for species-specific quantification and localization. apart from c. albicans, all other species gradually increased during aerobic and microaerophilic conditions,  but remained steady during anaerobic conditions. biofilm thickness was doubled during the microaerophilic phase, but remained steady throughout the anaerobic phase. extracellular polysaccharide presence was gradually reduced throughout the growth period. biofilm viability was reduced during the microaerophilic conversion, but was recovered during the anaerobic phase. this in vitro study has characterized the dynamic structural shifts occurring in an oral biofilm model during the switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, potentially modeling the  conversion of supragingival to subgingival biofilms. within the limitations of this experimental model, the findings may provide novel insights into the ecology of oral biofilms. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == antimicrobial, antitumor and brine shrimp lethality assay of ranunculus arvensis  l. extracts.
AB  == to investigate the antitumor activity, brine shrimp lethality assay, antibacterial and antifungal activity of methanol extract (me), water extract (we), acetone extract (ae), chloroform extract (ce), methanol-water extract (mwe), methanol-acetone extract (mae), methanol-chloroform extract (mce) of ranunculus arvensis (l.). antitumor activity was evaluated with agrobacterium tumefaciens (at10) induced potato disc assay. cytotoxicity was evaluated with brine shrimp lethality assay. antibacterial activity was evaluated with six bacterial strains including escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, bordetella  bronchiseptica, klebsiella pneumoniae, micrococcus luteus and streptococcus anginosus and antifungal screening was done against five fungal strains including aspergillus niger, a. flavus, a. fumigates, fusarium solani and mucor species by  using disc diffusion method. best antitumor activity was obtained with me and we, having highest ic50 values 20.27 +/- 1.62 and 93.01 +/- 1.33mug/disc. brine shrimp lethality assay showed lc50 values of ae, mae and me were obtained as 384.66 +/- 9.42mug/ml, 724.11 +/- 8.01mug/ml and 978.7 +/-8.01 mug/ml respectively. we of r. arvensis revealed weak antimicrobial result against the tested microorganisms. on the other hand, the antifungal activity of the plant extracts was found to be insignificant. these findings demonstrate that extracts  of r. arvensis possesses significant antitumor activity. further extensive study  is necessary to assess the therapeutic potential of the plant.

TI  == oral microbiota shift after 12-week supplementation with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289; a randomized control trial.
AB  == background: lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. methods and findings: oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna hypervariable region v3-v4 after 12 weeks of daily lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289 consumption. forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 cfu of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). presence of l. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific pcr. tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. a total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. after removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the human oral microbiome database. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. streptococcus was the most common genus and the s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group comprised the dominant species. the number of observed species was unaffected by l. reuteri exposure. however, subjects who had consumed l. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and pcr detected l. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. l. reuteri intake correlated with increased s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group and campylobacter concisus, granulicatella adiacens, bergeyella sp. hot322, neisseria subflava, and sr1 [g-1] sp. hot874 detection and reduced s. mutans, s. anginosus, n. mucosa, fusobacterium periodicum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, and prevotella maculosa detection. this effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. conclusions: l. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. the biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02311218.

TI  == how an opportunistic infection can mess with your brain and take your breath away: a rare case of simultaneous lung and brain abscess due to streptococcus anginosus.
AB  == streptococcus anginosus (s. anginosus) is considered a friendly bug and is a one  of many different bacteria that constitute the normal flora of the oral cavity. nevertheless, it has been infrequently associated with more invasive infections,  like lung abscess. it is extremely rare to have multisystemic involvement with s. anginosus group. we present a unique case of pulmonary and brain abscess due to s. anginosus in an immunocompetent patient.

TI  == intracranial bacterial infections of oral origin.
AB  == brain abscesses are rare but potentially deadly complications of odontogenic infections. this phenomenon has been described mainly in the form of case reports, as large-scale studies are difficult to perform. we compiled a total of  60 previously published cases of such a complication to investigate the predisposing factors, microbiology, and clinical outcomes of intracranial abscesses of odontogenic origin. a systematic review of the literature using the  pubmed database was performed. men accounted for 82.1% of cases, and the mean age was 42.1 years. caries with periapical involvement and periodontitis were the two most common intra-oral sources, and wisdom tooth extraction was the most common preceding dental procedure. in 56.4% of cases, there were obvious signs of dental disease prior to development of intracranial infection. commonly implicated microorganisms included streptococcus viridans (especially the anginosus group),  actinomyces, peptostreptococcus, prevotella, fusobacterium, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and eikenella corrodens. there was an 8.3% mortality rate.  intracranial abscesses can form anywhere within the brain, and appear unrelated to the side of dental involvement. this suggests that hematogenous spread is the  most likely route of dissemination.

TI  == [management of nasal orbital cellulitis in children].
AB  == objective: to analyze the clinical characteristics, diagnostic and treatment principle of orbital cellulitis in children, and to improve the experience of antibiotic treatment in orbital cellulites. methods: twenty children were admitted to shenzhen children's hospital with the diagnosis of nasal orbital cellulitis between january 2009 and december 2013. the children were severe enough to warrant hospital admission. there were 13(65%) males and 7 (35%) females. the median age was 3.5 years (2 months to 7.2 years). the relationship between the serum c-reactive protein (crp), white blood cell count and the hospitalization days were analyzed. the children were divided into 2 groups: cefoperazone sodium and sulbactam sodium for injection group and other antibiotic treatment group, the difference was compared. statistical calculation was performed using spss 13.0 software. results: the serum crp [(29.8 +/- 22.0) mg/l] at the time of admission had a positive correlation with the time of hospitalization[ (6.3 +/- 4.1) d, r = 0.46, p < 0.05]. the time of crp decreased  to normal range after admission [(3.4 +/- 1.8) d] were apparently related to the  hospitalization time (r = 0.81, p < 0.01). the hospital days whose crp could be decreased to normal within 3 days [n = 12, (4.3 +/- 1.7) d] were significantly shorter than that in the others [n = 8, (9.1 +/- 5.0) d, t = 2.61, p < 0.05]. the hospitalization of 12 cases with cefoperazone sodium and sulbactam sodium for injection [(4.3 +/- 1.9) d] was shorter than that in other 8 cases with other drugs [(9.3 +/- 4.7) d, t = 2.83, p < 0.05]. bacterial pathogens were only identified in 4 children, including 3 cases of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), 1 case of streptococcus anginosus. only 1 case in 20 cases with positive blood culture for staphylococcus aureus, consistented with the pus culture. conclusions: if early treatment at the first three days is valid, the course of nasal orbital cellulitis will be shorter and the orbital abscess can be prevented. cefoperazone sulbactam and sulbactam sodium for injection is effective in treating pediatric orbital cellulitis.

TI  == quantitative proteomics reveal distinct protein regulations caused by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans within subgingival biofilms.
AB  == periodontitis is an infectious disease that causes the inflammatory destruction of the tooth-supporting (periodontal) tissues, caused by polymicrobial biofilm communities growing on the tooth surface. aggressive periodontitis is strongly associated with the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in the subgingival biofilms. nevertheless, whether and how a. actinomycetemcomitans orchestrates molecular changes within the biofilm is unclear. the aim of this work was to decipher the interactions between a. actinomycetemcomitans and other  bacterial species in a multi-species biofilm using proteomic analysis. an in vitro 10-species "subgingival" biofilm model, or its derivative that included additionally a. actinomycetemcomitans, were anaerobically cultivated on hydroxyapatite discs for 64 h. when present, a. actinomycetemcomitans formed dense intra-species clumps within the biofilm mass, and did not affect the numbers of the other species in the biofilm. liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify the proteomic content of the biofilm lysate. a  total of 3225 and 3352 proteins were identified in the biofilm, in presence or absence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, respectively. label-free quantitative proteomics revealed that 483 out of the 728 quantified bacterial proteins (excluding those of a. actinomycetemcomitans) were accordingly regulated. interestingly, all quantified proteins from prevotella intermedia were up-regulated, and most quantified proteins from campylobacter rectus, streptococcus anginosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were down-regulated in presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans. enrichment of gene ontology pathway analysis showed that the regulated groups of proteins were responsible primarily  for changes in the metabolic rate, the ferric iron-binding, and the 5s rna binding capacities, on the universal biofilm level. while the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans did not affect the numeric composition or absolute protein  numbers of the other biofilm species, it caused qualitative changes in their overall protein expression profile. these molecular shifts within the biofilm warrant further investigation on their potential impact on its virulence properties, and association with periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == quantification of pseudomonas aeruginosa in multispecies biofilms using pma-qpcr.
AB  == multispecies biofilms are an important healthcare problem and may lead to persistent infections. these infections are difficult to treat, as cells in a biofilm are highly resistant to antimicrobial agents. while increasingly being recognized as important, the properties of multispecies biofilms remain poorly studied. in order to do so, the quantification of the individual species is needed. the current cultivation-based approaches can lead to an underestimation of the actual cell number and are time-consuming. in the present study we set up  a culture-independent approach based on propidium monoazide qpcr (pma-qpcr) to quantify pseudomonas aeruginosa in a multispecies biofilm. as a proof of concept, we explored the influence of the combined presence of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus and burkholderia cenocepacia on the antimicrobial susceptibility of p. aeruginosa using this pma-qpcr approach.

TI  == species-specific difference in antimicrobial susceptibility among viridans group  streptococci.
AB  == background: viridans group streptococci (vgs) are both commensal microbes and potential pathogens. increasing resistance to penicillin in vgs is an ongoing issue in the clinical environment. we investigated the difference in susceptibility and resistance to penicillin among various vgs species. methods: in total 1,448 vgs isolated from various clinical specimens were analyzed over a  two-yr period. identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed by the automated vitek 2 system (biomerieux, france) or the microscan microstrep  system (siemens, germany). results: among the 1,448 isolates, 412 were isolated from blood (28.4%). streptococcus mitis group was the most frequently isolated (589 isolates, 40.7%), followed by the s. anginosus group (290 isolates, 20.0%),  s. sanguinis group (179 isolates, 12.4%) and s. salivarius group (57 isolates, 3.9%). in total, 314 isolates could not be identified up to the species level. the overall non-susceptibility to penicillin was observed to be 40.0% (resistant, 11.2% and intermediately resistant, 28.8%) with uneven distribution among groups; 40.2% in s. sanguinis group (resistant, 5.0% and intermediately resistant, 35.2%), 60.3% in s. mitis group (resistant, 20.9% and intermediately resistant, 39.4%), 78.9% in s. salivarius group (resistant, 8.8% and intermediately resistant, 70.1%), and 6.2% in s. anginosus group (resistant, 1.7% and intermediately resistant, 4.5%). conclusions: antimicrobial resistance patterns towards penicillin show differences among various vgs; this should be considered  while devising an effective antimicrobial treatment against vgs.

TI  == surrogate analysis of vancomycin to predict susceptible categorization of dalbavancin.
AB  == dalbavancin (dal) represents a recently approved addition for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssis). newly released antimicrobial agents are rarely found on commercial susceptibility testing devices, and surrogate testing may be an option for clinical microbiology laboratories. a total of 33,688 staphylococcus aureus, 2800 viridans group streptococci (vgs), and 5722 beta-hemolytic streptococci (bhs) were included in this cross-susceptibility (dal versus vancomycin [van]) analysis as well as 4576  coagulase-negative staphylococci and 6515 enterococci (nonindicated species groups). isolates were collected as part of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program for the united states (usa) and europe (2011-2013). susceptibility testing followed clsi (m07-a9 and m100-s24) methods. usa food and drug administration (dal) and clsi (van) breakpoint criteria were used for correlations between dal and van susceptibility results. a categorical agreement  (ca; susceptible) rate of 99.9% was observed between dal and van when testing s.  aureus. only 48 (0.14%) very major (false-susceptible) errors were noted against  van-susceptible isolates that displayed a dal-nonsusceptible (mic, 0.25 or 0.5mug/ml) phenotype. when susceptible mic correlations were analyzed against indicated bhs species (streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pyogenes), an overall ca rate of 97.7-100.0% was obtained. complete (100.0%) ca was documented  for s. pyogenes, as well as against all vgs isolates, including the indicated streptococcus anginosus group (758 strains). in conclusion, high susceptible ca rates between dal and van were observed when testing a contemporary collection of indicated clinical isolates found in absssi. van-susceptible isolates can be inferred to be inhibited by dal (97.7-100.0%) at the regulatory agency-approved susceptible interpretive breakpoint of </=0.12mug/ml.

TI  == environment and colonisation sequence are key parameters driving cooperation and  competition between pseudomonas aeruginosa cystic fibrosis strains and oral commensal streptococci.
AB  == cystic fibrosis (cf) patient airways harbour diverse microbial consortia that, in addition to the recognized principal pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa, include other bacteria commonly regarded as commensals. the latter include the oral (viridans) streptococci, which recent evidence indicates play an active role during infection of this environmentally diverse niche. as the interactions between inhabitants of the cf airway can potentially alter disease progression, it is important to identify key cooperators/competitors and environmental influences if therapeutic intervention is to be improved and pulmonary decline arrested. importantly, we recently showed that virulence of the p. aeruginosa liverpool epidemic strain (les) could be potentiated by the anginosus-group of streptococci (ags). in the present study we explored the relationships between other viridans streptococci (streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguinis) and the les and observed that co-culture outcome was dependent upon inoculation sequence and environment. all four streptococcal species were shown to potentiate les virulence factor production in co-culture biofilms. however, in the case of s. oralis interactions were environmentally determined; in air cooperation within a high cell density co-culture biofilm occurred together with stimulation of les virulence factor production, while in an atmosphere containing added co2 this species became a competitor antagonising les growth through hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) production, significantly altering biofilm population dynamics and appearance. streptococcus  mitis, s. gordonii and s. sanguinis were also capable of h2o2 mediated inhibition of p. aeruginosa growth, but this was only visible when inoculated as a primary coloniser prior to introduction of the les. therefore, these observations, which  are made in conditions relevant to the biology of cf disease pathogenesis, show that the pathogenic and colonisation potential of p. aeruginosa isolates can be modulated positively and negatively by the presence of oral commensal streptococci.

TI  == ventricular septal defect and bivalvular endocarditis.
AB  == a 63-year-old man presented with generalized fatigue, chills, malaise, dyspnea, intermittent fevers, and 50-pound weight loss of 4 months' duration. blood cultures were positive for pan-sensitive streptococcus anginosus. transesophageal echocardiography showed an 11 mm x 3 mm mobile mass attached to the mitral valve, a 16 mm x 16 mm mobile mass attached to the pulmonary valve, and a small membranous ventricular septal defect. the patient received 12 weeks of intravenous (iv) antibiotics with eventual resolution of the masses. multi-valve  endocarditis involving both the left and right chambers is rarely reported without prior history of iv drug use or infective endocarditis. our case emphasizes the importance of careful assessment for ventricular septal defects or extra-cardiac shunts in individuals who present with simultaneous right and left-sided endocarditis.

TI  == comparison of species identification of endocarditis associated viridans streptococci using rnpb genotyping and 2 maldi-tof systems.
AB  == streptococcus spp. are important causes of infective endocarditis but challenging in species identification. this study compared identification based on sequence determination of the rnpb gene with 2 systems of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, maldi biotyper (bruker) and vitek ms ivd (biomerieux). blood culture isolates of viridans streptococci from 63 patients with infective endocarditis were tested. the 3 methods showed full agreement for all 36 isolates identified in the anginosus, bovis, and mutans groups or identified as streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, or streptococcus sanguinis. none of the methods could reliably identify the 23 isolates to the species level when designated as streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, or streptococcus tigurinus. in 7 isolates classified to the mitis group, the rnpb sequences deviated strikingly from all reference sequences, and additional analysis of soda and groel genes indicated the occurrence of yet unidentified streptococcus spp.

TI  == establishment of an oral infection model resembling the periodontal pocket in a perfusion bioreactor system.
AB  == periodontal infection involves a complex interplay between oral biofilms, gingival tissues and cells of the immune system in a dynamic microenvironment. a  humanized in vitro model that reduces the need for experimental animal models, while recapitulating key biological events in a periodontal pocket, would constitute a technical advancement in the study of periodontal disease. the aim of this study was to use a dynamic perfusion bioreactor in order to develop a gingival epithelial-fibroblast-monocyte organotypic co-culture on collagen sponges. an 11 species subgingival biofilm was used to challenge the generated tissue in the bioreactor for a period of 24 h. the histological and scanning electron microscopy analysis displayed an epithelial-like layer on the surface of the collagen sponge, supported by the underlying ingrowth of gingival fibroblasts, while monocytic cells were also found within the sponge mass. bacterial quantification of the biofilm showed that in the presence of the organotypic tissue, the growth of selected biofilm species, especially campylobacter rectus, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, and porphyromonas gingivalis, was suppressed, indicating a potential antimicrobial effect by the tissue. multiplex immunoassay analysis of cytokine secretion showed that interleukin (il)-1 beta, il-2, il-4, and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha levels in cell culture supernatants were significantly up-regulated in presence of the biofilm, indicating a positive inflammatory response of the organotypic tissue to the biofilm challenge. in conclusion, this  novel host-biofilm interaction organotypic model might resemble the periodontal pocket and have an important impact on the study of periodontal infections, by minimizing the need for the use of experimental animal models.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2010  and march 2011].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2010 to march 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. such as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus avium was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. such as streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus spp. such as staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. such as e. faecalis  and e. faecium was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. such as s. aureus from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli and r aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of parvimonas micra, eggerthella lenta, streptococcus constellatus, gemella morbillorum, and collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed.

AB  == introduction: bilateral empyema is a rare and life-threatening condition that is  difficult to treat. we herein report a case of bilateral empyema that was treated with simultaneous bilateral decortications via video-assisted thoracic surgery (vats). presentation of case: a 38-year-old female complained of chest pain, dyspnea, and high grade fever lasting two weeks. computed tomography revealed bilateral notching pleural effusion and pneumonia with atelectasis. bilateral thoracic drainage was performed. from the right chest, white pus was drained, and streptococcus anginosus was identified. the left drainage fluid was serous, and no bacteria were identified. we diagnosed the patient with right empyema and left para-pneumonic effusion consequent to pneumonia. because conservative therapies could not resolve the inflammatory findings, simultaneous bilateral vats decortications were performed. both thoracic cavities had loculated pleural effusion. in contrast to the preoperative findings, white pus was found in not only the right, but also the left thoracic cavity. she had an uncomplicated postoperative course and recovered. discussion: bilateral empyema that has developed to the fibrinopleural phase is difficult to treat with drains alone. bilateral vats decortications helped to make a definitive diagnosis and treat both sides simultaneously. conclusion: simultaneous bilateral vats decortications should be considered as a feasible and effective procedure for bilateral empyema  that is refractory to medical treatment.

TI  == subperiosteal abscess of the orbit: evolving pathogens and the therapeutic protocol.
AB  == purpose: because of widespread antibiotic use, immunization against selective species, and the emergence of hypervirulent organisms, we sought to determine changes over time in the bacteriology of sinusitis-related subperiosteal abscess  (spa) of the orbit and their impact on patient outcomes under a uniform management protocol. design: comparative case series. subjects: patients</=18 years of age with sinusitis-related spa treated from 2002 to 2012; comparable cohorts from earlier time frames. methods: we analyzed culture results and outcomes in surgical cases, compared overall and age-specific results with those  in a 1977 through 1992 patient series, and compared the proportion of patients<9  years old requiring surgery among 1988 through 1998, 1999 through 2008, and current cohorts. main outcome measures: patients requiring surgery; prevalence of pathogens; criteria prompting surgery; visual and systemic outcomes. results: ninety-four patients met inclusion criteria: 53 (56%) recovered with medical therapy alone and 41 (44%) underwent surgical drainage. compared with the 1977 through 1992 cohort, there was increased representation of streptococcus anginosus group, s aureus, and group a beta-streptococci. methicillin-resistant s aureus (mrsa) accounted for 4 of 7 s aureus isolates. of 94 patients, 74 (79%) were <9 years of age: 53 (72%) recovered without surgery and 21 (28%) underwent drainage. comparable figures were 67.5% versus 32.5% and 85% versus 15% in 1988 through 1998 and 1999 through 2008 cohorts, respectively. whereas patients>/=9 years old in the 1977 through 1992 cohort had a higher proportion of positive cultures and more varied pathogens than younger patients, in the current series both groups had similar culture yields and aerobic constituencies. anaerobes were isolated from only patients>/=9 years old in both series. in cases positive for mrsa and other aggressive aerobes, initial findings prompted early drainage; outcomes were not compromised by adherence to the treatment protocol. conclusions: the proportion of children<9 years requiring surgery for sinusitis-related spa has remained a minority (15%-32.5%), without a clear upward trend over 25 years. anaerobes continue not to factor in the younger subgroup, but more aggressive aerobic pathogens, including mrsa, have emerged. in such cases, surgical criteria that supersede age are triggered under the current treatment algorithm, and modification is not recommended.

TI  == oral bacterial dna findings in pericardial fluid.
AB  == background: we recently reported that large amounts of oral bacterial dna can be  found in thrombus aspirates of myocardial infarction patients. some case reports  describe bacterial findings in pericardial fluid, mostly done with conventional culturing and a few with pcr; in purulent pericarditis, nevertheless, bacterial pcr has not been used as a diagnostic method before. objective: to find out whether bacterial dna can be measured in the pericardial fluid and if it correlates with pathologic-anatomic findings linked to cardiovascular diseases. methods: twenty-two pericardial aspirates were collected aseptically prior to forensic autopsy at tampere university hospital during 2009-2010. of the autopsies, 10 (45.5%) were free of coronary artery disease (cad), 7 (31.8%) had mild and 5 (22.7%) had severe cad. bacterial dna amounts were determined using real-time quantitative pcr with specific primers and probes for all bacterial strains associated with endodontic disease (streptococcus mitis group, streptococcus anginosus group, staphylococcus aureus/staphylococcus epidermidis,  prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra) and periodontal disease (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatus, and dialister pneumosintes). results: of 22 cases, 14 (63.6%) were positive for endodontic and 8 (36.4%) for periodontal-disease-associated bacteria. only one case was positive for bacterial culturing. there was a statistically significant association between the relative amount of bacterial dna in the pericardial fluid and the severity of cad (p=0.035). conclusions: oral bacterial dna was detectable in pericardial fluid and an association between the severity of cad and the total amount of bacterial  dna in pericardial fluid was found, suggesting that this kind of measurement might be useful for clinical purposes.

TI  == streptolysin s of streptococcus anginosus exhibits broad-range hemolytic activity.
AB  == streptococcus anginosus is a commensal of mucous membranes and an emerging human  pathogen. some strains, including the type strain, display a prominent beta-hemolytic phenotype. a gene cluster (sag), encoding a variant of streptolysin s (sls) has recently been identified as the genetic background for beta-hemolysin production in s. anginosus. in this study, we further characterized the hemolytic and cytolytic activity of the s. anginosus hemolysin  in comparison with other streptococcal hemolysins. the results indicate that sls  of s. anginosus is a broad-range hemolysin able to lyse erythrocytes of different species, including horse, bovine, rabbit and even chicken. the hemolytic activity is temperature dependent, and a down-regulation of the hemolysin expression is induced in the presence of high glucose levels. survival assays indicate that in  contrast to other streptococcal species, s. anginosus does not require sls for survival in the presence of human granulocytes. cross-complementation studies using the sagb and sagd genes of streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis demonstrated functional similarities to the s. anginosus sls. nevertheless, distinct differences to other streptolysin s variants were noted and provide further insights into the molecular mechanisms of sls pathogen host interactions.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of sirupus bioaron c, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of aloe arborescens, was tested against  different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. the experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus candida and on 18 reference strains (atcc). the antimicrobial activity  of bioaron c (mbc and mfc) was determined at undiluted concentration. bioaron c proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. at the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (mbc, mfc) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, parvimonas micra, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus anginosus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans, already after 15 min. the mic of bioaron c against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. the great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. bioaron c  may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.

TI  == activity of oritavancin against gram-positive clinical isolates responsible for documented skin and soft-tissue infections in european and us hospitals (2010-13).
AB  == objectives: to assess oritavancin activity in vitro against clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens causing skin and soft-tissue infections (sstis) in european and us hospitals. methods: 13 262 consecutive and unique isolates deemed to be responsible for sstis were included. isolates originated from 36 and 27 institutions in europe (israel included) and the usa, respectively, between 2010  and 2013. results: oritavancin (98.8% susceptible) showed modal mic, mic50 and mic90 results of 0.03, 0.03 and 0.06 mg/l, respectively, for staphylococcus aureus. cons from the usa (mic50, 0.015 mg/l) demonstrated an mic50 value of oritavancin slightly lower than those from europe (mic50, 0.03 mg/l). overall, vancomycin-resistant (vana-phenotype) enterococcus faecalis had oritavancin mics  (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/l) that were 16-fold higher than those obtained for vancomycin-susceptible isolates (mic50/90, 0.015/0.03 mg/l; 99.2%-99.8% susceptible); nevertheless, oritavancin inhibited all vana e. faecalis at </=0.5  mg/l. equivalent oritavancin mics (mic50/90, 0.004/0.008 mg/l) were noted for all vanb and vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium, while higher mics (mic50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/l) were obtained for vana strains. oritavancin had low mics against the overall populations of streptococcus pyogenes (mic50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/l; 98.4%-98.6% susceptible), streptococcus agalactiae (mic50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/l; 97.9%-98.0% susceptible) and the streptococcus anginosus group (mic50/90, 0.008/0.015 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible), with slightly higher mics for streptococcus dysgalactiae (mic50/90, 0.06/0.25 mg/l; >/=98.3% susceptible). conclusions: oritavancin had potent activity in vitro against this contemporary collection of european and us isolates causing sstis. these results describe oritavancin activity against gram-positive pathogens collected shortly prior to its regulatory approval in the usa.

TI  == phylogenomic and maldi-tof ms analysis of streptococcus sinensis hku4t reveals a  distinct phylogenetic clade in the genus streptococcus.
AB  == streptococcus sinensis is a recently discovered human pathogen isolated from blood cultures of patients with infective endocarditis. its phylogenetic position, as well as those of its closely related species, remains inconclusive when single genes were used for phylogenetic analysis. for example, s. sinensis branched out from members of the anginosus, mitis, and sanguinis groups in the 16s ribosomal rna gene phylogenetic tree, but it was clustered with members of the anginosus and sanguinis groups when groel gene sequences used for analysis. in this study, we sequenced the draft genome of s. sinensis and used a polyphasic approach, including concatenated genes, whole genomes, and matrix-assisted laser  desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry to analyze the phylogeny of s. sinensis. the size of the s. sinensis draft genome is 2.06 mb, with gc content of 42.2%. phylogenetic analysis using 50 concatenated genes or whole genomes revealed that s. sinensis formed a distinct cluster with streptococcus oligofermentans and streptococcus cristatus, and these three streptococci were clustered with the "sanguinis group." as for phylogenetic analysis using hierarchical cluster analysis of the mass spectra of streptococci, s. sinensis also formed a distinct cluster with s. oligofermentans and s. cristatus, but these three streptococci were clustered with the "mitis group." on the basis of the findings, we propose a novel group, named "sinensis group," to include s. sinensis, s. oligofermentans, and s. cristatus, in the streptococcus genus. our study also illustrates the power of phylogenomic analyses for resolving ambiguities in bacterial taxonomy.

TI  == streptococcus anginosus infections: crossing tissue planes.
AB  == streptococcus anginosus has long been recognized to cause invasive pyogenic infections. this holds true for thoracic infections where s. anginosus has a propensity for abscess and empyema formation. early diagnosis is important given  the significant morbidity and mortality associated with thoracic s. anginosus infections. yet, distinguishing thoracic s. anginosus clinically is difficult. we present three cases of thoracic s. anginosus that demonstrated radiographic extension across tissue planes, including the interlobar fissure, diaphragm, and  chest wall. few infectious etiologies are known to cross tissue planes. accordingly, we propose s. anginosus be considered among the differential diagnosis of potential infectious etiologies causing radiographic extension across tissue planes.

TI  == host cytokine responses distinguish invasive from airway isolates of the streptococcus milleri/anginosis group.
AB  == background: the streptococcus milleri/anginosus group (smg) colonize mucosal surfaces, especially the airways, and are considered to be normal mucosal microbiota; however, they are a major cause of abscesses, pneumonia and pleural empyema. the production of exoenzymes and virulence factors do not correlate with smg pathogenicity. since smg infections are associated with robust inflammatory responses, we hypothesized that host immune responses might distinguish strains associated with asymptomatic carriage and those associated with fulminant disease. methods: we measured il1beta, tnf, il10, il12, il23, il17, and il4 production from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) stimulated with  a panel of clinical isolates from the airways and infections and measured the ability of these isolates to stimulate tlr2. results: isolates were categorized based on the levels of cytokines they induced from pbmcs (high, intermediate, low). airway isolates predominantly induced low levels of cytokines and isolates  from invasive disease induced higher levels, although about 10% of the strains produced divergent cytokine responses between donors. interestingly, the donors were most divergent in their production of il17, il12 and il23. conclusions: we propose that the ability to inhibit or avoid an inflammatory response is associated with carriage in the airways and variability in responses between isolates and donors might contribute to susceptibility to disease.

TI  == secondary aortoduodenal fistula following endovascular repair of inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm due to streptococcus anginosus infection: a case report and literature review.
AB  == introduction: aortoenteric fistula is a rare but very serious complication of both surgical and endovascular abdominal aortic reconstruction. since the advent  of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (evar), 20 cases of aortoduodenal fistula associated with aortic stent grafts have been reported.(1)  however, only a handful has been reported following inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. it most commonly presents with bleeding, usually from the upper  gastro-intestinal tract. with recent advances in the screening, diagnosis and management of abdominal aortic aneurysms either surgically or through an endovascular approach, the diagnosis of an aortoduodenal fistula in patients with gastro-intestinal bleeding must be suspected and excluded. presentation of case:  we describe a case of secondary aortoduodenal fistula that occurred two and a half years following endovascular stent graft repair of an inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. we also outline the emergency correction plan and the attempts at repair. discussion: this case defies the general concept that patients with inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms are relatively immune to rupture. although the presence of a peri-aneurysm thick inflammatory membrane decreases the possibility of rupture, these patients are more susceptible to other related  complications such as aorto-enteric and aorto-caval fistulas.(2) this case also demonstrates the peculiar presence of streptococcus anginosus as the pathological organism leading to graft infection and subsequent fistula, as opposed to enterococci which are often found in endograft infection. conclusion: aorto-enteric fistulas are associated with a grave prognosis. early diagnosis is  crucial and extra vigilance should be taken in cases of inflammatory aaa.

TI  == streptococcus intermedius bacteremia and liver abscess following a routine dental cleaning.
AB  == streptococcus intermedius is a member of the streptococcus anginosus group of bacteria. this group is part of the normal flora of the oropharynx, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal tracts; however, they have been known to cause a variety of purulent infections including meningitis, endocarditis, and abscesses, even in immunocompetent hosts. in particular, s. intermedius has been  associated with the development of liver and brain abscesses. there have been several case reports of s. intermedius liver abscesses with active periodontal infection. to our knowledge, however, there has not been a case following a routine dental procedure. in fact, the development of liver abscesses secondary to dental procedures is very rare in general, and there are only a few case reports in the literature describing this in relation to any pathogen. we present a rare case of s. intermedius bacteremia and liver abscess following a dental cleaning. this case serves to further emphasize that even routine dental procedures can place a patient at risk of the development of bacteremia and liver abscesses. for this reason, the clinician must be sure to perform a detailed history and careful examination. timely diagnosis of pyogenic liver abscesses is  vital, as they are typically fatal if left untreated.

TI  == chromosomal islands of streptococcus pyogenes and related streptococci: molecular switches for survival and virulence.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes is a significant pathogen of humans, annually causing over 700,000,000 infections and 500,000 deaths. virulence in s. pyogenes is closely linked to mobile genetic elements like phages and chromosomal islands (ci). s. pyogenes phage-like chromosomal islands (spyci) confer a complex mutator phenotype on their host. spyci integrate into the 5' end of dna mismatch repair (mmr) gene mutl, which also disrupts downstream operon genes lmrp, ruva, and tag. during early logarithmic growth, spyci excise from the bacterial chromosome and replicate as episomes, relieving the mutator phenotype. as growth slows and the cells enter stationary phase, spyci reintegrate into the chromosome, again silencing the mmr operon. this system creates a unique growth-dependent and reversible mutator phenotype. additional ci using the identical attachment site in mutl have been identified in related species, including streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus parauberis, and streptococcus canis. these ci have small genomes, which range from 13 to 20 kb, conserved integrase and dna replication genes, and no identifiable genes encoding capsid proteins. spyci may  employ a helper phage for packaging and dissemination in a fashion similar to the staphylococcus aureus pathogenicity islands (sapi). outside of the core replication and integration genes, spyci and related ci show considerable diversity with the presence of many indels that may contribute to the host cell phenotype or fitness. spyci are a subset of a larger family of streptococcal ci who potentially regulate the expression of other host genes. the biological and phylogenetic analysis of streptococcal chromosomal islands provides important clues as to how these chromosomal islands help s. pyogenes and other streptococcal species persist in human populations in spite of antibiotic therapy and immune challenges.

TI  == competence for genetic transformation in streptococcus pneumoniae: mutations in sigmaa bypass the comw requirement.
AB  == competence for genetic transformation in the genus streptococcus depends on an alternative sigma factor, sigma(x), for coordinated synthesis of 23 proteins, which together establish the x state by permitting lysis of incompetent streptococci, uptake of dna fragments, and integration of strands of that dna into the resident genome. initiation of transient accumulation of high levels of  sigma(x) is coordinated between cells by transcription factors linked to peptide  pheromone signals. in streptococcus pneumoniae, elevated sigma(x) is insufficient for development of full competence without coexpression of a second competence-specific protein, comw. comw, shared by eight species in the streptococcus mitis and streptococcus anginosus groups, is regulated by the same  pheromone circuit that controls sigma(x), but its role in expression of the sigma(x) regulon is unknown. using the strong, but not absolute, dependence of transformation on comw as a selective tool, we collected 27 independent comw bypass mutations and mapped them to 10 single-base transitions, all within rpod,  encoding the primary sigma factor subunit of rna polymerase, sigma(a). eight mapped to sites in rpod region 4 that are implicated in interaction with the core beta subunit, indicating that comw may act to facilitate competition of the alternative sigma factor sigma(x) for access to core polymerase.

TI  == molecular analysis of streptococcus anginosus-derived saga peptides.
AB  == background: saga1 and saga2 molecules produced from beta-hemolytic streptococcus  anginosus subsp. anginosus are composed of a leader peptide and a propeptide, and their mature form has hemolytic activity as a well-known streptococcal peptide toxin, streptolysin. the function of these saga molecules is thought to be dependent on intra-molecular heterocycle formation. in this study, we examined the heterocycle-involved molecular features of saga1, saga2, and s. pyogenes saga (spysaga), focusing on their heterocycle formation. materials and methods: molecular models of saga1, saga2, and spysaga were constructed using a molecular  modeling technique. molecular dynamics and molecular mechanic analyses of the modeled saga molecules were performed to obtain their energy profiles. results: total energy of the modeled saga1, saga2, and spysaga decreased with heterocycle  formation, and the border between the leader peptide and propeptide was clearly observed after heterocycle formation. conclusion: the flexibility of saga molecules was changed by intramolecular heterocycle formation, and their function (e.g. hemolytic activity) seems to be regulated by structural transition with heterocycle formation.

TI  == parallel evolution of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis to pathogenic and mutualistic lifestyles.
AB  == the bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the leading causes of fatal infections affecting humans. intriguingly, phylogenetic analysis shows that the species constitutes one evolutionary lineage in a cluster of the otherwise commensal streptococcus mitis strains, with which humans live in harmony. in a comparative analysis of 35 genomes, including phylogenetic analyses of all predicted genes, we have shown that the pathogenic pneumococcus has evolved into  a master of genomic flexibility while lineages that evolved into the nonpathogenic s. mitis secured harmonious coexistence with their host by stabilizing an approximately 15%-reduced genome devoid of many virulence genes. our data further provide evidence that interspecies gene transfer between s. pneumoniae and s. mitis occurs in a unidirectional manner, i.e., from s. mitis to s. pneumoniae. import of genes from s. mitis and other mitis, anginosus, and salivarius group streptococci ensured allelic replacements and antigenic diversification and has been driving the evolution of the remarkable structural diversity of capsular polysaccharides of s. pneumoniae. our study explains how the unique structural diversity of the pneumococcal capsule emerged and conceivably will continue to increase and reveals a striking example of the fragile border between the commensal and pathogenic lifestyles. while genomic plasticity enabling quick adaptation to environmental stress is a necessity for the pathogenic streptococci, the commensal lifestyle benefits from stability. importance: one of the leading causes of fatal infections affecting humans, streptococcus pneumoniae, and the commensal streptococcus mitis are closely related obligate symbionts associated with hominids. faced with a shortage of accessible hosts, the two opposing lifestyles evolved in parallel. we have shown  that the nonpathogenic s. mitis secured harmonious coexistence with its host by stabilizing a reduced genome devoid of many virulence genes. meanwhile, the pathogenic pneumococcus evolved into a master of genomic flexibility and imports  genes from s. mitis and other related streptococci. this process ensured antigenic diversification and has been driving the evolution of the remarkable structural diversity of capsular polysaccharides of s. pneumoniae, which conceivably will continue to increase and present a challenge to disease prevention.

TI  == vang element insertions within a conserved chromosomal site conferring vancomycin resistance to streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus anginosus.
AB  == three vancomycin-resistant streptococcal strains carrying vang elements (two invasive streptococcus agalactiae isolates [gbs-ny and gbs-nm, both serotype ii and multilocus sequence type 22] and one streptococcus anginosus [sa]) were examined. the 45,585-bp elements found within sa and gbs-ny were nearly identical (together designated vang-1) and shared near-identity over an ~15-kb overlap with a previously described vang element from enterococcus faecalis. unexpectedly, vang-1 shared much less homology with the 49,321-bp vang-2 element from gbs-nm, with widely different levels (50% to 99%) of sequence identity shared among 44 related open reading frames. immediately adjacent to both vang-1 and vang-2 were  44,670-bp and 44,680-bp integrative conjugative element (ice)-like sequences, designated ice-r, that were nearly identical in the two group b streptococcal (gbs) strains. the dual vang and ice-r elements from both gbs strains were inserted at the same position, between bases 1328 and 1329, within the identical  rna methyltransferase (ruma) genes. a genbank search revealed that although most  gbs strains contained insertions within this specific site, only sequence type 22 (st22) gbs strains contained highly related ice-r derivatives. the vang-1 element in sa was also inserted within this position corresponding to its ruma homolog adjacent to an ice-r derivative. vang-1 insertions were previously reported within the same relative position in the e. faecalis ruma homolog. an ice-r sequence perfectly conserved with respect to its counterpart in gbs-ny was apparent within the same site of the ruma homolog of a streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis strain. additionally, homologous vang-like elements within the conserved ruma target site were evident in roseburia intestinalis. importance: these three streptococcal strains represent the first known vancomycin-resistant  strains of their species. the collective observations made from these strains reveal a specific hot spot for insertional elements that is conserved between streptococci and different gram-positive species. the two gbs strains potentially represent a gbs lineage that is predisposed to insertion of vang elements.

TI  == comparative genomics of the bacterial genus streptococcus illuminates evolutionary implications of species groups.
AB  == members of the genus streptococcus within the phylum firmicutes are among the most diverse and significant zoonotic pathogens. this genus has gone through considerable taxonomic revision due to increasing improvements of chemotaxonomic  approaches, dna hybridization and 16s rrna gene sequencing. it is proposed to place the majority of streptococci into "species groups". however, the evolutionary implications of species groups are not clear presently. we use comparative genomic approaches to yield a better understanding of the evolution of streptococcus through genome dynamics, population structure, phylogenies and virulence factor distribution of species groups. genome dynamics analyses indicate that the pan-genome size increases with the addition of newly sequenced  strains, while the core genome size decreases with sequential addition at the genus level and species group level. population structure analysis reveals two distinct lineages, one including pyogenic, bovis, mutans and salivarius groups, and the other including mitis, anginosus and unknown groups. phylogenetic dendrograms show that species within the same species group cluster together, and infer two main clades in accordance with population structure analysis. distribution of streptococcal virulence factors has no obvious patterns among the species groups; however, the evolution of some common virulence factors is congruous with the evolution of species groups, according to phylogenetic inference. we suggest that the proposed streptococcal species groups are reasonable from the viewpoints of comparative genomics; evolution of the genus is congruent with the individual evolutionary trajectories of different species groups.

TI  == colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  == objectives: biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. this in vitro study investigated the  colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola). methods: the grown biofilm consisted of fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, veillonella dispar, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, t. denticola, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". after 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation  (fish), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected s. oralis, but not other species. the "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. a  co-localisation trend was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola, as determined by fish. however, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially s. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both clsm and sem. conclusions: while the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. this antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == the potential role of lung microbiota in lung cancer attributed to household coal burning exposures.
AB  == bacteria influence site-specific disease etiology and the host's ability to metabolize xenobiotics, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs). lung cancer in xuanwei, china has been attributed to pah-rich household air pollution  from burning coal. this study seeks to explore the role of lung microbiota in lung cancer among never smoking xuanwei women and how coal burning may influence  these associations. dna from sputum and buccal samples of never smoking lung cancer cases (n = 8, in duplicate) and controls (n = 8, in duplicate) in two xuanwei villages was extracted using a multi-step enzymatic and physical lysis, followed by a standardized clean-up. v1-v2 regions of 16s rrna genes were pcr-amplified. purified amplicons were sequenced by 454 flx titanium pyrosequencing and high-quality sequences were evaluated for diversity and taxonomic membership. bacterial diversity among cases and controls was similar in buccal samples (p = 0.46), but significantly different in sputum samples (p = 0.038). in sputum, granulicatella (6.1 vs. 2.0%; p = 0.0016), abiotrophia (1.5 vs. 0.085%; p = 0.0036), and streptococcus (40.1 vs. 19.8%; p = 0.0142) were enriched in cases compared with controls. sputum samples had on average 488.25 species-level otus in the flora of cases who used smoky coal (pah-rich) compared  with 352.5 otus among cases who used smokeless coal (pah-poor; p = 0.047). these  differences were explained by the bacilli species (streptococcus infantis and streptococcus anginosus). our small study suggests that never smoking lung cancer cases have differing sputum microbiota than controls. further, bacteria found in  sputum may be influenced by environmental exposures associated with the type of coal burned in the home.

TI  == identification and characterization of a novel secreted glycosidase with multiple glycosidase activities in streptococcus intermedius.
AB  == streptococcus intermedius is a known human pathogen and belongs to the anginosus  group (s. anginosus, s. intermedius, and s. constellatus) of streptococci (ags).  we found a large open reading frame (6,708 bp) in the lac operon, and bioinformatic analysis suggested that this gene encodes a novel glycosidase that  can exhibit beta-d-galactosidase and n-acetyl-beta-d-hexosaminidase activities. we, therefore, named this protein "multisubstrate glycosidase a" (msga). to test  whether msga has these glycosidase activities, the msga gene was disrupted in s.  intermedius. the msga-deficient mutant no longer showed cell- and supernatant-associated beta-d-galactosidase, beta-d-fucosidase, n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase, and n-acetyl-beta-d-galactosaminidase activities, and all phenotypes were complemented in trans with a recombinant plasmid carrying msga. purified msga had all four of these glycosidase activities and exhibited the lowest km with 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminide and the highest kcat with 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked beta-d-galactopyranoside. in addition, the purified lacz domain of msga had beta-d-galactosidase and beta-d-fucosidase activities, and the gh20 domain exhibited both n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase and n-acetyl-beta-d-galactosaminidase activities. the beta-d-galactosidase and beta-d-fucosidase activities of msga are thermolabile, and the optimal temperature of the reaction was 40 degrees c, whereas almost all enzymatic activities disappeared at 49 degrees c. the optimal temperatures for the n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase and n-acetyl-beta-d-galactosaminidase activities  were 58 and 55 degrees c, respectively. the requirement of sialidase treatment to remove sialic acid residues of the glycan branch end for glycan degradation by msga on human alpha1-antitrypsin indicates that msga has exoglycosidase activities. msga and sialidase might have an important function in the production and utilization of monosaccharides from oligosaccharides, such as glycans for survival in a normal habitat and for pathogenicity of s. intermedius.

TI  == molecular pathogenicity of streptococcus anginosus.
AB  == streptococcus anginosus and the closely related species streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedius, are primarily commensals of the mucosa. the true pathogenic potential of this group has been under-recognized for a long time because of difficulties in correct species identification as well as  the commensal nature of these species. in recent years, streptococci of the s. anginosus group have been increasingly found as relevant microbial pathogens in abscesses and blood cultures and they play a pathogenic role in cystic fibrosis.  several international studies have shown a surprisingly high frequency of infections caused by the s. anginosus group. recent studies and a genome-wide comparative analysis suggested the presence of multiple putative virulence factors that are well-known from other streptococcal species. however, very little is known about the molecular basis of pathogenicity in these bacteria. this review summarizes our current knowledge of pathogenicity factors and their regulation in s. anginosus.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibilities, streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin gene profiles among clinical isolates of group c or g streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis & of group g s. anginosus group at a tertiary care centre.
AB  == background & objectives: group c and group g streptococci (together gcgs) are often regarded as commensal bacteria and their role in streptococcal disease burden is under-recognized. while reports of recovery of gcgs from normally sterile body sites are increasing, their resistance to macrolides, fluoroquinolone further warrants all invasive beta haemolytic streptococci to be  identified to the species level and accurately tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. this study was aimed to determine the prevalence, clinical profile, antimicrobial susceptibility and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin gene profile (spea, speb, spec, spef, smez, spei, spem, speg, speh and ssa) of gcgs obtained over a period of two years at a tertiary care centre from north india. methods: the clinical samples were processed as per standard microbiological techniques. beta-haemolytic streptococci (bhs) were characterized and grouped. antimicrobial susceptibility of gcgs was performed using disk diffusion method. all gcgs were characterized for the presence of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (spe) and spe genes were amplified by pcr method. results: gcgs (23 ggs, 2gcs) comprised 16 per cent of beta haemolytic streptococci (25/142 betahs, 16%) isolated over the study period. of the 25 gcgs, 22 (88%) were recovered from pus, two (8%) from respiratory tract, whereas one isolate was recovered from blood of  a fatal case of septicaemia. of the total 23 ggs isolates, 18 (78%) were identified as streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp equisimilis (sdse, large-colony phenotype), five (21%) were streptococcus anginosus group (sag, small-colony phenotype). the two gcs were identified as sdse. all gcgs isolates were susceptible to penicillin, vancomycin, and linezolid. tetracycline resistance was noted in 50 per cent of sdse isolates. the rates of macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance in sdse were low. twelve of the 20 sdse isolates were positive for one or more spe genes, with five of the sdse isolates simultaneously carrying spea+ speb+ smez+ spef or speb+ smez+spef, spei+spem+speg+speh or, spei+spe m+speh or spea+ speb+ spec+ smez+ spef. one notable finding was the presence of spe b in four of the five isolates of the streptococcus anginosus group. no isolate was positive for ssa. interpretation & conclusions: our study showed no association between gcgs isolates harbouring streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins and disease severity. this might be attributed to the small sample size of spe-positive isolates.

TI  == establishment of a convenient sandwich-elisa for direct quantification of glucosyltransferase-i: application for dual diagnosis of dental caries.
AB  == previously, we established a convenient enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) system targeting glucosyltransferase (gtf)-b derived from streptococcus mutans for diagnosing caries risk. however, it has been reported that s. sobrinus possesses high cariogenicity and is more frequently detected in highly caries-susceptible patients than s. mutans is. s. sobrinus can secrete gtf-i, an  important cariogenic factor for dental plaque formation, as well as s. mutans gtf-b. therefore, in this study, we developed another feasible elisa system targeting s. sobrinus gtf-i that would ensure caries risk determination by combined gtf-i and gtf-b levels. a readily measurable sandwich-elisa system was devised, which consisted of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against gtf-i. the developed sandwich-elisa system quantified the purified gtf-i with sensitivity and specificity, and a positive correlation was observed between the  amount of gtf-i extracted from clinical plaque samples and s. sobrinus levels. furthermore, high levels of gtf-i and gtf-b were detected using the sandwich-elisa system in caries-susceptible subjects. these results indicate that the sandwich-elisa system against gtf-i developed in this study is useful, and that the dual detection of the caries risk factors gtf-i and gtf-b is helpful for predicting caries risk.

TI  == bacterial profile of dentine caries and the impact of ph on bacterial population  diversity.
AB  == dental caries is caused by the release of organic acids from fermentative bacteria, which results in the dissolution of hydroxyapatite matrices of enamel and dentine. while low environmental ph is proposed to cause a shift in the consortium of oral bacteria, favouring the development of caries, the impact of this variable has been overlooked in microbial population studies. this study aimed to detail the zonal composition of the microbiota associated with carious dentine lesions with reference to ph. we used 454 sequencing of the 16s rrna gene (v3-v4 region) to compare microbial communities in layers ranging in ph from 4.5-7.8 from 25 teeth with advanced dentine caries. pyrosequencing of the amplicons yielded 449,762 sequences. nine phyla, 97 genera and 409 species were identified from the quality-filtered, de-noised and chimera-free sequences. among the microbiota associated with dentinal caries, the most abundant taxa included lactobacillus sp., prevotella sp., atopobium sp., olsenella sp. and actinomyces sp. we found a disparity between microbial communities localised at acidic versus neutral ph strata. acidic conditions were associated with low diversity microbial populations, with lactobacillus species including l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and  l. crispatus, being prominent. in comparison, the distinctive species of a more diverse flora associated with neutral ph regions of carious lesions included alloprevotella tanerrae, leptothrix sp., sphingomonas sp. and streptococcus anginosus. while certain bacteria were affected by the ph gradient, we also found that approximately 60% of the taxa associated with caries were present across the investigated ph range, representing a substantial core. we demonstrated that some bacterial species implicated in caries progression show selective clustering with respect to ph gradient, providing a basis for specific therapeutic strategies.

TI  == an unusual case of streptococcus anginosus group pyomyositis diagnosed using direct 16s ribosomal dna sequencing.
AB  == bacteria belonging to the streptococcus anginosus group (streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus anginosus) are capable  of causing serious pyogenic infections, with a tendency for abscess formation. the present article reports a case of s anginosus group pyomyositis in a 47-year-old man. the pathogen was recovered from one of two blood cultures obtained from the patient, but speciation was initially not performed because the organism was considered to be a contaminant (viridans streptococci group). the diagnosis was ultimately confirmed using 16s ribosomal dna sequencing of purulent fluid obtained from a muscle abscess aspirate. the present case serves to emphasize that finding even a single positive blood culture of an organism belonging to the s anginosus group should prompt careful evaluation of the patient for a pyogenic focus of infection. it also highlights the potential utility of 16s ribosomal dna amplification and sequencing in direct pathogen detection from aspirated fluid in cases of pyomyositis in which antimicrobial therapy was initiated before specimen collection.

TI  == the influence of a glucosyltransferase, encoded by gtfp, on biofilm formation by  streptococcus sanguinis in a dual-species model.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis is an early colonizer of tooth surfaces and forms biofilms with other species of microorganisms. in vitro, s. sanguinis produces water-soluble glucans from sucrose and releases them into the culture supernatant; however, the role played by these glucans in biofilm formation is unclear. the present study examined both the effect of glucans on biofilm formation by s. sanguinis and the proportion of this bacterial species within the biofilms. inactivation of the gtfp gene, annotated as glucosyltransferase in the  s. sanguinis genome database, caused a marked reduction in the amount of water-soluble glucans in the culture supernatant, but not in the amount of water-insoluble glucans expressed on the bacterial cell surface. scanning electron microscopy revealed that wild-type s. sanguinis, but not the gtfp-deficient mutant, produced large amounts of sticky material in the presence  of 1% (w/v) sucrose. in addition, biofilm production by wild-type bacteria was greater than that by the mutant strain. by contrast, co-culture of mutant bacteria with streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. oralis, s. gordonii, s. anginosus, or s. salivarius showed that inactivating the gtfp gene had little effect on the amount of biofilm produced. furthermore, inactivating the gtfp gene did not greatly alter the proportion of s. sanguinis in the biofilms formed by the co-cultures. thus, despite the role of s. sanguinis glucosyltransferase in formation of water-soluble glucans and biofilms in monoculture, the functional gene contributed little to biofilms in co-culture experiments.

TI  == effective oral health in infective endocarditis: efficacy of high-street mouthwashes against the viridans group streptococci.
AB  == aim: recent uk national institute for health and clinical excellence guidelines state that there is no longer a need for oral antibiotic prophylaxis in patients  undergoing dental procedures who are at risk of infective endocarditis (ie), and  advocate the importance of maintaining good oral health. as viridans group streptococci (vgs) are common etiological agents of ie and inhabitants of the mouth, the purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of common high-street mouthwashes against four classes of vgs organisms (salivarius, mitis, anginosus, and mutans groupings). methods: the survival of vgs, streptococcus gordonii (national collection of type cultures [nctc] 7865), streptococcus intermedius (nctc 11324), streptococcus mutans (nctc 10449), streptococcus oralis (nctc 11427), streptococcus pneumoniae (nctc 7465, nctc 7978, & american type culture collection 49619) and streptococcus salivarius (nctc 8618) was assessed in vitro following treatment of approximately 10(7) c.f.u. in planktonic state with four mouthwashes. results: no organisms were culturable following 1-min exposure, and were not recovered following non-selective enrichment following incubation in brain heart infusion broth supplemented with 0.8% (w/v) yeast extract. conclusions: these data indicate that such mouthwashes are able to completely kill vgs organisms tested in planktonic solution, where their use would promote good oral hygiene in patients at risk of ie.

TI  == a streptolysin s homologue is essential for beta-haemolytic streptococcus constellatus subsp. constellatus cytotoxicity.
AB  == streptococcus constellatus is a member of the anginosus group streptococci (ags)  and primarily inhabits the human oral cavity. s. constellatus is composed of three subspecies: s. constellatus subsp. constellatus (scc), s. constellatus subsp. pharyngis and the newly described subspecies s. constellatus subsp. viborgensis. although previous studies have established that scc contains beta-haemolytic strains, the factor(s) responsible for beta-haemolysis in beta-haemolytic scc (beta-scc) has yet to be clarified. recently, we discovered that a streptolysin s (sls) homologue is the beta-haemolytic factor of beta-haemolytic streptococcus anginosus subsp. anginosus (beta-saa), another member of the ags. furthermore, because previous studies have suggested that other ags species, except for streptococcus intermedius, do not possess a haemolysin(s) belonging to the family of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins, we hypothesized that, as with beta-saa, the sls homologue is the beta-haemolytic factor of beta-scc, and therefore aimed to investigate and characterize the haemolytic factor of beta-scc in the present study. pcr amplification revealed that all of the tested beta-scc strains were positive for the saga homologue of scc (saga(scc)). further investigations using beta-scc strain w277 were conducted to elucidate the relationship between saga(scc) and beta-haemolysis by constructing saga(scc) deletion mutants, which completely lost beta-haemolytic activity. this loss of beta-haemolytic activity was restored by trans-complementation of saga(scc). furthermore, a co-cultivation assay established that the cytotoxicity of beta-scc was clearly dependent on the presence of saga(scc). these results demonstrate that saga(scc) is the factor responsible for beta-scc beta-haemolysis and cytotoxicity.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in the community.
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated the upper respiratory tract of adult and paediatric patients within the community. vgs are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of  the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (ar). laboratory examination of the colonising vgs species  may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the ar reservoir in this population. freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis, s. constellatus, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius,  s. sanguinis and s. vestibularis. the most frequent vgs organisms isolated was s. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by s. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), s. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), s. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), s. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), s. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), s. australis (3/363; 0.8%), s. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), s. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and s. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). all patients examined carried at least one vgs organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of vgs species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different vgs species, respectively. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by  standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime,  with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. s. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all vgs species examined (s. vestibularis v s. salivarius p=0.011), followed by s. anginosis. s. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible vgs species examined. overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. however, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae. in conclusion, these data indicate that vgs colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible s. salivarius.

AB  == persistent mucosal inflammation, granulation tissue formation, hypersensitivity,  and multifactorial infection are newly described complications of retained drug-eluting stents from endoscopic sinus surgery for refractory rhinosinusitis.  in an important report published in allergy and rhinology, a 45-year-old male patient suffering from recalcitrant chronic rhinosinusitis underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery and was found, for the first time, to have steroid-eluting catheters that were inadvertently left in the ethmoid and frontal sinuses. the retained catheters had caused persistent mucosal inflammation and formation of granulation tissue denoting hypersensitivity reaction. these consequences had induced perpetuation of symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis. meticulous removal of the retained stents with the nitinol wings from inflamed tissues of the frontal, ethmoidal, and sphenoethmoidal recesses in which they were completely imbedded was successfully performed without polypoid regrowth. cultures of specimens taken from both left and right stents showed heavy growth of stenotrophomonas maltophilia and moderate growth of klebsiella oxytoca, coagulase negative staphylococcus, and beta-hemolytic streptococcus anginosus. fungal infection was not detected. the current knowledge and experience regarding stent hypersensitivity and infection in relation with the use of stents in sinus  cavities is reviewed.

TI  == radiography-based score indicative for the pathogenicity of bacteria in odontogenic infections.
AB  == objective: to develop a new radiography-based score to assess the potential of bacteria to cause odontogenic infections derived from the occurrence of bacteria  at small or large radiographical lesions. materials and methods: the patients analyzed were a sub-population from a large randomized clinical trial comparing moxifloxacin and clindamycin in the treatment of inflammatory infiltrates and odontogenic abscesses. routine radiographs were used to analyze the area of the periapical radiolucent lesions. lesions were stratified by their radiographically measured area as large (>9 mm(2)) or small (</=9 mm(2)). a risk ratio was calculated for each species from the frequency of their occurrence in large vs in small lesions. results: fifty-one patients, 19 with abscesses and 32 with infiltrates, were evaluated. overall, the radiographical lesion areas ranged from 0.4-46.2 mm(2) (median = 9 mm(2)). an increased risk (risk ratio >1) to occur at  large abscess lesions was observed for prevotella (p.) oralis, p. buccae, p. oris, p. intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus (strep.) anginosus group. an increased risk to occur at large infiltrate lesions was found for strep. salivarius, strep. parasanguis, strep. anginosus group, capnocytophaga spp., neisseria (n.) sicca, neisseria spp., staphylococcus (staph.) aureus, p. intermedia, p. buccae, prevotella spp. and p. melaninogenica. conclusions: the radiography-based score suggests that certain prevotella spp., f. nucleatum and strep. anginosus groups play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of odontogenic abscesses, and that various streptococci, neisseria spp., capnocytophaga spp., staph. aureus and prevotella spp. are involved in the pathogenesis of odontogenic infiltrates.

AB  == background: descending necrotizing mediastinitis (dnm) is a highly morbid infectious process. this uncommon disease process has carried historically a substantial burden of morbidity and mortality. in this study we hypothesized that application of a prospective modified management algorithm would decrease the morbidity and mortality from this highly destructive process. methods: we developed a systematic approach for managing dnm, focusing on serial debridement  guided by imaging, in conjunction with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and  modern principles of critical care. we reviewed all patients admitted with this disease process from 2007-2012. data collected included demographic information,  co-morbidities, laboratory data including culture results, operative details, imaging frequency and findings, complications, and survival. continuous variables were reported as median values and ranges. results: from 2007-2010, we treated eight patients with dnm. the median age of the patients was 33 y (range 28-63 y), and 63% were male. in accordance with our algorithm, the patients underwent serial imaging at regular intervals following operative debridement. the median number of imaging studies was 11 (range 4-19). the patients required a median of  five operative debridements (range 1-15). in five patients, drainage was necessary through a cervical exploration. a thoracic approach was required in six patients (two thoracoscopic, four via thoracotomy). additional procedures included thymectomy (n=2), anterior mediastinotomy, carotid sheath exploration and resections of the clavicle, first rib, manubrium, pectoralis major muscle, and sternocleidomastoid muscle. the most common etiologic agents were peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus anginosus. study patients received a median of six different antibiotics (range 2-10) for a total of 42 d (range 34-55 d). these patients were hospitalized for a median of 29 days (range 16-56 d), with 15 d (range 7-48 d) spent in the intensive care unit. remarkably, the rate of survival was 100% (median follow-up of 33 mo). the patients developed no major complications, required no re-admissions, and had no re-infections. conclusions:  we applied an algorithmic approach to the treatment of dnm, consisting of aggressive operative debridement and enhanced by equally aggressive imaging. our  patients had excellent outcomes despite the widely known lethality of dnm. an aggressive approach may decrease complications and improve survival in this devastating disease process. furthermore, our prospective experience with dnm suggests that this algorithm used in the present study should be the standard for managing patients with this challenging condition.

TI  == dental abscess: a microbiological review.
AB  == dental abscess is a frequently occurring infectious process known to the health practice. the fate of the infection depends on the virulence of the bacteria, host resistance factors, and regional anatomy. serious consequences arising from  the spread of a dental abscess lead to significant morbidity and mortality. acute dental abscess is polymicrobial, comprising of strict anaerobes, such as anaerobic cocci, prevotella, fusobacterium species, and facultative anaerobes, such as viridans group streptococci and the streptococcus anginosus group. numerous novel, uncultivable and fastidious organisms have been identified as potential pathogens with the use of non-culture techniques. the majority of localized dental abscesses respond to surgical treatment while the use of antimicrobials is limited to severe spreading infections. there is a need for good-quality clinical trials of sufficient size to identify the ideal treatment.  the microbiology of the acute dentoalveolar abscess and its treatment in the light of improved culture and diagnostic methods are reviewed.

TI  == phylogenetic relationship and virulence inference of streptococcus anginosus group: curated annotation and whole-genome comparative analysis support distinct  species designation.
AB  == background: the streptococcus anginosus group (sag) represents three closely related species of the viridans group streptococci recognized as commensal bacteria of the oral, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. the sag also cause  severe invasive infections, and are pathogens during cystic fibrosis (cf) pulmonary exacerbation. little genomic information or description of virulence mechanisms is currently available for sag. we conducted intra and inter species whole-genome comparative analyses with 59 publically available streptococcus genomes and seven in-house closed high quality finished sag genomes; s. constellatus (3), s. intermedius (2), and s. anginosus (2). for each sag species, we sequenced at least one numerically dominant strain from cf airways recovered during acute exacerbation and an invasive, non-lung isolate. we also evaluated microevolution that occurred within two isolates that were cultured from one individual one year apart. results: the sag genomes were most closely related to  s. gordonii and s. sanguinis, based on shared orthologs and harbor a similar number of proteins within each cog category as other streptococcus species. numerous characterized streptococcus virulence factor homologs were identified within the sag genomes including; adherence, invasion, spreading factors, lpxtg cell wall proteins, and two component histidine kinases known to be involved in virulence gene regulation. mobile elements, primarily integrative conjugative elements and bacteriophage, account for greater than 10% of the sag genomes. s. anginosus was the most variable species sequenced in this study, yielding both the smallest and the largest sag genomes containing multiple genomic rearrangements, insertions and deletions. in contrast, within the s. constellatus and s. intermedius species, there was extensive continuous synteny, with only slight differences in genome size between strains. within s. constellatus we were able to determine important snps and changes in vntr numbers that occurred over the course of one year. conclusions: the comparative genomic analysis of the sag  clarifies the phylogenetics of these bacteria and supports the distinct species classification. numerous potential virulence determinants were identified and provide a foundation for further studies into sag pathogenesis. furthermore, the  data may be used to enable the development of rapid diagnostic assays and therapeutics for these pathogens.

TI  == impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. the model included streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, actinomycesoris, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.  nucleatum, veillonella dispar, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. based on literature, we considered streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, and actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. we quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative pcr and further compared the structures using confocal  laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. the absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. the biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. however, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. in the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. moreover, besides a significant increase of p. intermedia and a decrease of p. gingivalis , p. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. a. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on p. intermedia and p. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of p. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence p. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.

TI  == oral status in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis: a prospective, case-control study.
AB  == objective: patients with ra suffer from a higher risk of periodontal attachment loss and increased oral inflammation. we hypothesize that there are pathogenetic  and immunological interactions between these diseases that go beyond impaired manual dexterity accompanying advanced ra. the primary objective of the present study was to determine whether a loss of alveolar bone can be detected in ra patients during the early course of the disease. methods: in this cross-sectional, epidemiological case-control study, 22 patients with early ra (era) were compared with 22 matched healthy controls. oral and periodontal status, clinical activity, and socio-demographic parameters were determined. oral microbiota were analysed using real-time quantitative pcr specific for leading oral pathogens. results: more advanced forms of periodontitis were found in era patients compared with controls. era patients had a greater number of missing teeth [era 5.7 (s.d. 5.0), controls 1.9 (s.d. 1.0), p = 0.002], deeper periodontal pockets [clinical attachment level: era 3.4 (s.d. 0.5 mm), controls 2.7 (s.d. 0.3 mm), p < 0.000], and greater bleeding on probing [era 18.6% (s.d. 9.0%), controls 10.5% (s.d. 5.1%), p = 0.001] despite comparable oral hygiene. tannerella forsythia (6.77-fold, p = 0.033) subgingivally and streptococcus anginosus (3.56-fold, p = 0.028) supragingivally were the characteristic pathogens in era. conclusion: increased loss of periodontal attachment and alveolar bone can be detected in patients with era, therefore we propose that the consulting rheumatologists inform the patients that they have a higher risk of periodontal disease. it would be beneficial if these patients were referred directly for intensive dental care.

TI  == differential potentiation of the virulence of the pseudomonas aeruginosa cystic fibrosis liverpool epidemic strain by oral commensal streptococci.
AB  == background: the pseudomonas aeruginosa liverpool epidemic strain (les) is an important cystic fibrosis (cf) pathogen and is associated with increased morbidity and a worsened prognosis, compared with other cf-associated strains. however, interactions of common les phenotypic variants with other members of the polymicrobial biofilms associated with chronic cf respiratory disease, such as oral commensal streptococci, have not been investigated. methods: biofilm population dynamics, virulence factor production, and pathogenicity in galleria mellonella larvae of common les phenotypes (ie, low production, intermediate production, and overproduction of pyocyanin) in the presence or absence of anginosus group streptococci (ags) were compared. results: ags populations isolated from biofilm cocultures were p. aeruginosa phenotypic variant dependent, with higher ags cell densities than those in monoculture frequently observed. coexistence of ags with a producer of low or intermediate levels of pyocyanin was found to result in enhancement of virulence factor production. in addition, the les formed pathogenic partnerships with ags in the g. mellonella infection model, with killing dependent on les phenotype and ags species. conclusions: the pathogenic potential of les phenotypic variants can be enhanced by the presence of oral commensal streptococci. as adaptive mutations leading to reduced virulence factor production are commonplace, the observations made are relevant in the general context of the biology of p. aeruginosa infection during cf.

TI  == microarray analysis of microbiota of gingival lesions in noma patients.
AB  == noma (cancrum oris) is a gangrenous disease of unknown etiology affecting the maxillo-facial region of young children in extremely limited resource countries.  in an attempt to better understand the microbiological events occurring during this disease, we used phylogenetic and low-density microarrays targeting the 16s  rrna gene to characterize the gingival flora of acute noma and acute necrotizing  gingivitis (ang) lesions, and compared them to healthy control subjects of the same geographical and social background. our observations raise doubts about fusobacterium necrophorum, a previously suspected causative agent of noma, as this species was not associated with noma lesions. various oral pathogens were more abundant in noma lesions, notably atopobium spp., prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus spp., streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus anginosus. on the other hand, pathogens associated with periodontal diseases such as aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp., porphyromonas spp. and fusobacteriales were more abundant in healthy controls. importantly, the overall loss of bacterial diversity observed in noma samples as well as its homology to that of ang microbiota supports the hypothesis that ang might be the  immediate step preceding noma.

TI  == phenotypic diversity of multicellular filamentation in oral streptococci.
AB  == filamentous multicellular bacteria are among the most ancient multicellular organisms. they inhabit a great variety of environments and are present in the human body, including the oral cavity. beside the selective advantages related to the larger size achieved through filamentation, the development of multicellular  bacteria can be also driven by simple ecological factors such as birth and death  rates at the cellular level. in order to extend earlier results obtained in aquatic species, we investigate the filamentation process of four different strains of oral streptococci, namely s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. oralis and s. anginosus. the results indicate differences in the capacities of different streptococcus species to form filaments, manifested in terms of length and the time-scale of filament elongation. the filamentation pattern of these oral streptococci resembles that of aquatic bacteria, whereby filaments reach a peak length during exponential growth and become short when the population reaches a steady state. hence, this study validates that multicellularity can be an emergent property of filamentous bacteria of different ecological niches, and that phenotypic differences in filamentation can occur within species of the same genus, in this case oral streptococci. moreover, given the role that specific oral streptococci can play in the etiology of oral diseases, these results can possibly open new perspectives in the study of the virulence properties of these  species.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == iatrogenic sinistral hypertension complicating screening colonoscopy.
AB  == colonoscopy is widely accepted as the gold-standard screening technique for detecting malignancies in the distal gastrointestinal tract in patients with symptoms suggestive of colon cancer. however, this procedure is not without risk, including colonic perforation. we report a patient who was managed conservatively after colonoscopy induced perforation. eighteen months after appearing to make a  full recovery, he presented with an upper gastrointestinal bleed. oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (ogd) revealed large gastric fundal varices and computed tomography (ct) revealed splenic vein thrombosis. the ensuing left-sided (sinistral) hypertension explains the development of the fundal varices in the presence of normal liver function. at surgery, a persistent abscess cavity was identified and cultures from this site grew streptococcus anginosus. curative splenectomy was performed and the patient made a full recovery. we advocate more  prompt operative intervention in selected cases of iatrogenic colonic perforation with primary repair to prevent late complications.

TI  == the predominant bacteria isolated from radicular cysts.
AB  == purpose: to detect predominant bacteria associated with radicular cysts and discuss in light of the literature. material and methods: clinical materials were obtained from 35 radicular cysts by aspiration. cultures were made from clinical  materials by modern laboratory techniques, they underwent microbiologic analysis. results: the following are microorganisms isolated from cultures: streptococcus milleri group (smg) (23.8%) [streptococcus constellatus (19.1%) and streptococcus anginosus (4.7%)], streptococcus sanguis (14.3%), streptococcus mitis (4.7%), streptococcus cremoris (4.7%), peptostreptococcus pevotii (4.7%), prevotella buccae (4.7%), prevotella intermedia (4.7%), actinomyces meyeri (4.7%), actinomyces viscosus (4.7%), propionibacterium propionicum (4.7%), bacteroides capillosus (4.7%), staphylococcus hominis (4.7%), rothia denticariosa (4.7%), gemella haemolysans (4.7%), and fusobacterium nucleatum (4.7%). conclusions: results of this study demonstrated that radicular cysts show a great variety of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial flora. it was observed that all isolated microorganisms were the types commonly found in oral flora. although no  specific microorganism was found, streptococcus spp. bacteria (47.5%) - especially smg (23.8%) - were predominantly found in the microorganisms isolated. furthermore, radicular cysts might be polymicrobial originated. although radicular cyst is an inflammatory cyst, some radicular cyst fluids might be sterile.

TI  == tunel analysis of dna fragmentation in mouse unfertilized oocytes: the effect of  microorganisms within human follicular fluid collected during ivf cycles.
AB  == recently we reported the presence of bacteria within follicular fluid. previous studies have reported that dna fragmentation in human spermatozoa after in vivo or in vitro incubation with bacteria results in early embryo demise and a reduced rate of ongoing pregnancy, but the effect of bacteria on oocytes is unknown. this study examined the dna within mouse oocytes after 12 hours' incubation within human follicular fluids (n=5), which were collected from women undergoing in vitro fertilization (ivf) treatment. each follicular fluid sample was cultured to detect the presence of bacteria. terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dutp nick-end labeling (tunel) was used to label dna fragmentation in ovulated, non-fertilized mouse oocytes following in vitro incubation in human follicular fluid. the bacteria streptococcus anginosus and peptoniphilus spp., lactobacillus gasseri (low-dose), l. gasseri (high-dose), enterococcus faecalis, or propionibacterium acnes were detected within the follicular fluids. the most severe dna fragmentation was observed in oocytes incubated in the follicular fluids containing p. acnes or l. gasseri (high-dose). no dna fragmentation was observed in the mouse oocytes incubated in the follicular fluid containing low-dose l. gasseri or e. faecalis. low human oocyte fertilization rates (<29%) were associated with extensive fragmentation in mouse oocytes (80-100%). bacteria colonizing human follicular fluid in vivo may cause dna fragmentation in mouse oocytes following 12h of in vitro incubation. follicular fluid bacteria may result in poor quality oocytes and/or embryos, leading to poor ivf outcomes.

TI  == rapid detection of gram-positive organisms by use of the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the bact/alert pediatric fan system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  == assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. we evaluated the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp) in two pediatric hospitals. positive bact/alert pediatric fan blood cultures with gram-positive organisms were tested using the bc-gp in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. to test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles  were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 cfu  per milliliter. a total of 249 gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%,  respectively. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis  with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. the  bc-gp correctly identified 14/15 cases of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus  faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae. it misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with streptococcus anginosus group as s. pneumoniae. the bc-gp detected a case of streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus agalactiae. bc-gp's rapid accurate detection of staphylococcus spp., e. faecium, and e. faecalis and its ability to  ascertain meca, vana, and vanb status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining  to optimal antibiotic use. false-positive s. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the bc-gp.

TI  == fournier's gangrene of the penis caused by streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies  equisimilis: case report and incidence study in a tertiary-care hospital.
AB  == background: fournier's gangrene is a rare necrotizing soft tissue infection of the scrotum and penis. we report, to our knowledge, the first case of fournier's  gangrene caused by streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (sdse), a strain of pyogenic beta-hemolytic streptococci that is increasingly being recognized as  an important human pathogen. case presentation: we describe a healthy 59 year-old caucasian male who presented to the emergency department with fournier's gangrene of the penis and scrotum, with extension to the anterior abdominal wall. he underwent urgent surgical debridement of his scrotum, penis, and anterior abdomen. swabs from the scrotum grew gram-positive cocci, which were initially identified as streptococcus anginosus group by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms). however, polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification and sequencing of the 16s rrna gene identified the isolate as streptococcus dysgalatiae subspecies equisimilis (sdse). the incidences of invasive s. anginosus group and sdse infections at the london health sciences centre, a tertiary-care institution in southwestern ontario, were determined between august 1, 2011 and august 31, 2012, revealing a slightly lower rate of sdse (3.2 cases per 100,000 population) than other studies. conclusions:  this case highlights a unique disease manifestation of the emerging human pathogen streptococcus dysgalatiae subspecies equisimilis that has not been previously reported. this case also underscores the limitations of maldi-tof ms in differentiating between closely-related streptococcal species which may have different pathogenic profiles.

TI  == duodenal-mucosal bacteria associated with celiac disease in children.
AB  == celiac disease (cd) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion  of cereal gluten proteins. this disorder is associated with imbalances in the gut microbiota composition that could be involved in the pathogenesis of cd. the aim  of this study was to characterize the composition and diversity of the cultivable duodenal mucosa-associated bacteria of cd patients and control children. duodenal biopsy specimens from patients with active disease on a gluten-containing diet (n = 32), patients with nonactive disease after adherence to a gluten-free diet (n = 17), and controls (n = 8) were homogenized and plated on plate count agar, wilkins-chalgren agar, brain heart agar, or yeast, casitone, and fatty acid agar. the isolates were identified by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. renyi diversity profiles showed the highest diversity values for active cd patients, followed by  nonactive cd patients and control individuals. members of the phylum proteobacteria were more abundant in patients with active cd than in the other child groups, while those of the phylum firmicutes were less abundant. members of the families enterobacteriaceae and staphylococcaceae, particularly the species klebsiella oxytoca, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus pasteuri, were more abundant in patients with active disease than in controls. in contrast, members of the family streptococcaceae were less abundant in patients with active cd than in controls. furthermore, isolates of the streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus mutans groups were more abundant in controls than in both cd patient groups, regardless of inflammatory status. the findings indicated that the disease is associated with the overgrowth of possible pathobionts that exclude symbionts or commensals that are characteristic of the healthy small intestinal microbiota.

TI  == lincosamide resistance mediated by lnu(c) (l phenotype) in a streptococcus anginosus clinical isolate.
AB  == objectives: unique resistance to lincosamides (l phenotype) due to the production of nucleotidyltransferases (lnu) is uncommon among gram-positive bacteria. the aim of the study was to characterize the l phenotype in a clinical isolate of the streptococcus milleri group. methods: the strain ucn93 was recovered from neonatal specimens and from the mother's vaginal swab. identification was confirmed by sequencing of the soda gene. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by the disc diffusion method, while mics were determined using the agar dilution method. screening for lnu(a), lnu(b), lnu(c) and lnu(d) genes was performed by pcr. genetic environment and support were determined by thermal  asymmetric interlaced pcr and pcr mapping. the transfer of lincomycin resistance  was also attempted by conjugation. results: ucn93 was unambiguously identified as streptococcus anginosus. it was susceptible to all tested antibiotics, except lincomycin (mic, 8 mg/l) and tetracycline (2 mg/l). the lnu(c) gene was found to  be responsible for the l phenotype. it was shown that lnu(c) was associated with  a gene coding for a transposase within a structure similar to the transposon mtnsag1, described once in streptococcus agalactiae. since mtnsag1 was found to be mobilized by tn916 and s. anginosus ucn93 harboured a tn916 transposon, several attempts at transfer were performed but they all failed. the lnu(c)-containing genetic element was inserted into a chromosomal intergenic sequence of s. anginosus. conclusions: since lnu(c) has been detected in only one s. agalactiae clinical isolate so far, this is its second description among clinically relevant streptococci.

TI  == effects of short-chain fatty acids on actinomyces naeslundii biofilm formation.
AB  == actinomyces naeslundii is an early colonizer and has important roles in the development of the oral biofilm. short-chain fatty acids (scfa) are secreted extracellularly as a product of metabolism by gram-negative anaerobes, e.g. porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum; and the scfa may affect biofilm development with interaction between a. naeslundii and gram-negative bacteria. our aim was to investigate the effects of scfa on biofilm formation by  a. naeslundii and to determine the mechanism. we used the biofilm formation assay in 96-well microtiter plates in tryptic soy broth without dextrose and with 0.25% sucrose using safranin stain of the biofilm monitoring 492 nm absorbance. to determine the mechanism by scfa, the production of chaperones and stress-response proteins (grpe and groel) in biofilm formation was examined using western blot fluorescence activity with grpe and groel antibodies. adding butyric acid (6.25 mm) 0, 6 and 10 h after beginning culture significantly increased biofilm formation by a. naeslundii, and upregulation was observed at 16 h. upregulation was also observed using appropriate concentrations of other scfa. in the upregulated biofilm, production of grpe and groel was higher where membrane-damaged or dead cells were also observed. the upregulated biofilm was significantly reduced by addition of anti-groel antibody. the data suggest biofilm formation by a. naeslundii was upregulated dependent on the production of stress proteins, and addition of scfa increased membrane-damaged or dead cells. production of groel may physically play an important role in biofilm development.

AB  == background and objective: there is a paucity of data in relation to the possible  emergence of triclosan (tcs)-resistant bacteria following long-term exposure to tcs toothpaste. therefore, this study investigated whether long-term continuous exposure to tcs in toothpaste selects for tcs-resistant bacteria within the oral  biofilm. material and methods: dental plaque samples were collected from 40 individuals during year 5 of a randomised controlled trial. participants had been randomly assigned to use tcs (3000 mug/ml tcs) (n = 18) or placebo toothpaste (n  = 22). diluted plaque samples were plated on to wilkins-chalgren agar plates containing 5% (v/v) laked sheep red blood cells and tcs (concentrations ranging from 25 to 150 mug/ml) and incubated at 37 degrees c under microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions for 2-10 d. selected bacterial isolates were identified by partial 16s rdna sequencing and tcs minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determined for each isolate. results: at 3000 mug/ml tcs no growth was observed under microaerophilic or anaerobic conditions in either group. the mics of tcs for all isolates ranged from 125 to 1000 mug/ml in both groups. species common to both groups had similar mics. veillonella parvula and campylobacter gracilis were the most frequent isolates from both groups, with similar mics in both groups. conclusion: the use of tcs-containing toothpaste did not appear to lead to an increase in mic of tcs of oral bacterial isolates.

AB  == background: peritonsillar abscesses (pta) are a common complication of tonsillitis. recent global epidemiological data regarding ptas have demonstrated  increasing antimicrobial resistance patterns. no similar studies have been conducted in canada and no canadian study has examined the post-discharge course  of treated patients. methods: a prospective observational study of the epidemiology, antibiotic resistance and post-discharge course of patients presenting with a peritonsillar abscess to the emergency department in london, ontario over one year. a follow-up telephone survey was conducted 2-3 weeks after abscess drainage. results: 60 patients were diagnosed with an abscess, giving an  incidence of 12/100,000. 46 patients were enrolled in the study; the average duration of symptoms prior to presentation was 6 days, with 51% treated with antibiotics prior to presentation. streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus anginosus were present in 56% of isolates and of those, 7/23 (32%) of specimens demonstrated resistance to clindamycin. eight patients were treated with clindamycin and had a culture that was resistant, yet only one had recurrence. telephone follow-up was possible for 38 patients: 51% of patients reported a return to solid food within 2 days, and 75% reported no pain by 5 days. resolution of trismus took a week or longer for 51%. interpretation: clindamycin  resistance was identified in a third of streptococcus isolates, which should be taken into account when prescribing antibiotics. routine culture appears unnecessary as patients recover quickly from outpatient drainage and empiric therapy, with less pain than expected, but trismus takes time to resolve.

TI  == validation of antibiotic efficacy on in vitro subgingival biofilms.
AB  == background: systemic antibiotics are often used as adjunctive treatment modalities for periodontal diseases. testing of antimicrobial efficacy can be relevant only if the bacteria are in the form of biofilms rather than the planktonic state, and at concentrations of physiologic relevance, i.e., reachable in the periodontal pocket. the aim of the present study is to test the antimicrobial efficacy of five common antibiotic schemes at physiologically relevant concentrations on a multispecies in vitro biofilm model. methods: a 10-species in vitro subgingival biofilm model was exposed to metronidazole (15 mug/ml), amoxicillin (15 mug/ml), metronidazole and amoxicillin in combination, doxycycline (2 mug/ml), and azithromycin (10 mug/ml) over 24 hours. species-specific bacterial numbers were determined by culture on selective agar media or by epifluorescence microscopy. results: metronidazole alone did not affect biofilm composition. total bacterial counts were significantly reduced by  doxycycline, azithromycin, and amoxicillin alone or in combination with metronidazole, albeit by less than 1 log. on the species-specific level, these regimens significantly reduced the numbers of streptococcus anginosus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as campylobacter rectus (except for amoxicillin alone). the strongest effects were displayed by the combination of amoxicillin and metronidazole. conclusion: antibiotics at concentrations detectable in gingival crevicular fluid do not dramatically reduce total bacterial loads in this in vitro biofilm model, but cause species-specific  reductions, which may disrupt the biofilm unity.

AB  == no literature is available on the prevalence and clinical aspects of beta-haemolytic group g streptococcus anginosus group in central taiwan. in this  study, we used 16s rrna gene sequencing and 16s-23s rdna intergenic spacer sequencing (where necessary) as the gold standard for molecular identification. twenty-seven s. anginosus group isolates were identified from 273 beta-haemolytic ggs isolates collected from patients in central taiwan between february 2007 and  august 2011. of the 27 isolates, 22 were s. anginosus and 5 were streptococcus constellatus. the 3 commercial methods, rapid id 32 strep, api 20 strep, and vitek 2 gp card, identified 77.8%, 40.7%, and 37.0% of s. anginosus group isolates, respectively, with acceptable %id or probability level. all the s. constellatus isolates possessed the lmb gene (encoding laminin-binding protein);  however, none of the s. anginosus isolates possessed this gene. all the 27 isolates were susceptible to penicillin. five s. anginosus group isolates (18.5%) were resistant to erythromycin. the resistance genes, ermb and mefa, were detected in 3 (2 s. anginosus and 1 s. constellatus) and 2 (2 s. anginosus) isolates, respectively. pulsed field gel electrophoresis showed that most s. anginosus group isolates were genetically diverse. this is the first study to evaluate 3 commercial methods for the identification of beta-haemolytic group g s. anginosus group species, and only the rapid id 32 strep system showed considerable ability. the clinical aspects, susceptibility pattern, and molecular epidemiology of beta-haemolytic group g s. anginosus group isolates from central  taiwan were also first presented.

TI  == identification of beta-haemolysin-encoding genes in streptococcus anginosus.
AB  == streptococcus anginosus is an emerging pathogen, but little is known about its virulence factors. to detect the genes responsible for beta-haemolysis we performed genomic mutagenesis of the beta-haemolytic s. anginosus type strain atcc 12395 using the vector pghost9:iss1. integration site analysis of 15 non-haemolytic mutants identified a gene cluster with high homology to the genes  of the streptolysin s (sls) encoding sag gene cluster of s. pyogenes. the gene cluster harbours 10 open reading frames displaying significant similarities to the s. pyogenes genes saga-sagi, with the identities on protein level ranging from 38 to 87%. complementation assays of s. anginosus sagb and sagd integration  mutants with the respective genes confirmed their importance for beta-haemolysin  production and suggest the presence of post-translational modifications in s. anginosus sls similar to sls of s. pyogenes. characterization of the s. anginosus haemolysin in comparison to the s. pyogenes sls showed that the haemolysin is surface bound, but in contrast to s. pyogenes neither fetal calf serum nor rna was able to stabilize the haemolysin of s. anginosus in culture supernatants. inhibition of beta-haemolysis by polyethylene glycol of different sizes was carried out, giving no evidence of a pore-forming haemolytic mechanism. analysis  of a whole genome shotgun sequence of streptococcus constellatus, a closely related streptococcal species that belongs to the s. anginosus group, revealed a  similar sag gene cluster. employing a genomic mutagenesis strategy we were able to determine an sls encoding gene cluster in s. anginosus and demonstrate its importance for beta-haemolysin production in s. anginosus.

AB  == a 52-year-old man with cervical spondylosis sustained a hyperextension injury to  the neck and subsequently developed central cord syndrome after 2 weeks. the diagnosis was confirmed clinically and on mri. during the admission he was febrile from streptococcus anginosus bacteraemia from a gum infection and was started on penicillin. this resulted in pseudomembranous colitis with abdominal distension and bloody diarrhoea but a lack of expected abdominal complaints. unfortunately his neurology deteriorated and a repeat mri showed a discitis at c5-c7 which required a 2-level discectomy, debridement and instrumented fusion. owing to his spinal cord injury, an abdominal perforation was initially missed owing to the lack of clinical features of an acute abdomen. he underwent a right  hemi-colectomy for ascending colon perforation and eventually made a good recovery and was discharged to a spinal rehabilitation unit. by one year follow-up he had returned to full neurological function.

TI  == streptococcus anginosus group and osteomyelitis: a single centre clinical experience.
AB  == purpose: the streptococcus anginosus group comprises three species of bacteria classified within the viridans streptococci. this group is known for abscess formation and endocarditis. while a variety of sites in the body claim anginosus  streptococci as an agent of infection, osteomyelitis is unusual. the objective of this study was to describe a series of patients with osteomyelitis due to s anginosus group pathogens in terms of demographics, comorbidities, presentation and outcomes. study design: we reviewed our database for cases of osteomyelitis caused by s anginosus organisms. data described included demographics, comorbidities, site of infection, route of infection (haematogenous versus contiguous), laboratory data and course. results: 11 patients with s anginosus group osteomyelitis were identified. all cases arose from a contiguous anatomical site, with the exception of one haematogenous case. five instances were related to foot osteomyelitis while three, two and one case, respectively, were related to mandibular, cranial and vertebral osteomyelitis. seventy-five per cent of patients had associated abscesses. the mean length of antibiotic treatment was 10.9 weeks. one patient failed therapy while four others relapsed. conclusions: osteomyelitis due to the s anginosus group is uncommonly reported. our case series illustrates the virulence of these organisms in the context of osteomyelitis and the importance of aggressive management.

TI  == early in vitro and in vivo development of high-level daptomycin resistance is common in mitis group streptococci after exposure to daptomycin.
AB  == the development of high-level daptomycin resistance (hldr; mic of >/= 256 mg/liter) after exposure to daptomycin has recently been reported in viridans group streptococcus (vgs) isolates. our study objectives were as follows: to know whether in vitro development of hldr after exposure to daptomycin was common among clinical isolates of vgs and streptococcus bovis; to determine whether hldr also developed during the administration of daptomycin to treat experimental endocarditis caused by the daptomycin-susceptible, penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis strain s. mitis 351; and to establish whether combination with gentamicin prevented the development of hldr in vitro and in vivo. in vitro  studies were performed with 114 vgs strains (mitis group, 92; anginosus group, 10; mutans group, 8; and salivarius group, 4) and 54 streptococcus bovis strains  isolated from 168 consecutive patients with infective endocarditis diagnosed between 1995 and 2010. hldr was only observed after 24 h of exposure to daptomycin in 27% of the mitis group, including 27% of s. mitis isolates, 47% of  s. oralis isolates, and 13% of s. sanguis isolates. in our experimental model, hldr was detected in 7/11 (63%) and 8/12 (67%) isolates recovered from vegetations after 48 h of daptomycin administered at 6 mg/kg of body weight/24 h  and 10 mg/kg/24 h, respectively. in vitro, time-kill experiments showed that daptomycin plus gentamicin was bactericidal against s. mitis 351 at tested concentrations of 0.5 and 1 times the mic and prevented the development of hldr.  in vivo, the addition of gentamicin at 1 mg/kg/8 h to both daptomycin arms prevented hldr in 21 out of 23 (91%) rabbits. daptomycin plus gentamicin was at least as effective as vancomycin plus gentamicin. in conclusion, hldr develops rapidly and frequently in vitro and in vivo among mitis group streptococci. combining daptomycin with gentamicin enhanced its activity and prevented the development of hldr in most cases.

TI  == two cases of bacterial suppurative thyroiditis caused by streptococcus anginosus.
AB  == acute suppurative thyroiditis (ast) is a rare clinical condition. streptococcus anginosus has a propensity of producing empyema in the head and neck. here, we reported two cases of ast caused by s. anginosus. a 44-year-old man presented with anterior neck tender swelling and odynophagia for 12 days. he had thyrotoxicosis. he was initially diagnosed as thyroid cancer due to the misleading computed tomography report. fine needle aspiration (fna) yielded pus and neutrophils. s. anginosus was isolated from pus. after aspiration of abscess  and treatment with sensitive antibiotics, he recovered uneventfully with 3 weeks  treatment. he was euthyroid 3 months later. the other case is a 40-year-old women complained of fever and left neck swelling for 20 days. magnetic resonance imaging showed left neck inflammatory changes. fna revealed pus and inflammatory  cells infiltration. she had moderately decreased level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh). blood cultures were positive for s. anginosus. after penicillin treatment, tsh level returned to normal range, and the nodule gradually resolved. she recovered uneventfully after 5 weeks treatment. s. anginosus has a previously unappreciated clinical niche in ast. once ast is clinically concerned, fna procedure should be performed as early as possible.

TI  == the significance of streptococcus anginosus group in intracranial complications of pediatric rhinosinusitis.
AB  == objective: to assess the significance of the streptococcus anginosus group in intracranial complications of pediatric patients with rhinosinusitis. design: retrospective cohort study. setting: tertiary pediatric hospital. patients: a 20-year review of medical records identified patients with intracranial complications resulting from rhinosinusitis. in the 50 cases identified, s anginosus was the most commonly implicated bacterial pathogen in 14 (28%). documented data included demographics, cultured bacteria, immune status, sinuses  involved, type of intracranial complication, otolaryngologic surgical and neurosurgical intervention, type and duration of antibiotics used, and resulting  neurologic deficits. complications and outcomes of cases of s anginosus group-associated rhinosinusitis were compared with those of other bacteria. main  outcome measures: the severity and outcomes of intracranial complications of pediatric rhinosinusitis due to s anginosus group bacteria compared with other bacteria. results: infection caused by the s anginosus group resulted in more severe intracranial complications (p = .001). in addition, patients with s anginosus group-associated infections were more likely to require neurosurgical intervention (p < .001) and develop long-term neurologic deficits (p = .02). intravenous antibiotics were administered for a longer duration (p < .001) for s  anginosus group-associated infections. conclusions: rhinosinusitis associated with the s anginosus group should be considered a more serious infection relative to those caused by other pathogens. streptococcus anginosus group bacteria are significantly more likely than other bacteria to cause more severe intracranial complications and neurologic deficits and to require neurosurgical intervention.  a low threshold for intervention should be used for infection caused by this pathogen.

TI  == [streptococcus intermedius: a rare cause of brain abscess in children].
AB  == streptococcus intermedius is a member of the streptococcus anginosus group, also  known as the streptococcus milleri group. although this is a commensal agent of the mouth and upper airways, it has been recognized as an important pathogen in the formation of abscesses. however, it has rarely been involved in the formation of brain abscess in children. we report 4 pediatric cases of brain abscess caused by s. intermedius. three boys and 1 girl, all aged over 2 years, were admitted for a febrile meningeal syndrome and seizures, caused by a s. intermedius brain abscess. diagnosis was obtained by brain imaging combined with culture of cerebrospinal fluid. the outcome was favorable after antibiotic therapy and abscess puncture. s. intermedius should be considered a potential pathogen involved in the development of brain abscess in children.

AB  == in this case report, we describe a unique long-term complication from undiagnosed mandibular osteomyelitis. a 53-year-old female who underwent a dental extraction  complicated by chronic postoperative odontogenic infection and cutaneous parotid  fistula formation 2 years earlier presented with acute mental status change, gradual unilateral facial nerve palsy (house-brackmann score v), and nontraumatic dislocation of the condylar head into the middle cranial fossa. the patient's chronic mandibular osteomyelitis led to glenoid fossa erosion, middle cranial fossa penetration, and temporal lobe abscess formation. a combined middle cranial fossa approach through a burr hole placed in the squamous temporal bone near the  zygomatic root and intraoral mandibular approach to ipsilateral condylar head was performed to complete partial mandibulectomy, including condylectomy. the patient was treated with 6 weeks of meropenem perioperatively. four months after the surgery, the patient had complete resolution of skull base osteomyelitis, parotid fistula, and neurologic deficits and full recovery of facial nerve function (house-brackmann score of i).

TI  == novel twin streptolysin s-like peptides encoded in the sag operon homologue of beta-hemolytic streptococcus anginosus.
AB  == streptococcus anginosus is a member of the anginosus group streptococci, which form part of the normal human oral flora. in contrast to the pyogenic group streptococci, our knowledge of the virulence factors of the anginosus group streptococci, including s. anginosus, is not sufficient to allow a clear understanding of the basis of their pathogenicity. generally, hemolysins are thought to be important virulence factors in streptococcal infections. in the present study, a sag operon homologue was shown to be responsible for beta-hemolysis in s. anginosus strains by random gene knockout. interestingly, contrary to pyogenic group streptococci, beta-hemolytic s. anginosus was shown to have two tandem saga homologues, encoding streptolysin s (sls)-like peptides, in  the sag operon homologue. gene deletion and complementation experiments revealed  that both genes were functional, and these sls-like peptides were essential for beta-hemolysis in beta-hemolytic s. anginosus. furthermore, the amino acid sequence of these sls-like peptides differed from that of the typical sls of s. pyogenes, especially in their propeptide domain, and an amino acid residue indicated to be important for the cytolytic activity of sls in s. pyogenes was deleted in both s. anginosus homologues. these data suggest that sls-like peptides encoded by two saga homologues in beta-hemolytic s. anginosus may be potential virulence factors with a different structure essential for hemolytic activity and/or the maturation process compared to the typical sls present in pyogenic group streptococci.

TI  == validation of a quantitative real-time pcr assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification  of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objective: subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. the aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming  unit (cfu) counts on selective agar plates. material and methods: the 10 species  included in the in vitro biofilm were streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinomyces oris, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qpcr, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (fish) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of cfus after growth on selective agar plates. results: all 10 species were successfully quantified using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers  of cfus after growth on selective agar. in early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between  methods. in late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, but not by cfu counts, maintained significant correlation. cfu counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. conclusion: quantitative pcr and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. however, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. this may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.

TI  == development of an ex vivo coculture system to model pulpal infection by streptococcus anginosus group bacteria.
AB  == introduction: streptococcus anginosus group (sag) bacteria are opportunistic pathogens and a major cause of pulpal infection and subsequent abscess formation. understanding of the processes involved in sag oral infections has been limited by the lack of an appropriate model system. methods: cocultures of sag bacteria and mammalian tooth slices were maintained using a combination of dulbecco modified eagle medium and brain-heart infusion broth at 60 rpm, 37 degrees c, 5%  co(2) for 4, 8, or 24 hours before histologic examination or staining with acridine orange/ethidium bromide. tooth slices were also incubated as described with sag bacteria stained with fluorescein diacetate. pulps were extirpated from  infected and sterile cultured tooth slices, messenger rna was extracted and converted to complementary dna, and polymerase chain reaction were performed for  genes encoding tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1beta, and interleukin-6. results: sag bacteria were able to adhere directly to the central region of the pulpal matrix in small foci that were associated with a localized matrix breakdown. acridine orange-ethidium bromide staining and cell counts indicated a  decrease in mammalian cell viability with increasing incubation times in the presence of sag bacteria. the increased expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 1beta was detected in infected tooth slices. conclusions: a novel ex vivo model system has been developed that allows coculture of sag bacteria with a 3-dimensional organotypic tooth slice. the model allows observation of bacterial growth patterns and subsequent responses from host tissues. therefore,  it may be of future use in testing the efficacy of both antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory treatments for use in endodontic therapy.

TI  == taxonomy of the anginosus group of the genus streptococcus and description of streptococcus anginosus subsp. whileyi subsp. nov. and streptococcus constellatus subsp. viborgensis subsp. nov.
AB  == the anginosus group of the genus streptococcus has been the subject of much taxonomic confusion, which has hampered the full appreciation of its clinical significance. the purpose of this study was to critically re-examine the taxonomy of the anginosus group, with special attention to beta-haemolytic, lancefield group c strains, using multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa) combined with 16s rrna gene sequence and phenotypic analyses. phylogenetic analysis of concatenated sequences of seven housekeeping genes previously used for examination of viridans streptococci distinguished seven distinct and coherent clusters in the anginosus  group. analyses of 16s rrna gene sequences and phenotypic characters supported the mlsa clustering and currently recognized taxa of the anginosus group. single  gene analyses showed considerable allele sharing between species, thereby invalidating identification based on single-locus sequencing. two novel clusters  of beta-haemolytic, lancefield group c strains within the streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus anginosus species and isolated from patients with  sore throat showed sufficient phylogenetic distances from other clusters to warrant status as novel subspecies. the novel cluster within s. anginosus was identified as the previously recognized dna homology cluster, dna group 2. the names s. anginosus subsp. whileyi subsp. nov. (type strain ccug 39159(t) = dsm 25818(t) = sk1267(t)) and s. constellatus subsp. viborgensis subsp. nov. (type strain sk1359(t) = ccug 62387(t) = dsm 25819(t)) are proposed.

TI  == role of bacteria in oral carcinogenesis.
AB  == oral cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in indian men and is the leading  cause of cancer deaths. it is considered as a multistep and multifactorial disease. besides accumulation of genetic mutations, numerous other carcinogens are involved. in this category, viral and chemical carcinogens are well studied and documented. however, in the oral cavity, the role of microbiota in carcinogenesis is not known. microbial populations on mouth mucosa differ between healthy and malignant sites, and certain oral bacterial species have been linked  with malignancies, but the evidence is still weak in this respect. nevertheless,  oral microorganisms inevitably up-regulate cytokines and other inflammatory mediators that affect the complex metabolic pathways, and may thus be involved in carcinogenesis. poor oral health associates statistically with prevalence of many types of cancer such as pancreatic and gastrointestinal cancer. this review presents possible carcinogenesis pathway involved in bacterial carcinogenesis, commonly implicated bacteria in oral carcinogenesis, and their role in cancer therapeutics as well.

AB  == streptococcus anginosus group is widely known for its ability to cause invasive pyogenic infections. there are very few reports of disseminated infections sustained by members of this streptococcal group. we report a case of a highly disseminated infection and analyse previous literature reports. disseminated pyogenic infection has been defined as an infection affecting two or more of the  following organs/systems: central nervous system, lung, liver and spleen. we performed a pubmed search using the terms: s. milleri, s. anginosus, brain abscess, pulmonary abscess, hepatic abscess, spleen abscess. we reviewed 12 case  reports including the one presented in this paper. underlying conditions such as  dental infections, malignancy, gastrointestinal and respiratory tract disease accounted for 42% of cases. no definite endocarditis was encountered, even though positive blood cultures were found in 67% of patients. concomitant brain-liver, brain-lung and brain-spleen involvement occurred in 50%, 42% and 8% of cases respectively. ninety-one percent (91%) of patients were treated with beta-lactams, and surgical procedures were performed in 67% of patients. infections caused by s. anginosus group members are satisfactorily treated with penicillin g and cephalosporins. it is very important to associate surgery to antimicrobial chemotherapy in order to achieve a full or nearly full clinical recovery.

TI  == uv-c-irradiation sublethal stress does not alter antibiotic susceptibility of the viridans group streptococci to beta-lactam, macrolide, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents.
AB  == aim: previous work has indicated that environmental stresses on bacteria might lead to an upregulation of stress response. led curing lights (315-400 nm) and other uv lights used in tooth whitening cosmetic procedures might act as stresses. we examined the effect of uv-c light, as a high-energy surrogate to the lower-energy uv-a light used in such instruments, to examine its effect on the antibiotic susceptibility of viridans group streptococci. methods: twelve species of viridans group streptococci were examined in this study: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus australis, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis. these organisms were exposed to varying degrees of sublethal uv-c radiation, and their minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility was determined by broth dilution assay against three classes of commonly-used antibiotics: beta-lactams (penicillin), macrolides (erythromycin), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). results: there was no significant difference between antibiotic susceptibility before uv-c exposure and following maximum sublethal stress, prior to cell death due to fatal uv-c exposure. conclusions: exposure to uv-c light will not result in altered antibiotic susceptibility patterns on viridans group streptococci. given that uv-c is more toxic and mutagenic than uv-a light, it is unlikely than uv-a light  would yield any difference in response to such exposure.

AB  == members of the streptococcus anginosus group (sags) are significant pathogens. however, their pathogenic mechanisms are incompletely understood. this study investigates the adherence of sags to the matrix proteoglycans decorin and biglycan of soft gingival and alveolar bone. recombinant chondroitin 4-sulphate(c4s)-conjugated decorin and biglycan were synthesised using mammalian  expression systems. c4s-conjugated decorin/biglycan and dermatan sulphate (ds) decorin/biglycan were isolated from ovine alveolar bone and gingival connective tissue, respectively. using surface plasmon resonance, adherence of the sags s. anginosus, streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedius to immobilised proteoglycan was assessed as a function of real-time biofilm formation. all isolates adhered to gingival proteoglycan, 59% percent of isolates adhered to alveolar proteoglycans, 70% to recombinant decorin and 76% to recombinant biglycan. higher adherence was generally noted for s. constellatus and s. intermedius isolates. no differences in adherence were noted between commensal and pathogenic strains to decorin or biglycan. ds demonstrated greater  adherence compared to c4s. removal of the glycosaminoglycan chains with chondroitinase abc resulted in no or minimal adherence for all isolates. these results suggest that sags bind to the extracellular matrix proteoglycans decorin  and biglycan, with interaction mediated by the conjugated glycosaminoglycan chain.

AB  == introduction: the genus streptococcus comprises a number of species characterized by a differential pathogenic potential. these bacteria can be considered as members of microbial physiological flora but they can also cause mild infections  or severe, life threatening conditions. the majority of infections of streptococcal etiology are caused by beta-hemolysing species. the predominant causative agent of bacterial pharyngitis is streptococcus pyogenes. this species  usually doesn't give rise to any identification difficulties due to the introduction the well determined diagnostic schemes. problems concerning laboratory identification can be, however, associated with other species of beta-hemolysing streptococci isolated from patients with pharyngitis. these streptococci can demonstrate features similar to those of s. pyogenes and share the group antygen a, such as some strains of streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. the determination of sensitivity to bacitracin, which is a feature typical of s. pyogenes, is the basic test useful for its preliminary identification. nevertheless, the identification of some strains by this test can give rise to incompatibility. the aim of the study  was characterisation of beta-hemolysing streptococci resistant to bacitracin isolated from patients with pharyngitis. the examined bacterial strains caused identification problems by the use of routine diagnostic methods. methods: the material included 14 streptococcal strains resistant to bacitracin which were isolated from adult patients suffering from pharyngitis. the bacteria were cultured on media dedicated for the species. the following routine diagnostic tests were used for the bacterial identification: sensitivity to bacitracin (0.04 u/disc), camp test, determination of the group antigens a, b, c, d, f and g (slidex strepto-kit), and determination of biochemical features by the api 20 strep test (biomerieux). the sensitivity of streptococcal isolates to antibiotics (penicillin, clindamycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, vancomycin, ofloxacin) and  trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, was determined by the disc diffusion method on the mueller-hinton agar with 5% sheep blood (the inoculum-0.5 mcfarland). results: among the 14 isolates resistant to bacitracin, 6 isolates of s. pyogenes, 6 isolates of s. constellatus, and 2 isolates of s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis were identified. all isolates were sensitive to penicillin and vancomycin. one isolate ofs. pyogenes demonstrated constitutive mlsb resistance mechanism. seven  isolates were resistant to tetracycline: s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (3 isolates), s. constellatus (3), and s. pyogenes (1). the number of isolates resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was as follows: s. pyogenes (6) and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (1), whereas four isolates were resistant to ofloxacin. conclusions: the bacitracin test cannot be used as the only test for the laboratory identification of s. pyogenes even if it is combined with the determination of the lancefield group antigen due to the existence of bacitracin  resistant s. pyogenes strains. therefore, it is necessary to perform biochemical  commercial tests in addition to routine phenotypic tests. isolation of beta-hemolysing streptococci other than s. pyogenes from patients with pharyngitis confirms their role in the etiology of this infection. taken into account the significance of determination of sensitivity to bacitracin for the preliminary identification of s. pyogenes, it is necessary to standardize this test, which will make obtaining of the comparability of results possible.

TI  == a feasible enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against glucosyltransferase-b from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == streptococcus mutans has been considered the principal etiological agent of dental caries in humans. s. mutans can secrete three kinds of glucosyltransferases (gtfs). one of these, gtf-b, which synthesizes water-insoluble glucans from sucrose, has been considered to be one of the most important factors of cariogenic dental plaque formation. therefore, determination of whether gtf-b is present in plaque and saliva samples may contribute to the evaluation of individual virulence potential (caries risk). the aim of this study was to develop a feasible enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) for the routine quantification of gtf-b in plaque-derived cultures and clinical samples,  and to apply this assay to an epidemiological study. to determine the presence of gtf-b in plaque samples, a sandwich-elisa was devised, consisting of mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against gtf-b and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. the developed elisa allowed for quantification of the amounts of purified gtf-b with satisfactory sensitivity and specificity; this method was not affected by other components such as plaque and  saliva. plaque samples from healthy volunteers were examined using this elisa method and microbial analysis to apply the assay to an epidemiological study. a correlation was observed between the amount of extracted gtf-b and s. mutans levels as determined by elisa and cultivated with mitis salivarius bacitracin agar plates derived from plaque samples, although there were some exceptions. in  this regard, this elisa system has the advantage of estimating both the individual numbers of s. mutans and the productivity of gtf-b, namely, the cariogenic potential of s. mutans simultaneously. these results indicate that this elisa method is a useful tool for the diagnosis of caries risk.

TI  == structural insights into catalysis by betac-s lyase from streptococcus anginosus.
AB  == hydrogen sulfide (h(2)s) is a causative agent of oral malodor and may play an important role in the pathogenicity of oral bacteria such as streptococcus anginosus. in this microorganism, h(2)s production is associated with betac-s lyase (lcd) encoded by lcd gene, which is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (plp)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the alpha,beta-elimination of sulfur-containing amino acids. when lcd acts on l-cysteine, h(2)s is produced along with pyruvate and ammonia. to understand the h(2)s-producing mechanism of lcd in detail, we determined the crystal structures of substrate-free lcd (internal aldimine form) and two reaction intermediate complexes (external aldimine and alpha-aminoacrylate forms). the formation of intermediates induced little changes in the overall structure of the enzyme and in the active site residues, with the exception of lys234, a plp-binding residue. structural and mutational analyses highlighted the importance of the active site residues tyr60, tyr119, and arg365. in particular, tyr119 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain oxygen atom of l-serine, a substrate analog, in the external aldimine form  suggesting its role in the recognition of the sulfur atom of the true substrate (l-cysteine). tyr119 also plays a role in fixing the plp cofactor at the proper position during catalysis through binding with its side chain. finally, we partly modified the catalytic mechanism known for cystalysin, a betac-s lyase from treponema denticola, and proposed an improved mechanism, which seems to be common to the betac-s lyases from oral bacteria.

TI  == ascending necrotizing fasciitis of the face following odontogenic infection.
AB  == necrotizing fasciitis (nf) of the face is a rare but extremely dangerous complication of dental infection associated with a nearly 30% mortality rate. this infection spreads rapidly along the superficial fascial planes of the head and neck and can lead to severe disfigurement. reports in the literature of cases of nf of the face caused by dental infection are few. we report such a case in a  36-year-old woman and review the current standards of diagnosis and management. the patient initially presented with pain and severe swelling in the left side of her face subsequent to a dental infection. the symptoms had progressed quickly and had not improved with administration of oral antibiotics in the outpatient setting. the patient had no palpable crepitus despite its classic association with nf. the infection also took a rare, ascending route of spread with involvement of the temporalis muscle. cultures taken during debridement grew streptococcus anginosus and bacteroides. biopsies of involved muscle showed histologic evidence of necrosis. through early surgical intervention including aggressive debridement, and the adjunctive use of appropriate antibiotics, the patient recovered with minimal loss of facial mass and no skin loss. although nf  of the face is rare, the surgeon must maintain a high index of suspicion with any patient presenting after a dental infection with rapid progression of swelling and a disproportionate amount of pain that is unresponsive to antibiotics.

TI  == prevalence of beta-hemolytic groups c and f streptococci in patients with acute pharyngitis.
AB  == background: the roles of group c and f streptococci in causing endemic pharyngitis are still controversial, although group c streptococci are implicated in the outbreaks of pharyngitis and associated disorders. aim: the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and the role of these groups of beta-hemolytic streptococci in acute pharyngitis with emphasis on the streptococcus anginosus group. the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of these  bacterial isolates and their ability to produce some virulence factors was also determined. materials and methods: throat swab specimens were collected from 177  patients suffering from acute pharyngitis who had been admitted to the hilla teaching hospital, hilla, iraq, during october 2009 to january 2010. the necessary biochemical tests were conducted and the organisms identified using standard procedures. susceptibility of isolates pathogens to several antibiotics  was examined using standard susceptibility testing. virulence factors of these isolates were also determined using standard methods. results: results revealed that a total of 67 isolates belonged to beta-hemolytic streptococci, of which 11(16.4%) isolates belonged to anginosus group streptococci, which possessed lancefield group c and f antigens. most of these bacterial isolates have the ability to produce more than one virulence factor such as capsule, hemolysin, cfa iii, and lipase enzyme. the bacterial isolates were highly resistant to ampicillin, cefotaxime, and cefepime while they exhibited moderate resistance to  tetracycline, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin. on the other hand, they showed a high sensitivity to vancomycin, ofloxacin, and clindamycin. conclusion: this study concluded that groups c and f streptococci were implicated as a cause of acute pharyngitis in 6.2% of the specimens among other groups of streptococci. most of these isolates have the ability to produce more than one virulence factor. there was a high rate of resistance among isolates for beta-lactam antibiotics; however, they were highly susceptible to vancomycin, ofloxacin, and  clindamycin.

TI  == superinfection of focal liver lesions after bile duct procedures.
AB  == objectives: pyogenic liver abscess is a rare condition in the general population. the source of infection is most often biliary, and more rarely gastrointestinal via the portal tract, or even hematogenic. other than in special contexts (scarring after radiofrequency ablation), focal liver lesions are not a usual risk factor for hepatic abscesses in patients with a history of bile duct procedures (sphincterotomy, biliary stenting, biliary enteric anastomosis). materials and method - results: we report four cases of focal liver lesions (two  patients with benign lesions of the biliary cyst type and two other patients with lesions due to pancreatic cancer) complicated by a superinfection in patients with a history of bile duct procedures. there were no predisposing factors other  than a context of cancer or diabetes. conclusion: superinfection of a focal liver lesion should be considered when there is a suggestive clinical picture and a change in the appearance of the lesion in patients with a history of bile duct procedures in a context of cancer or diabetes.

TI  == milleri group streptococcus--a stepchild in the viridans family.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to provide a comprehensive review of the pathogenic role and spectrum of disease of milleri group streptococci, with special attention to bloodstream invasion and to possible differential roles among the three species. all consecutive isolates of milleri group streptococci from any anatomic source, during a 37-month period, in a tertiary care teaching hospital in tel-aviv, israel, were thoroughly investigated. identification to the species level was performed by an automated system.streptococcus anginosus constituted 82% of the 245 patient-unique isolates from hospitalized patients. all nonurinary isolates were involved in pyogenic infections mostly originating from the gastrointestinal tract, with bacteremia in 28 cases. the 71 urinary isolates represented either urinary tract infection or nonsignificant bacteriuria. no specific association could be detected between species and the infection site, except for a higher relative representation of streptococcus constellatus in bacteremia. milleri group streptococci are common in clinical practice and play a different pathogenic role to other viridans streptococci. due to their invariable association with pyogenic processes, their presence in blood  warrants immediate focus identification. in addition, they have a previously unappreciated clinical niche concerning urinary tract infection. the identification of viridans streptococci to the species level is of paramount clinical significance.

TI  == microbiological analysis of a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial comparing moxifloxacin and clindamycin in the treatment of odontogenic infiltrates and abscesses.

TI  == superantigen profiles of emm and emm-like typeable and nontypeable pharyngeal streptococcal isolates of south india.
AB  == background: the major virulence factors determining the pathogenicity of streptococcal strains include m protein encoded by emm and emm-like (emml) genes  and superantigens. in this study, the distribution of emm, emml and superantigen  genes was analyzed among the streptococcal strains isolated from the patients of  acute pharyngitis. methods: the streptococcal strains were isolated from the throat swabs of 1040 patients of acute pharyngitis. the emm and emml genes were pcr amplified from each strain and sequenced to determine the emm types. the dot-blot hybridization was performed to confirm the pathogens as true emm nontypeable strains. the presence of eleven currently known superantigens was determined in all the strains by multiplex pcr. results: totally, 124 beta-hemolytic streptococcal strains were isolated and they were classified as group a streptococcus (gas) [15.3% (19/124)], group c streptococcus (gcs) [59.7%  (74/124)] and group g streptococcus (ggs) [25.0% (31/124)]. among 124 strains, only 35 strains were emm typeable and the remaining 89 strains were emm nontypeable. all gas isolates were typeable, whereas most of the gcs and ggs strains were nontypeable. these nontypeable strains belong to s. anginosus [75.3% (67/89)] and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis [24.7% (22/89)]. the emm and emml types identified in this study include emm12.0 (28.6%), stg643.0 (28.6%), stc46.0 (17.0%), emm30.11 (8.5%), emm3.0 (2.9%), emm48.0 (5.7%), st3343.0 (2.9%), emm107.0 (2.9%) and sts104.2 (2.9%). various superantigen profiles were observed  in typeable as well as nontypeable strains. conclusions: multiplex pcr analysis revealed the presence of superantigens in all the typeable strains irrespective of their emm types. however, the presence of superantigen genes in emm and emml nontypeable strains has not been previously reported. in this study, presence of  at least one or a combination of superantigen coding genes was identified in all  the emm and emml nontypeable strains. thus, the superantigens may inevitably play an important role in the pathogenesis of these nontypeable strains in the absence of the primary virulence factor, m protein.

TI  == effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation between oral streptococci and actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == background: the co-aggregation of oral bacteria leads to their clearance from the oral cavity. poor oral hygiene and high saliva viscosity are common amongst the elderly; thus, they frequently suffer from pneumonia caused by the aspiration of  oral microorganisms. objectives: to examine the direct effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces. materials and methods: fifteen oral streptococcal and a single actinomyces strain were used. co-aggregation was assessed by a visual assay in phosphate buffer and a spectrophotometric assay in the same buffer containing 0-60% glycerol or whole saliva. results: nine oral streptococci co-aggregated with actinomyces naeslundii atcc12104 in the visual assay and were subsequently used for the spectrophotometric analysis. all tested strains displayed a decrease in co-aggregation with increasing amounts of glycerol in the buffer. the co-aggregation of streptococcus oralis with a. naeslundii recovered to baseline level following the removal of glycerol. the per cent co-aggregation of s. oralis with a. naeslundii was significantly correlated with the viscosity in unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva samples (correlation coefficients: -0.52 and -0.48, respectively). conclusion: this study suggests that saliva viscosity affects the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces and that bacterial co-aggregation decreases with increasing saliva viscosity.

AB  == fluorescence labeling of bacterial pathogens has a broad range of interesting applications including the observation of living bacteria within host cells. we constructed a novel vector based on the e. coli streptococcal shuttle plasmid pat28 that can propagate in numerous bacterial species from different genera. the plasmid harbors a promoterless copy of the green fluorescent variant gene egfp under the control of the camp-factor gene (cfb) promoter of streptococcus agalactiae and was designated pbsu101. upon transfer of the plasmid into streptococci, the bacteria show a distinct and easily detectable fluorescence using a standard fluorescence microscope and quantification by facs-analysis demonstrated values that were 10-50 times increased over the respective controls. to assess the suitability of the construct for high efficiency fluorescence labeling in different gram-positive pathogens, numerous species were transformed. we successfully labeled streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus aureus strains utilizing the egfp reporter plasmid pbsu101. in all of these species the presence of the cfb promoter construct resulted in high-level egfp expression that could be further increased by growing the streptococcal and enterococcal cultures under high oxygen conditions through continuous aeration.

TI  == 64-year-old male with septic arthritis of the pubic symphysis.
AB  == septic arthritis of the pubic symphysis is a rare disease. typical clinical features include fever, pubic or groin pain, pain with hip motion, and painful or waddling gait. identified predisposing factors to develop an infection in pubic joint include female incontinence surgery or postpartum period; sports, especially soccer; pelvic malignancy; and intravenous drug abuse. the most often  identified microorganisms were staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa.  osteomyelitis complicates the majority of cases, and about half of the patients require surgical debridement along with a prolonged antibiotic treatment. we report a case of streptococcus anginosus septic arthritis of the pubic symphysis. the patient did not have any of the above risk factors.

TI  == congenital alterations of nemo glutamic acid 223 result in hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia and immunodeficiency with normal serum igg levels.
AB  == background: hypomorphic mutations in the nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab) essential modulator (nemo) gene result in a variable syndrome of somatic and immunologic abnormalities. clinically relevant genotype-phenotype associations are essential to understanding this complex disease. objective: to study 2 unrelated boys with novel nemo mutations altering codon 223 for similarity in phenotype in consideration of potential genotype-phenotype associations. methods: clinical and laboratory features, including cell counts, immunoglobulin quantity  and quality, natural killer cell cytotoxicity, and toll-like and tumor necrosis factor receptor signaling, were evaluated. because both mutations affected nemo codon 223 and were novel, consideration was given to new potential genotype-phenotype associations. results: both patients were diagnosed as having  hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia and had severe or recurrent infections. one had recurrent sinopulmonary infections and the other necrotizing soft tissue methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infection and streptococcus anginosus subdural empyema with bacteremia. nemo gene sequence demonstrated a 3-nucleotide  deletion (c.667_669delgag) in one patient and a substitution (667g>a) in the other. these findings predict either the deletion of nemo glutamic acid 223 or it being replaced with lysine, respectively. both patients had normal serum igg levels but poor specific antibodies. natural killer cell cytotoxicity and toll-like and tumor necrosis factor receptor signaling were also impaired. serious bacterial infection did not occur in both patients after immunoglobulin replacement therapy. conclusions: two different novel mutations affecting nemo glutamic acid 223 resulted in clinically relevant similar phenotypes, providing further evidence to support genotype-phenotype correlations in this disease. they suggest nemo residue 223 is required for ectodermal development and immunity and  is apparently dispensable for quantitative igg production but may be required for specific antibody production.

TI  == exploring internal features of 16s rrna gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == background: streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. the genus has been divided into different groups based on 16s rrna gene sequence similarity. the variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. the present study was taken up to explore 16s rrna gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification  and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus streptococcus. methods: 16s rrna gene sequences belonging to the isolates of s. dysgalactiae, s. equi, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, s. gallolyticus, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus and s. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. results: the framework based analysis was used to segregate streptococcus spp. previously  identified upto genus level. this segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. conclusions: the markers generated exploring 16s rrna gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus streptococcus.

TI  == experimental alveolitis in rats: microbiological, acute phase response and histometric characterization of delayed alveolar healing.
AB  == the pathogenesis of alveolitis is not well known and therefore experimental situations that mimic some features of this disease should be developed. objective: in this study, the evolution of the experimentally induced infection in rat sockets is characterized, which leads to clinical signs of suppurative alveolitis with remarkable wound healing disturbs. material and methods: non-infected (group i) and experimentally infected sockets in rattus novergicus (group ii) were histometrically evaluated regarding the kinetics of alveolar healing. in addition, the characterization of the present bacteria in inoculation material and the serum levels of c-reactive protein (crp) were performed. the detected species were capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium nucleatum ss nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, streptococcus anginosus, treponema socranskii and streptococcus sanguis. results: all experimentally infected rats developed suppurative alveolitis, showing higher levels of crp in comparison to those non-infected ones. furthermore, infected rats presented a significant delayed wound healing as measured by the histometric analysis (higher persistent  polymorphonuclear infiltrate and lower density of newly formed bone). conclusion: these findings indicate that rat sockets with experimentally induced infection produced higher levels of serum crp, showing the potential of disseminated infection and a disturb in the alveolar repair process in an interesting experimental model for alveolitis studies.

TI  == the role of bacteria in oral cancer.
AB  == despite the widening interest in the possible association between bacteria and different stages of cancer development, our knowledge in its relation to oral cancers remains inadequate. the aim of this review article is to derive a better  understanding on the role of various micro-organisms in the etiogenesis of oral cancers through all the available data on the pubmed. different bacteria have been proposed to induce carcinogenesis either through induction of chronic inflammation or by interference, either directly or indirectly, with eukaryotic cell cycle and signaling pathways, or by metabolism of potentially carcinogenic substances like acetaldehyde causing mutagenesis. studies have shown diversity of isolated bacterial taxa between the oral cancer tissue specimens and the control, with exiguobacterium oxidotolerans, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus and veillonella parvula being specific for tumorogenic tissues. most isolates are saccharolytic and acid tolerant. streptococcus anginosus, commonly linked with esophageal and pharyngeal cancers, is not of significance in oral cancers. similarly, significant salivary specificity is noted for three bacteria, namely, capnocytophaga gingivalis, p. melaninogenica, and streptococcus mitis in  oral cancer patients, making these species salivary markers for the early detection of oral cancers and thus improving the survival rate significantly. also, such high degree of bacterial specificity in oral cancers has also provoked the designing of new treatment options for cancer prevention by way of vaccine delivery. however, for the success of these steps, a deeper exploration into this subject with a greater understanding is warranted.

TI  == streptococcus anginosus l-cysteine desulfhydrase gene expression is associated with abscess formation in balb/c mice.
AB  == streptococcus anginosus, an anginosus group bacterium, is frequently isolated from odontogenic abscesses, and is the oral bacterium that is primarily responsible for producing hydrogen sulfide from l-cysteine through the action of  its l-cysteine desulfhydrase (betac-s lyase) enzyme. however, the relationship between its production of hydrogen sulfide and abscess formation has not been investigated. to elucidate the etiological role of hydrogen sulfide in abscess formation, we initially measured, using specific primers, expression of the lcd gene, which encodes betac-s lyase, in the pus of abscesses that formed in balb/c  mice following subcutaneous injection of s. anginosus into the dorsa. expression  of lcd was >15-fold higher when l-cysteine was present than when it was absent. a mouse virulence assay revealed that the mean diameter of abscesses caused by s. anginosus fw73 plus l-cysteine was greater than that of abscesses caused by s. anginosus fw73 in the absence of l-cysteine. these findings demonstrate that the  lcd gene of s. anginosus is upregulated in mouse abscesses and that hydrogen sulfide, the product of a reaction catalyzed by betac-s lyase, plays an etiological role in odontogenic abscess formation.

TI  == neurosurgical management of extraaxial central nervous system infections in children.
AB  == object: extraaxial infections of the cns, including subdural empyema and epidural abscess, are rare but potentially life-threatening conditions. symptoms are usually progressive, and early diagnosis is therefore important. early intervention with appropriate treatment offers the best opportunity for eradicating the infection and promoting maximal neurological recovery. methods: the medical records of children with extraaxial cns infection over the last 24 years at the hospital for sick children were analyzed. only those patients with radiological and/or operative confirmation of the diagnosis of subdural empyema or epidural abscess were included in the study. demographic and clinical data were collected to determine the outcomes after such infections and factors that predict for such outcomes. results: the authors identified 70 children who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. sinusitis was the most common etiology and was  seen in 38 patients. all of these patients were older than 7 years of age at diagnosis. subdural empyemas were diagnosed in 13 patients following bacterial meningitis, and they were found primarily in infants within the 1st year of life. other etiological factors included otogenic infection (4 cases), postneurosurgical infection (7 cases), and hematogenous spread of infection (7 cases including 6 cases of spinal epidural abscess). streptococcus anginosus and  staphylococcus aureus were the most common pathogens identified. sixty-four patients (91.4%) underwent at least 1 neurosurgical procedure. seizures and cerebral edema from cortical vein thrombosis were the most common complications.  conclusions: due to variable etiology, identification of the responsible microorganism through neurosurgical drainage followed by long-term intravenous antibiotics remains the mainstay in treating extraaxial cns infections. optimal outcome is achieved with early diagnosis and therapy.

TI  == a specific polymerase chain reaction test for the identification of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == using an approach based on the comparison of arbitrary primer polymerase chain reaction (pcr) genomic profiles from oral streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae strains, we identified a 434-bp genomic fragment apparently specific for s. pneumoniae. from the nucleotidic sequence of this common fragment, a pair  of primers was designed and tested on a set of strains comprising the major streptococcus species. one species, s. anginosus, gave an amplification product of the same length as s. pneumoniae. sequence comparison of the s. anginosus and  s. pneumoniae amplicons revealed several variations which were used to define a new set of primers giving a 181-bp s. pneumoniae-specific fragment. the amplified fragment contains the 5' terminal part of a gene encoding a putative sugar-specific permease and an intergenic sequence. the pcr test was evaluated on 257 strains of invasive s. pneumoniae corresponding to clinical isolates and on 153 non-pneumoniae oral streptococci strains; in addition, 3 s. pseudopneumoniae  strains were tested. with these primers, an amplification product was only obtained with the s. pneumoniae strains. moreover, the test was successfully evaluated on 10 atypical s. pneumoniae strains related to pneumococcal diseases.  in this study, we therefore established the capacity of a simple pcr test to discriminate s. pneumoniae from other streptococci (including s. pseudopneumoniae), thus allowing rapid and accurate diagnosis.

TI  == microbiology and antibiotic management of orbital cellulitis.
AB  == objectives: orbital infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus may be increasing. because staphylococcus aureus infections have important treatment implications, our objective was to review the microbiology and antibiotic management of children hospitalized with orbital cellulitis and abscesses. patients and methods: this study was a retrospective chart review of all patients admitted to a tertiary care children's hospital between 2004 and 2009 with orbital infections confirmed by a computed tomography scan. patients with preceding surgery or trauma, anatomic eye abnormalities, malignancy, immunodeficiency, or preseptal infections were excluded. results: there were 94 children with orbital infections. a true pathogen was recovered in 31% of patients. the most commonly identified bacteria was the streptococcus anginosus group (14 of 94 patients [15%]). staphylococcus aureus (1 patient with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) was identified in 9% of patients. combination antimicrobial agents were frequently used (62%), and vancomycin use increased from 14% to 57% during the study period. patients treated with a single antibiotic during hospitalization (n = 32), in contrast to combination therapy (n = 58), were more likely to be discharged on a single antibiotic (p < .001). twenty-five (27%) patients were discharged on combination antibiotics. thirteen (14%) patients were discharged on intravenous therapy. conclusions: the streptococcus anginosus group is an emerging pathogen in pediatric orbital infections. although methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was uncommon, patients frequently received vancomycin and combination antibiotics. a simplified antibiotic regimen may help limit the development of resistant organisms and facilitate transition to an oral agent.

TI  == phenotypic and molecular methods used for identification of oral streptococci and related microorganisms.
AB  == the oral cavity contains the greatest biodiversity, over 70 species being isolated from mouth mucosa, saliva, denture surfaces and/or dental-plaque. the oral streptococci, representing over 80% of the mouth micro flora, are able to synthesize glucosyl-transferases, enzymes involved in glucans production. glucans are involved in production of an extracellular slime layer promoting adhesion and formation of a dental plaque biofilm. the 43 isolates studied obtained from partially and/or totally edentulous, were identified by vitek system using gram-positive identification cards. species-specific regions within the genes coding for glucosyl-transferases (gtf genes) were targeted for pcr identification of isolates. sequencing of 16s rrna was used as gold standard for strain confirmation. vitek system identified a number of 11 strains as s. mitis/oralis,  12 strains as s. anginosus/gordonii, 12 strains as s. sanguinis/parasanguinis, 3  strains as s. salivarius, 3 strains as s. plurianimalium, 1 strain as s. cristatus and 1 strain as s. alactolyticus, respectively. the pcr system targeting gtf genes was able to identify s. oralis, s. salivarius and s. gordonii strains. sequence of 16s rrna discriminated among streptococci species and revealed 16 strains of leuconostoc mesenteroides. many studies are needed in order to select the most reliable phenotypic and genotypic methods in order to improve the identification algorithm for oral streptococci used by clinical laboratories. their accurate identification is mandatory for better understanding their role in human infections.

TI  == invasion of human aortic endothelial cells by oral viridans group streptococci and induction of inflammatory cytokine production.
AB  == oral viridans group streptococci are the major commensal bacteria of the supragingival oral biofilm and have been detected in human atheromatous plaque. atherosclerosis involves an ongoing inflammatory response, reportedly involving chronic infection caused by multiple pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the invasion of human aortic endothelial cells (haecs) by oral viridans group streptococci and the subsequent cytokine production by viable invaded haecs. the invasion of haecs by bacteria was examined using antibiotic protection assays and was visualized by confocal scanning laser microscopy. the inhibitory effects of catalase and cytochalasin d on the invasion of haecs were also examined. the production of cytokines by invaded or infected haecs was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and a real-time polymerase chain reaction method was used to evaluate the expression of cytokine messenger rna. the oral streptococci tested were capable of invading haecs. the number of invasive bacteria increased with the length of the co-culture period. after a certain co-culture period, some organisms were cytotoxic to the haecs. catalase and cytochalasin d inhibited the invasion of haecs by the organism. haecs invaded by streptococcus mutans xc, streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis), streptococcus gordonii atcc 10558 and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419 produced more cytokine(s) (interleukin-6, interleukin-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) than non-invaded haecs. the haecs invaded by s. mutans xc produced the largest amounts of cytokines, and the messenger rna expression of cytokines by invaded haecs increased markedly compared with that by non-invaded haecs. these results suggest that oral streptococci may participate in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

TI  == molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci in  viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == objectives: ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. however, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (cf) airways has not yet been examined. the aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (vgs), in terms of mics and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs). methods: the mics of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the qrdrs for 190 isolates of vgs, originating from the sputa of adult cf patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. vgs organisms included streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus australis and streptococcus mutans. ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and qrdrs within the gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. results: twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mics >/=8 mg/l) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (mics 4 mg/l). as a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive vgs organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-cf patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. five novel qrdr pcr assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the cf vgs population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential qrdr resistance mutations. double mutations  in gyra and parc/pare led to mics of 16 to >64 mg/l, while single mutations in parc or pare resulted in mics of 8-32 mg/l and 8 mg/l, respectively. the mean homologies of each species to streptococcus pneumoniae r6 were: gyra, 70.3%-95%;  gyrb, 69.6%-96.2%; parc, 76.1%-94.8%; and pare, 70.7%-94.7%. the close relatives  of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). conclusions: treatment of p. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with cf may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal vgs flora, where these organisms may potentially  act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the streptococcus milleri group.

TI  == sialidase of streptococcus intermedius: a putative virulence factor modifying sugar chains.
AB  == a sialidase gene of streptococcus intermedius was cloned. it was most similar to  nana, a major sialidase gene in streptococcus pneumoniae, and was expressed in escherichia coli. since the gene-knockout s. intermedius strain lost detectable sialidase activity, the gene might code, either solely or mainly, the glycosidase in the bacterial genome. polymerase chain reaction using the primers for the nana homologue in s. intermedius (described as nana below) showed that this sialidase  gene was commonly distributed within the isolates of s. intermedius, but not found in the strains of other species among the anginosus group. in biofilm formation assay under cultivation with mucin, the nana-deleted s. intermedius maintained the amount of biofilm for 72 hr, while that of the parent strain decreased during incubation from 24 to 72 hr. since sialidase activity in the parent strain increased during that time period, sialidase might contribute to the degradation of biofilm under sialic acid-rich conditions. when s. intermedius was added into the hepg2 hepatoma culture, the calculated disassociation constant (k(d)) of edta-releasable bacterial adhesion to the cells was higher in the nana-deleted strain than in the parent. furthermore, the rate constant, assuming  endocytosis of the bacterium mediated by asgp-r in hepg2 cells, seemed to be increased by sialidase pretreatment of the bacterial cells before addition to the cell culture. according to the results, modification of sugar chains by sialidase on the bacterial surface and in the surrounding environment might influence both  bacterial interaction and host-bacterial interaction in s. intermedius.

AB  == after incubation of saliva from 58 semi-bedridden elderly persons, the cultures were identified based on the 16s rrna gene base sequence to compare the identification by the conventional culture method. as a result, the 16s rrna gene base sequence of 198 strains identified by the culture method showed 98.5% or more homology in some of the human oral microbiome database, and the identification of bacterial species and genus was possible. when an organism identified by the 16s rrna gene sequencing method was compared with that by the culture method, the concordance rates were 54.5% at the genus level and 35.9% at  the species level. streptococcus mitis strains most frequently isolated from saliva that were identified by the culture method were identified as the same species by the 16s rrna gene sequencing method (32/35), and all the 11 streptococcus salivarius strains identified by the culture method were identified as the same species by the 16s rrna gene sequencing method. all the strains identified as streptococcus anginosus group by the culture method and 8 of the 9  strains identified as prevotella species by the culture method were identified as the same group and genus by the 16s rrna gene sequencing method. when an oral microbial flora test with saliva samples from elderly persons is performed, the 16s rrna gene sequence identification enables us to identify major indigenous bacteria and pathogenic bacteria and is considered useful as a means of supplementing the conventional culture method.

AB  == a 66-year-old woman with neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1) was brought to the emergency room with seizures and high-grade fever. seizure in adult nf1 patients  raises concern for intracranial lesions. however, neurological examination and central nervous system imaging failed to detect any causative intracranial lesions for her seizure. gram-positive cocci, streptococcus anginosus, were detected by blood cultures. abdominal computed tomography revealed a well-defined round mass 7 cm in diameter, which was found to be a small intestinal gastrointestinal stromal tumor (gist) containing an abscess. there was fistula formation between the intestinal lumen and the abscess, in which there were numerous gram-positive cocci. the seizure may have been caused by hypoosmolality  (hyponatremia and hypoproteinemia), which may result from decreased food intake associated with high-grade fever and general malaise. in this case gist originating from the small intestine was invaded by s. anginosus through a fistula, leading to abscess formation, bacteremia, high-grade fever, and seizure, which was the first clinical manifestation.

TI  == two cases of endogenous endophthalmitis caused by gram-positive bacteria with good visual outcome.
AB  == background: endogenous endophthalmitis is a rare disease and its visual prognosis is poor. case reports: we present two patients, a 60-year-old man and a 53-year-old man, who developed endogenous endophthalmitis caused by gram-positive organisms but recovered good vision after antibiotics and vitrectomy. results: the first patient complained of ocular pain and visual decrease in his right eye. ophthalmoscopy showed inflammation in the anterior chamber and vitreous opacities. antibiotic was administrated systemically, and blood culture detected  streptococcus anginosus. he underwent successful heart surgery for endocarditis and total dental extraction for severe gingivitis. vitrectomy was performed 36 days after the onset and vision improved from 0.02 to 0.7. the second patient was referred for acute visual decrease in his left eye. severe iritis and vitreous opacities were observed, and systemic examination showed acute pyelitis and prostatic abscesses. blood cultures detected staphylococcus sp., and systemic antibiotics were given. vitrectomy was performed 12 days after the onset, and vision improved from 0.06 to 1.2. conclusions: we conclude that the rapid treatment with systemic antibiotics for the organisms at the primary site, and the vitrectomy, even though delayed, can lead to a good recovery of vision.

TI  == [classical and new approaches in laboratory diagnosis of viridans streptococci].
AB  == viridans group streptococci (vgs) are gram-positive microorganisms that can form  alpha-hemolytic colonies on sheep blood agar. they reside as normal flora in oral cavity, respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital tract and on skin. they can cause bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis and septicemia following dental procedures. the diagnosis of vgs are difficult since the taxonomic classification and species na-mes may change due in time. viridans group streptococci are classified into 5 groups (sanguinis, mitis, mutans, salivarius, anginosus) according to biochemical reactions and 16s rrna sequencing. since streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the mitis group, the other important species in this group deserves investigation. genetic exchange between streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis and s.pneumoniae by transformation and lysis mechanisms occur continously as they share the same anatomical region. these mechanisms play role in exchanging capsular and antibiotic resistance genes between these species. the cultivation of vgs usually starts with the inoculation of various patient specimens into sheep blood agar and the detection of alpha-hemolytic colonies. observation of gram-positive cocci microscopically, the detection of optochin-resistant and bile insoluble colonies with few exceptions are the further important steps in laboratory diagnosis. vgs are then identified at species level by using biochemical reactions, automated diagnostic systems and molecular methods. the last step in the laboratory diagnosis of vgs is antibiotic susceptibility testing which is of outmost importance as penicillin and erythromycin resistance are on rise. in this review article, classification of vgs, similarities between s.pneumoniae and mitis group streptococci and the laboratory diagnosis of vgs have been discussed.

TI  == amplification of minute amounts of oral bacterial dna for real-time quantitative  pcr analysis.
AB  == background: high-throughput technologies for typing caries or health-associated bacterial populations including pcr, dna microarrays and next-generation sequencing techniques require significant amounts of bacterial dna. in clinical settings, the amount of sampled dna is often limited and amplification is therefore essential. protocols should be able to reproducibly amplify sequences in order to maintain initial sequence ratios and should not bias the representation of particular dna sequence types. methods: a linear amplification  protocol using dna polymerase i was modified to permit the amplification and subsequent analysis of small amounts of bacterial dna. the protocol was tested on human oral bacterial biofilms from different sources, including carious dentine and plaque, and compared to amplification by degenerate pcr of 16s rdna sequences. real-time quantitative pcr of 24 bacterial species was used as a readout system to test amplified dna against unamplified dna. results: the amplification protocol reliably yielded 5-10 mug dna from as little as 12.5 ng of template dna. correlation coefficients between real-time quantitative pcr results from amplified and unamplified dna were between 0.78 and 0.98. conclusion: the optimized protocol consistently produced amplification products from minute amounts of bacterial dna from caries and plaque; the amplification products are suitable for downstream genetic analyses.

TI  == it's not easy being green: the viridans group streptococci, with a focus on pediatric clinical manifestations.
AB  == the viridans group streptococci (vgs) are a heterogeneous group of organisms that can be human commensals, colonizing the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts in addition to the oral mucosa. vgs are generally considered to be of low pathogenic potential in immunocompetent individuals. however, in certain patient  populations, vgs can cause invasive disease, such as endocarditis, intra-abdominal infection, and shock. within the vgs, the rates and patterns of antimicrobial resistance vary greatly depending upon the species identification and the patient population. in general, streptococcus mitis group organisms are resistant to more antimicrobial agents than the other vgs species. this review addresses current vgs taxonomy, in addition to the current methodologies being used in clinical microbiology laboratories for identification of vgs. automated systems struggle overall with species level identification and susceptibility testing for vgs. matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identification is emerging as a potential alternative for organism identification. a review of recent pediatric-specific data regarding the clinical manifestations of vgs revealed that the streptococcus anginosus group (sag) organisms may be important pathogens in pediatric patients and that the vgs may contribute to disease in patients with cystic fibrosis. it also appears that rates of antimicrobial resistance in vgs in pediatric patients are surpassing those of the adult population.

AB  == natural transformation is found in most groups of oral streptococci, including the mitis, the anginosus, and the mutans groups. this ability has been applied as a powerful tool to explore streptococcal gene functions and regulatory pathways,  particularly in streptococcus mutans and streptococcus gordonii. the range of strains and species amenable to transformation has expanded in recent years with  the identification of several competence-stimulating peptide signals (csps). in this chapter we present protocols for natural transformation in strains found in  the three groups of transformable oral streptococci, with focus on methods using  synthetic csps. we also include suggestions on how to optimize competence conditions for individual species or strains.

TI  == multiple liver abscesses with isolation of streptococcus intermedius related to a pyogenic dental infection in an immuno-competent patient.
AB  == introduction: streptococcus intermedius - a member of the streptococcus anginosus group - is part of the normal microbial flora of the oral cavity. despite being regarded as a harmless apathogenic commensal, streptococcus intermedius has been  described to cause abscesses in various locations of the body. case presentation: we report the clinical case and course of treatment of a 18-year-old male patient presenting with multiple hepatic abscesses associated with an untreated pyogenic  dental infection. conclusion: streptococcus intermedius can cause liver abscesses emerging from dental infectious foci even in previously healthy patients without  underlying innate or aquired immunodeficiency. the case illustrates the potential danger and underestimated risk associated with untreated dental infections.

AB  == background: peri-implantitis is common in patients with dental implants. we performed a single-blinded longitudinal randomized study to assess the effects of mechanical debridement on the peri-implant microbiota in peri-implantitis lesions. materials and methods: an expanded checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay encompassing 79 different microorganisms was used to study bacterial counts before and during 6 months following mechanical treatment of peri-implantitis in  17 cases treated with curettes and 14 cases treated with an ultrasonic device. statistics included non-parametric tests and glm multivariate analysis with p<0001 indicating significance and 80% power. results: at selected implant test sites, the most prevalent bacteria were: fusobacterium nucleatum sp., staphylococci sp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, helicobacter pylori, and tannerella forsythia. 30 min. after treatment with curettes, a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a), lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, and veillonella parvula were found at lower counts (p<0.001). no such  differences were found for implants treated with the ultrasonic device. inconsistent changes occurred following the first week. no microbiological differences between baseline and 6-month samples were found for any species or between treatment study methods in peri-implantitis. conclusions: both methods failed to eliminate or reduce bacterial counts in peri-implantitis. no group differences were found in the ability to reduce the microbiota in peri-implantitis.

TI  == contribution of streptococcus anginosus to infections caused by groups c and g streptococci, southern india.
AB  == vellore, a region in southern india, has a high incidence of severe human infections with beta-hemolytic group c and g streptococci (gcgs). to determine the causative species in these infections, we conducted 16s rrna gene sequencing: streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (81%) and s. anginosus (19%) were the causative organisms in the 2-year study period (2006-2007). we used pcr to detect the virulence-related emm gene; results showed that it was restricted to s. dysgalactieae subsp. equisimilis isolates of 99.2% tested positive. due to a novel marker, s. anginosus and s. constellatus can be quickly and accurately distinguished from other members of the genus. the notable contribution of the anginosus group to human infections suggests that this group of obligate pathogens deserves more attention in healthcare and research.

TI  == development of real-time pcr assays for detection of the streptococcus milleri group from cystic fibrosis clinical specimens by targeting the cpn60 and 16s rrna genes.
AB  == cystic fibrosis (cf) is a multiorgan disease, with the majority of mortalities resulting from pulmonary failure due to repeated pulmonary exacerbations. recently, members of the streptococcus anginosus group (s. anginosus, s. constellatus, and s. intermedius), herein referred to as the "streptococcus milleri group" (smg) have been implicated as important etiological pathogens contributing to pulmonary exacerbations in cf patients. this is partly due to better microbiological detection of the smg species through the development of a  novel specific medium termed "mckay agar." mckay agar demonstrated that smg has been an underreported respiratory pathogen contributing to lung exacerbations. our aim was to develop a real-time pcr assay to expedite the detection of smg within diagnostic samples. the cpn60 gene was chosen as a target, with all three  members amplified using a single hybridization probe set. smg strain analysis showed that speciation based on melting curve analysis allowed for the majority of the s. constellatus (96%), s. intermedius (94%), and s. anginosus (60%) strains to be correctly identified. to increase specificity for s. anginosus, two 16s rrna real-time pcr assays were developed targeting the 16s rrna gene. the 16s_sa assay is specific for s. anginosus (100%), while the 16s_sci assay is specific for s. constellatus and s. intermedius (100%). these assays can detect <10 genome equivalents in pure culture and >10(4) genome equivalents in sputum samples, making this a great tool for assessment of the presence of smg in complex polymicrobial samples. novel molecular methods were developed providing detection ability for smg, an emerging opportunistic pathogen.

TI  == viridans streptococcal (streptococcus intermedius) mitral valve subacute bacterial endocarditis (sbe) in a patient with mitral valve prolapse after a dental procedure: the importance of antibiotic prophylaxis.
AB  == background: subacute bacterial endocarditis (sbe) is an infection of the heart involving damaged valves or endothelium. the most common organisms causing sbe are the viridans streptococci. viridans streptococci differ in their propensity to cause sbe, which is related to the ability to adhere to damaged heart valves and endothelium, which is a function of extracellular matrix production. streptococcus intermedius is a member of the s. anginosus group. s. intermedius is one of the many strains of viridans streptococci and a rare cause of sbe. sbe  may result following a high-grade, sustained veridans streptococcal bacteremia in patients with predisposing cardiac lesions. because viridans streptococci are relatively avirulent pathogens in normal hosts, they usually present as sbe. some strains of viridans streptococci are inherently more virulent (eg, s. intermedius) and clinically resemble s. lugdunensis or s. aureus. methods: we report a case of s. intermedius sbe in a patient with mitral valve prolapse (mvp). throughout the patient's life, she received antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures and never developed sbe. because of changes in endocarditis prophylaxis guidelines in 2007, recommending no prophylaxis for dental procedures in patients with mvp, she did not receive prophylaxis for a dental procedure 3 months before admission. the change in prophylaxis recommendations was based on the relatively low incidence of endocarditis with certain cardiac lesions. the recommendations were also based on concern for antibiotic resistance from widespread antibiotic use for antibiotic prophylaxis. there has been no appreciable increase in penicillin resistance, and antimicrobial resistance is not an important consideration among the viridans streptococci. the incidence of  sbe is not high after dental procedures in patients with mvp, but if sbe occurs,  it may result in serious consequence for the patient. results: in this case, the  patient developed s. intermedius, mitral valve sbe complicated by a cerebral vascular accident, and embolic occlusion of her leg. she was given optimal antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone 2 g (intravenously) every 24 hours plus gentamicin 120 mg (intravenously) every 24 hours (synergy dose) but failed to respond to antimicrobial therapy. although her s. intermedius bacteremia was rapidly cleared with antimicrobial therapy, sterilization of her vegetation was not accomplished, and during therapy, the size of her cardiac vegetation actually increased in size. because of therapeutic failure despite optimal antibiotic therapy, the increasing size of her vegetation necessitated mitral valve replacement, which the patient underwent. reasons for apparent/real antibiotic failure include inappropriate antimicrobial therapy, inadequately dosed antimicrobial therapy, antibiotic "tolerance," or increased pathogen virulence. her strain of s. intermedius was sensitive to all antibiotics and not due to a "tolerant strain", i.e., her minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) were the same (<0.25 microg/ml). conclusion: in  this case, despite optimal antimicrobial therapy, and in the absence of resistance/tolerance, therapeutic failure was best explained on the basis of s. intermedius virulence. the take-home lesson for clinicians is that it is better to err on the side of antibiotic prophylaxis even in patients with low-risk cardiac lesions. failure to administer antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures may result in sbe and have disastrous consequences for the patient, which, in this case, resulted in a cerebral vascular accident, embolic occlusion  of the leg, and mitral valve replacement. in terms of virulence in patients with  endocarditis, s. intermedius may resemble s. lugdenesis.

TI  == mckay agar enables routine quantification of the 'streptococcus milleri' group in cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  == the 'streptococcus milleri' group (smg) has recently been recognized as a contributor to bronchopulmonary disease in cystic fibrosis (cf). routine detection and quantification is limited by current cf microbiology protocols. mckay agar was developed previously for the semi-selective isolation of this group. here, mckay agar was validated against a panel of clinical smg isolates, which revealed improved smg recovery compared with columbia blood agar. the effectiveness of this medium was evaluated by appending it to the standard cf sputum microbiology protocols in a clinical laboratory for a 6-month period. all  unique colony types were isolated and identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing. whilst a wide variety of organisms were isolated, members of the smg were the most prevalent bacteria cultured, and mckay agar allowed routine quantification of the smg from 10(3) to >10(8) c.f.u. ml(-1) directly from sputum. all members of the smg were detected [streptococcus anginosus (40.7 %), streptococcus intermedius (34.3 %) and streptococcus constellatus (25 %)] with an overall prevalence rate of 40.6 % in our adult cf population. without exception, samples  where smg isolates were cultured at 10(7) c.f.u. ml(-1) or greater were associated with pulmonary exacerbations. this study demonstrates that mckay agar  can be used routinely to quantify the smg from complex clinical samples.

AB  == streptococci, enterococci and streptococcus-like bacteria are frequent etiologic  agents of infective endocarditis and correct species identification can be a laboratory challenge. viridans streptococci (vs) not seldomly cause contamination of blood cultures. vitek 2 and partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene were applied in order to compare the results of both methods. strains originated from  two groups of patients: 149 strains from patients with infective endocarditis and 181 strains assessed as blood culture contaminants. of the 330 strains, based on  partial 16s rrna gene sequencing results, 251 (76%) were vs strains, 10 (3%) were pyogenic streptococcal strains, 54 (16%) were e. faecalis strains and 15 (5%) strains belonged to a group of miscellaneous catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci. among vs strains, respectively, 220 (87,6%) and 31 (12,3%) obtained agreeing and non-agreeing identifications with the two methods with respect to allocation to the same vs group. non-agreeing species identification mostly occurred among strains in the contaminant group, while for endocarditis strains notably fewer disagreeing results were observed.only 67 of 150 strains in the mitis group strains obtained identical species identifications by the two methods. most vs strains belonging to the groups of salivarius, anginosus, and mutans obtained agreeing species identifications with the two methods, while this only was the case for 13 of the 21 bovis strains. pyogenic strains (n=10), enterococcus faecalis strains (n=54) and a miscellaneous group of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci (n=15) seemed well identified by both methods, except that disagreements in identifications in the miscellaneous group  of strains occurred for 6 of 15 strains.

TI  == characterization of streptococcus milleri group isolates from expectorated sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == with the recent insights into the streptococcus milleri group (smg) as pulmonary  pathogens in patients with cystic fibrosis (cf), we sought to characterize 128 isolates from the sputum of adults with cf, along with 45 isolates from patients  with invasive diseases for comparison. the tests performed included lancefield grouping; tests for hemolysis; tests for the production of hyaluronidase, chondroitin sulfatase, dnase, proteases, and hydrogen peroxide; and pcr for the detection of the intermedilysin gene (ily). we also generated biochemical profiles with the rapid id strep 32 api system and tested cell-free supernatants  for the presence of the signal molecule autoinducer-2 (ai-2) using a vibrio harveyi bioassay with a subset of cf strains. the s. intermedius isolates from both strain collections were similar, while the s. constellatus and s. anginosus  isolates yielded several biotypes that differed in prevalence between the two strain collections. beta-hemolytic, lancefield group c s. constellatus comprised  74.4% of the s. constellatus isolates from patients with cf but only 13.3% of the corresponding isolates from patients with invasive infections. this was the only  s. constellatus biotype associated with pulmonary exacerbations. hyaluronidase-positive s. anginosus was detected only among the isolates from patients with cf. strain-to-strain variability in ai-2 expression was evident, with the mean values being the highest for s. anginosus, followed by s. constellatus and then s. intermedius. cluster analysis and 16s rrna sequencing revealed that the species of smg could be accurately determined with a minimum of three phenotypic tests: tests for the lancefield group, hyaluronidase production, and chondroitin sulfatase production. furthermore, isolates from patients with invasive infections clustered with isolates from the sputum of patients with cf,  suggesting that the respiratory tract isolates were equally pathogenic.

AB  == background: hydrogen sulfide is one of the predominant volatile sulfur compounds  (vscs) produced by oral bacteria. this study developed and evaluated a system for detecting hydrogen sulfide production by oral bacteria. methods: l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase (metase) and beta carbon-sulfur (beta c-s) lyase were used to degrade homocysteine and cysteine, respectively, to produce hydrogen sulfide. enzymatic reactions resulting in hydrogen sulfide production were assayed by reaction with bismuth trichloride, which forms a black precipitate when mixed with hydrogen sulfide. the enzymatic activities of various oral bacteria that result in hydrogen sulfide production and the capacity of bacteria from periodontal sites to form hydrogen sulfide in reaction mixtures containing l-cysteine or dl-homocysteine were assayed. results: with l-cysteine as the substrate, streptococcus anginosus fw73 produced the most  hydrogen sulfide, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis american type culture collection (atcc) 33277 and w83 and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953 produced approximately 35% of the amount produced by the p. gingivalis strains. finally, the hydrogen sulfide found in subgingival plaque was analyzed. using bismuth trichloride, the hydrogen sulfide produced by oral bacteria was visually detectable as a black precipitate. conclusions: hydrogen sulfide production by oral bacteria was easily analyzed using bismuth trichloride. however, further innovation is required for practical use.

TI  == evolutionary relationships among salivarius streptococci as inferred from multilocus phylogenies based on 16s rrna-encoding, reca, seca, and secy gene sequences.
AB  == background: streptococci are divided into six phylogenetic groups, i.e, anginosus, bovis, mitis, mutans, pyogenic, and salivarius, with the salivarius group consisting of only three distinct species. two of these species, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis, are members of the normal human oral microflora whereas the third, streptococcus thermophilus, is found in bovine milk. given that s. salivarius and s. vestibularis share several  physiological characteristics, in addition to inhabiting the same ecosystem, one  would assume that they would be more closely related to each other than to s. thermophilus. however, the few phylogenetic trees published so far suggest that s. vestibularis is more closely related to s. thermophilus. to determine whether  this phylogenetic relationship is genuine, we performed phylogenetic inferences derived from seca and secy, the general secretion housekeeping genes, reca, a gene from a separate genetic locus that encodes a major component of the homologous recombinational apparatus, and 16s rrna-encoding gene sequences using  other streptococcal species as outgroups. results: the maximum likelihood (ml) and maximum parsimony (mp) phylogenetic inferences derived from the seca and reca gene sequences provided strong support for the s. vestibularis/s. thermophilus sister-relationship, whereas 16s rrna-encoding and secy-based analyses could not  discriminate between alternate topologies. phylogenetic analyses derived from the concatenation of these sequences unambiguously supported the close affiliation of s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus. conclusion: our results corroborated the sister-relationship between s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus and the concomitant early divergence of s. salivarius at the base of the salivarius lineage.

TI  == streptococcus constellatus bacteremia causing septic shock following tooth extraction: a case report.
AB  == introduction: organisms of the streptococcus milleri group consists of streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus anginosus. though they are commonly associated with abscesses, bacteremia with subsequent septic shock and mortality is infrequent. case presentation: we report a case of a 27-year-old chinese man who presented with streptococcus constellatus bacteremia following an incomplete tooth extraction resulting in septic shock. conclusion: bacteremia from the streptococcus milleri group is infrequent but must trigger the search for an underlying abscess. knowledge of each member's predilection for different clinical presentations can aid in determining the location of the underlying source of infection.

TI  == gene cloning and characterization of streptococcus intermedius fimbriae involved  in saliva-mediated aggregation.
AB  == streptococcus intermedius, an oral commensal and a cause of systemic pyogenic disease, expresses fimbriae. to identify the gene(s) encoding these fimbriae, we  used a serum raised against purified fimbriae to screen libaries of recombinant lambda phages. the cloned gene cluster encoding s. intermedius fimbriae, (saliva-mediated aggregation and adherence-associated fimbriae), contained 4 orfs, i.e. a putative ribonulease (saf1), a putative adhesin (saf2), the main pilus subunit (saf3) and a sortase c (srtc). escherichia coli strains harboring recombinant phages and plasmids carrying the saf3 gene produced a 55kda protein recognized by the antifimbriae serum. saf3 contains an n-terminal signal sequence and a c-terminal cell-wall-anchoring motif lpxtg. among strains of the streptococcus anginosus group, only serotype g and untypable strains were found to contain the saf3 gene, to possess the fimbrial antigen and to exhibit saliva-mediated aggregation. knockout mutants made by insertion of an erythromycin resistance gene into saf3 did not produce fimbrial structures or fimbrial antigens and did not participate in saliva-mediated aggregation. the adherent activity of mutants toward plastic wells coated with salivary agglutinin was about 65% that of the parental strain, and the reaction depended on calcium.  there was no significant difference in adherence to hydroxyapatite beads pretreated with salivary agglutinin between the parental and mutant strains. these results demonstrated that saf3 is associated with aggregation, and suggested that other molecule(s) are associated with adherence of s. intermedius.

TI  == crystallization and preliminary x-ray analysis of betac-s lyases from two oral streptococci.
AB  == hydrogen sulfide, which causes oral malodour, is generally produced from l-cysteine by the action of betac-s lyase from oral bacteria. the betac-s lyases  from two oral bacteria, streptococcus anginosus and s. gordonii, have been cloned, overproduced, purified and crystallized. x-ray diffraction data were collected from the two types of crystals using synchrotron radiation. the crystal of s. anginosus betac-s lyase belonged to the orthorhombic space group p2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 67.0, b = 111.1, c = 216.4 a, and the crystal of s. gordonii betac-s lyase belonged to the same space group, with unit-cell parameters a = 58.0, b = 73.9. c = 187.6 a. the structures of the betac-s lyases were solved by molecular-replacement techniques.

TI  == ai-2/luxs is involved in increased biofilm formation by streptococcus intermedius in the presence of antibiotics.
AB  == bacteria utilize quorum-sensing communication to organize their behavior by monitoring the concentration of bacterial signals, referred to as autoinducers (ais). the widespread detection of ai-2 signals and its enzymatic synthase (luxs) in bacteria suggests that ai-2 is an inter- and intraspecies communication signal. we have previously shown that antibiotic susceptibility is affected by ai-2 signaling in streptococcus anginosus. since chronic infections involve persistent biofilms resilient to antibiotic treatment, we explored the role of ai-2/luxs in streptococcus intermedius biofilm formation and cell viability when  the organism was exposed to sub-mics of ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, or tetracycline. the s. intermedius wild type (wt) and its isogenic luxs mutant, strain si006, were exposed to sub-mics of ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, or tetracycline. biofilms were formed on polystyrene discs in microtiter plates. to  assess planktonic cell viability, the atp microbial viability assay was performed and the numbers of cfu were determined. for complementation assays, the ai-2 precursor dihydroxy pentanedione (dpd) was used as a supplement for si006. relative luxs expression was quantified by real-time pcr. the sub-mics of all three antibiotics increased biofilm formation in s. intermedius wt. however, biofilm formation by si006 was either unaffected or reduced (p < or = 0.05). bacterial viability tests of biofilm and planktonic cell cultures indicated that  si006 was more susceptible to antibiotics than the wt. dpd complemented the luxs  mutant phenotype. real-time pcr revealed modest yet significant changes in luxs expression in the presence of antibiotic concentrations that increased biofilm formation. in conclusion, in s. intermedius, ai-2/luxs was involved in antibiotic susceptibility and increased biofilm formation at sub-mics of antibiotic.

TI  == molecular characterization of macrolide resistance determinants [erm(b) and mef(a)] in streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf).
AB  == objectives: although long-term use of azithromycin has shown a significant clinical improvement for patients with cystic fibrosis (cf), its long-term effect on the susceptibility of commensal flora within cf airways has not yet been examined. we therefore suggest that long-term use of azithromycin increases macrolide resistance in commensal streptococci. methods: erythromycin susceptibility in naturally colonizing viridans group streptococci (vgs) was characterized, as well as macrolide resistance gene determinants through sequence analysis, in pneumococci (n = 15) and vgs [n = 84; i.e. streptococcus salivarius  (n = 30), streptococcus mitis (n = 17), streptococcus sanguinis (n = 11), streptococcus oralis (n = 10), streptococcus parasanguinis (n = 6), streptococcus gordonii (n = 3), streptococcus infantis (n = 3), streptococcus cristatus (n = 2), streptococcus anginosus (n = 1) and streptococcus australis (n = 1)] isolated from sputum from 24 adult cf patients, who were on oral azithromycin therapy for  at least the previous 7 months. results: almost three-quarters of isolates (74; 74.7%) were resistant to erythromycin, whilst a further 15 (15.2%) had reduced susceptibility, leaving only 10 (10.1%) isolates susceptible to erythromycin. the majority (89.8%) were not susceptible to erythromycin, as demonstrated by possession of the erm(b) gene in 25/99 (25.3%), the mef(a) gene in 1/99 (1.0%), the mef(e) gene in 75/99 (75.8%) and both erm(b) and mef(e) genes simultaneously  in 11/99 (11.1%). these results indicate that genotypic resistance for macrolides is common in vgs in adult cf patients, with efflux being over three times more frequent. conclusions: long-term treatment with azithromycin in cf patients may reduce antibiotic susceptibility in commensal vgs, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of macrolide resistance determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens.

TI  == evaluation of genotypic and phenotypic methods for differentiation of the members of the anginosus group streptococci.
AB  == the terminology and classification of the anginosus group streptococci has been inconsistent. we tested the utility of 16s rrna gene and tuf gene sequencing and  conventional biochemical tests for the reliable differentiation of the anginosus  group streptococci. biochemical testing included rapid id 32 strep, api strep, fluo-card milleri, wee-tabs, and lancefield antigen typing. altogether, 61 anginosus group isolates from skin and soft tissue infections and four reference  strains were included. our results showed a good agreement between 16s rrna gene  and tuf gene sequencing. using the full sequence was less discriminatory than using the first part of the 16s rrna gene. the three species could not be separated with the api 20 strep test. streptococcus intermedius could be differentiated from the other two species by beta-galactosidase (onpg) and beta-n-acetyl-glucosaminidase reactions. rapid id 32 strep beta-glucosidase reaction was useful in separating s. anginosus strains from s. constellatus. in conclusion, both 16s rrna gene and tuf gene sequencing can be used for the reliable identification of the anginosus group streptococci. s. intermedius can be readily differentiated from the other two species by phenotypic tests; however, 16s rrna gene or tuf gene sequencing may be needed for separating some strains of s. constellatus from s. anginosus.

TI  == microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women.
AB  == background: the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina in male-to-female transsexuals is a recently created microbial niche which thus far has been characterized only to a very limited extent. yet the knowledge of this microflora can be considered as essential to the follow-up of transsexual women. the primary objective of this study was to map the neo-vaginal microflora in a group of 50 transsexual women for whom a neovagina was constructed by means of the inverted penile skin flap technique. secondary objectives were to describe possible correlations of this microflora with multiple patients' characteristics, such as  sexual orientation, the incidence of vaginal irritation and malodorous vaginal discharge. results: based on gram stain the majority of smears revealed a mixed microflora that had some similarity with bacterial vaginosis (bv) microflora and  that contained various amounts of cocci, polymorphous gram-negative and gram-positive rods, often with fusiform and comma-shaped rods, and sometimes even with spirochetes. candida cells were not seen in any of the smears. on average 8.6 species were cultured per woman. the species most often found were: staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus anginosus group spp., enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium sp., mobiluncus curtisii and bacteroides ureolyticus. lactobacilli were found in only one of 30 women. there was no correlation between dilatation habits, having coitus, rinsing habits and malodorous vaginal discharge on the one hand and the presence of a particular species on the other. there was  however a highly significant correlation between the presence of e. faecalis on the one hand and sexual orientation and coitus on the other (p = 0.003 and p = 0.027 respectively). respectively 82%, 58% and 30% of the samples showed an amplicon after amplification with m. curtisii, atopobium vaginae and gardnerella  vaginalis primer sets. conclusion: our study is the first to describe the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women. it reveals a  mixed microflora of aerobe and anaerobe species usually found either on the skin, in the intestinal microflora or in a bv microflora.

TI  == characterization of the complex bacterial communities colonizing biliary stents reveals a host-dependent diversity.
AB  == this study provides a comprehensive survey of the spatial and temporal bacterial  composition of biliary stent biofilms. the bacterial diversity, distribution and  dynamics of 59 biliary and 4 pancreatic stent communities from 40 patients being  treated at two different hospitals, which implant stents either simultaneously or consecutively, were characterized by single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis. fifty-one phylotypes belonging to 5 bacterial phyla and 24 bacterial families were detected across 63 stents. this is a much broader diversity than previously detected through culture-dependent methods, particularly in regard to the diversity of obligate anaerobes. stent bacterial diversity was patient-dependent and more similar when stents were implanted simultaneously rather than consecutively. stent bacterial community composition differed between hospitals specifically because of the difference in abundance of bifidobacteria. co-colonization of veillonella sp., streptococcus anginosus and organisms closely related to fusobacterium nucleatum revealed a potentially important attachment and survival strategy that has yet to be reported in biliary stents. this work reveals a more complete survey of the identities of bacterial species that form biofilms in biliary stents, their co-colonization patterns and  the natural variation in species composition between different patients, hospitals and locations along the stent. consideration of the community composition from individual patients will allow tailoring of prophylactic antibiotic treatments and thus will make the management of stent biofilms more effective.

AB  == background: beta-hemolytic streptococci of groups other than a and b (nabs) are increasingly recognized as causes of clinically significant disease, but precise  information about this heterogeneous group is lacking. we report the incidence of nabs infection and describe the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics. methods: active, population-based surveillance for invasive nabs was performed over a 2-year period in the 8-county metropolitan atlanta, georgia, area and the  3-county san francisco bay, california, area. clinical records were reviewed, and available isolates were sent to the centers for disease control and prevention (atlanta) for additional microbiologic characterization. incidences were calculated using year-appropriate us census bureau data. results: a total of 489  cases of invasive nabs infection were identified (3.2 cases per 100,000 population). the median age of patients was 55 years; 64% of patients were males, and 87% had underlying diseases. the incidence was higher among black persons than white persons (4.0 vs. 2.5 cases per 100,000 population; p < .01) and increased with age among all races. infections were community acquired in 416 cases (85%). among the 450 patients (94%) with nabs infection who were hospitalized, 55 (12%) died. of 266 isolates (54%) speciated at the centers for disease control and prevention, 212 (80%) were streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis; 46 (17%) were members of the streptococcus anginosus group. s. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis primarily presented as skin and soft-tissue infection in older patients, whereas individuals with invasive s. anginosus group infections were more likely to be younger patients with intra-abdominal infections. conclusions: nabs comprise multiple distinct species  that cause a significant number of community-acquired invasive infections. clinical manifestations differ by species. thus, speciation of invasive nabs may  be warranted in clinical settings.

TI  == the microbiology of the acute dental abscess.
AB  == the acute dental abscess is frequently underestimated in terms of its morbidity and mortality. the risk of potential serious consequences arising from the spread of a dental abscess is still relevant today with many hospital admissions for dental sepsis. the acute dental abscess is usually polymicrobial comprising facultative anaerobes, such as viridans group streptococci and the streptococcus  anginosus group, with predominantly strict anaerobes, such as anaerobic cocci, prevotella and fusobacterium species. the use of non-culture techniques has expanded our insight into the microbial diversity of the causative agents, identifying such organisms as treponema species and anaerobic gram-positive rods  such as bulleidia extructa, cryptobacterium curtum and mogibacterium timidum. despite some reports of increasing antimicrobial resistance in isolates from acute dental infection, the vast majority of localized dental abscesses respond to surgical treatment, with antimicrobials limited to spreading and severe infections. the microbiology and treatment of the acute localized abscess and severe spreading odontogenic infections are reviewed.

TI  == identification and molecular analysis of betac-s lyase producing hydrogen sulfide in streptococcus intermedius.
AB  == hydrogen sulfide (h(2)s) is a toxic gas that induces the modification and release of haemoglobin in erythrocytes; however, it also functions in methionine biosynthesis in bacteria. betac-s lyase, encoded by the lcd gene, is responsible  for bacterial h(2)s production through the cleavage of l-cysteine. in this study, 26 of 29 crude extracts from reference and clinical strains of streptococcus intermedius produced h(2)s from l-cysteine. the capacities in those strains were  not higher than those in strains of the other anginosus group of streptococci, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus constellatus, but were much greater than those in strains of streptococcus gordonii, which is known to have an extremely low capacity for h(2)s production. incubation of the remaining three extracts with l-cysteine did not result in h(2)s production. sequence analysis revealed that the lcd genes from these three strains (s. intermedius strains atcc 27335, imu151 and imu202) contained mutations or small deletions. h(2)s production in crude extracts prepared from s. intermedius atcc 27335 was restored by repairing the lcd gene sequence in genomic dna. the kinetic properties of the  purified recombinant protein encoded by the repaired lcd gene were comparable to  those of native proteins produced by h(2)s-producing strains, whereas the truncated protein produced by s. intermedius atcc 27335 had no enzymic activity with l-cysteine or l-cystathionine. however, real-time pcr analysis indicated that the lcd gene in strains atcc 27335, imu151 and imu202 is transcribed and regulated in a manner similar to that in the h(2)s-producing strain.

TI  == oral bacteria in biofilms exhibit slow reactivation from nutrient deprivation.
AB  == the ability of oral bacteria to enter a non-growing state is believed to be an important mechanism for survival in the starved micro-environments of the oral cavity. in this study, we examined the reactivation of nutrient-deprived cells of two oral bacteria in biofilms, streptococcus anginosus and lactobacillus salivarius. non-growing cells were generated by incubation in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer for 24 h and the results were compared to those of planktonic cultures. when both types of cells were shifted from a rich, peptone-yeast extract-glucose (pyg) medium to buffer for 24 h, dehydrogenase and esterase activity measured by the fluorescent dyes 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl-tetrazolium chloride (ctc) and fluorescein diacetate (fda), respectively, was absent in both  species. however, the membranes of the vast majority of nutrient-deprived cells remained intact as assessed by live/dead staining. metabolic reactivation of the  nutrient-deprived biofilm cells was not observed for at least 48 h following addition of fresh pyg medium, whereas the non-growing planktonic cultures of the  same two strains were in rapid growth in less than 2 h. at 72 h, the s. anginosus biofilm cells had recovered 78 % of the dehydrogenase activity and 61 % of the esterase activity and the biomass mm(-2) had increased by 30-35 %. with l. salivarius at 72 h, the biofilms had recovered 56 % and 75 % of dehydrogenase and esterase activity, respectively. reactivation of both species in biofilms was enhanced by removal of glucose from pyg, and s. anginosus cells were particularly responsive to yeast extract (ye) medium. the data suggest that the low reactivity of non-growing biofilm cells to the introduction of fresh nutrients may be a survival strategy employed by micro-organisms in the oral cavity.

TI  == [periodontitis and cardiovascular disease].
AB  == the prevalence of periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (cvd) is high. a mixed infectious biofilm etiology of periodontitis is known but not fully established in cvd. cofactors; smoking habits, stress, ethnicity, genetics, socioeconomics and age contribute to both diseases. the objectives of this report are to summarize factors in regards to cvd and periodontitis that are clinically relevant. the hypothesis behind a relationship between the two conditions can be  founded in (i) shared infections etiology, (ii) shared inflammatory response, (iii) epidemiological and case-control studies, and (iv) periodontal studies demonstrating improvements of cvd markers. streptococcus species in the s. mitis  group, and s. anginosus group have been identified in periodontitis and are known as pathogens in endocarditis possibly transported from the oral cavity to the heart through bacteremia during dental therapies, and tooth brushing. other periodontal bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and parvimonas micra are beta-lactamase producing and may contribute to antibiotic resistance (extended spectrum beta-lactamases). other bacteria in cvd  and periodontitis include staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. chlamydia pneumoniae and p. gingivalis lipopolyysaccharide capsels share homology and induce heat-shock protein activity and a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines. associations between periodontitis and cvd have been presented in many studies when controlling for confounders. other studies have demonstrated that periodontal therapies increase brachial artery flow rate and reduce serum inflammatory cytokine levels. thus, physicians caring for subjects at cvd risk should consult with dentists/periodontists. dentists must improve their medical knowledge and also learn to consult with physicians when treating patients at cvd risk.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without sinus tract.
AB  == aim: to examine the microbiological status of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without a sinus tract. methodology: samples were collected by means of a size 15 h-type file and two sterile paper points from 30 cases of primary endodontic infections with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) a sinus tract. the presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: the species found at the highest levels and prevalence were fusobacterium nucleatum sp. vincentii, porphyromonas gingivalis,  veillonella parvula, enterococcus faecalis, campylobacter gracilis and neisseria  mucosa. total bacterial counts were similar between teeth with (44 x 10(5)) and without (50 x 10(5)) a sinus tract (t-test: p > 0.05). e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus, capnocytophaga sputigena and capnocytophaga gingivalis had significantly higher counts in the absence of sinus tract (mann-whitney test, p < 0.05). higher levels of p. gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were observed in cases with a sinus tract. leptotrichia buccalis (or = 1.83; ci 95%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (or = 2.15; ci 95%) were associated with an increased chance of subjects having a sinus tract. conclusions: primary endodontic infections were associated with a large variety of bacterial species.  specific differences between the composition of the microbiota of primary root canal infections were observed in cases with or without a sinus tract.

AB  == objectives: to investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts  of abrus precatorius on some clinical isolates as resistance to available and affordable antibiotics by these pathogens is on the increase. method: in this study the antimicrobial effects of the extracts of abrus precatorius from leaves, stem and the seed oil were tested against staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, three clinical s. aureus isolates from different sources, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus anginosus (s.milleri), bacillus subtilis, corynebacterium spp (toxigenic strain of the mitis biotype), escherichia coli atcc 25922, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as candida albicans using the agar well diffusion technique. aqueous and methanolic extraction, using the soxhlet extractor was carried out on all plant parts used while petroleum ether was the solvent used to extract the seed oil. to measure the mic values, various concentrations of the stock, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4 microg/ml were assayed against the test bacteria. result: at the  different concentrations of the extracts used (512 microg/ml - 4 microg/ml), staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with an mic of 8 ug/ml for  the leaf extract. extract from the stem and seed oil were potent against some of  the gram-positive bacteria and candida albicans but not against s anginosus, e. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria tested. the ph of the extracts ranged between ph5 and ph8. this study demonstrates that abrus precatorius particularly the seed oil has a potent antimicrobial activity. conclusion: the results substantiate the ethno botanical use of different parts of abrus precatorius for the treatment of  various bacteria-related diseases. topical application of abrus precatorius extracts in ointments may be recommended especially for treating superficial infections caused by staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == molecular and enzymatic characterization of betac-s lyase in streptococcus constellatus.
AB  == background/aims: streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus constellatus are frequently isolated from dental abscesses and other suppurative lesions. we previously reported that betac-s lyase from a strain of s. anginosus produced significantly more hydrogen sulfide than betac-s lyases from other streptococci.  the purpose of this study was to establish the molecular and enzymatic features of the betac-s lyase in s. constellatus and to elucidate whether this unique capacity is common to many strains of s. constellatus and s. anginosus. methods:  the capacity of crude extract to produce hydrogen sulfide was evaluated among 16  strains of s. constellatus, s. anginosus, and streptococcus gordonii. the lcd gene encoding betac-s lyase was cloned from the genomic dna of each strain to compare the deduced amino acid sequences. the recombinant betac-s lyases of three representative strains were purified and characterized. results: incubation of crude extracts from all strains of s. constellatus and s. anginosus with l-cysteine resulted in the production of a large amount of hydrogen sulfide. the  primary sequence of betac-s lyase was very similar among strains of s. constellatus and s. anginosus. the kinetic properties of the betac-s lyases purified from s. constellatus resembled those for betac-s lyases purified from s. anginosus. in contrast, the betac-s lyases of s. constellatus and s. gordonii differed in terms of their hydrogen sulfide production, with the former producing much more. conclusion: a high level of hydrogen sulfide production, which appears to be a common feature in both s. constellatus and s. anginosus, may be associated with their abscess formation.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == prevalence of bacteraemia following third molar surgery.
AB  == objective: to investigate the prevalence and aetiology of bacteraemia following third molar extractions (b-tme), analysing the factors affecting its development. methods: the study group was formed of 100 patients undergoing third molar extractions under general anaesthesia. peripheral venous blood samples were collected at baseline, 30 s after a mandibular third molar extraction and 15 min  after completing the final extraction. samples were inoculated into bactec aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles and were processed in the bact/alert. subculture and further identification of the bacteria isolated was performed using conventional microbiological techniques. results: the prevalence of bacteraemia following third molar surgery was 62% at 30 s after the first dental  extraction and 67% at 15 min after finishing the final extraction. the bacteria most frequently identified in the positive blood cultures were streptococcus viridans (87.9%). conclusion: in our series, the prevalence of b-tme at 30 s after a single third molar extraction was high, principally being of streptococcal aetiology, and was independent of the oral health status and the magnitude of the surgical procedure. positive blood cultures persisted for at least 15 min after three to four dental extractions in a higher number of patients, questioning the supposedly transient nature of bacteraemia following dental extractions.

TI  == effect of photo-activated disinfection on endodontic pathogens ex vivo.
AB  == aim: to test the hypothesis that photo-activated disinfection (pad) has a bactericidal effect on pathogens inoculated in root canals, with emphasis on biofilm formation/destruction. methodology: root canals of extracted teeth (n = 38) were prepared (size 30, 0.10 taper), autoclaved, divided into three groups and two negative controls inoculated (streptococcus anginosus, enterococcus faecalis or fusobacterium nucleatum) and treated (pad, laser, dye or positive control) according to a cross-sectional design. resultant colony-forming unit counts were associated with observations of cell structural changes using environmental scanning electron microscopy (esem) on inoculated dentinal surfaces (n = 22, two controls) before (1, 2 and 6 days of incubation) and after treatment with pad. results: treatment of root canals with pad (15 j) caused a significant  reduction of the bacterial load, resulting in a 93.8% kill of s. anginosus (p < 0.0001), a 88.4% kill of e. faecalis (p < 0.05) and a 98.5% kill of f. nucleatum  (p < 0.0001), but no sterilization. laser alone had no significant effect on the  load nor did the dye without laser. the esem experiment showed that individual cells or monolayers were easily eliminated with pad. but when biofilms were present (2 and 6 days for e. faecalis, 6 days for s. anginosus), bacterial eradication was substantially reduced in deep layers. conclusions: photo-activated disinfection is not an alternative but a possible supplement to the existing protocols for root canal disinfection as the interaction between light (diode laser) and associated dye (tbo) provides a broad-spectrum effect. some endodontic pathogens that grow as single-species biofilms, however, are difficult to eradicate.

TI  == [phenotypes and genetic mechanisms of resistance to macrolides and lincosamides in viridans group streptococci].
AB  == viridans group streptococci (vgs) are part of the oropharyngeal, intestinal and genital flora, but they may cause endocarditis and bacteremia in susceptible patients. penicillin- and macrolide-resistant strains are increasing every year.  the aim of this study was to investigate genetic mechanisms of resistance to macrolides in clinically relevant isolates. we identified 85 isolates from january 2004 to june 2006. susceptibility to penicillin, cefotaxime, erythromycin, clindamycin and gentamycin was determined. a resistance phenotype was assigned according to the disk approximation test (erythromycin-clindamycin). the mechanism of resistance was determined by pcr for the following genes: ermb,  erma, ermc, erma (tr) and mefa/e. we identified 51 isolates belonging to streptococcus anginosus species, most of which were obtained from abdominal abscesses, and 34 isolates belonging to other species, most of which were obtained from blood cultures. the macrolide resistance rate was 28.2% (24/85). the mls(b) phenotype was observed in 66.7% of the isolates, primarily in the s. anginosus group. the m phenotype was predominant in s. mitis and s. oralis. isolates that expressed the constitutive mls(b) phenotype carried the ermb gene,  and those that expressed the inducible mlsb phenotype carried the erma gene. isolates that expressed the m phenotype carried the mefa/e gene. there was coresistance with penicillin in 20.8% (5/24) of the isolates. coresistance with penicillin was low. these results suggest that screening for macrolide resistance in vgs would be desirable because of the potential transmission of resistance genes to other pathogenic streptococci.

AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to examine the diversity of bacterial  species in the infected root canals of teeth associated with endodontic abscesses by cloning and sequencing techniques in concert with denaturing high-performance  liquid chromatography. methods: samples collected from five infected root canals  were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with universal 16s ribosomal dna primers. products of these pcrs were cloned and sequenced. denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) was used as a screening method to  reduce the number of clones necessary for dna sequencing. results: all samples were positive for the presence of bacteria and a range of 7-13 different bacteria were found per root canal sample. in total, 48 different oral clones were detected among the five root canal samples. olsenella profusa was the only species present in all samples. porphyromonas gingivalis, dialister pneumosintes, dialister invisus, lachnospiraceae oral clone, staphylococcus aureus, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, peptostreptococcus micros and enterococcus faecalis were found in two of the five samples. the majority of the taxa were present in only one sample, for example tannerella forsythia, shuttleworthia satelles and filifactor alocis. some facultative anaerobes that are frequently isolated from endodontic infections such as e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus  and lactobacillus spp. were also found in this study. conclusion: clonal analysis of the microflora associated with endodontic infections revealed a wide diversity of oral species.

TI  == synthetic bromated furanone inhibits autoinducer-2-mediated communication and biofilm formation in oral streptococci.
AB  == introduction: autoinducer-2 (ai-2) is a widespread communication-signal molecule  that allows bacteria to sense and react to environmental factors. in some streptococci ai-2 is reported to be involved in virulence expression and biofilm  formation. it has earlier been shown that the alga delisea pulchra produces bromated furanones, which prevent bacterial colonization of the algae. methods and results: we have previously published a novel and simple synthesis of (z)-5-bromomethylene-2(5h)-furanone. in this study we showed that our synthesized furanone inhibited biofilm formation and bioluminescence induction by streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, and streptococcus mutans, as  well as bioluminescence induction by vibrio harveyi bb152. conclusion: we suggest that the effect is linked to interference with the ai-2 signaling pathway because adding furanone to the medium had no effect on the ability of the ai-2-defective  s. anginosus luxs and s. intermedius luxs mutants to form biofilms.

AB  == we described seven patients with streptococcus milleri group aortic (six patients) or vena cava (one patient) graft infection secondary to a vasculo-digestive fistula. time between vascular graft setting and first clinical signs varied from eight months to more than thirteen years. six patients had fever. three patients presented with recurrent fever for more than nine months and in two of these cases, delay before diagnosis was long because repeated blood cultures were sterile. three patients had abdominal pain and/or digestive haemorrhage. abdominal ct-scan s. milleri was not contributive for the diagnosis  in four patients. streptococcus anginosus was isolated in four patients, streptococcus constellatus in three patients. one patient died before surgical management. the other six patients were cured by a surgical management associated with a prolonged antibiotic (lactams) treatment. s. milleri group graft infections are rare (or misdiagnosed) while we found only 4 similar cases in the  english medical literature. we conclude that a peri-prosthetic infection secondary to a digestive fistula must be insistently searched (and blood cultures must be repeated many times) in any patient with an aortic (or any other vascular) graft presenting prolonged or recurrent fever or acute digestive symptoms.

AB  == viridans streptococci (vs) are responsible for several systemic diseases, such as endocarditis, abscesses, and septicemia. unfortunately, species identification by conventional methods seems to be more difficult than species identification of other groups of bacteria. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of cell matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) for the rapid identification of 10 different species of vs. a total of 99 vs clinical isolates, 10 reference strains, and 20 strains from our in-house culture collection were analyzed by maldi-tof-ms. to evaluate the mass-spectrometric discrimination results, all strains were identified in parallel by phenotypic and genotypic methods. maldi-tof-ms identified 71 isolates as the mitis group, 23 as the anginosus group, and 5 as streptococcus salivarius. comparison of the species identification results obtained by the maldi-tof-ms analyses and with the phenotypic/genotypic identification systems showed 100% consistency at the species level. thus, maldi-tof-ms seems to be a rapid and reliable method for the identification of species of vs from clinical samples.

TI  == ai-2 quorum sensing affects antibiotic susceptibility in streptococcus anginosus.
AB  == objectives: the concern over rising antibiotic resistance necessitates exploration of alternative approaches in antimicrobial therapy. bacterial communities use the auto-inducer 2 (ai-2) quorum sensing signal at a specific threshold level for intra- and interspecies communication in order to regulate virulence behaviour. ai-2 signal production occurs in bacteria that possess a luxs homologue. in this study, we investigate for the first time the association  between ai-2 signalling and susceptibility to antibiotics. methods: streptococcus anginosus wild-type and its isogenic luxs mutant sa001 were exposed to erythromycin and ampicillin. susceptibility to erythromycin and ampicillin was determined by measuring the cell density and viability. complementation assays were conducted by exposing the mutant to wild-type supernatant or to the ai-2 precursor molecule dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (dpd). results: disruption of luxs  in s. anginosus resulted in a mutant with increased susceptibility to erythromycin and ampicillin. supernatant from s. anginosus wild-type partially restored growth of sa001 in the presence of the two antibiotics. dpd restored growth of the luxs mutant in the presence of erythromycin and ampicillin to values similar to that of s. anginosus wild-type. conclusions: our results indicate that luxs-based ai-2 communication is associated with antibiotic susceptibility. targeting the ai-2 signal communication may present a novel approach in antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == oral streptococcal strains isolated from odontogenic infections and their susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == the aim of this study was to identify at species level and to investigate the antibiotic susceptibility of oral streptococcal strains isolated from 100 pus samples collected from romanian patients with different odontogenic infections. the isolates were identified at species level using the rapid id 32 strep system  and their susceptibility was testing by the etest, against: penicillin g, ampicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline. for the investigation of  erythromycin resistance phenotype the disk diffusion test was used. the isolates  belonged to several species, with streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis predominating. reduced susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics was found only among the isolates belonging to s. mitis and s. sanguinis groups. resistance to erythromycin was detected among all species, except for: s. constellatus, s. intermedius and s. gordonii, and the m phenotype was established, while resistance to tetracycline was detected within all species but s. gordonii. in contrast, clindamycin was fully active. as most odontogenic infections are mixed  infections, often involving strictly anaerobic bacteria, which are frequently beta-lactamase producers, the association of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor, like amoxiclav, is recommended when the antimicrobial treatment is necessary.

TI  == response to alkaline stress by root canal bacteria in biofilms.
AB  == aim: to determine whether bacteria isolated from infected root canals survive alkaline shifts better in biofilms than in planktonic cultures. methodology: clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus paracasei, olsenella uli, streptococcus anginosus, s. gordonii, s. oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum  in biofilm and planktonic cultures were stressed at ph 10.5 for 4 h, and cell viability determined using the fluorescent staining live/dead baclight bacterial  viability kit. in addition, proteins released into extracellular culture fluids were identified by western blotting. results: enterococcus faecalis, l. paracasei, o. uli and s. gordonii survived in high numbers in both planktonic cultures and in biofilms after alkaline challenge. s. anginosus, s. oralis and f. nucleatum showed increased viability in biofilms compared with planktonic cultures. alkaline exposure caused all planktonic cultures to aggregate into clusters and resulted in a greater extrusion of cellular proteins compared with cells in biofilms. increased levels of dnak, hpr and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase were observed in culture fluids, especially amongst streptococci. conclusions: in general, bacteria isolated from infected roots canals resisted alkaline stress better in biofilms than in planktonic cultures, however, planktonic cells appeared to use aggregation and the extracellular transport of specific proteins as survival mechanisms.

AB  == objective and importance. several previous reports have documented cord compression resulting from the formation of an intrathecal inflammatory mass in patients using intrathecal drug delivery systems. we present the first reported case of an intramedullary abscess and intrathecal inflammatory mass associated with an intrathecal drug delivery system. clinical presentation. a 47-year-old man was transferred to our institution from an outside hospital with a 3-week history of the inability to ambulate or move his legs. his medical history included multiple failed back surgeries for back pain that had been effectively managed after the implantation of an intrathecal drug delivery system eight years prior. upon presentation to us, his examination showed no movement in his lower extremities with pinprick-preserved sensation in his toes. imaging showed an intrathecal mass at the catheter tip, at spinal level t10 and t11. contrast-enhanced imaging indicated an intramedullary abscess at t11 and t12 level. intervention. the patient underwent t10-l1 laminectomies with complete resection of the inflammatory mass, catheter tip, and explantation of the intrathecal drug delivery pump. a midline myelotomy also was performed to aspirate the abscess and the cavity was profusely irrigated. pathology studies demonstrated that the inflammatory mass contained chronic inflammatory markers and necrotic tissue. the abscess was linked to infection with streptococcus anginosus. conclusion. generally, inflammatory masses forming along the catheter  tip are not associated with infections. we report the first case of an intramedullary abscess associated with an intrathecal drug delivery pump.

TI  == group milleri streptococci: significant pathogens in solid organ recipients.
AB  == group milleri streptococci (gms) comprise a heterogeneous group of streptococci including the species intermedius, constellatus and anginosus. they may cause chronic intra-abdominal and intrathoracic abscesses, which are difficult to treat. this is a retrospective analysis including 45 transplant recipients in whom gms were isolated. the epidemiology, clinical significance and the impact on the outcome in all transplant patients with infections caused by gms during a 4-year period (2001-2004) was evaluated. the 45 solid organ recipients (88 isolates) included 34 liver-, four kidney/pancreas-, one kidney-, two small bowel-, three combined liver/kidney- and one combined kidney/small bowel transplant recipient. in 42 cases gms caused intra-abdominal infection, in two cases pleural empyema and in one case soft tissue infection. only a single isolate of gms was cultured from blood. in 54 of the 88 specimens (61%), which grew gms, other pathogens were also isolated. gms frequently caused recurrent cholangitis (n = 17) associated with anastomotic and nonanastomotic biliary strictures. these cases were managed by repeated stenting or surgical intervention and prolonged antibiotic therapy. no patient died directly related to gms infection and all except one case responded to combined surgical/antibiotic treatment. one pancreas graft was lost because of erosion haemorrhage associated with an abscess. gms were susceptible to penicillin g, carbapenems and clindamycin, whereas cephalosporins and quinolones showed intermediate activity or resistance in some cases, and gms in general were found  resistant to aminoglycosides. gms may cause serious infections in transplant recipients which are difficult to treat. their prevalence in transplant surgical  site infections thus far may have been underestimated.

TI  == [evaluation of rapid diagnostic kits for the detection of group a streptococcus to streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus spp. with lancefield's group a antigen].
AB  == we studied the basic performance of eight rapid diagnostic kits for the detection of group a streptococcus by immunochromatography under the same conditions. kits  were the; quickvue dipstick strep a (sumitomo seiyaku biomedical co., ltd.), testpack plus strep a (abbott japan co., ltd), cleaview strep a (nihon schering k. k.), quickvue strep a (wako pure chemical industries, ltd), immunocard stat! strep a (tfb, inc.), dipstick 'eiken' strep a (eiken chemical co., ltd.), rapid testa strep a (daiichi pure chemical co., ltd.), and statcheck strep a (kainos laboratories, inc.). four of these kits, i.e. quickvue dipstick strep a, testpack plus strep a, rapid testa strep a, and statcheck strep a showed sensitivity at 1.0 x 10(5) cfu/ml (1.0 x 10(4)cfu/test) with all of s. pyogenes tested, while the anginosus group and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis with lancefield' s group a antigen showed sensitivity very similar to s. pyogenes. of these strains, s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis formed a beta-hemolytic colony resembling that of s. pyogenes on sheep blood agar, and was sensitive to bacitracin. it is thus indispensable to identify the colony using biochemical tests such as the pyr (pyrrolidonylarylamidase production) test. in using rapid diagnostic kits for the detection of group a streptococcus, it is important to rule out the possibility of group a streptococcus other than s. pyogenes in throats. severe invasive group-g streptococcal infections are increasing recently. concerning s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, it is especially important to conduct these identification tests.

TI  == tigecycline (gar-936) activity against streptococcus gallolyticus (bovis) and viridans group streptococci.
AB  == viridans group streptococci including streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly s. bovis) represent serious invasive pathogens often associated with endocarditis or sepsis among immunocompromised or cancer patients. tigecycline (gar-936), the first clinically studied glycylcycline, has a potent gram-positive activity with  a potential treatment option for these streptococcal infections. the studied collection (848 strains) included 100 isolates each of streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and fewer  strains of s. gallolyticus (98 strains) and streptococcus mutans (50 strains). these strains were isolated from patients on 3 continents in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program and tested for susceptibility and interpreted  by clinical and laboratory standards institute broth microdilution methods and criteria (< or = 0.25 microg/ml for tigecycline per us food and drug administration). penicillin susceptibility rates for the entire collection varied from 61% (s. sanguis) to 98% (s. constellatus), and macrolide susceptibility was  also compromised (49-88%; average, 69%). tigecycline was active against all isolates tested, in contrast to tetracycline resistance rates of 8-66%, and highest for s. gallolyticus. in conclusion tigecycline was quite active against bacteremic isolates of viridans group streptococci species and s. gallolyticus with an overall mic90 at < or = 0.06 microg/ml; the highest mic was only 0.25 microg/ml.

AB  == interactions between enterococcus faecalis and other species found in root canal  infections might be important for the development and persistence of periapical disease. the aim of this study was to investigate the coaggregation interactions  between e. faecalis clinical isolates and species previously shown to survive and induce apical periodontitis in monkeys: peptostreptococcus anaerobius, prevotella oralis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and streptococcus anginosus. intergeneric coaggregation assays were conducted in duplicate with observations scored immediately at 0 h, 1 h and 24 h after mixing of combinations of strains. all e.  faecalis strains (n = 53) coaggregated with f. nucleatum; e. faecalis did not coaggregate with p. anaerobius or s. anginosus. one strain, e. faecalis e1, coaggregated with p. oralis, with aggregates visible at 1 h. coaggregation interactions between e. faecalis and f. nucleatum observed in this study suggest  a potential role for this combination in endodontic infections.

TI  == disseminated streptococcus anginosus infection with empyema thoracis in a patient with sarcoma.
AB  == streptococcus anginosus is a member of the normal flora of the oral cavity and a  pathogen of thoracic infection. however, disseminated infection that was identified from different body fluids at the same time has never been reported. we report a 52-year-old man with advanced pulmonary sarcoma who developed neutropenia, bronchopleural fistula and thoracic empyema after chemotherapy. viridans group streptococcus was isolated from both empyema and urine, which was  confirmed as s. anginosus according to the biochemical reaction profiles and 16s  rrna gene sequencing results. the patient recovered uneventfully after tube drainage and treatment with imipenem. disseminated s. anginosus infection should  be considered as a possible pathogen in immunocompromised patients with empyema and can be rapidly identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing.

TI  == use of the phoenix automated system for identification of streptococcus and enterococcus spp.
AB  == the phoenix system (becton dickinson diagnostic systems, sparks, md) was evaluated for identification (id) to the species level of streptococci and enterococci. two hundred clinical isolates were investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae organisms (n = 46), viridans group streptococci (n = 31), enterococcus faecium (n = 36), enterococcus faecalis (n = 25), and other catalase-negative cocci (n = 12). the api system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) was used as a comparator. molecular methods (sequencing of 16s rrna and zwf and gki genes and ddl gene amplification) were used to investigate discordant results. upon resolution of discrepancies, correct species id was achieved by the phoenix system for 121/129 (93.8%) streptococci and 63/70  (90.0%) enterococci. excellent results were obtained for s. pneumoniae (45/45) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (49/50). with regard to viridans streptococci, the accuracy of the phoenix system was 83.9%. among the latter organisms, the best performance was obtained with isolates of the streptococcus sanguinis group  and streptococcus anginosus group; problems were instead encountered with the streptococcus mitis group. four e. faecium and three e. faecalis isolates were misidentified as enterococcus casseliflavus/enterococcus gallinarum or enterococcus durans. thus, these isolates were identified only at the genus level. compared with commercially available systems, the phoenix system appears a reliable diagnostic tool for identifying clinically relevant streptococci and enterococci. the smic/id-2 panel proved particularly effective for beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci.

TI  == influence of residual bacteria on periapical tissue healing after chemomechanical treatment and root filling of experimentally infected monkey teeth.
AB  == the purpose of this study was twofold: first, to determine the influence on the healing of the periapical tissues when selected bacterial strains and combinations thereof remain after root canal treatment; and, second, the relationship to healing of the quality of the root filling. in eight monkeys, 175 root canals, previously infected with combinations of four or five bacterial strains and with radiographically verified apical periodontitis, were endodontically treated, bacteriologically controlled, and permanently obturated.  after 2-2.5 yr, the periapical regions were radiographically and histologically examined. of these teeth, 48 root canals were also examined for bacteria remaining after removal of the root fillings. when bacteria remained after the endodontic treatment, 79% of the root canals showed non-healed periapical lesions, compared with 28% where no bacteria were found. combinations of residual bacterial species were more frequently related to non-healed lesions than were single strains. when no bacteria remained, healing occurred independently of the  quality of the root filling. in contrast, when bacteria remained, there was a greater correlation with non-healing in poor-quality root fillings than in technically well-performed fillings. in root canals where bacteria were found after removal of the root filling, 97% had not healed, compared with 18% for those root canals with no bacteria detected. the present study demonstrates the importance of obtaining a bacteria-free root canal system before permanent root filling in order to achieve optimal healing conditions for the periapical tissues.

TI  == luxs-mediated signalling in streptococcus anginosus and its role in biofilm formation.
AB  == the autoinducer-2 signal (ai-2) produced by several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria mediates interspecies communication. in this study we were able to identify an orthologue of luxs, required for the synthesis of ai-2 signals, in streptococcus anginosus. comparative analyses revealed conserved sequences in the predicted s. anginosus luxs. expression of luxs was highest during early exponential growth phase. compared to other oral streptococci, conditioned media from growth of members of the anginosus group were the most efficient in inducing bioluminescence in vibrio harveyi, indicative of ai-2 signalling. disruption of luxs in s. anginosus resulted in a mutant deficient in  biofilm formation, whereas no effect on planktonic growth rate was observed under various growth conditions. s. anginosus is part of the human flora found in biofilms of the oral cavity, as well as of the upper respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. such habitats harbour large varieties of  bacterial species, among which cell-cell communication may play an important role. s. anginosus has also been associated with purulent infections and cancer in the upper digestive tract. knowledge about the molecular mechanisms involved in s. anginosus communication is important for understanding its commensalism and its pathogenic transition.

TI  == bacterial profile and burden of periodontal infection in subjects with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome.
AB  == background: periodontitis has been identified as a potential risk factor in cardiovascular diseases. it is possible that the stimulation of host responses to oral infections may result in vascular damage and the inducement of blood clotting. the aim of this study was to assess the role of periodontal infection and bacterial burden as an explanatory variable to the activation of the inflammatory process leading to acute coronary syndrome (acs). methods: a total of 161 consecutive surviving cases admitted with a diagnosis of acs and 161 control subjects, matched with cases according to their gender, socioeconomic level, and smoking status, were studied. serum white blood cell (wbc) counts, high- and low-density lipoprotein (hdl/ldl) levels, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsc-rp) levels, and clinical periodontal routine parameters were studied. the subgingival pathogens were assayed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: total oral bacterial load was higher in the subjects with acs (mean difference: 17.4x10(5); sd: 10.8; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 4.2 to 17.4; p<0.001), and significant for 26 of 40 species including porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, and treponema denticola. serum wbc counts, hsc-rp levels, streptococcus intermedius, and streptococcus sanguis,  were explanatory factors to acute coronary syndrome status (nagelkerke r2=0.49).  conclusion: the oral bacterial load of s. intermedius, s. sanguis, streptococcus  anginosus, t. forsythensis, t. denticola, and p. gingivalis may be concomitant risk factors in the development of acs.

TI  == bactericidal effect of nd:yag laser irradiation on some endodontic pathogens ex vivo.
AB  == aim: to define the role of neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (nd:yag) lasers in root canal disinfection along with a minimally invasive treatment concept. methodology: the hypothesis was tested ex vivo that nd:yag laser irradiation has  a bactericidal effect on endodontic pathogens inoculated in root canals. resultant colony-forming unit counts were associated with observations of bacterial cell structural changes using conventional scanning electron microscopy (csem) and environmental scanning electron microscopy (esem) on inoculated dentine surfaces, following indirect and direct nd:yag laser irradiation, respectively. results: the nd:yag laser irradiation (1.5 w, 15 hz, four times for 5 s) of enterococcus faecalis inoculated canals resulted in a significant reduction (p < 0.05, wilcoxon signed rank test) of the bacterial load, meaning a  99.7% kill, but no sterilization. the csem procedure verified that the extent of  radiation damage was in line with the total amount of laser energy applied. after 2 h of incubation and three cycles of indirect laser treatment (i.e. through a 1-mm-thick dentine disc), no morphologically intact bacteria of actinomyces naeslundii or streptococcus anginosus were discernible. however, when micro-colonies of s. anginosus and specially biofilms of e. faecalis were present after 2 days, the in situ experiment using esem and direct laser treatment showed that bacterial eradication was reduced in deep layers. conclusions: the nd:yag laser irradiation is not an alternative but a possible supplement to existing protocols for canal disinfection as the properties of laser light may allow a bactericidal effect beyond 1 mm of dentine. endodontic pathogens that grow as biofilms, however, are difficult to eradicate even upon direct laser exposure.

AB  == we studied history, renal histopathology and microbiology of an epidemic of acute glomerulonephritis associated with throat infections and uncommon culture results in four neighbour families. a 40-year-old man (index patient) was referred to a university hospital for dialysis and kidney biopsy due to a suspected acute glomerulonephritis. an acute tonsillitis had preceded the condition. penicillin treatment had been started four days before the discovery of renal failure. throat swabs were positive for beta-hemolytic streptococci, group c (gcs). gcs were also found in throat cultures from his wife and two of their children. the bacteria were typed as streptococcus constellatus. a third child had s. constellatus expressing lancefield antigen group g. a neighbour and two of his children fell ill the following week with renal involvement. throat swabs from both these children were positive for s. constellatus. his third child had erythema multiforme and s. constellatus in the throat while a fourth child had beta-hemolytic streptococci group a; streptococcus pyogenes. kidney biopsies on the index patient and his neighbour showed an acute diffuse prolipherative glomerulonephritis compatible with acute post-streptococcal nephritis and microbiological analysis of renal tissue revealed in both cases s. pyogenes and s. constellatus. the families had had much contact and had consumed unpasteurized milk from our index patient's farm. in four of seven persons in two additional neighbouring families s. constellatus was found in throat swabs during the same month while two persons carried streptococcus anginosus expressing the lancefield c antigen. in conclusion spread of s. constellatus coincided with the occurrence  of four cases of acute glomerulonephritis. the two biopsied patients had both s.  pyogenes and s. constellatus present in renal tissue. the epidemic either suggested that the outbreak of glomerulonephritis was due to s. pyogenes but coincided with the transmission and colonization of s. constellatus or that the s. constellatus strains were highly pathogenic or nephritogenic and that this organism can be transmitted in such cases.

AB  == clinical and microbiologic studies of 50 cases of viridans streptococcal bacteremia in cancer patients were performed. the bacteria were identified to species level by sequencing analysis of the 16s rrna gene. at least nine streptococcus spp. were found, including s. mitis (25 strains, 50.0% of 50); currently unnamed streptococcus spp. (11 strains); s. parasanguis (five strains); s. anginosus (three strains); s. salivarius (two strains); and one strain each of s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. sobrinus, and s. vestibularis. there were no s. oralis strains. among 11 antibiotics of nine classes tested, no resistance to vancomycin, linezolid, or quinupristin-dalfopristin was seen. resistance to penicillin (mic, 4 to 12 mug/ml) was noted only among s. mitis strains (28.0%, 7/25) and not non-s. mitis strains (0/25) (p = 0.004). significantly more s. mitis strains than non-s. mitis strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones and to > or =3 classes of antibiotics. isolation of quinolone-resistant organisms was associated with the prior usage of quinolones (p = 0.002). quantitative blood cultures showed that the strains resistant to levofloxacin or gatifloxacin were associated with higher colony counts than were their corresponding nonresistant strains. the young and elderly patients also had higher levels of bacteremia caused predominantly by s. mitis. septic shock was present in 17 (34.0% of 50) patients, and 13 of those cases were caused by s. mitis (p = 0.007). these results suggest that s. mitis is the most common cause of viridans streptococcal  bacteremia in cancer patients and is more resistant to antibiotics than other species.

TI  == use of phylogenetic and phenotypic analyses to identify nonhemolytic streptococci isolated from bacteremic patients.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate molecular and phenotypic methods for the identification of nonhemolytic streptococci. a collection of 148 strains consisting of 115 clinical isolates from cases of infective endocarditis, septicemia, and meningitis and 33 reference strains, including type strains of all relevant streptococcus species, were examined. identification was performed by phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences of four housekeeping genes, ddl, gdh, rpob, and soda; by pcr analysis of the glucosyltransferase (gtf) gene; and by conventional phenotypic characterization and identification using two commercial kits, rapid id 32 strep and streptogram and the associated databases.  a phylogenetic tree based on concatenated sequences of the four housekeeping genes allowed unequivocal differentiation of recognized species and was used as the reference. analysis of single gene sequences revealed deviation clustering in eight strains (5.4%) due to homologous recombination with other species. this was particularly evident in s. sanguinis and in members of the anginosus group of streptococci. the rate of correct identification of the strains by both commercial identification kits was below 50% but varied significantly between species. the most significant problems were observed with s. mitis and s. oralis  and 11 streptococcus species described since 1991. our data indicate that identification based on multilocus sequence analysis is optimal. as a more practical alternative we recommend identification based on soda sequences with reference to a comprehensive set of sequences that is available for downloading from our server. an analysis of the species distribution of 107 nonhemolytic streptococci from bacteremic patients showed a predominance of s. oralis and s. anginosus with various underlying infections.

TI  == identification of 43 streptococcus species by pyrosequencing analysis of the rnpb gene.
AB  == pyrosequencing technology was evaluated for identification of species within the  streptococcus genus. two variable regions in the rnpb gene, which encodes the rna subunit of endonuclease p, were sequenced in two reactions. of 43 species, all could be identified to the species level except strains of the species pairs streptococcus anginosus/s. constellatus and s. infantis/s. peroris. a total of 113 blood culture isolates were identified by pyrosequencing analysis of partial  rnpb sequences. all but eight isolates could be unambiguously assigned to a specific species when the first 30 nucleotides of the two regions were compared to an rnpb database comprising 107 streptococcal strains. principal coordinate analysis of sequence variation of strains from viridans group streptococci resulted in species-specific clusters for the mitis and the salivarius groups but not for the anginosus group. the identification capacity of pyrosequencing was compared to the biochemical test systems vitek 2 and rapid id 32 strep. the concordance between pyrosequencing and vitek 2 was 75%, and for rapid id 32 strep the corresponding figure was 77%. isolates with discrepant identifications in the three methods were subjected to entire rnpb dna sequence analysis that confirmed  the identifications by pyrosequencing. in conclusion, pyrosequencing analysis of  the rnpb gene can reliably identify streptococcus species with high resolution.

TI  == homogeneous enzymatic assay for l-cysteine with betac-s lyase.
AB  == we have developed a new enzymatic assay for determining l-cysteine concentration. the method involves the use of betac-s lyase from streptococcus anginosus, which  catalyzes the alpha,beta-elimination of l-cysteine to hydrogen sulfide, pyruvate, and ammonia. the production of pyruvate is measured by d-lactate dehydrogenase and nadh. the decrease in nadh was proportional to the l-cysteine concentration up to 1.0 mm. when serum samples were used, within-day and day-to-day coefficient variations were below 4%. this method is simple, and can easily and reliably be used for accurate determination of l-cysteine concentration in serum or other samples.

TI  == epidural abscess caused by streptococcus milleri in a pregnant woman.
AB  == background: bacteria in the streptococcus milleri group (s. anginosus, s. constellatus, and s. intermedius) are associated with bacteremia and abscess formation. while most reports of streptococcus milleri group (smg) infection occur in patients with underlying medical conditions, smg infections during pregnancy have been documented. however, smg infections in pregnant women are associated with either neonatal or maternal puerperal sepsis. albeit rare, s. milleri spinal-epidural abscess in pregnancy has been reported, always as a complication of spinal-epidural anesthesia. we report a case of spinal-epidural abscess caused by smg in a young, pregnant woman without an antecedent history of spinal epidural anesthesia and without any underlying risk factors for invasive streptococcal disease. case presentation: a 25 year old pregnant woman developed  neurological symptoms consistent with spinal cord compression at 20 weeks gestation. she underwent emergency laminectomy for decompression and was treated  with ceftriaxone 2 gm iv daily for 28 days. she was ambulatory at the time of discharge from the inpatient rehabilitation unit with residual lower extremity weakness. conclusion: to our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a streptococcus milleri epidural abscess in a healthy, pregnant woman with no history of epidural anesthesia or invasive procedures. this report adds to the body of literature on smg invasive infections. treatment of smg spinal-epidural abscess with neurologic manifestations should include prompt and aggressive surgical decompression coupled with targeted anti-infective therapy.

TI  == bacterial flora of the low male genital tract in patients consulting for infertility.
AB  == the physiological aerobic bacterial flora of the low male genital tract was determined. this prospective study was performed on 600 semen specimens collected from 543 asymptomatic males consulting for infertility. semen cultures were sterile in 28.8%, with a polymicrobial flora and/or absence or low titres of ureaplasma urealyticum in 49.3%, and with one or two aerobic and facultative bacteria > or =1 x 10(3) cfu ml(-1) and/or u. urealyticum with titres > or =10(4) ccu ml(-1) (colour changing units) in 21.8%. in standard aerobic cultures, gardnerella vaginalis was the most commonly isolated species (26.1%), followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (15.7%) and streptococcus anginosus (14.2%). ureaplasma urealyticum was absent in 84.5% of semen samples, but when recovered,  high (> or =10(4) ccu ml(-1)) and low titres (< or =10(3) ccu ml(-1)) were counted in 7.2% and 8.3% respectively. of 48 patients, the follow-up of semen cultures showed marked variations in time. this study shows that (i) there was no relationship between the bacterial flora and the leucocytospermia; (ii) low titres of u. urealyticum in semen were not associated with a disturbance of the ecosystem; (iii) the critical threshold for u. urealyticum should be raised to >  or =10(4) cfu ml(-1) and (iv) a positive semen culture should be repeated before  any treatment.

TI  == spontaneous cervical paraspinal and epidural giant abscess in a child--case report--.
AB  == a 10-year-old girl presented with a very rare paraspinal and spinal epidural abscess manifesting as fever, and neck pain and stiffness. initially, she was treated under a diagnosis of meningitis for 3 weeks. however, she developed monoparesis of the right upper extremity, and was referred for neurosurgery. magnetic resonance imaging revealed an epidural and paraspinal lesion intensely enhanced by gadolinium. the patient underwent urgent surgery for c2-3 laminectomy and abscess drainage, followed by broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. she was discharged and followed up in the outpatient clinic. two months later, the paraspinal abscess recurred with great increase in size. a second operation was performed and 150 ml pus was drained. streptococcus anginosus was grown in the culture. the patient fully recovered after long-term targeted antibiotic therapy. such abscesses are very rare in children, especially in the cervical region. the  correct diagnosis can be difficult to establish but early treatment is essential  for a good prognosis.

TI  == predominant presence of streptococcus anginosus in the saliva of alcoholics.
AB  == chronic alcohol consumption is known to be a major risk factor for cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract. the incidence of esophageal cancer (4.4%) in alcoholics is reported to be much higher than that in the japanese population as  a whole (0.0001%). this suggests the presence of specific factors in chronic alcohol consumption-related carcinogenesis. recently, data showing a significant  correlation between streptococcus anginosus and carcinogenesis in the upper aerodigestive tract have been reported. in this study, the ratio of s. anginosus  to oral bacteria in the saliva of 38 alcoholic patients was investigated to determine if there is an association between alcoholic patients and s. anginosus  infection. the level of s. anginosus in the saliva from 22 healthy people, 41 esophageal cancer patients, 32 gastritis patients, and 24 periodontitis patients  was also investigated and compared to the level in alcoholic patients. in the saliva from esophageal cancer patients, the level of s. anginosus was not significantly different from that of healthy people. the levels of s. anginosus in periodontitis and gastritis patients were also similar. in alcoholics, however, there was an extremely high level of s. anginosus, suggesting that they, rather than healthy people and general esophageal cancer patients, have a high risk for s. anginosus infection.

TI  == quantification and detection of bacteria from postoperative maxillary cyst by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background/aims: postoperative maxillary cyst (pomc) is known to occur as a delayed complication of radical maxillary sinus surgery, such as caldwell-luc surgery. the cyst gradually expands with no symptoms over a period of years, and  then occasionally causes swelling and pain in the buccal region and/or the mucogingival fold. it is probable that bacterial infection affects the progression of pomc symptoms. the aims of this study were to determine the bacterial density and to examine the presence of 20 oral bacteria in pomc fluids. methods: pomc fluids (4 purulent, 2 mucous and 4 serous) were sampled from 10 subjects (aged 43-77 years). bacterial quantification and detection were performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and nested pcr based on bacterial 16s rrna genes, respectively. results: bacterial dna was detected in all samples and the average concentrations of bacterial dna were 5.9 (purulent),  0.5 (mucous), and 0.7 (serous) ng/mg of sample. twelve bacterial species, including anginosus streptococci, known to be associated with abscess formation,  were detected in the purulent fluids, while two and five species were detected in the mucous and serous fluids, respectively. conclusion: purulent fluids contained numerous bacteria of various types, thus suggesting that oral bacteria may cause  symptoms such as pain in pomc with purulent fluids. mucous and serous fluids also contained bacteria, although their numbers were small, thus suggesting an association between bacteria and progression of pomc.

TI  == clinical, phenotypic, and genotypic evidence for streptococcus sinensis as the common ancestor of anginosus and mitis groups of streptococci.
AB  == in 2002, we reported the discovery of a novel species of viridans streptococcus,  streptococcus sinensis. recently, we reported the isolation of two more strains of s. sinensis. clinically, s. sinensis is a definite cause of infective endocarditis, a characteristic mainly pertaining to the mitis group of streptococci. phenotypically, two of the three s. sinensis isolates were lancefield group f, a characteristic of the anginosus group. however, none of the three strains possess the caramel smell typical of this group of streptococci. biochemically, s. sinensis was identified in 56% of the time as members of the anginosus group, and in 33% of the time as members of the mitis group. these clinical and phenotypic properties should be governed by the presence/absence or  expressivity of particular genes in the s. sinensis genome. genotypically, phylogenetic analysis using 16s rrna gene sequences showed that s. sinensis branched out as the first branch in the anginosus group, implying that it is the  ancestor of the other members of this group. however, the bootstrap value for s.  sinensis clustered with members of the anginosus group is only 47%, meaning that  it is often not clustered with members of this group, but the mitis group. furthermore, the differences in the 16s rrna gene sequences between s. sinensis and streptococcus intermedius (3.7%) and those between s. sinensis and streptococcus gordonii (3.6%) are almost the same. all these indicated that it is very likely that s. sinensis is the common ancestor of the anginosus and mitis groups of streptococci. complete genome sequencing of s. sinensis and comparative genomics studies on the s. sinensis genome and genomes of members in the anginosus and mitis groups should reveal clues to the underlying genotypic differences that govern the different phenotypic properties of the two groups of  streptococci, such as why streptococci of the anginosus group are prone to cause  abscess formation but not infective endocarditis as compared to other viridans streptococci.

TI  == brainstem infarcts as an early manifestation of streptococcus anginosus meningitis.
AB  == background and purpose: vasculitis and infarcts are well-established sequelae of  bacterial meningitis. however, early large-vessel involvement is rare, particularly within the brainstem. there has been one previous case report of a young male who presented with pontine infarct as an early manifestation of streptococcus milleri meningitis. we present another case of brainstem infarction associated with meningitis caused by streptococcus anginosus. case description: we report a 58-year-old man who developed constitutional symptoms and gait instability, followed by progressive stupor. on examination, he had a glasgow coma scale of 8 with intact brainstem reflexes and no focal findings. magnetic resonance imaging documented bilateral pontine infarcts. s. anginosus was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid. despite proper antibiotic treatment, the patient remained comatose and care was withdrawn. postmortem examination revealed the meningitis was predominantly localized at the base of the brain. in addition, ventriculitis, multiple abscesses, and multiple infarcts in the pons and midbrain were found. conclusion: s. anginosus, which is part of the normal human flora, causes invasive pyogenic infections and is an uncommon cause of bacterial meningitis. this type of infection is mostly situated at the base of the brain and has a propensity to encase the basilar artery and its perforators, thus causing brainstem stroke early in its course.

TI  == differentiation of mutans streptococci by intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == it is difficult to distinguish mutans streptococci on the species level, and even more so on the subspecies level. intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) (icm) was applied to reference strains of five of the species of the mutans group (streptococcus criceti, streptococcus downei, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus ratti, streptococcus sobrinus), nonmutans streptococci (streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis), and  177 mutans streptococci isolated from saliva of 10 children. from the analysis of the reference strains, readily distinguishable icm mass spectra were obtained for the different species. based on multivariate statistical analysis, a correct and  unambiguous assignment was made of the spectra of 159 isolated mutans streptococci to s. mutans and 16 isolates to s. sobrinus. two isolates were sorted out and were identified by sequencing of their 16s rrna genes as streptococcus anginosus. in addition, icm indicated a misclassification for some  reference strains (aht, v 100 and e 49) and re-classified aht and e 49 as s. ratti and v 100 as s. sobrinus. this was confirmed by 16s rdna sequencing. based  on a statistical similarity analysis of the spectra of reference strains and a quantitative assessment of the reproducibility of icm, the isolates identified as either s. mutans or s. sobrinus were phenotyped on the subspecies level. in the population of the clinical isolates, 14 unambiguously different s. mutans and three different s. sobrinus phenotypes were detected. icm proved to be a powerful tool for a differentiation of mutans streptococci down to the subspecies level.

TI  == streptococci from root canals in teeth with apical periodontitis receiving endodontic treatment.
AB  == objectives: the object of this study was to investigate the diversity among streptococcal species isolated from root canals in conjunction with endodontic therapy and to characterize their production of extracellular proteins. study design: consecutive root canal samples (rcs) taken as bacteriological controls during root canal treatment of teeth with apical periodontitis were analyzed in a total of 100 clinical cases. bacteria were isolated and classified by selective media and gas liquid chromatography. streptococcal strains were identified by carbohydrate fermentation, hydrolysis of aesculin/arginine, and production of enzymes. releases of extracellular proteins by streptococci and enterococcus spp  in fluid culture media were examined with sds-page and 2-dimension gel electrophoresis (2 de). extracellular proteins produced were quantified and qualitatively analyzed. specific proteins were targeted with western immunoblot assays. comparisons were made with type strains. results: of a total of 241 bacterial strains recovered in the first samples submitted, streptococcus gordonii, s anginosus, and s oralis were the most frequently isolated streptococci. in 49 of 89 resubmitted samples showing bacterial growth, s gordonii and s oralis still predominated among streptococci. other common bacterial isolates were enterococcus spp, lactobacillus paracasei, and olsenella  uli. quantitative and qualitative differences in extracellular protein production were observed among clinical isolates and laboratory streptococcal strains. in similar conditions for growth, s intermedius, s anginosus, s oralis, and s gordonii were strong producers of extracellular proteins (>3.0 microg/ml), while  enterococcus spp and s mutans were weak. whole cell protein extracts showed a different profile from that of extracellular proteins. the chaperone protein dnak was recognized to be produced extracellularly by s gordonii, s oralis, s anginosus, and s parasanguis. conclusions: being strong producers of extracellular proteins and by virtue of common presence in teeth undergoing endodontic therapy, s gordonii, s anginosus, and s oralis may be of pathogenic significance in posttreatment apical periodontitis.

TI  == experimental abscess formation caused by human dental plaque.
AB  == human dental plaque consists of a wide variety of microorganisms, some of which are believed to cause systemic infections, including abscesses, at various sites  in the body. to confirm this hypothesis experimentally, we examined the abscess-forming ability of native dental plaque in mice, the microbial features of the infectious locus produced by the plaque, and the anti-phagocytic property  of microbial isolates. aliquots of a suspension of supragingival dental plaque containing 6 x 10(6) colony-forming unit of bacteria were injected subcutaneously into the dorsa of mice. abscess formation was induced in 76 of 85 mice using ten  different plaque samples. thirteen microorganisms were isolated from pus samples  aspirated from abscess lesions. the microbial composition of pus, examined in 17  of 76 abscesses, was very simple compared to that of the plaque sample that had induced the abscess. the majority of the isolates belonged to the streptococcus anginosus group, normally a minor component of plaque samples. s. anginosus was the most frequently detected organism and the most prevalent in seven abscesses,  and streptococcus intermedius and streptococcus constellatus were predominant in  one and three abscess samples, respectively. each isolate of s. anginosus group produced abscesses in mice, and heat-treated supragingival dental plaque influenced the abscess-forming ability of s. anginosus isolate. these isolates possessed a high antiphagocytic capacity against human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. our results suggest that human supragingival dental plaque itself is  a source of the infectious pathogens that cause abscess formation.

AB  == objective: to elucidate a possible involvement of streptococcus anginosus in oral cancer, we assessed the frequency of s. anginosus infection in oral cancer tissues, and investigated its infection route. materials and method: the tissue specimens were obtained from 46 oral cancer and three precancerous leukoplakia subjects. frequency of s. anginosus infection was assessed by a species-specific  polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. the genotype of the clinical isolates taken from cancer tissue and dental plaque samples was analyzed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). results: s. anginosus dna was frequently detected in squamous cell carcinoma (19/42), but not in other types of cancer (lymphoma and rhabdomyosarcoma) or leukoplakia samples. a subject-based analysis  revealed that s. anginosus was solely detected in dental plaque and not in saliva from all 19 s. anginosus-positive squamous cell carcinoma cases. further, the genotype of s. anginosus isolated from cancer tissue was identical to that from dental plaque of the same patients. conclusion: infection of s. anginosus could occur frequently in oral squamous cell carcinoma and that dental plaque could be  a dominant reservoir of the s. anginosus.

AB  == the objective of this study was to both isolate and identify non-mutans streptococci organisms (non-mso) from dental plaques recovered on mitis-salivarius sucrose bacitracin agar (msb) plates. the dental plaque samples, which had been collected from 63 human subjects, were diluted and plated on msb.  the bacteria growing on the msb plates were then identified with biochemical tests, as well as with 16s rdna cloning and sequencing techniques. our data indicated that bacteria from 30 subjects had been recovered on the msb plates. among the 21 typical colonies selected from the 30 subjects, 12 colonies, derived from 10 subjects, were identified as non-mso. these 12 colonies were determined to be streptococcus anginosus (8 colonies), s. sanguinis (1 colony), and pantoea  agglomerans (3 colonies). these results strongly suggest that a new selective medium will be required for the reliable isolation of mutans streptococci.

TI  == luxs-based signaling affects streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is implicated as a major etiological agent in human dental caries, and one of the important virulence properties of this organism is its ability to form biofilms (dental plaque) on tooth surfaces. we examined the role  of autoinducer-2 (ai-2) on s. mutans biofilm formation by constructing a gs-5 luxs-null mutant. biofilm formation by the luxs mutant in 0.5% sucrose defined medium was found to be markedly attenuated compared to the wild type. scanning electron microscopy also revealed that biofilms of the luxs mutant formed larger  clumps in sucrose medium compared to the parental strain. therefore, the expression of glucosyltransferase genes was examined and the gtfb and gtfc genes, but not the gtfd gene, in the luxs mutant were upregulated in the mid-log growth  phase. furthermore, we developed a novel two-compartment system to monitor ai-2 production by oral streptococci and periodontopathic bacteria. the biofilm defect of the luxs mutant was complemented by strains of s. gordonii, s. sobrinus, and s. anginosus; however, it was not complemented by s. oralis, s. salivarius, or s. sanguinis. biofilm formation by the luxs mutant was also complemented by porphyromonas gingivalis 381 and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 but not  by a p. gingivalis luxs mutant. these results suggest that the regulation of the  glucosyltransferase genes required for sucrose-dependent biofilm formation is regulated by ai-2. furthermore, these results provide further confirmation of previous proposals that quorum sensing via ai-2 may play a significant role in oral biofilm formation.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by an oligonucleotide array.
AB  == viridans streptococci (vs) are common etiologic agents of subacute infective endocarditis and are capable of causing a variety of pyogenic infections. many species of vs are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. an oligonucleotide array based on 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic spacer (its) sequences was developed to identify 11 clinically relevant vs. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the method consisted of pcr amplification of the its regions by using  a pair of universal primers, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled pcr products to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides immobilized on a nylon membrane. after 120 strains of the 11 species of vg and 91 strains of other bacteria were tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide array were found to be 100% (120 of 120 strains) and 95.6% (87 of 91 strains), respectively. s. pneumoniae cross-hybridized to the probes used for the identification of s. mitis, and simple biochemical tests such as optochin susceptibility or bile solubility should be used to differentiate s. pneumoniae from s. mitis. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by use of the present oligonucleotide array is accurate and could be used as an alternative reliable method for species identification of strains of vs.

TI  == expression of the gtfi gene from streptococcus sobrinus in streptococcus anginosus using integration-mediated transformation system.
AB  == we have constructed a streptococcus anginosus transformant expressing the gtfi gene from streptococcus sobrinus, using a previously developed integration-mediated transformation system to introduce foreign genes onto the oral streptococcal chromosome, and attempted to evaluate the gene expression. in  this system, one cloning plasmid and three pacyc184 derivatives, anchor, heterodimer, and integration plasmids were used for the construction of a series  of integrants via homologous recombination. a portion of s. sobrinus gtfi gene devoid of approximately 1 kb of the 5'-region derived from pmd39 was cloned into  the integration plasmid and introduced onto the s. anginosus chromosome. next, the polymerase chain reaction product corresponding to 2.0 kb of the 5'-region of the gtfi gene from s. sobrinus chromosome was further cloned into the cloning plasmid, and the intact gtfi gene was reconstructed following integration. the final s. anginosus integrant successfully secreted the enzymatically active gtfi  gene products and extracellular enzyme was characterized. this enzyme produced water-insoluble glucans and glucan-forming activity was stimulated by the addition of dextrant10. when this integrant was grown in todd-hewitt broth supplemented with sucrose, the integrant adhered to the glass surface in vitro and this integrant exhibited the different colony morphology on mitis-salivarius  agar plates compared to s. sobrinus and s. anginosus. these observations strongly suggest that the construction of s. anginosus integrant expressing s. sobrinus gtfi gene using this transformation system may be an effective means of analysis  of cariogenic biofilm formation.

AB  == objectives: to analyse the culture results of heart valves removed following streptococcal endocarditis in order to gain insight into the duration of treatment required for valve sterilization. patients and methods: retrospective review of 131 episodes of streptococcal endocarditis: 94 due to alpha-haemolytic  streptococci; 15 due to beta-haemolytic streptococci; 10 due to nutritionally deficient streptococci; eight due to the streptococcus anginosus group and four due to streptococcus pneumoniae. patients had their valves removed during antimicrobial treatment. culture results were analysed with respect to duration of treatment before surgery. results: for alpha-haemolytic streptococci, 17 (18%) valves were culture-positive and 77 (82%) culture-negative after a median (range) of 4 (1-20) and 16 (4-58) days of treatment, respectively, p < 0.001. for beta-haemolytic streptococci, two valves (13%) were culture-positive; both patients had received < or = 4 days of treatment. four patients (40%) with nutritionally deficient streptococci were culture-positive, and had received < or = 8 days of treatment. for the s. anginosus group, two valves (25%) were culture-positive; both patients had received < or = 4 days of treatment before operation. overall, only one of 131 (0.8%) valves was culture-positive after 14 days of treatment. all valves infected with beta-haemolytic streptococci, nutritionally deficient streptococci and the s. anginosus group, who were treated for more than 8 days before surgery, were culture-negative. conclusions: our findings support current treatment guidelines for endocarditis caused by alpha-haemolytic streptococci. we suggest that the recommended duration of treatment for endocarditis resulting from other streptococci may be excessive and treatment trials evaluating 2 and 4 week regimens are justified.

TI  == invasive group b streptococcal disease in infants: a 19-year nationwide study. serotype distribution, incidence and recurrent infection.
AB  == during the period 1984-2002, 472 cases of invasive group b streptococcal (gbs) disease in infants aged 0-90 days in denmark were registered. the overall incidence was 0.4/1000 live births. most infants (73%) had early-onset gbs infection with 53% registered within the first day. serotype iii predominated (59%) with other serotypes as follows: ia (16%), ib (8%), nt (7%), ii (6%), other serotypes (5%). recurrence of gbs infection was registered in six infants, and the interval with no antibiotic therapy varied from 2 to 39 days. the serotypes of the isolates obtained from first and second episodes were identical (serotype  iii in five, and serotype ia in one infant). paired isolates were indistinguishable by pfge and antibiotic susceptibility testing. invasive gbs infections in infants are still a problem in denmark, and recurrent infections are registered in 1% of these infants.

TI  == streptococcus sinensis may react with lancefield group f antiserum.
AB  == lancefield group f streptococci have been found almost exclusively as members of  the 'streptococcus milleri' group, although they have been reported very occasionally in some other streptococcal species. among 302 patients with bacteraemia caused by viridans streptococci over a 6-year period, three cases were caused by streptococcus sinensis (type strain hku4t, hku5 and hku6). all three patients had infective endocarditis complicating their underlying chronic rheumatic heart diseases. gene sequencing showed no base differences between the  16s rrna gene sequences of hku5 and hku6 and that of hku4t. all three strains were gram-positive, non-spore-forming cocci arranged in chains. all grew on sheep blood agar as alpha-haemolytic, grey colonies of 0.5-1 mm in diameter after 24 h  incubation at 37 degrees c in ambient air. lancefield grouping revealed that hku5 and hku6 were lancefield group f, but hku4t was non-groupable with lancefield groups a, b, c, d, f or g antisera. hku4t was identified by the vitek system (gpi), api system (20 strep) and atb system (id32 strep) as 99 % streptococcus intermedius, 51.3 % s. intermedius and 99.9 % streptococcus anginosus, respectively. using the same tests, hku5 was identified as 87 % streptococcus sanguinis/streptococcus gordonii, 59 % streptococcus salivarius and 99.6 % s. anginosus, respectively, and hku6 as 87 % s. sanguinis/s. gordonii, 77 % streptococcus pneumoniae and 98.3 % s. anginosus, respectively. the present data  revealed that a proportion of lancefield group f streptococci could be s. sinensis. lancefield group f streptococci should not be automatically reported as 's. milleri'.

TI  == alkali-resistant bacteria in root canal systems.
AB  == the aim of this study was to isolate and identify alkali-resistant bacteria from  the dentin of infected root canals. bacteria from homogenized dentin powder made  up from infected root canal walls from human teeth were cultured on buffer-enriched brain heart infusion agar supplemented with 4% sheep blood (bhi-blood agar), adjusted to ph 7.0, 9.0 or 10.0. incubation took place for 7 days at 37 degrees c in an anaerobic glove box. bacterial strains selected according to colony and morphology were subcultured in buffer-enriched bhi broth  adjusted to ph 9.0, 10.0 or 11.0 to confirm their growth as alkali-resistant bacteria. polymerase chain reaction amplification using specific primer sets and  16s rdna sequence analysis was performed for identification of alkali-resistant isolates. in the present study, 37 teeth extracted from 37 patients were used for preparation of the dentin powder samples. bacteria were detected in 25 samples when standard bhi-blood agars (ph 7.0) were used. of these, 29 strains from 15 samples were alkali resistant, 25 strains growing at ph 9.0 and 4 at ph 10.0. the alkali-resistant strains included enterococcus faecium (10 strains) and enterococcus faecalis (2 strains), enterobacter cancerogenus (1 strains), fusobacterium nucleatum (1 strains), klebsiella ornithinolytica (2 strains), lactobacillus rhamnosus (2 strains), streptococcus anginosus (2 strains), streptococcus constellatus (3 strains), and streptococcus mitis (2 strains). three strains were also identified as bacteria of genus firmicutes or staphylococcus at the genus level. the present study showed that many bacterial species in infected root canal dentin were alkali-resistant at ph 9.0 and/or ph 10.0, and belonged mainly to the genus enterococcus.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to survey the prevalence of streptococcal species,  especially streptococcus anginosus (which has been reported to be associated with cancer in the upper digestive tract), streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus intermedius in the saliva of different age groups. a sequence analysis of 16s rdna was performed and dna quantified using real-time polymerase  chain reaction. the s. anginosus level increased with age, whereas the levels of  s. constellatus and s. intermedius did not change. streptococcus mitis was the predominant species in the saliva of all the age groups but, unlike the s. anginosus, the proportion of s. mitis in the salivary bacteria decreased with age. the increase in s. anginosus with age should be carefully monitored because  of its association with diseases, including cancer.

TI  == bacterial risk and sperm cryopreservation.
AB  == prior to sperm cryopreservation, french guidelines only recommend viral screening for serological status towards human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis b and c viruses and treponema palidum. the probability of semen infection by other bacterial pathogens is not taken into consideration by the current recommendations. the objective of the present study was to evaluate this risk and a strategy to reduce it prospectively. ninety-six patients consulting for sperm cryopreservation underwent a semen culture simultaneously to cryopreservation. the patients were classified into three groups following semen culture results: negative culture (group 1, 77/96, 80.2%), positive culture with saprophytic agents (group 2, 9/96, 9.4%) and positive culture with pathogen agents (group 3,  10/96, 10.4%). for six patients of the latter group showing a genital infection with ureaplasma urealyticum, a discontinuous gradient selection performed on the  cryopreserved sample was efficient to discard bacteria. these data emphasize the  usefulness to cultivate semen simultaneously to cryopreservation and demonstrate  the ability to remove some microbial agents from semen before its use in assisted reproductive techniques.

TI  == clinical and microbiological changes associated with the use of combined antimicrobial therapies to treat "refractory" periodontitis.
AB  == background: the present investigation examined clinical and microbial changes after a combined aggressive antimicrobial therapy in subjects identified as "refractory" to conventional periodontal therapy. method: fourteen subjects were  identified as "refractory" based on full-mouth mean attachment loss and/or >3 sites with attachment loss > or =3 mm following scaling and root planing (srp), periodontal surgery and systemic antibiotics. after baseline monitoring, subjects received srp, locally delivered tetracycline at pockets > or =4 mm, systemically  administered amoxicillin (500 mg, t.i.d. for 14 days)+metronidazole (250 mg, t.i.d. for 14 days) and professional removal of supragingival plaque weekly for 3 months. subjects were monitored clinically every 3 months post-therapy for 2 years. subgingival plaque samples were taken at the same time points from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. mean levels of each species were averaged within a subject at each visit. significance of changes in clinical and  microbiological parameters over time were evaluated using the friedman or wilcoxon signed ranks test. results: on average, subjects showed significant improvements in all clinical parameters after therapy. mean (+/-sem) full-mouth pocket depth reduction was 0.83+/-0.13 mm and mean attachment level "gain" was 0.44+/-0.12 at 24 months. clinical improvement was accompanied by major reductions in multiple subgingival species during the first 3 months of active therapy that were maintained for most species to the last monitoring visit. reductions occurred for three actinomyces species, "orange complex" species including campylobacter showae, eubacterium nodatum, three fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia as well as the "streptococcus milleri" group, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedus. subjects differed in their response to therapy; six modest response subjects exhibited less attachment level gain and were characterized by reductions in the microbiota from baseline to 3 months, but re-growth of many species thereafter. conclusions: the combined antibacterial therapy was successful in controlling disease progression in 14 "refractory" periodontitis subjects for 2 years.

TI  == frequent and preferential infection of treponema denticola, streptococcus mitis,  and streptococcus anginosus in esophageal cancers.
AB  == multiple cancers frequently occur in the upper digestive tract. one possible explanation is that specific bacterial infection stimulates the normal epithelium to initiate inflammation and/or promotes carcinogenesis. this study was undertaken to determine which bacterial species is predominantly associated with  esophageal cancer. we examined the bacterial diversity in this type of cancer and in the saliva from healthy people by using a culture-independent molecular method. here we report the preferential and frequent infection of the oral periodontopathic spirochete treponema denticola (t. denticola), streptococcus mitis (s. mitis), and streptococus anginosus (s. anginosus) in esophageal cancer  from different regions of the world, and we also describe the induction of inflammatory cytokines by infection of s. anginosus and s. mitis. our present data suggest that these three bacteria could have significant roles in the carcinogenic process of many cases of esophageal cancer by causing inflammation and by promoting the carcinogenic process, and that eradication of these three bacteria may decrease the risk of recurrence.

TI  == streptococcus milleri group bacteraemia in north yorkshire, england (1989-2000).
AB  == background & objectives: though carriage and local infection with organisms of the streptococcus milleri group (smg) are regular in clinical practice, bacteraemia is infrequent in man. the objective of the present study was to give  an account of our experience with the smg bacteraemia over a period of 12 yr in north yorkshire. methods: the laboratory and clinical records of all clinically significant cases of smg bacteraemia in our district general hospital catchment (combined population 260,000) were reviewed for the 12 yr period from 1989 to 2000. viable isolates were recovered, species identified, and minimum inhibitory  concentration (mic) determined. results: twenty nine episodes of infection gave an annual incidence of 0.93 cases per 100,000 population. infections included abscess, pneumonia, septic arthritis, genital and urinary tract infections, endocarditis and diffuse septicaemia. patient ages ranged from 18 to 90 yr but most patients were elderly, 82 per cent had evident predisposing conditions and mortality rate was 10 per cent. species determination of the 22 isolates showed s. anginosus (64%), s. constellatus (27%) and s. intermedius (9%). nearly all isolates were non-haemolytic and lancefield grouping showed carriage of the f antigen (in 41%), c (14%) and no detected group (45%). most of the isolates were  susceptible to the antimicrobials tested. interpretation & conclusion: bacteraemia with smg organisms was infrequent, often opportunistic and featured a low overall mortality rate. intra-abdominal sepsis was the local feature in 16 (55%) of the patients and 9 (31%) of the total patient group showed abscess or empyema. there was a low rate of antibiotic resistance in these organisms from bloodstream infection.

AB  == the feasibility of sequence analysis of the 16s-23s ribosomal dna (rdna) intergenic spacer (its) for the identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci (vs) was evaluated. the its regions of 29 reference strains (11 species) of vs were amplified by pcr and sequenced. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis,  s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the its lengths (246 to 391 bp) and sequences were highly conserved among strains within a species. the intraspecies similarity scores for the its sequences ranged from 0.98 to 1.0, except for the score for s. gordonii strains.  the interspecies similarity scores for the its sequences varied from 0.31 to 0.93. phylogenetic analysis of the its regions revealed that evolution of the regions of some species of vs is not parallel to that of the 16s rrna genes. one  hundred six clinical isolates of vs were identified by the rapid id 32 strep system (biomerieux vitek, marcy l'etoile, france) and by its sequencing, and the  level of disagreement between the two methods was 18% (19 isolates). most isolates producing discrepant results could be unambiguously assigned to a specific species by their its sequences. the accuracy of using its sequencing for identification of vs was verified by 16s rdna sequencing for all strains except strains of s. oralis and s. mitis, which were difficult to differentiate by their 16s rdna sequences. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by its sequencing is reliable and could be used as an alternative accurate method for identification of vs.

TI  == identification of the anginosus group within the genus streptococcus using polymerase chain reaction.

TI  == "streptococcus milleri" endocarditis caused by streptococcus anginosus.
AB  == unlike other viridans streptococci, members of the "streptococcus milleri group"  are often associated with abscess formation, but are only rare causes of infective endocarditis. although it has been shown that almost all s. intermedius isolates and most s. constellatus isolates, but only 19% of s. anginosus isolates, were associated with abscess formation, no report has addressed the relative importance of the 3 species of the "s. milleri group" in infective endocarditis. during a 5-year period (april 1997 through march 2002), 6 cases of  "s. milleri" endocarditis (out of 377 cases of infective endocarditis), that fulfil the duke's criteria for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis, were encountered. all 6 "s. milleri" isolates were identified as s. anginosus by 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequencing. three patients had underlying chronic rheumatic heart disease and 1 was an iv drug abuser. five had monomicrobial bacteremia, and 1 had polymicrobial (s. anginosus, s. mitis, granulicatella adiacens, and slackia exigua) bacteremia. two patients died. none of the 6 isolates were identified by the vitek system (gpi) or the api system (20 strep) at >95% confidence. all 6 isolates were sensitive to penicillin g (mic 0.008-0.064 microg/ml), cefalothin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. accurate identification to the species level, by 16s rrna gene sequencing, in cases of bacteremia caused by members of the "s. milleri group", would have direct implication on the underlying disease process, hence guiding diagnosis and treatment. infective endocarditis should be actively looked for in cases of monomicrobial s. anginosus bacteremia, especially if the organism is recovered in multiple blood cultures.

TI  == rpob gene sequence-based identification of aerobic gram-positive cocci of the genera streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, abiotrophia, and granulicatella.
AB  == we developed a new molecular tool based on rpob gene (encoding the beta subunit of rna polymerase) sequencing to identify streptococci. we first sequenced the complete rpob gene for streptococcus anginosus, s. equinus, and abiotrophia defectiva. sequences were aligned with these of s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. pneumoniae available in genbank. using an in-house analysis program (svarap),  we identified a 740-bp variable region surrounded by conserved, 20-bp zones and,  by using these conserved zones as pcr primer targets, we amplified and sequenced  this variable region in an additional 30 streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, granulicatella, and abiotrophia species. this region exhibited 71.2 to 99.3% interspecies homology. we therefore applied our identification system by pcr amplification and sequencing to a collection of 102 streptococci and 60 bacterial isolates belonging to other genera. amplicons were obtained in streptococci and bacillus cereus, and sequencing allowed us to make a correct identification of streptococci. molecular signatures were determined for the discrimination of closely related species within the s. pneumoniae-s. oralis-s. mitis group and the s. agalactiae-s. difficile group. these signatures allowed us to design a s. pneumoniae-specific pcr and sequencing primer pair.

TI  == detection of streptococcus anginosus and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine in saliva.
AB  == several studies have demonstrated a close association between streptococcus (s.)  anginosus infection and head and neck cancer. accumulation of 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-ohdg), which may result from the continuous generation of reactive oxygen species associated with chronic inflammation, has been reported in human preneoplastic lesions and in cancerous tissues. the purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of s. anginosus and 8-ohdg in patients with periodontitis. salivary levels of s. anginosus were measured by real-time pcr. s. anginosus was detected in 28 out of  38 (73.7%) of subjects. the 8-ohdg level was significantly higher in patients positive for s. anginosus than in patients negative for the bacterium. a significant decrease in s. anginosus and 8-ohdg levels was observed after initial periodontal treatment. our findings indicate that, although the levels of s. anginosus are relatively low, there is a correlation between the salivary level of s. anginosus and 8-ohdg, and that periodontal treatment can decrease the levels of these hazard factors.

AB  == the nature in variation of the 16s rrna gene of members of the streptococcus anginosus group was investigated by hybridization and dna sequencing. a collection of 708 strains was analyzed by reverse line blot hybridization. this revealed the presence of distinct reaction patterns representing 11 different hybridization groups. the 16s rrna genes of two strains of each hybridization group were sequenced to near-completion, and the sequence data confirmed the reverse line blot hybridization results. closer inspection of the sequences revealed mosaic-like structures, strongly suggesting horizontal transfer of segments of the 16s rrna gene between different species belonging to the streptococcus anginosus group. southern blot hybridization further showed that within a single strain all copies of the 16s rrna gene had the same composition,  indicating that the apparent mosaic structures were not pcr-induced artifacts. these findings indicate that the highly conserved rrna genes are also subject to  recombination and that these events may be fixed in the population. such recombination may lead to the construction of incorrect phylogenetic trees based  on the 16s rrna genes.

TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

AB  == streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus intermedius, commonly referred to as the streptococcus anginosus group (sag), are commensal organisms known for their propensity to cause purulent infections which are difficult to eradicate. in this study, we determined the genetic similarities between sag isolates consecutively recovered from single patients to assess the duration of infection or colonization. a total of 97 sag isolates recovered from  30 patients were included; 65 (67.0%) of the isolates were abscess related. the isolates were identified by the 16s rrna reverse line blot hybridization assay as s. anginosus (n = 34), s. constellatus (n = 55), and s. intermedius (n = 8). amplified fragment length polymorphism (aflp) analysis of the sag isolates produced discriminatory and reproducible patterns. consecutive sag isolates with  identical aflp types were found in 27 of 30 (90.0%) patients, and consecutive isolates with only a single aflp type were demonstrated in 21 (70.0%) patients. the median delay between the times of recovery of the first and last isolates of  identical aflp types from each patient was 36 days, and this delay extended for more than 1 year in patients with both colonizing and abscess-related sag isolates. in six bacteremic patients, paired blood and nonblood sag isolates showed identical aflp types.

TI  == different frequencies of streptococcus anginosus infection in oral cancer and esophageal cancer.
AB  == multiple cancers frequently occur in the upper aerodigestive tract. the high incidence rate of multiple carcinomas in this region is often explained in terms  of involvement of the same underlying risk factors. it has been reported that the oral bacterium streptococcus anginosus (s. anginosus) is associated with esophageal, gastric, and pharyngeal cancer tissues. in this study, a highly specific quantification method for s. anginosus dna using real-time pcr was established. we employed this assay to determine whether s. anginosus is also associated with oral cancer tissues. this precise quantification method revealed  different degrees of infection with s. anginosus in esophageal cancer and oral cancer. we assayed 10 ng of genomic dna from cancer tissues, and found that eight of 18 samples (44%) from the esophagus contained a detectable level (>10 fg) of s. anginosus dna, whereas this was the case for only five of 38 samples (13%) of  oral cancer. the quantity of s. anginosus dna in the esophageal cancer tissues was significantly higher than in oral cancer. the maximum amount of s. anginosus  dna was approximately ten times higher in esophageal than in oral cancer tissues. in addition, none of the five different oral cancer sites (floor of the mouth, mandibular gingival, maxillary gingival, buccal mucosal, and tongue) showed significant signs of s. anginosus infection. on the other hand, most non-cancerous tissues of the esophagus and tongue showed an undetectable level of s. anginosus. these results suggest that s. anginosus is associated with esophageal cancer, but is not closely related with oral cancer.

AB  == a gene (cgs) encoding cystathionine gamma-synthase was cloned from streptococcus  anginosus, and its protein was purified and characterized. the cgs gene and the immediately downstream lcd gene were shown to be cotranscribed as an operon. high-performance liquid chromatography analyses showed that the s. anginosus cgs  not only has cystathionine gamma-synthase activity, but also expresses o-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase activity. these results suggest that s. anginosus has the capacity to utilize both the transsulfuration and direct sulfhydrylation pathways for homocysteine biosynthesis.

TI  == [a case of a bacterial brain abscess presenting as symptoms of 'sudden stroke-like' onset].
AB  == we report a case of a bacterial brain abscess presenting symptoms of 'sudden stroke-like' onset, associated with infective endocarditis. a 59-year-old woman experienced a sudden stroke-like onset of left hemiplegia. computed tomography (ct) and magnetic resonance imaging (mri) were performed on the day of ictus. no  lesion responsible for the symptom was seen on either ct or a t2 weighted image (t2wi), but a diffusion-weighted image (dwi) revealed focal increased signal intensity in the right frontal lobe. an initial diagnosis of acute embolic infarction associated with infective endocarditis was made. although the patient's neurological state had been stable, motor paresis of her left extremities became worse starting one month after her admission. mri with gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepenta-acid (gd-dtpa) at 37 days after admission showed an irregular-shaped ring-enhancement lesion located at the same place as the initial infarction, and in the left frontal lobe. surgical drainage of the lesion in the right frontal lobe was performed, and diagnosed as a bacterial abscess. the exact mechanism of a bacterial brain abscess presenting with 'sudden stroke-like' onset is unknown, but various hypotheses have been proposed. one is  that paroxysmal septic emboli lead to abscess formation within or near the area of embolic infarction. our case showed that the creation of a brain abscess followed embolic strokes, and that this hypothesis was demonstrated by mri carried out on the day of ictus.

TI  == subdural empyema.
AB  == subdural empyema represents loculated infection between the outermost layer of the meninges, the dura, and the arachnoid. the empyema may develop intracranially or in the spinal canal. intracranial subdural empyema is most frequently a complication of sinusitis or, less frequently, otitis or neurosurgical procedures. spinal subdural empyema is rare and may result from hematogenous infection or spread of infection from osteomyelitis. the most common organisms in intracranial subdural empyema are anaerobic and microaerophilic streptococci, in  particular those of the streptococcus milleri group (s. milleri and streptococcus anginosus). staphylococcus aureus is present in a minority of cases, and multiple additional organisms, including gram-negative organisms, such as escherichia coli, and anaerobic organisms, such as bacteroides, may be present. pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus epidermidis may be present in cases related to neurosurgical procedures, and salmonella species have been detected in patients with advanced aids; multiple organisms may be present simultaneously. spinal subdural empyemas are almost invariably caused by streptococci or by s. aureus. subdural empyema--whether it occurs in the skull or the spinal canal--may cause rapid compression of the brain or spinal cord, and represents an extreme medical  and neurosurgical emergency. the diagnostic procedure of choice for intracranial  and spinal subdural empyema is mri with gadolinium enhancement. computed tomography scan may miss intracranial subdural empyemas detectable by mri. conversely, occasion spinal subdural empyemas may be detected by ct myelography where mri is negative. treatment in virtually all cases of intracranial or spinal subdural empyema requires prompt surgical drainage and antibiotic therapy. pus from the empyema should always be sent for anaerobic, as well as aerobic, culture. because intracranial subdural empyemas may contain multiple organisms, provisional antibiotic therapy of intracranial subdural empyema, where the organism is unknown, should be directed against s. aureus, microaerophilic and anaerobic streptococci, and gram-negative organisms. antibiotics should include 1) nafcillin, oxacillin, or vancomycin; plus 2) a third generation cephalosporin; plus 3) metronidazole. provisional antibiotic therapy of spinal subdural empyemas should be directed against s. aureus and streptococci, and should include nafcillin, oxacillin, or vancomycin. morbidity and mortality in intracranial and  spinal subdural empyema relate directly to the delay in institution of therapy. both conditions should, thus, be treated with great urgency.

TI  == correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult sudanese.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult sudanese. whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva  and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. there were significantly ( p< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, veillonella parvula, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus salivarius, and leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( p< or =0.01) lower percentages with treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. the detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for selenomonas sputigena, s. anginosus, streptococcus sanguis, and s. salivarius and significantly lower for porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( p< or =0.01). porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, s. sputigena, s. sanguis, and streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( p< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. this study indicates that the levels of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, s.  sanguis, and s. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and  subgingival plaque.

TI  == lcd from streptococcus anginosus encodes a c-s lyase with alpha,beta-elimination  activity that degrades l-cysteine.
AB  == hydrogen sulfide is highly toxic to mammalian cells. it has also been postulated  that hydrogen sulfide modifies haemoglobin resulting in haemolysis. the enzyme that produces hydrogen sulfide from l-cysteine was purified from streptococcus anginosus. using the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme, the lcd gene encoding l-cysteine desulfhydrase was cloned; the recombinant protein was then purified to examine its enzymic and biological characteristics. this l-cysteine desulfhydrase had the michaelis-menten kinetics k(m)=0.62 mm and v(max)=163 micro mol min(-1) mg(-1). dl-cystathionine, l-cystine, s-(2-aminoethyl)-l-cysteine, 3-chloro-dl-alanine and s-methyl-l-cysteine were substrates for the enzyme, whereas d-cysteine, dl-homocysteine, l-methionine, dl-serine, dl-alanine, l-cysteine methyl ester, l-tryptophan, l-tyrosine and l-phenylalanine were not. these findings suggest that this l-cysteine desulfhydrase is a c-s lyase that catalyses the alpha,beta-elimination (alphac-n  and betac-s) reaction. in addition, it is demonstrated that the hydrogen sulfide  produced by this enzyme caused the modification and release of haemoglobin in sheep erythrocytes.

TI  == differences in the betac-s lyase activities of viridans group streptococci.
AB  == betac-s lyase catalyzes the alpha,beta-elimination of l-cysteine to hydrogen sulfide, which is one of the main causes of oral malodor and is highly toxic to mammalian cells. we evaluated the capacity of six species of oral streptococci to produce hydrogen sulfide. the crude enzyme extract from streptococcus anginosus had the greatest capacity. however, comparative analysis of amino acid sequences  did not detect any meaningful differences in the s. anginosus betac-s lyase. the  capacity of s. anginosus purified betac-s lyase to degrade l-cysteine was also extremely high, while its capacity to degrade l-cystathionine was unremarkable. these findings suggest that the extremely high capacity of s. anginosus to produce hydrogen sulfide is due to the unique characteristic of betac-s lyase from that organism.

TI  == anogenital bacteriology in non-abused preschool children: a descriptive study of  the aerobic genital flora and the isolation of anogenital gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == the purpose of the study is to describe the genital aerobic bacterial flora including gardnerella vaginalis in girls and the occurrence of anal g. vaginalis  in both genders. from a group of 3773 children, 278 (99 boys and 179 girls) with  a mean age of 5.63 y (range: 5.13-6.73) were recruited. inclusion in the study was based on self-selection, whereby parents who did not suspect any occurrence of sexual abuse of their child gave informed consent to participate. several mechanisms were undertaken to exclude abused children. at least one bacterial species was isolated from the genitals of 59 (33.9%) girls. most isolates (39 out of 99) were bacteria representing skin flora (staphylococci and coryneform organisms), with viridans streptococci and related organisms as the second most common group of isolates (31 out of 99). s. anginosus was the single most frequent bacterial species identified (17 isolates). streptococcus pyogenes was isolated from the genitals of two girls, streptococcus pneumoniae from one girl and haemophilus influenzae from eight girls. g. vaginalis was not isolated from the genitals in any girl, but the organism was isolated from the anal canal in three children.

TI  == microbial profile on metallic and ceramic bracket materials.
AB  == the placement of orthodontic appliances creates a favorable environment for the accumulation of a microbiota and food residues, which, in time, may cause caries  or exacerbate any pre-existing periodontal disease. the purpose of the present study was to compare the total bacterial counts present on metallic and ceramic orthodontic brackets in order to clarify which bracket type has a higher plaque retaining capacity and to determine the levels of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp on both types of brackets. thirty-two metallic brackets and 24  ceramic brackets were collected from orthodontic patients at the day of debonding. two brackets were collected from each patient; one from a maxillary central incisor and another from a maxillary second premolar. sixteen patients who used metallic brackets and 12 patients who used ceramic brackets were sampled. bacterial populations were studied using "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization, which uses dna probes to identify species in complex microbial samples. the significance of differences between groups was determined using the  mann-whitney u-test. results showed no significant differences between metallic and ceramic brackets with respect to the caries-inducing s mutans and l acidophilus spp counts. mean counts of 8 of 35 additional species differed significantly between metallic and ceramic brackets with no obvious pattern favoring one bracket type over the other. this study showed higher mean counts of treponema denticola, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii, streptococcus anginosus, and eubacterium nodatum on metallic brackets while higher counts of eikenella corrodens, campylobacter showae, and selenomonas noxia were found on ceramic brackets.

AB  == viridans streptococci, including streptococcus anginosus, are a common cause of infective endocarditis in humans. adherence mechanisms involved in colonization of non-diseased native valves (present in 40% of native valve endocarditis) are unknown. we have previously shown that an endocarditis isolate of s. anginosus adheres to exposed basement membrane of human and porcine valve tissue in a laminin dependent manner. we now describe the partial purification of an 80 kda putative laminin binding protein (plbp) by biochemical methods. amino acid sequence of plbp peptides is similar to substrate binding proteins of abc transporters in other gram-positive cocci.

TI  == streptococcus anginosus adheres to vascular endothelium basement membrane and purified extracellular matrix proteins.
AB  == the mechanisms of bacterial adherence in the initial stages of native valve endocarditis are unclear, especially in patients without valve disease or the presence of a platelet-fibrin thrombus. extracellular matrix may act as a ligand  in areas of exposed basement membrane on the endothelial monolayer. in this study, adherence of 55 clinical blood and 21 oral viridans streptococcal isolates was examined using purified extracellular matrix compounds. the majority of blood and oral isolates exhibited adherence to purified laminin, fibronectin, and fibrinogen, with lesser adherence to type i and iv collagens. adherence to laminin and fibronectin was concentration dependent, saturable, and competitively inhibited with soluble ligand. a streptococcus anginosus isolate and other viridans strains exhibiting a strong laminin adherence phenotype bound extensively to the endothelial aspect of human and porcine valve tissue sections  and were inhibited by soluble laminin and anti-laminin antibody fragments. using  a novel native porcine valve explant adherence model, we localized binding to areas of exposed basement membrane by confocal and scanning electron microscopy.  these studies support the hypothesis that bacterial adherence to exposed basement membrane plays a role in the initial phase of native valve endocarditis.

TI  == identification of viridans streptococcal species causing bacterial meningitis in  adults in taiwan.
AB  == in order to determine the species responsible for viridans-group streptococcal meningitis in adults in taiwan, seven cases of culture-proven meningitis due to these organisms were studied. the cases were all identified at the chang gung memorial hospital-kaohsiung over a period of 3 years, and they accounted for 9% (7/78) of all cases of culture-proven bacterial meningitis occurring in adults during this period. of the seven viridans streptococci isolates recovered, streptococcus constellatus accounted for four, streptococcus anginosus for two, and streptococcus oralis for one. thus, it appears that streptococci of the milleri group are the most common species causing bacterial meningitis in adults  in taiwan. the tendency for these organisms to cause invasive central nervous system infections in adults should not be overlooked when these species are recovered from cerebrospinal fluid specimens.

AB  == objectives: the purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult sudanese subjects. material and methods: the study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. the periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using whole genomic dna probes. results: a high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or =  105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. between 12% and 16%  of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, c. rectus and e. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, respectively. there were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. presence of > or = 105 l. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). there were significantly higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, c. rectus, p. micros, v. parvula, s. mutans, s. anginosus, a. israelii, c. sputigena, and c. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, e. corrodens, l. acidophilus, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. oralis, and s. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. conclusions: : the findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. this is the first report that the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.

TI  == competence without a competence pheromone in a natural isolate of streptococcus infantis.
AB  == many streptococcal species belonging to the mitis and anginosus phylogenetic groups are known to be naturally competent for genetic transformation. induction  of the competent state in these bacteria is regulated by a quorum-sensing mechanism consisting of a secreted peptide pheromone encoded by comc and a two-component regulatory system encoded by comde. here we report that a natural isolate of a mitis group streptococcus (atu-4) is competent for genetic transformation even though it has lost the gene encoding the competence pheromone. in contrast to other strains, induction of competence in atu-4 is not  regulated by cell density, since highly diluted cultures of this strain are still competent. interestingly, competence in the atu-4 strain is lost if the gene encoding the response regulator come is disrupted, demonstrating that this component of the quorum-sensing apparatus is still needed for competence development. these results indicate that mutations in comd or come have resulted  in a gain-of-function phenotype that allows competence without a competence pheromone. a highly similar strain lacking comc was isolated independently from another individual, suggesting that strains with this phenotype are able to survive in nature in competition with wild-type strains.

TI  == streptococcus sinensis sp. nov., a novel species isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis.
AB  == a bacterium was isolated from the blood culture of a patient with infective endocarditis. the cells were facultative anaerobic, nonsporulating, gram-positive cocci arranged in chains. the bacterium grows on sheep blood agar as alpha-hemolytic, gray colonies of 0.5 to 1 mm in diameter after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees c in ambient air. growth also occurs in 10 or 40% bile and on bile esculin agar but not in 6% nacl. no enhancement of growth is observed in 5% co(2). it is nongroupable with lancefield groups a, b, c, d, f, or g antisera and is resistant to optochin and bacitracin. the organism is aflagellated and is nonmotile at both 25 and 37 degrees c. it is voges-proskauer  test positive. it produces leucine arylamidase and beta-glucosidase but not catalase, urease, lysine decarboxylase, or ornithine decarboxylase. it hydrolyzes esculin and arginine. it utilizes glucose, lactose, salicin, sucrose, pullulan, trehalose, cellobiose, hemicellulase, mannose, maltose, and starch. 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that there were 3.6, 3.7, 4.3, 4.7, and 5.9% differences between the 16s rrna gene sequence of the bacterium and those of streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus anginosus, respectively. the g+c content of it (mean plus minus standard deviation) was 53.0% plus minus 2.9%. based on phylogenetic affiliation, it belongs to the mitis or anginosus group of streptococcus. for these reasons a new species, streptococcus sinensis sp. nov., is proposed, for which hku4 is the type strain. further studies should be performed to ascertain the potential of this bacterium to become an emerging cause of infective endocarditis.

TI  == rapid identification of streptococcus intermedius by pcr with the ily gene as a species marker gene.
AB  == streptococcus intermedius belongs to the anginosus group of streptococci (ags) and is associated with endogenous infections leading to abscesses in the oral cavity and at deepseated sites, such as the brain and liver. two other species, s. anginosus and s. constellatus, and some presently unnamed taxa, are also classified as ags. recently, s. constellatus subsp. pharyngis, a new subspecies with biochemical characteristics similar to s. intermedius, was described with the potential for causing confusion when trying to identify isolates of these two species routinely with commercial identification kits, such as rapid id32 strep and fluo-card milleri. to correctly identify s. intermedius, this study attempted to develop an accurate pcr identification system with the ily gene as a species marker. this approach relies on amplification of an 819-bp fragment of the ily gene and its 3'-flanking region and is shown here to be specific for s. intermedius strains among all other streptococcal species. moreover, this pcr system was applicable in direct rapid pcr with whole bacterial cells and takara z-taq (takara), a highly efficient dna polymerase, as the template and dna amplification enzyme, respectively.

AB  == streptococcus constellatus, s. intermedius, and s. anginosus, the 3 species of the s. milleri group, form part of the normal flora commonly found in the mouth,  throat, and gastrointestinal and genital tracts. this group has become known as an important pathogen in infections and abscesses, but data on the anatomical distribution of these species is lacking in relation to clinical significance. we obtained 275 strains of the s. milleri group from different departments at our hospital over the last 3 years, including 54 strains from dental surgery, 47 from internal medicine, 44 from otolaryngology (head and neck), 43 from surgery, 32 from gynecology, 17 from urology, 16 from dermatology, 11 from brain surgery, 6 from pediatrics, 3 from orthopedics, and 2 from opthalmology. the 44 strains from head and neck were found in 42 patients,--23 with primary infection and 19 with secondary infection induced by cancer treatments. the primary infection group included 4 deep neck abscesses, 1 peritonsillar abscess, 5 tonsillitis, 4 paranasal sinusitis, 3 congenital aural fistula infections, 2 dental infections,  2 paranasal sinus cysts, 1 supprative parotitis, and 1 postoperative wound infection. the secondary infection group included 7 postoperative wound infections, 3 postoperative pulmonary infections, 3 laryngitis and pharyngitis, 3 terminal pneumonias, and 3 infections of the local recurrence site. the s. milleri group was the only isolated organism in 13 cases (56.5%) of primary infection and in 5 (26.3%) of secondary infection. among other organisms from the primary infection group, no so-called major pathogens were found. antimicrobial susceptibility tests of the s. milleri group showed that 50% were resistant to ccl and 33% to ctm. abpc, cpdx, and cfdn were also found to be less sensitive, although no resistant strains were detected. to adequately culture the s. milleri group, incubation in air containing carbon dioxide or in an anaerobic atmosphere  is required, and differentiation of the 3 requires biochemical reactivity tests.  since not all facilities use identical techniques in routine bacteriological examination, a considerable number of the s. milleri group could be missed in unknown species of alpha-,beta-, and gamma-streptococci and culture-negative cases. with antibiotics now being used widely, normal flora such as the s. milleri group may have become an important pathogen in head and neck infections due to an imbalance between organisms and host defense.

AB  == streptococci strains of the anginosus group isolated from various oral and maxillofacial infections (omf) were screened for their susceptibility to the following antimicrobial agents: benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, cephalothin, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, cefuroxime, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, vancomycin and trimethoprime-sulphamethoxazole. the isolates were susceptable to: clindamycin, chloramphenicol, vancomycin and all beta-lactam antibiotics, except ceftazidime to which 54.5% of the strains showed intermediate susceptibility. intermediate susceptibility to tetracycline was found in 11.3% of the strains, whereas resistance to the same antibiotic was  demonstrated in 61.4%. resistance to erythromycin and trimethoprime-sulphamethoxazole was of 2.3% for both. in conclusion, penicillin is the drug of choice in infections caused by streptococci of the anginosus group.

TI  == streptococci species of anginosus group isolated from oral and maxillofacial infections.
AB  == the aim of the study was to isolate and identify at species level streptococci strains of anginosus group in pus samples collected from 110 patients with oral and maxillofacial (omf) infections. gram-stained smears and cultures on selective and nonselective media were done from each of the 111 pus samples (2 samples were collected from one of the patients, who presented 2 oral abscesses at the same time). the isolates were identified on the basis of cultural and biochemical characteristics. speciation of the anginosus group isolates was performed using the rapid id 32 strep system (bio merieux, france). fourty-four anginosus group strains were isolated from 42 patients. fourty of these isolates were identified  as streptococcus anginosus (2 nonidentical isolates were found in 2 patients), 3  isolates as streptococcus constellatus and only one as streptococcus intermedius. the study confirmed that the anginosus group is often involved in omf infections  alone or in association with other aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria. in the investigated cases, streptococcus anginosus was by far the most frequently isolated species within the anginosus group.

TI  == phenotypic characterization of some anginosus group isolates from oral and maxillofacial infections.
AB  == the aim of this study was to briefly characterize serologically, biochemically and from the cultural point of view some anginosus group isolates found in pus samples collected from patients with oral and maxillofacial infections. cultural  characterization was done by studying the culture odor, the colony size and aspect, and hemolysis type on columbia bood agar (ba). lancefield grouping was made on cards using the rapid latex-agglutination test (slidex strepto-kit, bio merieux, france). the biochemical characterization was performed at the same time with the speciation by the rapid id 32 strep system (bio merieux, marcy-l'etoile, france). the anginosus group isolates were phenotypically heterogenic. based on phenotypic description, nonidentical anginosus group isolates were found in the same patient sample.

TI  == interaction between human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and streptococcus milleri  group bacteria.
AB  == because streptococcus milleri group (smg) bacteria--streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus intermedius, and streptococcus anginosus--exhibit a striking propensity to cause abscesses, the interaction of these organisms with human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmnl) was examined. after incubation in pooled normal human serum, smg stimulated less chemotaxis than did staphylococcus aureus, in contrast to viridans streptococci, which caused greater chemotaxis than did s. aureus. pmnl ingested greater numbers of smg and viridans streptococci than s. aureus but killed these organisms more slowly and less completely. relative resistance to killing by pmnl is expected in organisms that  cause abscesses, and inhibition of chemotaxis may contribute to pathogenicity, because delayed arrival of pmnl gives a head start to proliferating bacteria. this study helps explain the capacity of smg to cause abscesses. it is unclear, however, why viridans streptococci, bacteria that rarely produce abscesses, share some of these same properties.

TI  == antigenic characterisation of a novel streptococcus anginosus antigen that induces nitric oxide synthesis by murine peritoneal exudate cells.
AB  == a novel antigen that induces nitric oxide (no) synthesis by murine peritoneal exudate cells (pec) was prepared from a culture supernate of streptococcus anginosus nctc 10713 in dialysed medium by column chromatography with deae-sephacel followed by size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). a chemical analysis of the s. anginosus antigen (saa) revealed that it mainly consisted of carbohydrates (rhamnose, n-acetylglucosamine, glucose and galactose), smaller quantities of protein and a trace amount of phosphorus. the saa stimulated pec from c57bl/6n mice to produce no and accumulate induced no synthetase (inos) mrna in a dose-dependent manner, reaching a plateau with 10-30  microg/ml. furthermore, a reverse transcription-pcr assay revealed that saa 10 microg/ml could induce mrna accumulation of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (il)-1beta and il-6 as well as inos. in contrast, rantz-randall antigen (rra), a carbohydrate antigen prepared from the organisms, could not induce no synthesis or cause the accumulation of inos mrna, although cytokine production was observed after stimulation. the saa-induced no synthesis, but not  the cytokine production, was sensitive to heat. furthermore, an immunoblot analysis of saa indicated that the 43-kda protein band reacted with anti-saa but  not anti-rra antibodies. in immunodiffusion, saa reacted with both anti-saa and anti-rra antibodies, and the precipitin bands formed crossing lines, suggesting that saa could possess two different antigenic components--one that reacts specificially with anti-saa antibodies and another that has an identity similar to that of rra. taken together, saa, a novel antigen of s. anginosus, was found to induce no synthesis as well as produce inflammatory cytokines in murine pec. it is suggested that the protein molecule of saa may exclusively induce no synthesis, and its carbohydrate component(s) could have a relationship to cytokine production.

TI  == [clinical significance of the streptococcus milleri group in peritonsillar abscesses].
AB  == few researchers have microbiologically studied peritonsillar abscesses in detail, and their results have been conflicting. although streptococcus pyogenes (group a beta-streptococcus) is commonly considered an important pathogen in this infection, recent studies have demonstrated the recovery of many other streptococci mainly consisting of alpha-streptococci. few studies have identified these streptococci at the species level, however. we studied details of bacteriology in 31 cases of peritonsillar abscess treated between 1991 and 2000.  the streptococcus milleri group was most frequently isolated (25.8%), followed by eikenella corrodens (9.7%), staphylococcus aureus (6.5%), and s. pyogenes (3.2%). the s. milleri group, consisting of 3 species of streptococcus constellatus, s. intermedius, and s. anginosus, forms part of the normal flora most commonly found in the mouth, throat, gastrointestinal tract, and genital tract. these species have become known as an important pathogen in abscess disease but little attention has been paid to their role in peritonsillar abscesses. to adequately culture the s. milleri group, incubation in air containing carbon dioxide or in an anaerobic condition is required, and then the differentiation of the 3 species requires the biochemical reactivity tests. since hemolytic patterns of the s. milleri group vary, we studied the population of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-hemolytic strains among 36 strains of this group. we found 32 (88.8%) to be alpha-hemolytic. although not all alpha-hemolytic strains belong to the s. milleri group, a considerable number of this group could be missed among alpha-streptococci isolated from the peritonsillar abscess. as antibiotics began  being used widely, normal flora such as the s. milleri group may have become an important pathogen in peritonsillar abscesses due to an imbalance between organisms and host defense.

TI  == identification of the psaa gene, coding for pneumococcal surface adhesin a, in viridans group streptococci other than streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == the gene encoding the pneumococcal surface adhesin a (psaa) protein has been identified in three different viridans group streptococcal species. comparative studies of the psaa gene identified in different pneumococcal isolates by sequencing pcr products showed a high degree of conservation among these strains. psaa is encoded by an open reading frame of 930 bp. the analysis of this fragment in streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus anginosus strains revealed a sequence identity of 95, 94, and 90%, respectively, to the corresponding open reading frame of the previously reported streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 6b strain. our results confirm that psaa is present and detectable in heterologous bacterial species. the possible implications of these  results for the suitability and potential use of psaa in the identification and diagnosis of pneumococcal diseases are discussed.

TI  == infectious crystalline keratopathy in an immunosuppressed patient.
AB  == purpose: to report a case of infectious crystalline keratopathy (ick) in a patient with systemic malignancy on immunosuppressive chemotherapy. the patient wore frequent replacement contact lenses on an extended wear basis. methods: a 51-year-old female with carcinoma of the breast and systemic metastases was referred for a corneal ulcer. she received intravenous docetaxel, trastuzumab, and systemic dexamethasone. she wore frequent replacement acuvue lenses on an extended wear basis. her visual acuity was 20/200 in the right eye and 20/400 in  the left eye. the right eye examination revealed diffuse superficial punctate keratopathy. in the left eye, there was a 3.8 x 4.5 mm corneal infiltrate with projecting crystalline processes. corneal scrapings were performed for smears and cultures. treatment with topical fortified cefazolin and fortified tobramycin every hour around the clock was initiated. results: culture of the corneal scrapings grew streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus aureus. there was a good response to medical therapy. when last seen after 4 weeks of treatment, the  infiltrate measured about 1 mm and the visual acuity was 20/40 with pinhole. conclusions: systemic immunosuppression may be a predisposing factor for the development of ick. this case suggests that debilitated patients may be at risk for unusual infections and should be discouraged from overnight wear of contact lenses.

TI  == streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus anginosus ("streptococcus milleri group") are of different clinical importance and are not equally associated with abscess.
AB  == difficulties in distinguishing organisms of the "streptococcus milleri group" (smg; streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus anginosus), have caused ambiguity in determining their pathogenic potential. we reviewed 118 cases in which smg isolates had been identified using 16s rdna sequence. s. constellatus and s. anginosus were isolated far more frequently than was s. intermedius. nearly all isolates of s. intermedius and most isolates of s. constellatus, but only 19% of those of s. anginosus, were associated with abscess. our findings suggest that speciation of the smg may guide diagnostic evaluation, give insight into the possible role of coinfecting organisms, and help assess the need to search for occult abscess.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibilities of genetically characterized streptococcus milleri group strains.
AB  == previous studies of the antibiotic susceptibility of streptococcus milleri group  organisms have distinguished among species by using phenotypic techniques. using  44 isolates that were speciated by 16s rrna gene sequencing, we studied the mics  and minimum bactericidal concentrations of penicillin, ampicillin, ceftriaxone, and clindamycin for streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus anginosus. none of the organisms was resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, although a few isolates were intermediately resistant; one strain of s. anginosus was tolerant to ampicillin, and another was tolerant to ceftriaxone. six isolates were resistant to clindamycin, with representation from each of the  three species. relatively small differences in antibiotic susceptibilities among  species of the s. milleri group show that speciation is unlikely to be important  in selecting an antibiotic to treat infection caused by one of these isolates.

TI  == [clinical and bacteriological significance of the streptococcus milleri group in  deep neck abscesses].
AB  == streptococcus constellatus, s. intermedius, and s. anginosus, the three species of the s. milleri group, form part of the normal flora most commonly found in the mouth, throat, gastrointenstinal tract, and genital tract. the s. milleri group has become known as an important pathogen in abscess disease, but little attention has been paid to their role in deep neck abscesses. we have treated 9 patients with deep neck abscesses relating to the s. milleri group since 1991, and regarded this group as an important pathogen also in these abscesses. we studied the frequency of the s. milleri group isolated from deep neck abscesses in our cases and from the literature and discuss clinical significance and bacteriological pathogenesis. cases numbered 27 treated at our facility since 1991 and 200 cases reported in the japanese literature since 1990. of our 9 cases, 4 originated from acute pharyngitis, 3 from peritonsillar abscesses, and 2 from odontogenic infection. serious complications such as mediastinitis, cervical necrotizing fasciitis, sepsis accompanied by disseminated intravascular coagulation, and spondylitis of the cervical vertebrae were seen in 4 cases. among organisms isolated, the s. milleri group appeared to be a pathogen contributing to abscess formation and to serious complications. the genus streptococcus was most frequently isolated both in our 27 cases (66.7%) and the 200 in the literature (45.5%). among species of the genus streptococcus, the s. milleri group numbered the highest in our cases at 33.3% but only 8.5% in the literature. cases in the literature, however, contained many unknown species of streptococci--31.5% vs. 18.5% in our cases. alpha-streptococcus was frequently reported in the literature among unknown species of streptococci--36 of 63. culture-negative cases were also numbered more in the literature than in our case--29.0% vs. 18.5%. special conditions and procedures are required to suitably isolate and detect the s. milleri group. since not all facilities use identical techniques in routine bacteriological examination, a considerable number of the s. milleri group could be missed in unknown species of streptococci or alpha-streptococcus and culture-negative cases. the detailed pathogenesis of the  s. milleri group remains to be clarified. infection by normal flora on mucosa is  thought to occur due to an imbalance between organisms and host defense in deep neck abscesses. some strains of the s. milleri group have been reported to produce many tissue-destroying enzymes such as collagenase and hyaluronidase. the co-existence of the s. milleri group with some anaerobe strains has also been suggested to accelerate inflammation. we discuss the mechanism inducing the massive release of cytokines through t cell response to certain exotoxins produced by s. milleri group, as reported in toxic shock-like syndrome due to the group a beta-streptococcus and in alpha-streptococcal shock syndrome due to viridans streptococci (alpha-streptococci).

TI  == mannosidase production by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the production of mannosidase activity by all currently recognized species of human viridans group streptococci was determined using an assay in which bacterial growth was dependent on the degradation of the high-mannose-type glycans of rnase b and subsequent utilization of released mannose. rnase b is an  excellent substrate for the demonstration of mannosidase activity since it is a glycoprotein with a single glycosylation site which is occupied by high-mannose-type glycoforms containing five to nine mannose residues. mannosidase activity was produced only by some members of the mitis group (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus parasanguinis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) and streptococcus intermedius of the anginosus group. none of the other species within the salivarius and mutans groups or streptococcus peroris and streptococcus sanguinis produced mannosidase activity. using matrix-assisted  laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the man(5) glycan alone was degraded while man(6) to man(9), which contain terminal alpha(1-->2) mannose residues in addition to the alpha(1-->3), alpha(1-->6), and beta(1-->4) residues present in man(5), remained intact. investigations on mannosidase production using synthetic (4-methylumbelliferone-  or p-nitrophenol-linked) alpha- or beta-mannosides as substrates indicated that there was no correlation between degradation of these substrates and degradation  of the man(5) glycan of rnase b. no species degraded these alpha-linked mannosides, while degradation of the beta-linked synthetic substrates was restricted to strains within the streptococcus anginosus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius species. the data generated using a native glycoprotein as the substrate demonstrate that mannosidase production within the viridans group streptococci is more widely distributed than had previously been considered.

TI  == intrauterine infection and spontaneous midgestation abortion: is the spectrum of  microorganisms similar to that in preterm labor?
AB  == objective: to determine whether microorganisms associated with intrauterine infection and preterm labor play a contributing role in midgestation abortion. methods: a 4 year retrospective review of spontaneous midgestation abortions for  which autopsy and microbiological cultures of placental and fetal tissue were performed was conducted for a tertiary obstetrics hospital, which included a regional referral service for perinatal and fetal pathology. one hundred twenty-nine spontaneously delivered, nonmacerated, midgestation fetuses or stillbirths (of between 16 and 26 weeks' gestation) and placentas were examined and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, yeasts, and genital mycoplasmas. results: microorganisms were recovered in 85 (66%) cases (57% placentas, 49% fetuses). among the culture positive cases, 81% had histological chorioamnionitis, 28% fetal pneumonitis, 38% clinical signs of infection, and 62% ruptured membranes at the time of miscarriage. these differed significantly from  culture-negative cases (44%, 5%, 13%, and 34%, respectively). group b streptococcus (gbs) was the most significant pathogen, recovered in 21 cases, 13  as the sole isolate, 94% with chorioamnionitis, and 47% in women with intact membranes. escherichia coli and ureaplasma urealyticum (22 and 24 cases, respectively) occurred mostly as mixed infections, with ruptured membranes. gbs,  mu urealyticum, and streptococcus anginosus group were individually associated with chorioamnionitis, bacteroides/prevotella and s. anginosus with fetal pneumonitis. the spectrum of microorganisms was similar to that in preterm labor  at later gestations; however, gbs appeared to be the most significant pathogen in midgestation miscarriage, especially with intact membranes. conclusions: unsuspected intrauterine infection underlies many spontaneous midgestation abortions. gbs is a key pathogen in this setting.

AB  == our aim was to develop a rapid fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) assay for the identification of different oral groups of streptococci in dental plaque and  to combine it with digital image analysis for the automated enumeration of target cells. cy3-labeled oligonucleotide probes specific for 16s rrna gene sequences of the anginosus, mitis, mutans, and salivarius groups of streptococci were hybridized under stringent conditions with bacterial cultures or supragingival plaque samples that had been permeabilized with lysozyme. probe specificity was determined with strains from 30 different species, mainly of oral origin. results showed that probes ang541, mit447, ssp001, and sal090 with specificity for the anginosus, mitis, mutans, and salivarius groups, respectively, the pan-reactive streptococcal probe str405, the s. mutans specific probe mut590, and the s. sobrinus specific probe sob174 were well-suited for the identification of cultured streptococci. probes str405, mit447 and ssp001 were then successfully applied to enumerate automatically bacteria of the recognized taxa in 144 supragingival plaque samples. on the average, total streptococci accounted for 8.2%, streptococci of the mitis and mutans groups for 3.9 and 1.7%, respectively, of the plaques. the combined application of fish and automated image analysis provides an objective time-saving alternative to culture or pcr for the enumeration of selected oral streptococci in dental plaque.

AB  == background: acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in childhood. however, the pathogenesis and detailed microbiology are obscure. objective: to determine in detail the bacterial etiology of appendicitis in children in relation to the histologic tissue pathology. study design: tissue samples obtained at surgery from 41 children with suspected acute appendicitis were examined histologically and by culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the patients were analyzed according to histopathologic and clinical findings. results: aerobic and anaerobic species were isolated from 40 of 41 (98%) samples; on average, 14.1 isolates per specimen (10.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). specimens from patients with gangrenous appendices yielded significantly higher numbers of anaerobic isolates per specimen than did specimens from patients with  healthy appendices (11.7 vs. 7.7; p < 0.01). bacteria belonging to the bacteroides fragilis group were the most frequently isolated anaerobic microorganisms (95%). other organisms frequently isolated in all histology groups were peptostreptococcus micros (66%), bilophila wadsworthia (63%), fusobacterium  nucleatum (44%), eggerthella lenta (44%) and a hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing gram-negative rod (41%). of the aerobes escherichia coli (88%) and streptococcus anginosus group (former streptococcus "milleri" group) organisms (61%) were the most frequent findings. conclusions: the shift from histologically normal toward gangrenous appendices was clearly associated with markedly elevated anaerobic bacterial counts in terms of species. the unusually high frequencies of b. wadsworthia (75%) and the hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing gram-negative rod (56%) in gangrenous appendices represent unique and different findings from those reported in adults.

AB  == acid production, in particular at low ph, is thought to be an important ecological determinant in dental caries. the aim of the present study was to determine the acid producing capability at different ph levels of 47 streptococcal strains, representing 9 species, isolated from human dental plaque. the bacteria were grown until mid log-phase under anaerobic conditions and acid production was measured in a ph-stat system at ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5 and 5.0. at all ph values, the mean velocity of acid production (v(ap)) by streptococcus mutans and s. sobrinus was significantly higher (p<0.01; anova) than that of the other oral streptococci, including s. mitis, s. oralis, s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. intermedius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus, and s. vestibularis. however, the v(ap) of some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and s. oralis, particularly at ph values of 7.0 and 6.0, exceeded that of some strains of s. mutans. the v(ap) decreased with ph for all strains, but some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and strains of the mutans streptococci maintained a relatively high rate of acid production. the results suggest that some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and s. oralis may play an important role in caries development by modifying the environment in dental plaque to become favourable for the succession of aciduric  species. the study furthermore emphasises the need for detailed species and biovar identification of oral streptococci and for recognition of the significant physiological differences that occur within single species.

TI  == streptococcus anginosus in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: implication in  carcinogenesis.
AB  == it has been suggested that helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) infection might be associated with not only gastric ulcers but also gastric malignancies. recently,  it was reported that the streptococcus anginosus (s. anginosus) dna sequence was  found in dna samples extracted from esophageal cancers. because smoking and alcohol abuse are regarded as risk factors for both esophgeal cancer and head and neck cancer, infection of s. anginosus might be associated with carcinogenesis of head and neck cancer. to investgate the involvement of s. anginosus infection in  head and neck cancer, we analyzed 217 dna samples prepared from head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. we performed pcr analysis with s. anginosus-16s ribosomal dna-specific primers, and southern blot analysis. for detection of s. anginosus in the oral and pharyngeal cavities, we used oropharyngeal bacteriological culture and pcr analysis of gingival smears of the patients. by pcr analysis, the s. anginosus dna sequence was found in 217 out of 217 (100%) dna samples obtained from head and neck cancers. by southern blot analysis, positive bands were detected in 41 out of 125 (33%) samples. we could find no s.  anginosus colony in oropharyngeal bacteriological culture dishes of 53 patients with and without head and neck cancer. on the other hand, we found the s. anginosus dna fragment in 8 out of 8 dna samples obtained from gingival smears by pcr analysis. these data indicate that the upper aerodigestive environment of the patients permitting s. anginosus infection was implicated in the carcinogenesis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

TI  == proteolysis and utilization of albumin by enrichment cultures of subgingival microbiota.
AB  == subgingival dental plaque consists mainly of microorganisms that derive their energy from amino acid fermentation. their nutrient requirements are met by the subgingival proteolytic system, which includes proteases from microorganism and inflammatory cells, and substrate proteins from sulcus exudate, including albumin. to determine the selective effect of individual proteins on microbiota,  we used albumin as the main substrate for growth. eight subgingval plaque samples from untreated periodontal pockets of patients with adult periodontitis were inoculated in peptone yeast medium with bovine albumin (9 g/l). after three subculture steps, cell yields of the enrichment cultures at the medium with 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 g/l albumin were determined. proteolytic activity (u/absorbance at 550 nm) of the enrichment cultures and different isolates derived from the cultures was estimated by the degradation of resorufin-labeled casein. it was observed that the yield of the mixed culture was albumin limited,  and the proteolytic activities of the cultures in albumin broth were higher than  in control (peptone broth). among the isolates from the enrichment cultures, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella buccae and prevotella bivia demonstrated proteolysis. the frequent occurrence of streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus anginosus in the albumin cultures is explained by their ability to utilize arginine as an energy source for growth. albumin in the medium was partly degraded by pure cultures but completely consumed in enrichment cultures, indicating synergy of bacterial proteinases. it  is concluded that the subgingival microbiota possesses proteolytic activity and may use albumin as a substrate for their growth. enrichment cultures on albumin may serve as a relatively simple in vitro model to evaluate the effects of proteinase inhibitors.

TI  == the streptococcus anginosus species comprises five 16s rrna ribogroups with different phenotypic characteristics and clinical relevance.
AB  == a collection of 267 consecutively isolated streptococcus anginosus strains was screened for the prevalence of previously described 'motile' strains by hybridization with oligonucleotide probes in a reverse line blot assay. the motile strains represented 101 (37.8%) of the s. anginosus strains. the vast majority of these strains fermented mannitol and raffinose, whereas most other s. anginosus strains did not (p<0.001). most (83/101) of the motile strains were recovered from the urogenital tract (including five strains from neonatal surveillance cultures) and only a minority (36) of them were associated with infection-related samples (p<0.001). strains that hybridized with the same oligonucleotide probes as the type strain s. anginosus atcc 33397t (= nctc 10713t) were designated atcc-like strains. they accounted for 74 (27.7%) of the strains examined, were commonly distributed among the different body parts and were significantly more associated with infection-related samples. three other hybridization patterns were recognized in the reverse line blot assay, ribogroup  i (n = 51), ribogroup ii (n = 21) and ribogroup iii (n = 19). ribogroup ii strains were significantly more frequently recovered from the abdominal cavity and were associated with infection-related samples. ribogroup i included the majority of the s. anginosus strains that carried lancefield group c. comparison  of the nearly complete 16s rrna sequence of two representative strains of each ribogroup revealed that all five ribogroups were closely related (>97% sequence similarities), and that most sequence divergences between the ribogroups occurred in the 1024-1064 bp region of the 16s rrna gene. the present data confirm the heterogeneity within the s. anginosus species.

TI  == comparison of gyra and parc mutations and resistance levels among fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates and laboratory-derived mutants of oral streptococci.
AB  == laboratory-derived fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants were obtained by serial passage of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus anginosus isolates on agar containing increasing concentrations of old and new fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin and du-6859a, respectively. sequencing of an s. sanguis isolate exposed to du-6859a showed that resistance was associated with two mutations in the quinolone resistance determining region (qrdr) of the gyra gene (ser83-->phe; glu87-->lys), and with a mutation in the parc gene (ser79-->ile). however, different mutations in the gyra gene (ser83-->tyr) and parc gene (ser79-->phe) were found in a s. sanguis isolate exposed to ofloxacin. a fluoroquinolone-resistant isolate, qr-95101, from a dental infection, had a single mutation in the gyra gene (ser83-->phe) and in the parc gene (ser79-->phe). two fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants, qs-701ofm and qs-701dum, were obtained from s. anginosus qs-701, by exposure to ofloxacin and du-6859a, respectively. these mutants showed a common substitution at codon 83 (ser-->phe)  in the gyra gene but had different substitutions at codon 87 (qs-701ofm, glu-->gln; qs-701dum, glu-->lys). they also had different substitutions at codons 79 and 135 in the parc gene (qs-701ofm, ser79-->leu but no change at glu135; qs-701dum, ser79-->ile and glu135-->gln). the resistance levels of the du-6859a-selected resistant s. sanguis mutant qs-951dum to du-6859a, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin were higher than those of the ofloxacin-selected resistant mutant qs-951ofm. however, ampicillin susceptibilities of these mutants were not different from the parental strains. in s. anginosus, the du-6859a-selected fluoroquinolone-resistant mutant qs-701dum was resistant to all the fluoroquinolones tested, while the ofloxacin-selected mutant qs-701ofm was resistant to three fluoroquinolones, but not du-6859a. the results indicate that  different fluoroquinolones select distinct mutations in the qrdr of the gyra and  parc genes in oral streptococci. the gyra or parc mutation in oral streptococci may determine the levels of fluoroquinolone resistance.

TI  == distribution of the intermedilysin gene among the anginosus group streptococci and correlation between intermedilysin production and deep-seated infection with  streptococcus intermedius.
AB  == the distribution of intermedilysin, a human-specific cytolysin, among the anginosus group streptococci and the correlation of toxin production and infection by streptococcus intermedius were investigated. pcr and southern hybridization specific for the intermedilysin gene revealed that the toxin gene exists only in s. intermedius and no homologue to the toxin gene is distributed in s. anginosus and s. constellatus. thus, the intermedilysin gene is useful as a marker gene of s. intermedius. moreover, a human-specific hemolysis assay and western blotting with intermedilysin-specific antibodies clearly demonstrated that the intermedilysin production level in isolates from deep-seated infections, such as brain and liver abscesses, is higher (6.2- to 10.2-fold, respectively) than in strains from normal habitats, such as dental plaque, or from peripheral infection sites. however, other candidate virulence factors of s. intermedius, such as chondroitin sulfate depolymerase, hyaluronidase, and sialidase activities, did not show such a clear correlation between enzymatic activity and  isolation sites or disease severity. from these results, intermedilysin is likely to be the pathogenic or triggering factor of significance in inducing deep-seated infections with s. intermedius.

TI  == systemic doxycycline administration in the treatment of periodontal infections (ii). effect on antibiotic resistance of subgingival species.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to determine the proportion and prevalence  of doxycycline resistant species in subgingival plaque samples taken during and after doxycycline administration. 20 subjects with adult periodontitis were randomly assigned to test (n = 10) or control groups (n = 10). saliva samples as  well as subgingival plaque samples taken from the distal surface of 6 posterior teeth were collected at baseline. all subjects received full mouth srp and the test group systemic doxycycline at the dosage of 100 mg/day for 14 days. saliva samples and plaque samples from the distal surface of 2 randomly selected teeth were taken at 3, 7 and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. control subjects were sampled at the same time points. samples were anaerobically dispersed and serially diluted in pras ringer's solution and plated on enriched trypticase soy blood agar plates with or without 4 microg/ml doxycycline. after 7 days of anaerobic incubation, colonies were counted on both sets of plates. microbial growth was washed from the doxycycline-containing media and the species identified using 40 dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. differences in proportions of resistant species between test and control groups were tested for significance at each time point using the mann whitney test and over time within each group using the quade test. the mean % (+/-sem) of isolates resistant to 4 microg/ml doxycycline in the plaque samples of the test subjects increased from 6+/-2 to 48+/-9% during doxycycline administration, decreasing to  25+/-6% 2 weeks later and 9+/-2% at 90 days. in saliva, the % of resistant isolates rose from 13+/-1% to 81+/-10% during doxycycline administration falling  to 46+/-8% 2 weeks later and 22+/-5% at 90 days. the % of resistant isolates did  not change significantly in plaque or saliva samples of the control subjects at the same time points. for all subject visits combined, the most prevalent resistant species were: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, actinomyces gerencseriae, streptococcus constellatus, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, streptococcus gordonii, eikenella corrodens and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1. doxycycline resistant strains of these  species were detected in both plaque and saliva samples prior to therapy and in the control group. despite the finding of increased resistance, approximately 50% of the organisms present at periodontal sites at the end of 14 days of doxycycline administration tested sensitive to the agent.

TI  == prevalence of the amylase-binding protein a gene (abpa) in oral streptococci.
AB  == salivary amylase binds specifically to a number of oral streptococcal species. this interaction may play an important role in dental plaque formation. recently, a 585-bp gene was cloned and sequenced from streptococcus gordonii challis encoding a 20.5-kda amylase-binding protein (abpa). the goal of this study was to determine if related genes are present in other species of oral streptococci. biotinylated abpa was used in southern blot analysis to screen genomic dna from several strains representing eight species of oral streptococci. this probe hybridized with a 4.0-kb hindiii restriction fragment from all 13 strains of s. gordonii tested. the probe did not appear to bind to any restriction fragments from other species of amylase-binding oral streptococci including streptococcus mitis (with the exception of 1 of 14 strains), streptococcus crista (3 strains),  streptococcus anginosus (1 strain), and streptococcus parasanguinis (1 strain), or to non-amylase-binding oral streptococci including streptococcus sanguinis (3  strains), streptococcus oralis (4 strains), and streptococcus mutans (1 strain).  primers homologous to sequences within the 3' and 5' ends of abpa yielded products of 400 bp following pcr of genomic dna from the southern blot-positive strains. several of these pcr products were cloned and sequenced. the levels of similarity of these cloned products to the abpa of s. gordonii challis ranged from 91 to 96%. these studies reveal that the abpa gene appears to be specific to s. gordonii and differs from genes encoding amylase-binding proteins from other species of amylase-binding streptococci.

TI  == sinogenic subdural empyema and streptococcus anginosus.
AB  == subdural empyema (sde) is most commonly caused by sinusitis and, without early diagnosis and neurosurgical intervention, is associated with high mortality. in a patient with sinusitis who presents with mental status changes, the diagnosis of  sde should be suspected on clinical grounds, even in the absence of significant computed tomographic findings. computed tomography with contrast is a useful aid  in the diagnosis of sde, but findings may be subtle, and contrasted magnetic resonance imaging is superior. the association of streptococcus anginosus sinusitis and related intracranial sequelae is important owing to the potentially catastrophic complications and should be recognized by otolaryngologists. in view of the rapidly progressing nature of sinogenic sde, physicians should strongly consider early institution of aggressive therapy consisting of craniotomy with concurrent sinus drainage in patients in whom sinogenic sde is suspected on clinical grounds, particularly in the presence of s. anginosus-positive sinus cultures.

AB  == the utility of pcr analysis of transfer dna intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tdna-ilp) for the identification to the species level of clinically relevant viridans streptococci was evaluated with a collection of reference strains of 15  species of the salivarius, anginosus, mitis and mutans rrna homology groups. pcr  products generated by using fluorescent, outwardly directed, consensus tdna primers were analysed by electrophoresis on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and  by laser fluorescence scanning. eleven species showed specific and distinct tdna  patterns: streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis,  streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus criceti and streptococcus ratti. indistinguishable patterns were obtained among two groups of species: streptococcus vestibularis and streptococcus salivarius on the one hand and streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedius on the other. s. mitis strains produced heterogeneous patterns that could be separated into three groups: a group containing s. mitis biovar 1 and two s. mitis biovar 2 groups, one of which clustered with s. parasanguinis strains while the other showed patterns unrelated to other species. these results agree in part with protein electrophoretic analysis showing that s. mitis biovar 2 strains belong to several streptococcal taxa. in conclusion, pcr analysis of tdna-ilp holds promise for rapid identification of viridans streptococci that are difficult to identify by phenotypic tests.

TI  == a study of small-colony, beta-haemolytic, lancefield group c streptococci within  the anginosus group: description of streptococcus constellatus subsp. pharyngis subsp. nov., associated with the human throat and pharyngitis.
AB  == beta-haemolytic, lancefield group c streptococci within the anginosus-species group were shown by genetic and phenotypic criteria to be heterogeneous and to constitute two distinct taxa related at subspecies level to streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus anginosus, respectively. the first group, referred to here as dna group 1, comprised six strains with 86-100% intragroup overall genomic dna relatedness; five of the strains were originally isolated from the human throat and one was from an abdominal mass. they shared 61-77% dna relatedness (delta tm values = 1.2-1.5 degrees c) with reference strains of s. constellatus and were clearly differentiated from s. constellatus (now named streptococcus constellatus subsp. constellatus) by the ability to produce beta-n-acetylgalactosaminidase, beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase, beta-d-fucosidase,  beta-d-galactosidase and beta-d-glucosidase. the name s. constellatus subsp. pharyngis is proposed for these strains on the grounds that they are genetically  and phenotypically distinct and exhibit a predeliction for the human throat, being isolated also from cases of pharyngitis. the dna g + c content is 35-37 mol%. the type strain is mm9889at (= nctc 13122t). the second group (dna group 2) was formed by five beta-haemolytic, lancefield group c strains originally isolated from various human infections. dna group 2 strains (81-100% intragroup dna relatedness) shared 60-72% dna relatedness (delta tm values = 2.1-4.1 degrees c) with s. anginosus strains nctc 10713t and mas 283 but were not clearly differentiated phenotypically from s. anginosus, showed no clear pattern of clinical association, and therefore are not formally proposed as a new subspecies here.

TI  == genotypic and phenotypic characterization of "streptococcus milleri" group isolates from a veterans administration hospital population.
AB  == because identification of the species within the "streptococcus milleri" group is difficult for the clinical laboratory as the species share overlapping phenotypic characteristics, we wished to confirm biochemical identification with identification by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. ninety-four clinical isolates  previously identified as the "streptococcus milleri" group were reclassified as s. anginosus, s. constellatus, or s. intermedius with the api 20 strep system (biomerieux vikek, hazelton, mo.) and the fluo-card (key scientific, round rock,  tex.). in addition, we determined the lancefield group, hemolysis, colony size, colony texture, repetitive extragenic palindromic pcr (rep-pcr) pattern, and cellular fatty acid (cfa) profile (midi, newark, del.). 16s rrna gene sequence analysis with 40 selected representative strains showed three distinct groups, with s. constellatus and s. intermedius found to be more closely related to each  other than to s. anginosus, and further distinguished a biochemically distinct group of urogenital isolates within the s. anginosus group of isolates. except for strains unreactive with the fluo-card (8%), all s. anginosus and s. intermedius strains identified by sequencing were similarly identified by biochemical testing. however, 23% of the selected s. constellatus isolates identified by sequencing (9% of all s. constellatus isolates) would have been identified as s. anginosus or s. intermedius by biochemical tests. although most  s. anginosus strains formed one unique cluster by cfa analysis and most s. constellatus strains showed similar rep-pcr patterns, neither method was sufficiently dependable for identification. whereas lancefield group or lactose fermentation did not correspond to sequence or biochemical type, s. constellatus  was most likely to be beta-hemolytic and s. intermedius was most likely to have a dry colony type. the most frequent isolate in our population was s. constellatus, followed by s. anginosus. there was an association of s. anginosus with a gastrointestinal or urogenital source, and there was an association of s. constellatus and s. intermedius with both the respiratory tract and upper-body abscesses.

TI  == spondylodiscitis caused by viridans streptococci: three cases and a review of the literature.
AB  == three cases of spondylodiscitis caused by viridans streptococci were observed within the course of 1 month. although streptococci have been reported as the third most frequent cause of spondylodiscitis after staphylococci and gram-negative bacteria, alpha-haemolytic streptococci are rarely seen. the three  patients presented with symptoms of low back pain; they felt well and did not have a fever or chills. laboratory examinations revealed inflammation. further examinations such as scintigraphy, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging were done. bacteriological diagnosis was established by blood cultures in two cases and by needle biopsy of the disco-vertebral space in one. in one patient endocarditis was also documented. because the prevalence of endocarditis  was found to be higher in our cases of spondylodiscitis due to streptococcus viridans than for other bacteria, the exclusion of this diagnosis must be pursued aggressively. these observations lead us to question if the spectrum of bacteria  causing spondylodiscitis is undergoing a change. an aetiological agent could be isolated in 1168 patients (85.4%): in 48% a staphylococcus, in 28% a gram-negative bacterium and in only 10% a streptococcus. there were two cases of  viridans streptococci (0.2%). these two cases together with other single case reports [14-22] account for 15 cases of spondylodiscitis due to alpha-haemolytic  streptococci. differentiation of the organisms to the species level was accomplished in six cases: s. mitis (3), s. sanguis (2) and s. anginosus (1). although a multitude of organisms, bacterial as well as fungal, causing spondylodiscitis has been reported in recent years, almost all were single cases  [23-42]. the unusual observation of three cases of spondylodiscitis due to alpha-haemolytic streptococci within 1 month prompted us to review the clinical and laboratory findings and to compare these cases with those caused by staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == effect of low-molecular-weight chitosans on the adhesive properties of oral streptococci.
AB  == it was previously shown that a low-molecular-weight chitosan and its derivatives  n-carboxymethyl chitosan and imidazolyl chitosan inhibit streptococcus mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite. the ability of the same molecules to interfere with adhesive properties of other oral streptococci (streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus vestibularis) was tested. when saliva-coated or -uncoated hydroxyapatite beads were treated with n-carboxymethyl chitosan, a reduction varying from 60% to 98% depending on strains was observed. low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan did not have any effect. growth in n-carboxymethyl chitosan-supplemented medium (final concentrations ranging from 20 to 500 micrograms.ml-1) caused a dose related reduction in the adsorption of all strains to hydroxyapatite and in their affinity towards xylene. no effect was observed with low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan. in contrast to what observed with s. mutans, the three polysaccharides did not affect detachment from hydroxyapatite beads and adherence to cheek epithelial cells of the other streptococci. these results suggest that low-molecular-weight chitosans and/or imidazolyl chitosan, selectively affecting s. mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite, may be very interesting as potential anti-dental caries agents.

AB  == we recently reported cloning of streptococcus anginosus (s. anginosus) dna fragments containing the 16s ribosomal gene from dna samples of surgical specimens of gastric cancers. to investigate the specificity of s. anginosus infection, southern blot analysis with s. anginosus 16s ribosomal dna probe and pcr analysis with s. anginosus-specific primers were performed in dna samples prepared from 15 esophageal cancers, 43 gastric cancers, 16 lung cancers, 10 cervical cancers, 14 renal cell carcinomas, 10 colorectal cancers, and 19 bladder cancers. we frequently found s. anginosus dna sequences in dna samples from esophageal cancer and gastric cancer tissues, as well as in those from dysplasia  of the esophagus of esophageal cancer patients. no s. anginosus dna bands were detected by southern blot analysis on dnas from the noncancerous portions of the  esophagus or the stomach. by pcr analysis with 35 cycles, only 7% of the noncancerous portion of the esophagus was shown to contain s. anginosus sequences. no s. anginosus sequences were found in dnas from cancers in lung, cervix, and kidney, but they were found in 1 of 10 colon cancers.

TI  == whole-cell protein electrophoretic analysis of viridans streptococci: evidence for heterogeneity among streptococcus mitis biovars.
AB  == one hundred reference strains representing all species belonging to the different phylogenetic lineages of the viridans streptococci were examined by means of one-dimensional whole-organism protein electrophoresis. for most of the species examined, multiple strains characterized by dna-dna hybridization were included and, wherever described, representatives of different biochemical variants were analysed. most species were clearly differentiated. the data support the viewpoint that members of the streptococcus anginosus group constitute a single species and indicate that streptococcus mitis biovar 2 is a heterogeneous taxon comprising strains from several streptococcal species.

TI  == determination of 23s rrna sequences from members of the genus streptococcus and characterization of genetically distinct organisms previously identified as members of the streptococcus anginosus group.
AB  == the 23s rrna gene sequences of eight type strains of the genus streptococcus were determined. three species-specific probes for the three members of the streptococcus anginosus group and one group-specific probe for these three species were designed. the pcr-amplified 23s rrna gene sequences of 28 clinical strains were examined by hybridization with the four oligonucleotide probes. they were suspected to be members of the s. anginosus group by biochemical tests; however, only 21 strains (75%) hybridized to one of the three species probes. seven biochemically atypical strains did not hybridize to these species-specific  probes. of the seven strains, three hybridized to the group-specific probe. the 23s ribosomal rna sequences of these three strains differed by three bases within the 20-base probe area of s. anginosus. the phylogenetic tree of the 16s rrna of  these three strains located them within the branch of s. anginosus. the remaining four strains, which did not hybridize to group- or species-specific probes, had a raffinose-positive and vp-negative phenotype. the probe hybridization results showed that these four strains did not belong to the s. anginosus group and were  closely related to s. parasanguis according to partial sequences of their 16s rrna genes.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == natural competence in the genus streptococcus: evidence that streptococci can change pherotype by interspecies recombinational exchanges.
AB  == to map the incidence of natural competence in the genus streptococcus, we used pcr to screen a number of streptococcal strains for the presence of the recently  identified competence regulation operon, containing the comc, -d, and -e genes. this approach established that the operon is present in strains belonging to the  s. mitis and s. anginosus groups, but it was not detected in the other strains examined. competence is induced in s. pneumoniae and s. gordonii by strain-specific peptide pheromones, competence-stimulating peptides (csps). with  its unique primary structure, each csp represents a separate pheromone type (pherotype), which is recognized by the signalling domain of the downstream histidine kinase, comd. thus, all bacteria induced to competence by a particular  csp belong to the same pherotype. in this study, we identified a number of new pherotypes by sequencing the genes encoding the csp and its receptor from different streptococcal species. we found that in several cases, these genes have a mosaic structure which must have arisen as the result of recombination between  two distinct allelic variants. the observed mosaic blocks encompass the region encoding the csp and the csp-binding domain of the histidine kinase. consequently, the recombination events have led to switches in pherotype for the  strains involved. this suggests a novel mechanism for the adaptation of naturally competent streptococci to new environmental conditions.

TI  == [bacteremias due to the streptococcus milleri group. an analysis of 18 episodes].
AB  == objective: to study the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of bacteremia caused by streptococcus milleri group streptococci (smg). methods: prospective evaluation of all bacteremic episodes with clinical significance from 1990 to 1995 in two general hospitals. in this study all episodes caused by smg were analyzed. results: a total of 905 bacteremic episodes with clinical significance were detected; 18 (1.98%) were caused by smg (0.16/1,000 admissions). the mean age of patients were 43 years and the male/female ratio 1.6. seventeen patients (94.4%) had some underlying disease; nine patients had diabetes, four were parenteral drug abusers, and two had neoplasms. the most common sources of bacteremia were intraabdominal in four episodes (two liver abscesses, one subphrenic abscess and one pancreatic pseudocyst), cutaneous and/or soft tissues in four, surgical wound in two and respiratory in two; no source was identified in five episodes. four episodes had a polymicrobial origin. in 13 isolates the identification was at species level (streptococcus anginosus eight, streptococcus intermedius four and streptococcus constellatus one). all strains were susceptible to penicillin. six patients (33.3%) required surgery. in ten episodes a favorable outcome was recorded, although four patients required surgery. the infection associated mortality rate was 31.2%. the mean age of deceased patients was higher than for cured patients (62.2 +/- 20.2 versus 35.3 +/- 20.3; p < 0.05). conclusions: smb bacteremia is uncommon. it involved mainly  diabetic patients or parenteral drug abusers, commonly with an intraabdominal suppurative source or in skin or soft tissues. the mortality rate was high despite surgery in one third of patients. patients with advanced age had a poorer prognosis. all isolates investigated were susceptible to penicillin.

TI  == characterization of the lancefield group c streptococcus 16s-23s rna gene intergenic spacer and its potential for identification and sub-specific typing.
AB  == the 16s-23s rna gene intergenic spacers of isolates of streptococcus equi (n = 5), s. zooepidemicus (n = 5), s. equisimilis (n = 3) and s. dysgalactiae (n = 2)  were sequenced and compared. there were distinct regions within the spacer, arranged in the order 1-9 for all s. equi and one s. zooepidemicus isolate and 1,2 and 4-9 for the remaining isolates. region 4 was identical to the trna(ala) gene found in the 16s-23s intergenic spacers of other streptococci. regions 1, 5, 6 and 7 had distinct variations, each conserved in different isolates. however, amongst the intergenic spacers there were different combinations of variant regions, suggesting a role for dna recombination in their evolution. the intergenic spacer of all isolates of s. equi and one s. zooepidemicus isolate were almost identical. primers derived from the variant sequences of regions 1 and 5 to 6 were used to group all s. zooepidemicus (n = 17) and s. equi (n = 5) into 1 of 8 types by polymerase chain reaction; three s. zooepidemicus isolates typed the same as s. equi. s. equi and s. zooepidemicus were clearly distinguishable from s. equisimilis and s. dysgalactiae which had shorter regions 5 and 6 and no region 7. most homology for the group c sequences was found in previously published sequences for the 16s-23s intergenic spacers of s. anginosis, s. constellatus, s. intermedius, s. salivarius and s. agalactiae. a 75-90 nucleotide length shared with s. anginosus and s. intermedius in opposite orientations in the two main variants of region 6 supported the role for dna recombination in the evolution of the spacer. the 16s-23s intergenic spacers indicate that s. zooepidemicus was the archetypal species for s. equi and that both are genetically more distant from s. equisimilis and s. dysgalactiae. the intergenic spacer can be used to identify specifically the group c streptococci and as an epidemiological marker for s. zooepidemicus.

TI  == utilization of sialic acid by viridans streptococci.
AB  == the importance of viridans streptococci as agents of serious extra-oral diseases, including endocarditis, is now recognized. we have tested the hypothesis that the ability to utilize sialic acid as a nutrient source may play a role in the proliferation of these organisms. the type strains of the 15 presently recognized species of viridans streptococci and two clinical isolates-s. oralis (ar3), isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis, and s. intermedius (uns35),  a brain abscess isolate-were studied for their ability to utilize sialic acid. only s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. gordonii, s. mitis ("oralis group") s. intermedius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus ("milleri group"), and s. defectivus ("nutritionally variant group") were able to use sialic acid (n-acetylneuraminic  acid) efficiently as a sole carbon source. formate, acetate, and ethanol were produced as the major metabolic end-products of sialic acid metabolism, while corresponding glucose-grown cultures produced lactate as the major metabolic end-product. utilization of sialic acid was independent of the production of sialidase. cell-free extracts of sialic acid-grown cultures expressed elevated levels of n-acetylneuraminate pyruvate-lyase (npl; the first enzyme in the intracellular catabolism of sialic acid) and n-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (glcnac-6-p) deacetylase and glucosamine-6-phosphate (glcn-6-p) deaminase (enzymes involved in the intracellular catabolism of n-acetylglucosamine). these  activities were repressed by growth in the presence of glucose. the intracellular fate of sialic acid, after cleavage by npl into n-acetylmannosamine (mannac) and  pyruvate, is uncertain, but the elevated levels of glcnac-6-p deacetylase and glcn-6-p deaminase in sialic acid-grown cells suggest that phosphorylation and isomerization are possible steps in the metabolism of mannac to generate an intermediate common to the pathway of n-acetylglucosamine metabolism. the species of viridans streptococci that have the ability to utilize sialic acid are those most commonly associated with extra-oral diseases, and this ability is likely to  play a role in the persistence and survival of these infecting organisms in vivo.

TI  == experimental salivary pellicles formed on titanium surfaces mediate adhesion of streptococci.
AB  == the goal of this study was to characterize salivary components of titanium pellicles and to determine how experimental pellicles affect adhesion of several  strains of streptococci to titanium surfaces. titanium experimental pellicles were formed by incubation of fresh human parotid or human submandibular-sublingual saliva on pure titanium beads. pellicle was recovered from the beads using sodium dodecyl sulfate buffer and was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting to identify adsorbed salivary components. streptococcus anginosus, s. oralis, and s. salivarius recovered from in vivo titanium plaque and five reference strains of streptococci were used in adhesion assays to titanium beads with and without experimental salivary pellicles. the experimental pellicle formed on titanium was found to be composed of selected proteins from human parotid and human submandibular-sublingual saliva. salivary alpha-amylase and proline-rich proteins were found in all experimental pellicles, while siga, high-molecular weight mucin, and proline-rich glycoproteins were detected in one of the experimental pellicles examined. adhesion of fresh isolates and reference stains of s. anginosus, s. oralis, and s. salivarius to saliva-coated titanium was reduced compared to that of titanium without saliva coating. however, adhesion of laboratory strains of s. gordonii and s. sanguis was found to be significantly greater to experimental pellicles of human submandibular-sublingual saliva than was the adhesion of the fresh isolates, suggesting that streptococci-colonizing implant surfaces may be inherently less adhesive than other bacterial strains. this study found that salivary pellicles are selectively formed on titanium and mediate in vitro adhesion of streptococci.

TI  == rapid species identification of "streptococcus milleri" strains by line blot hybridization: identification of a distinct 16s rrna population closely related to streptococcus constellatus.
AB  == a collection of 399 "streptococcus milleri" strains were identified to the species level by the use of a line blot assay. their pcr-amplified partial 16s rrna gene sequences were hybridized with species-specific 5'-biotinylated oligonucleotide probes homologous to the bp 213 to 231 regions of the 16s rrna gene sequences of the type strains streptococcus anginosus atcc 33397, streptococcus constellatus atcc 27823, and streptococcus intermedius atcc 27335.  the hybridization results were compared with the reference phenotypic identification method data (r. a. whiley, h. fraser, j. m. hardie, and d. beighton, j. clin. microbiol. 28:1497-1501, 1990). most strains (357 of 399 [89.5%]) reacted unambiguously with only one probe. however, 42 of the 399 strains (10.5%) reacted with both the s. constellatus- and s. intermedius-specific probes; 41 of them were phenotypically identified as s. constellatus. these dually reactive strains hybridized with a 5'-biotinylated probe based on the bp 213 to 231 region of the 16s rrna gene sequence of one of two species. analysis of the 5' ends of the 16s rrna gene sequences (487 bp) demonstrated that the dually reactive strains represent a distinct rrna population sharing 98.1% sequence similarity with s. constellatus. phenotypic consistency between the dually reactive strains and the s. constellatus strains was not demonstrated. line blot hybridization proved to be a simple and inexpensive method to screen large numbers of strains for genetic relatedness, and it allowed the detection of a distinct 16s rrna type within the "s. milleri"  group.

AB  == streptococci that colonize the mouth and upper respiratory tract tend to be considered harmless commensals. in 45 cases of acute pneumonia and/or pulmonary abscess and 25 cases of thoracic empyema, the predominant species recovered were  anaerobic bacteria and the streptococcus milleri group, which encompasses the oral species streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus intermedius. the isolation of most s. milleri organisms along with  oral anaerobes indicated synergy between these groups. studies in a mouse model of pneumonia demonstrated this synergy; mortality was higher, histopathologic abnormalities were more marked (reflecting acute pneumonia followed by pulmonary  abscess or empyema), and viable bacteria were more numerous in the lungs of mice  with mixed infections caused by the s. milleri group and anaerobes than in the lungs of those with monomicrobial infection. in vitro studies elucidated a possible mechanism of this synergistic effect: anaerobes may enhance the growth of the s. milleri group and/or inhibit the bactericidal activity of the host. we  conclude that the s. milleri group is more important in pulmonary infections than has previously been recognized.

AB  == a collection of 518 "streptococcus milleri" isolates recovered from clinical specimens was identified to the species level according to recently established criteria. streptococcus anginosus was the most frequently isolated species (59.3%), followed by s constellatus (30.3%) and s intermedius (10.4%). one third  (34%) of all isolates were beta-hemolytic. the majority of s anginosus isolates were nonhemolytic, carried lancefield group f, or were nongroupable. most of the  s constellatus isolates were beta-hemolytic, as well as 16.6% of s intermedius strains. streptococcus anginosus was recovered more often from the genital and urinary tracts and s constellatus was recovered from the thorax. streptococcus intermedius was mostly found in the head and neck area, but was also isolated from the abdomen and the skin, bone, and soft tissue. streptococcus intermedius and nonhemolytic isolates were recovered most often from abscess-related specimens.

AB  == eight cases of infection caused by streptococcus milleri were studied clinically, and a comparative study was made of the backgrounds and factors influencing the development of infectious diseases caused by streptococcus milleri and streptococcus pneumoniae. the patients (six males and two females) with infectious diseases caused by streptococcus milleri ranged in age from 21 to 81 years old with an average age of 62.0 years. the infectious diseases encountered  among the patients were pyothorax in three patients, and in one patient each pyothorax and lung abscess, pleurisy, a secondary infection of pulmonary emphysema, skin infection related to a tracheostomy, a subdural abscess and a brain abscess, respectively. six out of the eight cases had infections which formed pus. an underlying disease existed in seven cases, and, in five of these seven cases, it influenced the general condition of these patients. six serum antibody titers for the s. milleri groups were examined in the first department of internal medicine, university of the ryukyus. three cases for s. anginosus, two cases for s. intermedius, and one case for s. constellatus showed high titers of x1024 or x2048. therefore, the examination of the serum antibody titer seems useful for the diagnosis of infections caused by the s. milleri group. we also carried out a comparative investigation of the backgrounds and factors of infectious diseases caused by s. milleri and s. pneumoniae. there are more underlying diseases in infections caused by s. milleri than in those caused by s. pneumoniae. there were more smokers among the patients with infections caused by  s. milleri than among those with s. pneumonia infections.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == species identification of members of the streptococcus milleri group isolated from the vagina by id 32 strep system and differential phenotypic characteristics.
AB  == the importance of bacterial vaginosis as a risk factor in obstetric and gynecological infections has recently been recognized. the bacterial vaginosis group of organisms includes members of the streptococcus milleri group, the identification of which has caused much confusion. we prospectively surveyed the  rates of carriage of s. milleri group organisms in 397 high vaginal swabs received in our laboratory. for the identification of 99 clinical isolates and 23 control strains, we compared the results obtained by the rapid id 32 strep system (analytab products) and by a scheme utilizing six differential phenotypic characteristics (presence of beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase, alpha-glucosidase, beta-d-fucosidase, beta-galactosidase, beta-n-acetylgalactosaminidase, and beta-glucosidase) as described by whiley et al. (r. a. whiley, h. fraser, j. m. hardie, and d. beighton, j. clin. microbiol. 28:1497-1501, 1990). we identified streptococcus anginosus in 18% and streptococcus constellatus in 0.05% of the specimens examined. of the isolates of s. anginosus that reacted with grouping antisera, 20 of 25 belonged to lancefield group f. the incubation conditions for  bacterial cultures and for reaction mixtures affected the results of phenotypic characterization in the production of alpha-glucosidase, beta-galactosidase, and  beta-glucosidase. however, by using bacterial cultures grown under hypercapnic conditions and incubating the reaction mixtures aerobically, consistent phenotypic characteristics were obtained, allowing identification similar to that obtained by the id 32 strep system. we therefore recommend the phenotypic scheme  as an inexpensive, reliable, and convenient method for the initial identification of species of the s. milleri group.

TI  == heterogeneity among 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacers of species within the 'streptococcus milleri group'.
AB  == the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer has been suggested as a suitable region of the bacterial genome from which to derive useful taxonomic information, particularly  with regard to identification at the species level. to investigate this approach  as an aid to the identification of the three species comprising the 'streptococcus milleri group' (smg), the spacers of isolates of streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus constellatus were amplified by pcr and length polymorphisms determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. phenotypically atypical isolates which had been identified presumptively as belonging to these three species were also included. spacers from two representatives of each spacer length found within the three smg species were sequenced. 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer length polymorphisms allowed discrimination between s. anginosus (350 bp or 450 bp amplification product) and  s. constellatus (380 bp amplification product), species that are difficult to differentiate phenotypically. s. intermedius (330 bp or 450 bp amplification product) and s. anginosus (350 bp or 450 bp amplification product) were not reliably distinguished by this method but are phenotypically distinct. sequencing data demonstrated that the spacers had a central region of highly variable length flanked by conserved regions which included a single trna(ala) gene. polymorphism in the length of the 16s-23s spacer determined by pcr provides a rapid and useful adjunct to strain identification for s. anginosus and s. constellatus, which are  not readily differentiated phenotypically.

TI  == "streptococcus milleri" strains displaying a gliding type of motility.
AB  == isolates belonging to the "streptococcus milleri" species group that appear to exhibit a gliding type of motility, which is expressed as spreading growth on certain types of agar media, are described. these strains resembled a biotype of  "s. milleri" that is usually isolated from genitourinary sources and is notable for its ability to ferment a wide array of carbohydrates. this biotype, which is  currently included in the species streptococcus anginosus, has been implicated in cases of neonatal infection. the "s. milleri" isolates which we studied lacked any observable organelles of motility and gave negative results when they were tested in conventional motility test medium stab cultures. colonies growing on certain agar media, however, spread over the surfaces of plates and increased in  area with increasing time of incubation. chocolate agar supported maximum spreading, while this characteristic was barely discernible on blood agar. electron microscopy studies revealed that there was more production of extracellular glycocalyx by motile strains than by a nonmotile isolate having a similar biotype. the results of an analysis of 16s rrna gene sequences suggested  that the motile strains are closely related to s. anginosus and represent a distinct rrna population within the "s. milleri" species complex.

AB  == s. anginosus is a commensal of the oro-pharyngeal mucous membrane without any signification for the local pathology. ignoring the existence of beta-haemolytic  colonies of this species, the risk to report the presence of some beta-haemolytic streptococci that actually belong to the normal flora exists. the antigenic identifications of beta-haemolytic streptococci maintain the confusion either, s. anginosus being able to react with specific sera anti group g, c or a. in our study, two identification criteria out of those available demonstrated a high value: the small or very small colonies' size, especially in secondary cultures and the production of acetoin (voges-proskauer test). s. anginosus was isolated with a quite great frequency in pharyngeal exudate from children: 41 strains out  of 90 strains of beta-haemolytic non-group a streptococci were s. anginosus. antigenically they belonged, in numerical order to groups c, g, f or they were ungroupable. in conclusion: the microbiologist has to identify, but not to report the presence of s. anginosus in pharyngeal exudate, it being a normal component of the oro-pharyngeal flora. doing so, a better evaluation of the clinical signification of the other beta haemolytic streptococci's non group a will be possible.

AB  == when dentin is planed by endodontic instruments, a smear layer forms. whether this layer should be removed is unknown and controversial. this study was conducted to assess the effect of the smear layer on retention of bacteria using  an in vitro root canal bacterial colonization model. canals of 26 extracted human canines were step-back prepared using 2.5% naocl. teeth were then randomly divided into two groups based on the type of high volume final flush: 1-20 ml of  sterile saline (0.85% wt/vol) or (2-10 ml of 17% edta followed by 10 ml of 2.5% naocl which removes smear layer. streptococcus anginosus (milleri) was cultured in trypticase soy broth supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract at 37 degrees c in 5% co2. cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in fresh media. serial dilutions were performed to achieve inocula of 10(6) colony-forming units  in a 30-microliters volume. teeth were inoculated and incubated for 2 h in 5% co2 at 37 degrees c. following incubation, teeth were split and processed for microbiological analysis. numbers of colonizing bacteria were determined by a spiral-plating system. enumeration of the numbers of bacteria revealed a reproducible, order of magnitude difference (p = 0.0002) between teeth with smear layer (10(4) colony-forming units) versus teeth without smear layer (10(5) colony-forming units). this suggests that smear layer produced during root canal  therapy may inhibit bacterial colonization of root canals. one suggested mechanism is that smear layer may block bacterial entry into dentinal tubules.

TI  == conservation of salivary glycoprotein-interacting and human immunoglobulin g-cross-reactive domains of antigen i/ii in oral streptococci.
AB  == in this study we localized more precisely the salivary glycoprotein-interacting and the human immunoglobulin g (higg)-cross-reacting domains on the sr molecule,  an antigen i/ii-related protein from s. mutans serotype f. mapping of the sr molecule with polypeptides expressed by subclones covering the entire molecule and with synthetic peptides demonstrates that the salivary glycoprotein-binding domain is located in the n-terminal alanine-rich repeats of the sr molecule. in order to investigate the degree of conservation of both regions in various oral streptococci, we tested the reactivity of 8 representative strains of the mutans  group and 11 nonmutans oral streptococcus strains (s. anginosus, s. milleri, s. constellatus, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. sanguis, s. gordonii, s. salivarius, and s. mitis strains) with antipeptide antibodies in a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay together with colony hybridization analysis using dna probes  designed to map these two regions. all the mutans group strains except s. rattus  and the 11 nonmutans streptococcal strains showed a high conservation of the c-terminal part of the sr molecule, especially the higg-cross-reacting domain, and less homology for the n-terminal salivary glycoprotein-binding region. almost all of the sera from patients with rheumatic disease reacted strongly with sr from s. mutans serotype f, p1 from s. mutans serotype c, and four peptides located in the higg-cross-reacting region and not with peptides located at the c  and n termini and in the proline-rich repeats. these results confirm that epitopes located within this region are immunogenic in humans and could lead to the synthesis of natural anti-igg antibodies.

TI  == genetic and molecular studies of a composite chromosomal element (tn3705) containing a tn916-modified structure (tn3704) in streptococcus anginosus f22.
AB  == the plasmid-free streptococcus anginosus f22 contained a conjugative element, tn3705, encoding resistance to erythromycin (emr) and tetracycline-minocycline (tcr-mnr). we mapped a chromosomal region (> 52 kb) of f22, corresponding to the  internal part of tn3705. molecular analysis of tn3705 revealed it to be a composite structure: it included in its central part a transposon designated tn3704 (20.3 kb +/- 0.5 kb), which had a modified structure in comparison with that of tn916 and on which the emr tcr-mn4 markers were localized. tn3705 inserted from f22 into the chromosome of various streptococcal transconjugants as well as that of enterococcus faecalis transconjugants without changing its structure. in contrast, from the chromosome of an e. faecalis::tn3705 transconjugant only tn3704 inserted, at various sites, into another e. faecalis chromosome. sugar fermentations occurred after the insertion of tn3704 into the chromosome of an asaccharolytic e. faecalis strain. transposition of only tn3704  from the chromosome of e. faecalis::tn3705 onto pip964, an e. faecalis hemolysin  plasmid, yielded two different pip964 derivatives. the size of the entire element tn3705 was estimated to be about 70.0 kb by pulsed-field electrophoresis.

TI  == mucin-sulphatase activity of some oral streptococci.
AB  == mucin-sulphatase activity, measured using a 35s-[so4(2-)]-labelled colonic mucin  substrate, was detected in whole cells of streptococci isolated from the human oral cavity. the highest levels of sulphatase activity were found in all strains  of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis and in half of the strains of streptococcus mutans tested. little or no activity was detected in 9 of the 11 streptococcus oralis strains examined, in the 4 streptococcus constellatus strains, and in the 3 streptococcus anginosus isolates tested. the highest enzyme levels were obtained from the two fresh streptococcus gordonii isolates. this is  the first report of such activity in oral microorganisms. streptococcal mucin-sulphatase may contribute to the destruction of salivary mucins and mitigate their protective functions in the oral cavity, and be a determinant in the development of dental caries.

TI  == interaction of the salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with the bacterium streptococcus salivarius hb.
AB  == the interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. ep-gp could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of elisa or by electrophoresis in combination with western transfer. the results indicated that ep-gp is bound only by streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides fragilis, s. gordonii, s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. rattus, s. constellatus, and s. anginosus. binding of ep-gp to s. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be ph-dependent with a maximum binding between ph 5 and 6. for further characterization of the binding of ep-gp  to s. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. ep-gp was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. we were able to identify a 27-kd ep-gp binding protein, by extraction of s. salivarius-cell wall  antigens and electrophoretic techniques. in addition to ep-gp, s. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory iga and low-molecular-weight mucin (mg-2).

TI  == dog-associated bacterial infections in humans: isolates submitted to an australian reference laboratory, 1981-1992.
AB  == over the period 1981-92, 32 bacterial isolates were referred to the microbiological diagnostic unit from infected dog-bite wounds and 10 isolates were submitted from blood cultures after dog bites or close contact with dogs. the isolates from the bite wounds were identified, or confirmed, as pasteurella multocida (11 isolates), pasteurella dagmatis (3), cdc group m-5 (9), cdc group ef-4a (8) and streptococcus anginosus (1). five of the 9 patients from whom cdc group m-5 was cultured had mixed infections: 2 with p. multocida one of which also had bacteroides sp., one with p. dagmatis, one with cdc group ef-4a and another with bacteroides sp. nine of the 10 blood isolates were identified as capnocytophaga canimorsus. the remaining one of streptobacillus moniliformis, which is typically associated with rat-bite fever, was the result of a bite from  a breed of dog (greyhound) that eats rodents. clinical notes are provided for infections caused by the more unusual bacterial isolates and their laboratory identification is described.

TI  == the antimicrobial activity of prevention mouthrinse.
AB  == prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. to determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. a spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, serratia  marcescens and candida albicans. microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. mic determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to prevention mouthrinse, with mics ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold  dilutions. bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. brief (5-minute) exposure of s. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. under the constraints of this type of study, prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. we support the notion that prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. a 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.

TI  == the isolation and characterization of milleri group streptococci from dental periapical abscesses.
AB  == reports of the isolation of streptococci from dental abscesses have shown an association of the "s. milleri" group with such lesions. there has been considerable confusion regarding the taxonomy of these organisms, but the milleri group has recently been reclassified into three distinct species: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus intermedius. in this study, 45 samples from dental periapical abscesses were examined. milleri group streptococci were isolated from 16 patients (37%), 15 being identified as s. anginosus and one as s. intermedius. in one patient, s. anginosus was isolated in pure culture, and it would appear that this is the predominant species of milleri group streptococci associated with periapical abscesses.

TI  == [microbiological characteristics and spectrum of infections of 108 streptococcus  anginosus isolated].
AB  == background: the aim of the present study was to assess the key microbiologic characteristics aid in the identification of streptococcus anginosus in the laboratory and know the spectrum of clinical infections it produces. methods: from march 1991 to april 1992 all the isolated strains of clinical significant samples were collected. for identification the api 20 strep (biomerieux) system was used. the histories of the patients with infection by s. anginosus were retrospectively reviewed to collect clinical and microbiologic data of interest.  results: the 108 strains of st. anginosus isolated were diminute colonies on sheep blood agar with co2 enrichment. they had a characteristic smell, were beta-hemolitic or non hemolitic and of the lancefield group a, c, f, g or not groupable. all had invariable biochemical features in the api 20 strep: produced  acetone and alkaline phosphatase, hydrolized arginine, did not hydrolize hypurate nor did they ferment ribose. streptococcus anginosus produced purulent infections of different localization: abdominal, head-neck, pleuro-pulmonary, muscle-skeletal, skin and soft tissues and miscellaneous. most of these infections were polymicrobial (81.5%). conclusions: st. anginosus was easily identified in the laboratory by its morphologic characteristics and biochemical reaction in the api 20 strep. it produced a wide variety of supurative infections, some being severe: cerebral, pulmonary, hepatic, empyema abscess. the identification of this microorganism at a species level should contribute to better recognition as a pathogen of occassionally severe supurative infections.

TI  == the microbiologic aspects, including diagnosis, of beta-hemolytic streptococcal and enterococcal infections.
AB  == basic principles concerning the collection, transport, and processing of clinical specimens for the detection of streptococcaceae are given. identification of beta-hemolytic streptococci (s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, lancefield group c and g streptococci, s. anginosus) and enterococci is based on the careful observation of colony morphology and hemolytic pattern on sheep blood agar plates; subsequent genus or species confirmation is achieved by rather simple biochemical or enzymatic tests and by detection of streptococcal cell wall carbohydrate antigens (lancefield grouping). rapid antigen tests for the detection of group a and b streptococci directly from pharyngeal and vaginal swabs, respectively, are highly specific, thus allowing an immediate antibiotic therapy in patients with a positive test result. the reported sensitivities of these nonculture tests are too low to exclude streptococcal colonization or infection, however. the elucidation of the genetics of some major virulence factors of group a and b streptococci has contributed to knowledge of their association with disease, and  molecular techniques have supplemented the traditional (mostly culture and serologic) methods for an improved understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of streptococcal infections. recently employed examples include the  m protein gene typing of group a streptococci by oligonucleotide probes and the use of pcr assays for the detection of the genes encoding for the pyrogenic exotoxins. restriction enzyme endonuclease digestions of bacterial dna in association with dna fragment separation by conventional or pfge have been applied successfully to several species of streptococcaceae (e.g., s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae). enterococci are important pathogens in the hospital setting, exhibiting high morbidity and mortality rates in bacteremic patients with severe  underlying disease. molecular typing methods have clearly confirmed their potential to be nosocomially transmitted. e. faecalis and e. faecium still account for the majority of human infections, but some of the newer enterococcal  species (at present 19 species are recognized) have been encountered as well. the definitive species identification of enterococci requires the performance of an array of biochemical tests. the increasing antimicrobial resistance of enterococci, including high-level resistance to penicillins and aminoglycosides and occasionally also to glycopeptides, has hampered standard therapeutic regimens. all enterococci isolated from serious infections should be tested for high-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance by one of several methods evaluated; beta-lactamase production (primarily found in e. faecalis) is reliably detected by the nitrocefin test.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == role of beta-hemolytic group c streptococci in pharyngitis: incidence and biochemical characteristics of streptococcus equisimilis and streptococcus anginosus in patients and healthy controls.
AB  == the biochemical characteristics and the isolation rates of the two lancefield group c streptococcal species (s. equisimilis and s. anginosus) from patients with pharyngitis and asymptomatic controls were compared. some 239 strains of beta-hemolytic group c streptococci were isolated from 1,480 patients (209 strains) with pharyngitis and 227 controls (30 strains). a total of 44 strains displayed broad hemolysis, were voges-proskauer test negative, and produced glucuronidase. some 72.7% of these strains also fermented ribose. a second group  of 159 strains was voges-proskauer test positive and glucuronidase negative; 98.8% also displayed minute hemolysis and only 3.7% fermented ribose. these two groups represent typical large-colony s. equisimilis and small-colony s. anginosus, respectively. a small number of strains (36 in total) exhibited intermediate characteristics; morphologically, all 36 strains resembled s. anginosus, but 6 strains biochemically resembled s. equisimilis. no strains of s. equisimilis fermented sorbitol (unlike s. zooepidemicus) and all fermented trehalose (unlike s. equi). the structural carbohydrate profiles of s. equisimilis and s. anginosus both included galactosamine (consistent with their being group c organisms), but the profiles were not distinguishable. in total, 78.5% of strains from controls and 83.3% of strains from patients were determined to be the species s. anginosus. s. equisimilis was isolated from 3.0% of patients and 2.2% of controls, and s. anginosus was isolated from 11.1% of patients and 11.0% of controls. thus, s. equisimilis and s. anginosus are both members of the  normal flora of asymptomatic individuals. the incidence and biochemical characteristics of these two species are similar in patients who are healthy and  those who have disease. however, a companion article provides clinical evidence associating s. equisimilis (but not s. anginosus) with pharyngitis.

AB  == the multiple sugar metabolism (msm) operon of streptococcus mutans is responsible for the uptake and metabolism of a variety of sugars. in order to further characterize the substrate specificities of the transport system, a 12-kb region  of dna containing the entire msm operon was cloned, via a novel two-step integration strategy, into the chromosomes of two heterologous streptococcal strains, streptococcus gordonii challis and streptococcus anginosus is57, as well as the chromosome of a natural isolate of s. mutans with a deletion of the msm region. these strains are unable to transport or ferment melibiose, raffinose, or isomaltosaccharides, but the newly constructed recombinants gained the ability to ferment all of these sugars. the s. gordonii challis construct containing msm was shown to transport radiolabelled melibiose, raffinose, isomaltotriose, and isomaltotetraose, and the transport function was also subjected to induction by raffinose, an inducer of the msm operon in s. mutans. the results confirm the role of the msm operon in the transport and metabolism of melibiose, raffinose, and isomaltosaccharides.

AB  == the isolation frequency and distribution of eight recently defined streptococcal  species have been investigated in the saliva of adults and that of both predentate and dentate children. the effects of frequency of sugar intake and tooth presence on the distribution of streptococcal species were also analyzed. saliva samples were collected from 121 subjects divided into three study groups:  (a) 56 predentate children (predentate group), (b) 37 dentate children (dentate group), and (c) 28 adults (adult group). up to 17 biochemical and enzymatic tests were used to categorize streptococcal isolates into s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. mutans, and s. gordonii. the mean total and streptococcal salivary colony-forming units (cfu) were lowest in the predentate group and highest in the adult group. streptococci  were found in all the study subjects, and there was no obvious relationship between the total or streptococcal cfu and the number of teeth or the frequency of sugar intake. there was a wide variation in the isolation frequency of streptococcal species in the three study groups. s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. salivarius were the most frequent species isolated, and together they comprised 83% of the total streptococcal isolates. in contrast to studies using older classifications, s. sanguis was a minor species in the saliva though found more often in adults than in children (p < 0.04). s. anginosus was a minor species found in about 10% of adults and children. s. gordonii was detected rarely and only in dentate subjects. s. mutans was detected only in dentate subjects, significantly greater in adults (57.1%) than in children (5.4%, p < 0.001).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

"streptococcus milleri group" is a term for a large group of streptococci which includes streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus anginosus. usually considered commensals, these organisms are often associated with various pyogenic infections including cardiac, abdominal, skin and central nervous system infections. organisms of the "streptococcus milleri group" are often unrecognized pathogens due to the lack of uniformity in classifications and difficulties in microbiological identification. penicillin g, cephalosporins, clindamycin and vancomycin all possess activity against these streptococci. use of agents with poor activity may promote infections with "streptococcus milleri group" and allow it to exhibit its pathogenicity. an understanding of these organisms may aid in their recognition and proper treatment.

TI  == biological characterisation of group f streptococci causing human infections.
AB  == fifty five strains of group f streptococci (gfs) isolated from clinical samples of 53 patients with diverse diseases, were characterised by a battery of physiological tests. among them 37 (67%) were streptococcus anginosus f, 14 (25%) were strep. intermedius, two of which were mannitol positive and 4 (7%) were strep. constellatus. determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations of penicillin, erythromycin, ampicillin, gentamicin and cefazolin showed that despite their biochemical heterogeneity, all strains were uniformly susceptible to these antibiotics. except for bacteraemia, other diseases due to gfs responded well to surgical drainage and/or antibiotics.

TI  == bactericidal titers of loracarbef (ly 163892) in serum and killing rates in volunteers receiving 400 versus 200 milligrams.
AB  == in a randomized crossover trial, six volunteers received 200- and 400-mg doses of loracarbef (ly 163892), a new oral cephalosporin. mean +/- standard error of the  mean concentrations in serum obtained after 1.5 and 3 h were 13.2 +/- 2.8 and 4.3 +/- 0.7 mg/liter, respectively, after the 400-mg dose and 6.9 +/- 1.0 and 1.7 +/- 0.2 mg/liter, respectively, after the 200-mg dose. bactericidal reciprocal titers measured against respiratory pathogens in serum suggested that loracarbef would be highly effective against streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes (median titers, 8 to 128 at 1.5 h and less than 2 to 32 at 3 h) and beta-lactamase-negative haemophilus influenzae (median titers, 4 at 1.5 h and 2 to 4 at 3 h). other species (branhamella catarrhalis, streptococcus anginosus, staphylococcus aureus) were associated with lower bactericidal titers. killing curves performed against 12 strains demonstrated that the bioactivity of loracarbef (measured by the reduction in the area under the control growth curve) was significantly correlated with the concentration/mic ratio, whereas the initial rate of killing was not, once the concentration was greater than the mic. our results suggest that administration of 400 mg of loracarbef every 8 h might be associated with more favorable pharmacodynamic parameters against target bacteria.

TI  == infectious arthritis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  == eleven cases of infectious arthritis occurring in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are reported. staphylococcus aureus was the causative organism in eight patients. streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus agalactiae in one patient each, and mycobacterium tuberculosis in two patients. the mean duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 16 days in patients with pyogenic arthritis. the diagnosis of joint infection caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis was especially  delayed (57 days). four patients died; they were found to have a longer time to diagnosis and two of them had multiple joint infection. although staphylococcus aureus is the microorganism most often affecting patients with rheumatoid arthritis, infection caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis must also be considered in such patients.

TI  == a numerical taxonomic study of the "streptococcus milleri" group based upon conventional phenotypic tests and pyrolysis mass spectrometry.
AB  == clinical strains presumptively identified as streptococcus milleri (60), and blind coded collection strains (21) were characterised in conventional tests and  pyrolysis mass spectrometry. comparison of the clusters found by these two approaches revealed five clearly distinct centres of variation. three corresponded to the dna homology groups suggested by whiley and hardie (1989) as  representing the species s. anginosus, s. intermedius and s. constellatus; a fourth comprised three lancefield group c beta-haemolytic strains; the fifth may  represent a biotype of s. anginosus. the characteristics of the latter group are  described.

AB  == the associations of streptococcus intermedius, s. constellatus, and s. anginosus  (the three species of the s. milleri group) with clinical infections and sites of isolation were investigated by using a simple biochemical scheme to identify a collection of 153 clinical isolates. s. intermedius was associated with abscesses of the brain and liver, while both s. anginosus and s. constellatus were isolated from a wider range of sites and infections. s. anginosus strains predominated in  both genitourinary and gastrointestinal sources and exhibited a wider range of phenotypes, particularly in the ability to ferment mannitol and/or raffinose.

TI  == a scheme for the identification of viridans streptococci.
AB  == a collection of strains representing all the currently recognised species of oral or viridans streptococci (streptococcus sanguis, s. parasanguis, s. gordonii, s.  oralis, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. vestibularis, s. anginosus, s. constellatus,  s. intermedius, s. mutans and s. sobrinus) were tested for the production of a range of glycosidase activities with 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked fluorogenic substrates, and for reactions in a range of conventional fermentation and hydrolytic tests. the resulting biochemical scheme, consisting of 14 tests, enabled the differentiation of all these species and distinguished three biotypes within s. sanguis. the scheme reported here represents an improvement over currently available schemes for the identification of viridans streptococci.

TI  == [studies on clinical significance of "streptococcus milleri group" in respiratory infections].
AB  == "streptococcus milleri group" are the part of the indigenous oral flora, and they are proposed to contain three distinct species: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus intermedius. though not included in the approved lists of bacterial names, "s. milleri group" are regarded as the causative organisms of suppurative infections, such as oral abscess, brain abscess, lung abscess and empyema. i have studied the clinical significance of the "s. milleri group" in respiratory infections. an investigation was performed  to confirm the incidence of "s. milleri group" colonization in healthy 120 volunteers' (20 y/o-80 y/o) throats, and it was found that 11.7% (14/120) were positive. on the other hand, attention should be paid to the fact that the "s. milleri group" was highly isolated, 24 (24.7%) in 97 purulent respiratory specimens (94 sputa and 3 throat swabs) from which no other significant microorganism was recovered. i have measured the serum antibody titers of the "s. milleri group", employing the ifa technique, in 10 patients from whose specimens  "s. milleri group" was predominantly isolated, and compared with those of 18 healthy volunteers. whereas all of the titers of healthy volunteers reveal less than 1:256, those of the patients reveal more than 1:512. and antibody titers to  "s. milleri group" showed the highest in two weeks after "s. milleri group" isolation, and came down to healthy adult levels in six weeks or more. thus far,  about half of the causative organisms of acute pneumonia have been reported unknown. in this study i have suggested that the "s. milleri group" plays an important role as the causative organism in respiratory infections including pneumonia.

TI  == a modified mitis salivarius medium for a caries diagnostic test.
AB  == a new medium, mskb, composed of mitis salivarius agar base, sorbitol, kanamycin sulfate and bacitracin, has been developed that is more selective for recovery of mutans streptococci (mutans) than the so called mitis salivarius bacitracin (msb) medium. msb and mskb were compared for recovery and selectivity of mutans by plating saliva samples as well as pure cultures on both media. sixty saliva samples were plated and counted for mutans and non-mutans colonies. thirty-six samples had greater numbers of non-mutans on msb than on mskb, and 14 of the 36 had non-mutans colonies that could be visually confused with mutants. the recovery of mutans on mskb was approximately 13% less than on msb. the selectivity and recovery of msb and mskb were evaluated over 1-5 months of storage at 4 degrees c. streptococcus anginosus grew on msb after 1 month, but not on mskb. streptococcus milleri type 2 grew on both media after 4 months.

TI  == intrageneric structure of streptococcus based on comparative analysis of small-subunit rrna sequences.
AB  == the partial 16s rrna sequences of 24 streptococcus species were determined by reverse transcription. a comparative analysis of these sequences and the sequences of seven previously studied streptococcal species revealed the presence of several clusters within the genus. the clusters obtained from the sequence analysis agreed in general with the groups outlined on the basis of the results of nucleic acid hybridization studies, but there were some exceptions. the pyogenic group was extended to include streptococcus agalactiae, s. parauberis, s. porcinus, and s. uberis. four oral groups were discerned; these four groups centered on s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, and s. oralis. some species (e.g., s. suis and s. acidominimus) did not cluster with any particular group. our findings are discussed in the context of data from other genetic and chemotaxonomic studies.

TI  == ecology of viridans streptococci in the oral cavity and pharynx.
AB  == recently published taxonomic studies of viridans streptococci have resulted in several changes in the nomenclature and definition of oral streptococcal species. with this background, the ecology of streptococci in the oropharyngeal cavities was reinvestigated. the results based on the examination of 1426 streptococcal isolates confirmed and extended earlier findings. apart from mature supragingival plaque, which contained a mixture of all orally encountered streptococci, each site showed a characteristic streptococcal flora. initial dental plaque formation is primarily associated with streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis biovar 1  and streptococcus oralis. our investigation showed that s. sanguis and s. mitis biovar 1 were the most prominent streptococci, also on buccal mucosa. in contrast, s. oralis was almost exclusively found in initial dental plaque. streptococcus gordonii, formerly part of s. sanguis, was found in small numbers on the oropharyngeal mucosa and in mature supragingival plaque. the dorsum of the tongue was dominated by s. mitis biovar 2 and streptococcus salivarius, the latter of which was predominant also on the pharyngeal mucosa. streptococcus anginosus was by far the most predominant streptococcus in subgingival plaque. immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease-producing streptococci were primarily isolated  from initial dental plaque and from the buccal mucosa. this lends further support to the concept of iga1 proteases being important for the ability of streptococci  to evade the local immune defence during their initial colonization of certain oral surfaces.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by treponema denticola, porphyromonas  gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga orchracea, capnocytophaga sp., actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis. the enzymes produced by capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while  the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mm chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mm inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. these observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.

TI  == streptococcus milleri group (streptococcus anginosus): recovery from intra-abdominal and soft tissue sites.
AB  == one hundred thirty-three streptococcus milleri group (s. anginosus) isolates were recovered from 487 surgical patients. the streptococci were recovered from 33 percent of intra-abdominal infection cultures (84/257). 22 percent of samples from penetrating visceral trauma (19/86), 52 percent of perirectal abscess specimens (13/25), 13 percent of nonpuerperal breast abscess cultures (8/60), and 15 percent of diabetic foot lesions (9/59). ninety-eight percent of the s. milleri (131/133) were recovered as companion flora in polymicrobial cultures. the organisms were highly susceptible to the beta-lactam antibiotics. the precise pathogenic role of the s. milleri group (s. anginosus) is unknown. however, intrinsic virulence may be expressed in patients with severe infection or other predisposing factors.

TI  == emended descriptions and recognition of streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus intermedius, and streptococcus anginosus as distinct species.
AB  == strains currently classified as streptococcus anginosus include strains previously identified as streptococcus constellatus (prevot 1924) holdeman and moore 1974, streptococcus intermedius (prevot 1925), and "streptococcus milleri"  (guthof 1956) because these specific epithets were argued to be later synonyms of streptococcus anginosus (andrewes and horder 1906) smith and sherman 1938 by coykendall et al. (int. j. syst. bacteriol. 37:222-228, 1987). however, recent data from dna-dna hybridization experiments, whole-cell-derived polypeptide patterns determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and data from phenotypic testing have demonstrated that streptococcus anginosus strains represent three readily identifiable taxa to which the previously assigned type strains of streptococcus constellatus (strain ncdo 2226 [= atcc 27823], streptococcus intermedius (strain ncdo 2227 [= atcc 27335], and streptococcus anginosus (strain nctc 10713 [= atcc 33397] have been shown to belong. therefore, we propose recognition of streptococcus constellatus (emend.)  (type strain ncdo 2226 [= atcc 27823]), streptococcus intermedius (emend.) (type  strain ncdo 2227 [= atcc 27335]), and streptococcus anginosus (emend.) (type strain nctc 10713 [= atcc 33397]) as distinct species and propose an emended description of each of these taxa.

TI  == applications of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis) typing in a longitudinal study of the oral carriage of beta-haemolytic streptococci by a group of dunedin schoolchildren.
AB  == a longitudinal study of the distribution of oral beta-haemolytic streptococci in  103 children (ages 5-6 y) attending three dunedin schools was initiated in february 1987. a total of 858 paired pharyngeal and saliva specimens were obtained in nine principal sampling sessions, the last being in may 1989. the detection rate of lancefield group a streptococci in directly plated pharyngeal cultures (19.8%) was considerably higher than in the corresponding saliva cultures (5.1%). by contrast, lancefield group f and serologically non-groupable  beta-haemolytic streptococcus anginosus tended to be more prevalent in saliva (10.9% positive) than in pharyngeal specimens (7.1%). group a streptococci were recovered at least once from 59 (57.3%) of the subjects. representative beta-haemolytic streptococcus isolates were typed according to their production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (blis) and by traditional serological techniques. the epidemiological value of blis typing was particularly evident in  that both blis-positive and blis-negative strains could be differentiated within  serotypes m1, m12 and m22 and also the serologically not typable group a streptococcus isolates. ten children consistently had small numbers of group a streptococci present in their pharyngeal cultures, for periods of at least 12 months. in six of these subjects the carried strain was m-type 4/blis-type 655. this study has shown that in young schoolchildren long-term carriage of a variety of species of beta-haemolytic streptococci with little associated clinical evidence of infection may be common.

TI  == group c streptococcal arthritis: case report and review.
AB  == streptococci account for approximately 15%-20% of cases of nongonococcal septic arthritis. the majority of these are due to group a streptococci, but group b and group g streptococci are being isolated more frequently. we present a case of group c streptococcal arthritis and summarize nine additional cases reported in the literature. the group c streptococci include the large colony of voges-proskauer-negative bacteria (streptococcus equi, streptococcus equisimilis, streptococcus zooepidemicus, and streptococcus dysgalactiae) as well as as the minute colony of voges-proskauer-positive streptococcus anginosus ("streptococcus milleri") group c organisms. any joint may become infected, but joints affected by preexisting rheumatologic abnormalities are more frequently involved. bacteremia was documented in five of the 10 patients. one patient had an associated pneumonia, and another patient had an associated acute aortic valve endocarditis. none of the infections involved a prosthetic joint or an overlying  cellulitis, associations reported for group g streptococcal arthritis. surgical drainage of the infected joint was required in six of the 10 patients. we concluded that the presence of two groups of organisms sharing the same lancefield group antigen necessitates the careful identification of isolates to determine potential clinical differences.

TI  == phenotypic differentiation of streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus anginosus strains within the "streptococcus milleri group".
AB  == a biochemical scheme was developed by which strains of streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus intermedius, and streptococcus anginosus can reliably be distinguished from within the "streptococcus milleri group." strains identified as s. intermedius were differentiated by the ability to produce detectable levels of alpha-glucosidase, beta-galactosidase, beta-d-fucosidase, beta-n-acetylgalactosaminidase, beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase, and sialidase with  4-methylumbelliferyl-linked fluorogenic substrates in microdilution trays after 3 h of incubation at 37 degrees c, together with the production of hyaluronidase. strains of s. constellatus and s. anginosus were differentiated by the production of alpha-glucosidase and hyaluronidase by the former and the production of beta-glucosidase by the latter. the majority of strains of the s. milleri group obtained from dental plaque were identified as s. intermedius, as were most strains isolated from abscesses of the brain and liver. strains of s. constellatus and s. anginosus were from a wider variety of infections, both oral  and nonoral, than were strains of s. intermedius, with the majority of strains from urogenital infections being identified as s. anginosus.

TI  == sialidase activity of the "streptococcus milleri group" and other viridans group  streptococci.

TI  == coaggregation of streptococcus sanguis and other streptococci with candida albicans.
AB  == thirteen strains of viridans group streptococci and two strains of other streptococci were tested for coaggregation with candida albicans. streptococcus sanguis strains generally exhibited low levels of adherence to 28 degrees c-grown exponential-phase yeast cells, but starvation of yeast cells for glucose at 37 degrees c (or at 28 degrees c) increased their coaggregating activity with these  streptococci by at least tenfold. this was a property common to four c. albicans  strains tested, two of which were able to form mycelia (6406 and men) and two of  which were not (mm2002 and ca2). the expression of the coaggregation adhesin during yeast cell starvation was inhibited by addition of trichodermin or amphotericin b. the strains of s. sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus oralis tested for coaggregating activity encompassed a diverse range of physiological and morphological types, yet all exhibited saturable coaggregation with starved c. albicans cells. there was no correlation of cell surface hydrophobicity, of either yeast or streptococcal cells, with their abilities to coaggregate. strains of streptococcus anginosus also coaggregated with starved yeast cells; streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus pyogenes coaggregated to a lesser degree with c. albicans, and the coaggregation with s. pyogenes was not promoted by yeast cell starvation; streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis did not coaggregate with yeast. the coaggregation reactions of s. sanguis and s. gordonii with c. albicans were inhibited by edta and by heat or protease treatment of the yeast cells and were not reversible by the addition  of lactose or other simple sugars. these observations extend the range of intergeneric coaggregations that are known to occur between oral microbes and suggest that coaggregations of c. albicans with viridans group streptococci may be important for colonization of oral surfaces by the yeast.

TI  == surface-associated properties of streptococcus milleri group strains and their potential relation to pathogenesis.
AB  == thirty strains from the streptococcus milleri (anginosus) group (smg) obtained from various sources were tested for a range of characters that could be associated with pathogenicity and the results were compared with those for type strains of s. sanguis, s. mutans and s. pyogenes. the smg strains were heterogeneous in all tests. most (18) belonged to one of the lancefield groups with group f predominating. adherence of strains isolated from abscesses to buccal epithelial cells was greater than that of other strains (p = 0.033). compared with strains of s. sanguis, smg strains were generally not aggregated by human saliva. they differed from the type strain of s. pyogenes in their relative ability to bind fibrinogen and fibronectin; they were less effective in binding fibrinogen (0.33-4.28% cf. 22% for s. pyogenes) and generally more effective in binding fibronectin (0.49-12.37% cf. 0.95%). strains isolated from infections were statistically better at binding fibronectin than other strains (p less than  0.001). the ability of strains to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha) varied 10-fold, from 0.16-16.35%. the amount of fibronectin bound by smg strains  correlated with their ability to adhere to sha (p less than 0.001). the hydrophobicity of the strains, as measured in the hexadecane partition assay, ranged from 0.0% to 99.0%. some strains carried both positive and negative cell-surface charges and some strains with a highly hydrophobic cell surface also possessed a relatively high cell-surface charge. a minority of strains possessed  a net positive cell-surface charge. neither hydrophobicity nor cell-surface charge was related to the capacity of strains to adhere to sha. strains of smg co-aggregated weakly with strains of veillonella parvula, v. dispar, actinomyces  viscosus and a. naeslundii.

AB  == twenty-five strains resembling 'streptococcus milleri' were compared by dna-dna hybridization, by whole-cell-derived polypeptide patterns on sds-page, and by biochemical tests. four homology groups were revealed by dna-dna hybridization. dna homology groups 1, 2 and 3 were closely related and contained the type strains ncdo 2226 (streptococcus constellatus), ncdo 2227 (streptococcus intermedius) and nctc 10713 (streptococcus anginosus), respectively. dna homology group 4 consisted of four strains received as variants of streptococcus intermedius which were found not to be closely related to strains in groups 1-3.  the data from sds-page polypeptide patterns and biochemical tests supported the recognition of three centres of variation within the 'streptococcus milleri group' corresponding to dna homology groups 1-3 and indicated that strains of dna homology group 4 are members of an as yet undescribed species within the viridans streptococci.

TI  == adherence of oral streptococci to composite resin restorative materials.
AB  == the frequency of oral streptococcal bacterial isolates detected on composite resin squares attached to maxillary first molars in 12 volunteers was 62.1 per cent. these cocci consisted of streptococcus mitior (52.8 per cent), s. sanguis (20.2 per cent), s. oralis (8.6 per cent), s. salivarius (1.0 per cent) and s. anginosus (0.3 per cent). an electron microscopic study of these organisms labelled with [3h]thymidine for in vitro adhesiveness to the resin revealed that  s. mitior was the most adhesive, and that its pronounced adhesiveness is associated with its characteristic extracellular ultrastructure.

TI  == classification and identification of the viridans streptococci.
AB  == this review traces the history of the human, nonhemolytic, or viridans, streptococci and describes improvements in their taxonomy wrought by study of their biochemical profiles and analysis of their nucleic acids. the goal was to define species on the basis of genetic relationships and to describe these species by their phenotypic characteristics so that they can be easily identified. this method has resulted in the division of some species. streptococcus mutans has been divided into four species, two of which are common  in humans. three more mutans group species are indigenous to animals. conversely, s. constellatus, s. intermedius, and "s. milleri" have been combined under s. anginosus. s. mitis (or "s. mitior") can be well-defined and includes s. sanguis  ii. there is genetic heterogeneity within s. sanguis, but the species is usually  easy to identify. there is also some heterogeneity in s. bovis, but most human isolates are genetically related. discussions of the taxonomy of these species are accompanied by descriptions of the characteristics by which these streptococci can be identified. among these species are potential pathogens which should be suspected in cases of endocarditis and purulent infections of liver, brain, and other tissues.

TI  == a qualitative and quantitative study of the cellular fatty acids of 'streptococcus milleri' with capillary gas chromatography.
AB  == fatty acid analysis was done with gc and gc-ms on 21 strains of 'streptococcus milleri', representative of the various proposed species. although no qualitative differences were found in the fatty acid profiles, discriminant analysis of the quantitative data revealed three groups. streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus constellatus were indistinguishable but separated from the other two groups which comprised streptococcus intermedius, with a wide fermentation pattern and streptococcus intermedius with a narrow fermentation pattern. three of the strains could be distinguished from the others by a 'fingerprint' of a particularly prominent fatty acid peak. the results support the suggestion that there is more than one species in this group of organisms and that the technique  might be of value in epidemiological investigations of 's. milleri'.

TI  == [taxonomic studies of the streptococcus intermedius strains isolated from human oral cavities].
AB  == human oral isolates of streptococcus intermedius, which were biochemically identified, have been classified into 5-serogroups (i-v). selecting some representive stock cultures together with the type strain atcc 27335, comparisons were carried out between them in terms of cell extractable proteins, g + c mol% values, dna-dna homology and dna restriction fragments. since the taxon of s. intermedius has not been clarified, comparison was also made between the above strains and the type strains of the "streptococcus anginosus-milleri group", streptococcus anginosus, "streptococcus milleri" and streptococcus constellatus,  which were thought to be related to s. intermedius. 1. g + c mol% of s. intermedius atcc 27335 was 38.0 +/- 0.28. the values of all the isolates tested ranged from 37.0 to 38.8. on the other hand, the values of the type strains of the "s. anginosus-milleri group" were 38.0-38.8. 2. under stringent conditions of dna-dna hybridization, all the isolates showed more than 66.7% homology with s. intermedius atcc 27335, demonstrating that these strains belonged to the same species. on the other hand, s. anginosus atcc 33397, "s. milleri" nctc 11169 and  s. constellatus atcc 27823 hybridized at levels of 50%, 53% and 28%, respectively. consequently, it was impossible to classify these strains as being  the same species as s. intermedius. 3. when the dna restriction fragments were compared by page, the strains of serogroups i and v showed the same pattern, respectively. the strains of serogroups ii and iii, however, showed two different patterns, and these of serogroup iv showed five different patterns. dna fragments specific to s. intermedius could not be identified. 4. when cell extractable groups were compared by sds-page, the strains of serogroups i and v showed identical patterns. the strains of serogroup iii showed 2 different patterns and  those of serogroup iv showed 5 patterns. these results reflected those of the dna restriction analysis. however, the strains of serogroup ii showed the same protein pattern, although 2 different patterns were observed in dna restriction fragments. unique proteins, which were not detected in the proteins extracted from the type strains of the "s. anginosus-milleri group", were observed in the cell proteins of s. intermedius strains. 5. the results of dna-dna hybridization  and the existence of unique extractable proteins together with the chondroitinase productivity suggest that the strains of s. intermedius might represent a particular taxon among the strains of the "s. anginosus-milleri group".(abstract  truncated at 400 words)

TI  == clinically significant streptococcus anginosus (streptococcus milleri) infections: a review of 186 cases.
AB  == we describe clinically significant infections due to streptococcus anginosus in 186 patients; 114 (61.3%) males and 72 (38.7%) females, median age 42 years, range 9 months to 93 years. in 101 (54.3%) cases s anginosus alone caused infection and in 85 (45.7%) cases it was associated with other microorganisms. abscesses accounted for 110 (59.1%) infections. sites of infection were: miscellaneous skin and soft tissue, 64 (34.4%), intraabdominal 41 (22%), head and neck 34 (18.3%), pleuropulmonary 22 (11.8%), genitourinary 9 (4.8%), musculoskeletal 6 (3.2%), endocarditis 5 (2.7%) and primary bacteraemia 5 (2.7%). treatment consisted of antibiotic therapy which was often prolonged, median 30 days, range 2-90 days, and surgery in 159 (85.5%). s anginosus infection was a contributory factor in two of the three deaths which occurred.

TI  == do the beta-hemolytic non-group a streptococci cause pharyngitis?
AB  == implication of the beta-hemolytic non-group a streptococci (bhnas) as pharyngeal  pathogens has been based predominantly on reports of a few outbreaks, small case  clusters, and anecdotes. these organisms have long been noted to constitute a significant number of the beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates from throats of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in a variety of populations. laboratory studies have demonstrated the usefulness of anaerobic atmosphere and prolonged incubation in maximizing isolation of the bhnas. more recently, genetic studies have furthered our appreciation of the taxonomy and have defined two major groups: streptococcus anginosus-milleri group and large-colony bhnas; the latter  can be further separated on the basis of serogrouping and biotyping. recognition  of this diversity gives justification to the reexamination of the epidemiology and disease course of bhnas pharyngitis. treatment studies will also be required  if all or subsets of these organisms can be confirmed as pharyngeal pathogens.

TI  == streptococcus anginosus ("streptococcus milleri"): the unrecognized pathogen.
AB  == "streptococcus milleri" is an unofficial name that has been applied to a group of streptococci which, although basically similar, show various hemolytic, serological, and physiological characteristics. the species name streptococcus anginosus has recently been recognized as the approved name for these organisms.  streptococci known as "s. milleri" have been implicated as etiologic agents in a  variety of serious purulent infections, but because of their heterogeneous characteristics, these organisms may be unrecognized or misidentified by clinical laboratorians. this review describes the bacteriological aspects of organisms known as "s. milleri," their clinical significance, and the problems encountered  with their identification in the clinical laboratory.

TI  == evaluation of the api 20 strep system for species identification of "viridans" streptococci isolated from bacteremia.
AB  == species identifications of 71 strains of viridans streptococci isolated from blood and 4 reference strains were made by the api 20 strep system (api system s. a., montalieu-vercien, france) and the conventional method. there are high levels of agreement between results obtained with the both methods for determining acidification from carbohydrate except inulin. the api 20 strep system correctly  identified 74.7% of the viridans streptococci with 9.3% low descrimination, 12% incorrect and 4% unidentified. all strains of s. mitis, s. mutans, s. salivarius  and s. anginosus-constellatus were correctly identified. the correct identification rates for s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii and s. mg-intermedius were 88.9%, 68% and 61% respectively. the difference of inulin reaction and the taxonomy discrepancy may be the cause of different identification. the study indicates that the api 20 strep system has a good potentiality for species identification of viridans streptococci at present time, however, further refinement in needed.

TI  == fatty acid composition of streptococcus milleri.
AB  == the cellular fatty acids of 31 strains belonging to the streptococcus milleri group were analysed by capillary gas-liquid chromatography. results were compared with findings from biochemical differentiation of the strains into streptococcus  constellatus (two strains), streptococcus anginosus (16 strains) and streptococcus intermedius (13 strains). eight strains of various other streptococci were included as internal references, including three strains of streptococcus morbillorum, three strains of beta-hemolytic streptococci, and two  strains of enterococci. the streptococcus milleri strains formed a very homogeneous group according to fatty acid composition and were easily differentiated from other groups. however, within the group, it was not possible  to differentiate streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus intermedius by fatty acid composition alone.

TI  == prevalence of viridans streptococci exhibiting lactose-inhibitable coaggregation  with oral actinomycetes.
AB  == fresh oral isolates from human dental plaque were selected on the basis of their  spherical morphology. in a double-blind experiment, their species identity and ability to coaggregate with human oral actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii were determined. of the 110 isolates characterized, 30 were identified as either streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus-constellatus, or veillonella parvula; none of these coaggregated with the actinomycetes. the remaining 80 isolates were identified as streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mg-intermedius, or streptococcus morbillorum. of these 49 isolates (61%) coaggregated with actinomycetes, and nearly 90% (43 of 49 isolates) exhibited lactose-inhibitable coaggregations. compared with previously  characterized coaggregation properties determined with stock culture strains of streptococci, 82% of the fresh isolates exhibited identical coaggregations. the other 18% made up a new coaggregation group that possessed a related lactose-inhibitable coaggregation pattern. thus, most fresh isolates that coaggregated exhibited lactose-inhibitable coaggregations with human oral actinomycetes. it is suggested that these coaggregations are mediated by a network of lectin-carbohydrate interactions similar to those already characterized in previous studies with stock cultures of actinomycetes and streptococci.

TI  == bacteriology of experimental gingivitis in young adult humans.
AB  == from replicate trials of experimental gingivitis in four periodontally healthy subjects, 166 bacterial species and subspecies were detected among 3,034 randomly selected isolates from 96 samples. of these bacteria, actinomyces naeslundii (serotype iii and phenotypically similar strains that were unreactive with available antisera), actinomyces odontolyticus (serotype i and phenotypically similar strains that were unreactive with available antisera), fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus species d-2, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella parvula, and treponema species a appeared to be the most likely etiological agents of gingivitis. statistical interpretations indicated that the greatest source of microbiological variation of the total flora observed was person-to-person differences in the floras. the next greatest source of variation was the inflammatory status of the sample sites. person-to-person differences were smallest at experimental day 4. the floras became more diverse with time and as gingivitis developed and progressed. analyses indicated that sequential colonization by certain species was repeatable and therefore probably predictable. variation was relatively small between replicate trials, between two sites on the same teeth sampled on the same day, and between the same sites sampled at the same relative time in a replicate trial.

TI  == infections due to lancefield group f and related streptococci (s. milleri, s. anginosus).
AB  == we can no longer accept classification of streptococci solely on the basis of hemolytic reactions or lancefield agglutinations. while the "viridans" streptococci cannot be serologically differentiated, physiological separation of  the species offers a satisfactory method of classifying human isolates. we review the microbiology of lancefield group f and related streptococci (s. milleri, s. anginosus), emphasizing microbial ecology and current taxonomic considerations. a series of 28 patients infected with these organisms is presented. there was a striking male predominance in the series (6:1) as well as an obvious association  with underlying diseases and/or antecedent trauma. the most remarkable feature of these pathogens is their predilection for abscess formation, confirming their overdue recognition as the most common "viridans" streptococcus recovered from abscesses within internal organs. we observed purulent disease of the nervous and skeletal systems, oral cavity, lung and pleural space, abdomen and subcutaneous tissues. microbial synergy (i.e. polymicrobic infection) was not a requisite for  abscess formation. four of the five deaths in this series occurred in patients 60 years of age of older. some degree of variability in antimicrobial susceptibility was noted, so speciation alone may not always provide sufficient information on which to base a therapeutic decision.
