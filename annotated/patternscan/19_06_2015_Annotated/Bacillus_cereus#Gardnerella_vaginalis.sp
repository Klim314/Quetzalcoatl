TI  == anova-like differential expression (aldex) analysis for mixed population rna-seq.
AB  == experimental variance is a major challenge when dealing with high-throughput sequencing data. this variance has several sources: sampling replication, technical replication, variability within biological conditions, and variability  between biological conditions. the high per-sample cost of rna-seq often precludes the large number of experiments needed to partition observed variance into these categories as per standard anova models. we show that the partitioning of within-condition to between-condition variation cannot reasonably be ignored,  whether in single-organism rna-seq or in meta-rna-seq experiments, and further find that commonly-used rna-seq analysis tools, as described in the literature, do not enforce the constraint that the sum of relative expression levels must be  one, and thus report expression levels that are systematically distorted. these two factors lead to misleading inferences if not properly accommodated. as it is  usually only the biological between-condition and within-condition differences that are of interest, we developed aldex, an anova-like differential expression procedure, to identify genes with greater between- to within-condition differences. we show that the presence of differential expression and the magnitude of these comparative differences can be reasonably estimated with even  very small sample sizes.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and spectrum of rifaximin, a new topical rifamycin derivative.
AB  == rifaximin, a rifamycin derivative, was evaluated in vitro to assess its spectrum  and potency against a wide variety of bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and parasites. high concentrations of rifaximin were often used to reflect topically achieved levels since this compound is poorly absorbed by oral route. like rifampin, rifaximin possessed best activity against staphylococcus spp. (mic50 < or = 0.015 microgram/ml), streptococcus spp. (mic50s, < or = 0.03-0.12 microgram/ml), enterococcus spp. (mic50s, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml), bacillus cereus (mic50, 0.06 microgram/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic50, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml), and haemophilus influenzae (mic50, 0.25 microgram/ml). rifaximin demonstrated potential use as a topical agent for bacterial vaginosis by inhibiting bacteroides bivius-disiens, gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacillus spp., and mobiluncus spp. strains (all mics < or = 1 microgram/ml). strains of haemophilus  ducreyi and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic50s, 0.25 microgram/ml) were also inhibited. however, some organisms associated with genital tract infections were  rifaximin resistant, for example, candida spp., herpes virus, mycoplasmas, trichomonas vaginalis, and ureaplasma urealyticum. clinical trials appear warranted using rifaximin topical concentrations that will minimize mutations to  rifamycin resistance.
