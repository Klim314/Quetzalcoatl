TI  == small rnas in the genus clostridium.
AB  == the genus clostridium includes major human pathogens and species important to cellulose degradation, the carbon cycle, and biotechnology. small rnas (srnas) are emerging as crucial regulatory molecules in all organisms, but they have not  been investigated in clostridia. research on srnas in clostridia is hindered by the absence of a systematic method to identify srna candidates, thus delegating clostridial srna research to a hit-and-miss process. thus, we wanted to develop a method to identify potential srnas in the clostridium genus to open up the field  of srna research in clostridia. using comparative genomics analyses combined with predictions of rho-independent terminators and promoters, we predicted srnas in 21 clostridial genomes: clostridium acetobutylicum, c. beijerinckii, c. botulinum (eight strains), c. cellulolyticum, c. difficile, c. kluyveri (two strains), c. novyi, c. perfringens (three strains), c. phytofermentans, c. tetani, and c. thermocellum. although more than one-third of predicted srnas have shine-dalgarno (sd) sequences, only one-sixth have a start codon downstream of sd sequences; thus, most of the predicted srnas are noncoding rnas. quantitative reverse transcription-pcr (q-rt-pcr) and northern analysis were employed to test the presence of a randomly chosen set of srnas in c. acetobutylicum and several c. botulinum strains, leading to the confirmation of a large fraction of the tested  srnas. we identified a conserved, novel srna which, together with the downstream  gene coding for an atp-binding cassette (abc) transporter gene, responds to the antibiotic clindamycin. the number of predicted srnas correlated with the physiological function of the species (high for pathogens, low for cellulolytic,  and intermediate for solventogenic), but not with 16s rrna-based phylogeny.

TI  == gene transfer to clostridium cellulolyticum atcc 35319.
AB  == although much is known about the bacterial cellulosome and its various protein components, their contributions to bacterial growth on cellulose and the process  of cellulolysis in vivo cannot currently be assessed. to remedy this, the authors have developed gene transfer techniques for clostridium cellulolyticum atcc 35319. firstly, transfer of tn1545 has been obtained using an enterococcus faecalis donor. secondly, incp-mediated conjugative mobilization of plasmids from escherichia coli donors has also been achieved. the yield of transconjugants in both cases was low and was probably limited by the suboptimal growth conditions that must of necessity be employed for the co-culture of oligotrophic c. cellulolyticum with copiotrophic donors. a restriction endonuclease was detected  in crude extracts of c. cellulolyticum. this enzyme, named cce:i, is an isoschizomer of msp:i (hpa:ii). electro-transformation was employed to establish  plasmids containing the replication functions of pamss1 (en. faecalis), pim13 (bacillus subtilis), pcb102 (clostridium butyricum), pip404 (clostridium perfringens) and pwv01 (lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris) in c. cellulolyticum. transformants were only obtained if the dna was appropriately methylated on the external c of the sequence 5'-ccgg-3' using either bsu:fi methylase in vivo or msp:i methylase in vitro. plasmids based on the pamss1 and pim13 replicons were more stably maintained than one based on the pcb102 replicon. selection of transformants on solid medium led to low apparent transformation efficiencies (approx. 10(2) transformants per microg dna) which might, in part, reflect the low plating efficiency of the organism. selection of transformants in liquid medium led to a higher apparent yield of transformants (between 10(5) and 10(7) transformants per microg dna). the methods developed here will pave the way for functional analysis of the various cellulosome components in vivo.
