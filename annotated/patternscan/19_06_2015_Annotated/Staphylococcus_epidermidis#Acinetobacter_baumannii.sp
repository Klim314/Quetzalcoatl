TI  == nanotechnology approaches for antibacterial drug delivery: preparation and microbiological evaluation of fusogenic liposomes carrying fusidic acid.
AB  == many antibacterial drugs have some difficulty passing through the bacterial cell  membrane, especially if they have a high molecular weight or large spatial structure. consequently, intrinsic resistance is shown by some bacterial strains. reduced cell membrane permeability is one of the mechanisms of resistance known for fusidic acid (fus), a bacteriostatic steroidal compound with activity limited to gram-positive bacteria. moreover, the lipophilic character of fus has been shown to cause drug retention inside the bilayers of cell membranes, preventing its diffusion towards target sites inside the cytoplasm. targeting antimicrobial  agents by means of liposomes may be a valid strategy in the treatment of infections refractory to conventional routes of antimicrobial treatment. on this  basis, loading of fus in fusogenic liposomes (fls) was planned in this study. fusogenic small unilamellar vesicles loaded with fus were produced to evaluate their influence on improving the cell penetration and antibacterial activity of the antibiotic. the produced carriers were technologically characterised and were subjected to an in vitro microbiological assay against several strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. the experimental results showed that encapsulating fus in a liposomal carrier can improve antimicrobial efficacy and reduce the effective concentration required, probably through putative mechanisms of increased diffusion through the bacterial cell membrane. in fact, whilst free  fus was active only on the tested gram-positive strains, incubation of fus-loaded fls exhibited growth inhibitory activity both against gram-positive and gram-negative strains. the lowest mics were obtained against staphylococcus epidermidis (</=0.15mug/ml) and acinetobacter baumannii (37.5mug/ml) clinical strains.

TI  == surveillance of catheter-related infections: the supplementary role of the microbiology laboratory.
AB  == background: the burden of catheter-related infections (cris) in developing countries is severe. in south africa, a standardised surveillance definition does not exist and the collection of catheter days is challenging. the aim of the study was to provide baseline data on the prevalence of cris and to describe the  epidemiology of cri events within a tertiary academic hospital. methods: surveillance was laboratory-based and conducted for a six month period. a microbiologically confirmed crbsi (mc-crbsi) event was defined as the isolation of the same microorganism from the catheter and concomitant blood cultures (bcs), within 48 h of catheter removal, which were not related to an infection at another site. results: a total of 508 catheters, removed from 332 patients, were  processed by the laboratory, of which only 50% (253/508 removed from 143/332 patients) of the catheters were accompanied by bcs within 48 h. sixty-five episodes of mc-crbsi in 57 patients were detected, involving 71 catheters and 195 microbial isolates. the institutional prevalence rate was 3.7 episodes per 1 000  admissions and 5.8 episodes per 10 000 in-patient days. catheter day data was collected in only six wards of the hospital. the pooled laboratory incidence was  10.1 mc-crbsi episodes per 1 000 catheter days, whereas the hospital-based central line-associated bloodstream infection (clabsi) rate was pooled at 5.7 episodes per 1 000 catheter days. the majority of patients had an underlying gastro-intestinal condition (33%; 19/56) with a non-tunnelled, triple-lumen central venous catheter, placed in the subclavian vein (38%; 27/71). the most predominant pathogen was methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (28%; 55/195), followed by extensively-drug resistant acinetobacter baumannii (18%; 35/195). conclusions: catheter-related infection prevention and control efforts require urgent attention, not only to keep patients safe from preventable harm, but to prevent the spread of multidrug resistant microorganisms.

TI  == anti-cancer, immunoregulatory, and antimicrobial activities of the frog skin host-defense peptides pseudhymenochirin-1pb and pseudhymenochirin-2pa.
AB  == pseudhymenochirin-1pb (ps-1pb) and pseudhymenochirin-2pa (ps-2pa) are host-defense peptides, first isolated from skin secretions of the frog pseudhymenochirus merlini (pipidae). ps-1pb and ps-2pa are highly cytotoxic (lc50<12 mum) against non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma a549 cells, breast adenocarcinoma mda-mb-231 cells, and colorectal adenocarcinoma ht-29 cells but are also hemolytic against human erythrocytes (lc50=28+/-2 mum for ps-1pb and lc50=6+/-1 mum for ps-2pa). ps-2pa shows selective cytotoxicity for tumor cells (lc50 against non-neoplastic human umbilical vein (huvec) cells=68+/-2 mum). ps-1pb and ps-2pa (5 mug/ml) significantly inhibit production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 and the multifunctional cytokine il-6 from lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulated peritoneal macrophages from c57bl/6 mice and  enhance the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine il-23 from both unstimulated and lps-stimulated macrophages. ps-1pb potently (mic</=10 mum) inhibits growth of multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of the gram-positive bacteria methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, and the gram-negative bacteria acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. ps-2pa shows the same high potency (mic</=10 mum) against the gram-positive bacteria but is 2-4 fold less potent against the gram-negative isolates. ps-1pb at 4xmic kills 99.9% of escherichia coli within 30 min and 99.9% of s. aureus within 180 min. in conclusion, cytotoxicity against tumor cells, cytokine-mediated immunomodulatory properties, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity suggest that the ps-1pb and ps-2pa represent templates for design of non-hemolytic analogs for tumor therapy and for treatment of infections in cancer patients produced by multidrug-resistant pathogens.

TI  == preventing microbial colonisation of catheters: antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of cellobiose dehydrogenase.
AB  == the ability of cellobiose dehydrogenase (cdh) to produce hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) for antimicrobial and antibiofilm functionalisation of urinary catheters was investigated. a recombinantly produced cdh from myriococcum thermophilum was shown to completely inhibit the growth of escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus both in liquid and solid media when supplemented with either 0.8 mm or 2 mm cellobiose as substrate. biofilm formation on silicone films was prevented by cdh when supplemented with 1mm cellobiose. the cdh/cellobiose system also successfully inhibited many common urinary catheter-colonising micro-organisms, including multidrug-resistant s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. interestingly, cdh was also able to produce h(2)o(2) during oxidation of extracellular polysaccharides (exps) formed by micro-organisms in the absence of cellobiose. the h(2)o(2) production and consequently antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities on these exps were enhanced by incorporation of glycoside hydrolases such as amylases. hydrolysis of polysaccharides by these enzymes increases the number of terminal reducing sugars as substrates for cdh as well as destabilises the biofilm. furthermore, cdh suspended in catheter lubricants killed bacteria in biofilms colonising catheters. incorporation of the cdh/cellobiose system in the lubricant therefore  makes it an easy strategy for preventing microbial colonisation of catheters.

TI  == [prevalence and features of pathogenic bacteria in the department of hematology without bone marrow transplantation in peking union medical college hospital from 2010 to 2012].
AB  == objective: to investigate the incidence, pathogens, and clinical features of infection in consecutive cases from 2010 to 2012 in peking union medical college  hospital. method: the incidence, pathogen, treatment, and outcomes of patients with hematological diseases who had positive findings of bacterium in their samples from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. results: there were 449  positive samples (5.8%) from 4 890 patients during this period, among which 388 were proved to be with pathogenic bacteria. samples separated from patients with  community-aquired infections accounted for 8.4% of all positive samples. most community-aquired infections were caused by gram-negative bacteria (75%), although no multidrug-resistant bacteria was observed. samples separated from patients with nosocomial infections accounted for 91.6% of all positive samples.  respiratory tract (49.4%) and peripheral blood (32.6%) were the most common samples with positive results. skin soft tissues (10.4%), and urine (3.7%) were less common samples. most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infections were gram-negative (66.9%). the most common gram-negative bacteria included escherichia coli (13.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), and klebsiella pneumonia (12.1%), while staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), enterococcus faecium (7.0%), and staphylococcus epidermidis (5.1%) were the most common gram-positive  bacteria. gram-negative bacteria consisted of most of sputum samples and peripheral blood samples. samples from the surface of skin wound and anal swab were composed largely by gram-positive bacteria (63.8%). the detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumonia/klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis were 24.0%, 87.9% and 38.4%, respectively. the resistance to acinetobacter baumannii was serious. multidrug-resistant, extensive drug resistant and pan drug resistant a. baumannii acountted for 74% of all a. baumannii infections. stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed low resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, levofloxacin and minocycline. also, 22 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 9 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis were detected, which were only sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. all patients were treated in the haematology wards and most of them were under agranulocytosis or immunosuppression. finally, 22 patients reached clinical recovery through anti-infective therapy, whereas 49 patients died. among those deaths, 42 patients attributed to severe infections and infection-associated complications. fourteen  of all the deaths might be infected with drug-resistance bacteria. there were 61  samples proved to be bacteria colonization. nonfermenters such as acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia made up for a large amount of bacteria colonization. conclusions: the pathogens of nosocomial infections in the hematology ward are mainly gram-negative bacteria. the incidences and pathogens vary from different infection sites. nosocomial infection still has a higher mortality rate. once nonfermenters are detected positive, the pathogenic or colonial bacteria should be distinguished.

TI  == highly drug-resistant pathogens implicated in burn-associated bacteremia in an iraqi burn care unit.
AB  == objective: in low- and middle-income countries, bloodstream infections are an important cause of mortality in patients with burns. increasingly implicated in burn-associated infections are highly drug-resistant pathogens with limited treatment options. we describe the epidemiology of bloodstream infections in patients with burns in a humanitarian surgery project in iraq. methods: we performed a retrospective, descriptive study of blood culture isolates identified between july 2008 and september 2009 among patients with burns in a single hospital in iraq who developed sepsis. results: in 1169 inpatients admitted to the burn unit during the study period, 212 (18%) had suspected sepsis, and 65 (6%) had confirmed bacteremia. sepsis was considered the primary cause of death in 198 patients (65%; 95% ci 65-70) of the 304 patients that died. the most commonly isolated organisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22 isolates [34%]), staphylococcus aureus (17 [26%]), klebsiella pneumoniae (8 [12%]), staphylococcus epidermidis (7 [11%]), acinetobacter baumannii (6 [9%]), and enterobacter cloacae (5 [8%]). a high proportion of enterobacteriaceae strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and s. aureus isolates were uniformly methicillin-resistant. for gram-negative bacteria, the most reliably active antibiotics were imipenen and amikacin. conclusions: burn patients with sepsis in iraq were commonly found to have bloodstream pathogens resistant to most antibiotics available locally. effective empirical therapy of burn sepsis in this region of iraq would consist of vancomycin or teicoplanin and a carbapenem-class  antibiotic with antipseudomonal activity.

TI  == [a prospective randomized controlled trial on effect of norvancomycin tube sealing for prevention of central venous catheter-related infection in critical patients].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the clinical value of tube-sealing with norvancomycin and  heparin saline mixture for prevention of central venous catheter-related infection (cri). methods: a prospective randomized controlled trial was performed. 120 patients who were admitted to department of critical care medicine from january 2012 to january 2014 were included, with their subclavian vein catheterization installation time longer than 48 hours, age over 18 years and younger than 80 years, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii (apache ii) score reaching 10-29. the patients were divided into two groups using a random number table, and finally 116 patients were enrolled. norvancomycin and  heparin saline mixture were used for tube sealing in the intervention group (n=56), while only heparin saline was used in the control group (n=60). the incidence of cri, catheter correlated spectrum of pathogens, adverse events, mortality, hospital day, catheter retention time, and hospital costs were compared between two groups. results: (1) there was no significant difference in  the incidence of cri between intervention group and control group [7.14% (4/56) vs. 8.33% (5/60), chi(2)=0.058, p=1.000]. there was no catheter pathogenic colonization in the intervention group, but there were 2 cases of catheter pathogenic colonization in control group. (2) a total of 7 pathogens were found in two groups. three cases with pathogenic bacteria was found in the intervention group, with 1 case of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 case acinetobacter baumannii, and 1 case fungi. staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, fungi, and acinetobacter baumannii was found in the control group, with 1 case of each. there was no significantly statistical difference between two groups (all p>0.05), but there was a decreasing trend of gram-positive cocci infection in the intervention group. (3) there was no significant difference in the catheter thrombosis, local bleeding or hematoma, catheter dislocation and other adverse events between intervention group and control group [21.43% (12/56) vs. 23.33% (14/60), chi(2)=0.060, p=0.806]. (4) there were no significant differences in mortality [7.14% (4/56) vs. 8.33% (5/60), chi(2)=0.058, p=1.000], hospital day (35.9+/-15.2 days vs. 34.1+/-16.3 days, t=16.330, p=0.620), catheter retention time (25.0+/-4.5 days vs. 24.5+/-5.1 days, t=26.427, p=2.560) and cost of hospitalization (10 thousand yuan: 3.42+/-1.22 vs. 3.72+/-1.30, t=13.215, p=1.560) between intervention group and control group. conclusions: for patients  with central venous catheter, application norvancomycin with heparin saline mixture for tube sealing did not reduce the incidence of cri, the incidence of adverse events and mortality, does not reduce hospitalization time, catheter retention time and hospital costs, but may reduce the catheter colonization and infection of gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == tolerability and efficacy of long-term treatment with daptomycin, ceftazidime and colistin in a patient with a polymicrobial, multidrug-resistant prosthetic joint  reinfection: a case report.
AB  == introduction: prosthetic joint infections are severe complications of joint implants. further complications arise when polymicrobial and/or multidrug-resistant microorganisms are involved. currently, there are limited data on the management of these infections and on the tolerability of long-term treatment with daptomycin, ceftazidime and colistin. case presentation: a 55-year-old caucasian woman who had a right hip prosthesis removed 1 year prior because of infection was admitted for prosthesis reimplantation. on admission at  our hospital, anamnesis regarding etiology and management of prosthesis infection was not available. on clinical, laboratory findings and imaging studies infection was not suspected. a hip prosthesis was reimplanted. at surgery, histopathological and microbiological investigations were not taken. three weeks  after reimplantation, surgical site infection due to enterobacter cloacae was diagnosed and oral ciprofloxacin was prescribed. four days later, a periprosthesis fluid collection was evidenced and a percutaneous needle aspirate  grew staphylococcus epidermidis and s. haemolyticus. enterobacter genome was also detected from the same sample. teicoplanin and meropenem were added to ciprofloxacin without clinical improvement. moreover, acetabular cup dislocation  was documented. she underwent prosthesis explantation, debridement, and positioning of an antimicrobial mixed spacer. from the intraoperatory cultures s. epidermidis and acinetobacter baumannii were grown. daptomycin, ceftazidime, colistin and rifampin were administered. four days later, rifampin was stopped due to a suspected liver toxicity. while undergoing therapy she presented recurrent episodes of wound dehiscence and on the 22nd week of treatment a further surgical debridement was performed, upon which the spacer was removed. at this time, intraoperative cultures resulted negative. three months later, after a total of 8 months, antimicrobials were interrupted. subsequently, a femoral transcondylar traction was positioned, and 3 weeks later a new prosthesis was reimplanted. at over 1 year after reimplantation she is well. conclusions: our findings suggest that microbiologic investigations are mandatory even when prosthetic joint infection is not suspected. molecular methods for identification of microorganisms can be used in addition to conventional cultures especially when patients are under antibiotic treatment. daptomycin, ceftazidime and colistin can be administered for several months without side effects. guidelines  specifically addressing the diagnosis and the management of polymicrobial, multidrug-resistant prosthetic joint infections need to be developed.

TI  == polyethyleneimine and polyethyleneimine-based nanoparticles: novel bacterial and  yeast biofilm inhibitors.
AB  == biofilms are commonly involved in medical device-related infections. the purpose  of this study was to determine the antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity of polyethyleneimine (pei) and pei-based nanoparticles (nanopei) against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, acinetobacter baumannii and candida albicans (clinical and atcc strains), and to evaluate their effect upon biofilm formation on polyurethane (pur)-like catheters. mics and minimal lethal concentrations of pei and nanopei were determined according to clsi microdilution reference protocols. for pei, the mic value was 195.31 mg l(-1) for all the bacteria and 48.83 mg l(-1) for the yeast strains. for nanopei, the mic value was 1250 mg l(-1) for all the strains except a. baumannii, for which it was 2500 mg l(-1). biofilm formation was assessed with pur-like catheter segments and biofilm metabolic activity was quantified by colorimetry with a tetrazolium reduction assay. plasma membrane integrity and membrane potential were assessed by flow cytometry after staining microbial cells with a membrane-impermeable dye, propidium iodide, and a membrane-potential marker, dibac4(3). pei inhibited growth of all microbial species; higher concentrations of nanopei were needed to  inhibit growth of all species. biofilm formation in the presence of anti-bacterial pei activity was dose-dependent (except for s. epidermidis) and species-related. nanopei at 0.5xmic and mic significantly reduced the metabolic activity of biofilms of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and a. baumannii, whereas 2xmic was required in order to inhibit biofilm metabolic activity.

TI  == potent antimicrobial activity of bone cement encapsulating silver nanoparticles capped with oleic acid.
AB  == bone cement is widely used in surgical treatments for the fixation for orthopaedic devices. subsequently, 2-3% of patients undergoing these procedures develop infections that are both a major health risk for patients and a cost for  the health service providers; this is also aggravated by the fact that antibiotics are losing efficacy because of the rising resistance of microorganisms to these substances. in this study, oleic acid capped silver nanoparticles (np) were encapsulated into poly(methyl methacrylate) (pmma)-based  bone cement samples at various ratios. antimicrobial activity against methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, acinetobacter baumannii was exhibited at np concentrations as low as 0.05% (w/w). furthermore, the mechanical properties and cytotoxicity of the bone cement containing these np were assessed to guarantee that such material is safe to be used in orthopaedic surgical practice.

TI  == control of multi-drug-resistant pathogens with non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate wound dressing.
AB  == background: non-thermal dielectric-barrier discharge plasma (non-thermal plasma)  is being investigated for use in wound healing. alginate gel, already in clinical use, is non-toxic but has no meaningful antimicrobial property. this study reports that a non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate wound dressing has strong antimicrobial properties. methods: alginate gel was treated with non-thermal plasma in room air and inoculated with bacterial pathogens. at 15 min after this, bacterial cell viability was determined by colony assay or 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-  nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (xtt) assay. the anti-biofilm efficacy of the non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate gel was investigated and the  treated gel was tested against vascular endothelial cells for a cytotoxic effect. the proliferation and migration of bacterial cells before and after exposure to the treated gel were investigated with an in vitro wound testing assay. scanning  electron microscopy was used to observe changes in the gel surface associated with exposure to bacterial pathogens. the treated gel was tested against acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, candida albicans, and c. glabrata as representative pathogens (at 10(6)-10(9) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml), and the thickness of a plasma-treated gel dressing and distance between a glass dielectric-barrier discharge plasma probe and the gel surface were kept constant. results: non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate gel exhibited a strong biocidal property and inactivated all of the pathogens included in the study at counts of 10(8) cfu/ml and within 15 sec of treatment. the treated gel inactivated 10(9) cfu/ml of the organisms within 1 min, and 3 min of exposure to the treated gel inactivated pathogens embedded in biofilms. the plasma-treated gel showed no significant cytotoxicity, and endothelial cells exposed to the treated gel proliferated and migrated well across a wound area over a period of time. dressings made with the treated gel retained their biocidal effects for about a month. scanning electron microscopy showed no damage to the surfaces of treated gels, but damage to the bacterial pathogens on plasma exposure. conclusion: a non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate gel dressing has the clinical potential to decontaminate wounds, prevent surgical site infection, and promote wound healing.

TI  == next science wound gel technology, a novel agent that inhibits biofilm development by gram-positive and gram-negative wound pathogens.
AB  == loss of the skin barrier facilitates the colonization of underlying tissues with  various bacteria, where they form biofilms that protect them from antibiotics and host responses. such wounds then become chronically infected. topical antimicrobials are a major component of chronic wound therapy, yet currently available topical antimicrobials vary in their effectiveness on biofilm-forming pathogens. in this study, we evaluated the efficacy of next science wound gel technology (nxtsc), a novel topical agent designed to kill planktonic bacteria, penetrate biofilms, and kill the bacteria within. in vitro quantitative analysis, using strains isolated from wounds, showed that nxtsc inhibited biofilm development by staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and klebsiella pneumoniae by inhibiting bacterial growth. the gel formulation nxtsc-g5, when applied to biofilms preformed by these pathogens, reduced the numbers of bacteria present by 7 to 8 log10 cfu/disc or cfu/g. in vivo, nxtsc-g5 prevented biofilm formation for 72 h when applied at the time of wounding and infection and eliminated biofilm infection when applied 24 h after wounding and infection. storage of nxtsc-g5 at  room temperature for 9 months did not diminish its efficacy. these results establish that nxtsc is efficacious in vitro and in vivo in preventing infection  and biofilm development by different wound pathogens when applied immediately and in eliminating biofilm infection already established by these pathogens. this novel antimicrobial agent, which is nontoxic and has a usefully long shelf life,  shows promise as an effective agent for the prevention and treatment of biofilm-related infections.

AB  == the medical importance of bacterial biofilms has increased with the recognition of biofilms as one of the major contributors to the slow or non-healing chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, and pressure ulcers. being a protected community of microorganisms, biofilms are notoriously refractory to antibiotic treatments. as the conventional treatment modalities have proven ineffective, this study provides the in vitro evidence to support the use of a novel combination of dispersinb((r)) antibiofilm enzyme that inhibits biofilm formation and disperses preformed biofilm, and thus making the biofilm bacteria more susceptible to a broad-spectrum ksl-w antimicrobial peptide. the combination of dispersinb((r)) and ksl-w peptide showed synergistic antibiofilm and antimicrobial activity against chronic wound infection associated biofilm-embedded bacteria such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), and  acinetobacter baumannii. in addition, the wound gel formulation comprising dispersinb((r)), ksl-w peptide, and a gelling agent pluronic f-127 showed a broad-spectrum and enduring antimicrobial activity against test organisms. furthermore, as compared to commercial wound gel silver-sept, dispersinb((r))-ksl-w peptide-based wound gel was significantly more effective in inhibiting the biofilm-embedded mrsa, s. epidermidis, cons, vancomycin-resistant  enterococci, a. baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p < 0.05). thus, this study provides promising evidence for the potential application of antibiofilm-antimicrobial dispersinb((r))-ksl-w wound gel in chronic wound management.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy and wound-healing property of a topical ointment containing nitric-oxide-loaded zeolites.
AB  == topical delivery of nitric oxide (no) through a wound dressing has the potential  to reduce wound infections and improve healing of acute and chronic wounds. this  study characterized the antibacterial efficacy of an ointment containing no-loaded, zinc-exchanged zeolite a that releases no upon contact with water. the release rate of no from the ointment was measured using a chemiluminescence detection system. minimum bactericidal concentration assays were performed using  five common wound pathogens, including gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii), gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis  and meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) and a fungus (candida albicans).  the time dependence of antimicrobial activity was characterized by performing log-reduction assays at four time points after 1-8 h ointment exposure. the cytotoxicity of the ointment after 24 h was assessed using cultured 3t3 fibroblast cells. minimum microbicidal concentrations (mmcs) for bacterial organisms (5x10(7) c.f.u.) ranged from 50 to 100 mg ointment (ml media)(-1); the  mmc for c. albicans (5x10(4) c.f.u.) was 50 mg ointment (ml media)(-1). five to eight log reductions in bacterial viability and three log reductions in fungal viability were observed after 8 h exposure to no-zeolite ointment compared with untreated organisms. fibroblasts remained viable after 24 h exposure to the same  concentration of no-zeolite ointment as was used in antimicrobial tests. in parallel studies, full-thickness cutaneous wounds on zucker obese rats healed faster than wounds treated with a control ointment. these data indicate that ointment containing no-loaded zeolites could potentially be used as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial wound-healing dressing.

TI  == biofilm formation by clinical isolates and the implications in chronic infections.
AB  == background: biofilm formation is a major virulence factor contributing to the chronicity of infections. to date few studies have evaluated biofilm formation in infecting isolates of patients including both gram-positive and gram-negative multidrug-resistant (mdr) species in the context of numerous types of infectious  syndromes. herein, we investigated the biofilm forming capacity in a large collection of single patient infecting isolates and compared the relationship between biofilm formation to various strain characteristics. methods: the biofilm-forming capacity of 205 randomly sampled clinical isolates from patients, collected from various anatomical sites, admitted for treatment at brooke army medical center (bamc) from 2004-2011, including methicillin-resistant/methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mrsa/mssa) (n=23), acinetobacter baumannii (n=53), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=36), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=54), and escherichia coli (n=39), were evaluated for biofilm formation using the high-throughput microtiter plate assay and scanning electron microscopy (sem). relationships between biofilm formation to clonal type, site of isolate collection, and mdr phenotype were evaluated. furthermore, in patients with relapsing infections, serial strains were assessed for their ability to form biofilms in vitro. results: of the 205 clinical isolates tested, 126 strains (61.4%) were observed to form biofilms in vitro at levels greater than or equal to the staphylococcus epidermidis, positive biofilm producing strain, with p. aeruginosa and s. aureus having the greatest number of biofilm producing strains. biofilm formation was significantly associated with specific clonal types, the site of isolate collection, and strains positive for biofilm formation were more  frequently observed to be mdr. in patients with relapsing infections, the majority of serial isolates recovered from these individuals were observed to be  strong biofilm producers in vitro. conclusions: this study is the first to evaluate biofilm formation in a large collection of infecting clinical isolates representing diverse types of infections. our results demonstrate: (1) biofilm formation is a heterogeneous property amongst clinical strains which is associated with certain clonal types, (2) biofilm forming strains are more frequently isolated from non-fluid tissues, in particular bone and soft tissues,  (3) mdr pathogens are more often biofilm formers, and (4) strains from patients with persistent infections are positive for biofilm formation.

TI  == photoinactivation of gram positive and gram negative bacteria with the antimicrobial peptide (klaklak)(2) conjugated to the hydrophilic photosensitizer  eosin y.
AB  == we test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial peptide (klaklak)(2) enhances the photodynamic activity of the photosensitizer eosin y upon conjugation. the conjugate eosin-(klaklak)(2) was obtained by solid-phase peptide synthesis. photoinactivation assays were performed against the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli , pseudomonas aeruginosa , and multidrug resistant acinetobacter baumannii aye, as well as the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus , and  staphylococcus epidermidis . partitioning assays were performed with e. coli and  s. aureus . photohemolysis and photokilling assays were also performed to assess  the photodynamic activity of the conjugate toward mammalian cells. eosin-(klaklak)(2) photoinactivates 99.999% of 10(8) cfu/ml of most bacteria tested at a concentration of 1 mum or below. in contrast, neither eosin y nor (klaklak)(2) cause any significant photoinactivation under similar conditions. the increase in photodynamic activity of the photosensitizer conferred by the antimicrobial peptide is in part due to the fact that (klaklak)(2) promotes the association of eosin y to bacteria. eosin-(klaklak)(2) does not significantly associate with red blood cells or the cultured mammalian cell lines hacat, cos-7, and colo 316. consequently, little photodamage or photokilling is observed with these cells under conditions for which bacterial photoinactivation is achieved. the peptide (klaklak)(2) therefore significantly enhances the photodynamic activity of eosin y toward both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria while interacting minimally with human cells. overall, our results suggest that antimicrobial peptides such as (klaklak)(2) might serve as attractive agents that can target photosensitizers to bacteria specifically.

TI  == in vivo antibiofilm effect of cerium, chitosan and hamamelitannin against usual agents of catheter-related bloodstream infections.
AB  == objectives: catheter-related bloodstream infections (crbsis) are common healthcare-associated infections associated with increased morbidity and medical  costs. antiseptic- and antibiotic-coated central venous catheters (cvcs) have been proposed to reduce the incidence of crbsis, with variable success. the aim of this study was to determine the in vivo antibiofilm activity of biocompatible  and inexpensive compounds, such as cerium nitrate, chitosan and hamamelitannin, against usual agents of crbsis. methods: the antibiofilm effect of cerium nitrate, chitosan and hamamelitannin was tested against staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii and candida albicans  in a mouse foreign body infection model, using polyurethane catheter segments. biofilm formation was assessed with a crystal violet assay to quantify the total  biomass, with a tetrazolium reduction assay to quantify the metabolic activity and with scanning electron microscopy. results: at subinhibitory concentrations,  cerium nitrate significantly reduced biofilm formation by c. albicans, chitosan significantly decreased biofilm formation by s. epidermidis and c. albicans, and  hamamelitannin significantly inhibited all bacterial biofilms. discussion: the in vivo antibiofilm effect of cerium nitrate against c. albicans and of chitosan against c. albicans and s. epidermidis, at subinhibitory concentrations, makes them promising alternatives to coat cvcs. moreover, the microbicidal effect on a  wider range of cvc colonizers was previously reported in vitro for both compounds, at higher concentrations. for all bacterial strains, the highest in vivo antibiofilm efficacy was achieved with hamamelitannin. for a. baumannii, this is the first report of in vivo inhibition.

AB  == background: statins have several effects beyond their well-known antihyperlipidemic activity, which include immunomodulatory, antioxidative and anticoagulant effects. in this study, we have tested the possible antimicrobial activity of statins against a range of standard bacterial strains and bacterial clinical isolates. methods: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) values were evaluated and compared among three members of the statins drug (atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin). results: it was revealed that statins are able to induce variable degrees of antibacterial activity with atorvastatin, and simvastatin being the more potent than rosuvastatin. methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (vse), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre), acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterobacter aerogenes, were more sensitive to both atorvastatin, and simvastatin compared to  rosuvastatin. on the other hand, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae were more sensitive to atorvastatin compared to both simvastatin and rosuvastatin. furthermore, most clinical isolates were less sensitive to statins compared to their corresponding standard strains. conclusion: our findings might raise the possibility of a potentially important antibacterial class effect for statins especially, atorvastatin and simvastatin.

TI  == the design and construction of k11: a novel alpha-helical antimicrobial peptide.
AB  == amphipathic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides comprise a class of broad-spectrum agents that are used against pathogens. we designed a series of antimicrobial peptides, cp-p (kwksfikkltskflhlakkf) and its derivatives, and determined their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) against pseudomonas aeruginosa, their minimum hemolytic concentrations (mhcs) for human erythrocytes, and the therapeutic index (mhc/mic ratio). we selected the derivative peptide k11, which had the highest therapeutic index (320) among the tested peptides, to  determine the mics against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and 22 clinical isolates including acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and klebsiella pneumonia. k11 exhibited low mics (less than 10 mug/ml) and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, especially against clinically isolated drug-resistant pathogens. therefore, these results indicate that k11 is a promising candidate antimicrobial peptide for further studies.

TI  == the impact of the types of microorganisms isolated from blood and wounds on the results of treatment in burn patients with sepsis.
AB  == despite development of combustiology, infections continue to be the most important cause of death among patients with burns. sepsis is the most severe clinical presentation of infection in patients after thermal injuries who require immediate treatment. early diagnosis and proper treatment of sepsis are important in the clinical management that is often hampered for multiple reasons, e.g. impaired patient immunity, problems with microorganisms with multi-antibacterial  drug resistance. the aim of the study was to assess effect of type of a microorganism isolated from blood and wound on results of treatment of sepsis in  patients with burns. material and methods: effect of type of microorganisms isolated from blood and wound on the result of treatment of sepsis was studied in 338 patients hospitalized immediately after an injury in centre for burn treatment in siemianowice slaskie in years 2003 - 2004 (at the age of 18 - 96 years, 66 women and 272 men). clinical symptoms of generalized infection were found in all study subjects. the study group was divided into two subgroups: cured patients and patients who died of sepsis. the following parameters were assessed in both subgroups: type of microorganism isolated from blood, type of microorganism isolated from wound as well as occurrence of the same and different infections of blood and burn wound. results: positive blood cultures were found in 165 patients (48.8%), 106 (64.2%) were cured, 59 (35.8%) died. the most commonly isolated microorganisms in cured patients were gram(+) staphylococcus epidermidis mrse (19.81%) and staphylococcus aureus mrsa (18.87%). gram(-) intestinal rods were least commonly isolated from this group. the most commonly isolated microorganisms from blood of patients who were to die, included non-fermenting gram(-) rods acinetobacter baumannii (35.59%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.03%). mixed bacterial flora was found in the blood of 22.03% patients. among patients who were to die, the same microorganisms were found in the blood and in the wound in 32.2% of patients, while this rate was 17.92 in cured patients. the most commonly found bacteria in the blood and burn wound in the cured patients included staphylococcus aureus mrsa (31.58%) and staphylococcus aureus (21.05%). in the group of patients who were to die, the most common bacteria isolated simultaneously from the blood and burn wound included acinetobacter baumannii (47.37%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (36.84%). conclusions: 1. the patients with thermal injuries are at higher risk of death in the event of sepsis caused by gram(-) bacteria versus gram(+) bacteria. 2. infection of blood and burn wound caused by the same bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumanni increases the risk of death due to sepsis in patients with burns following thermal injuries.

TI  == cerium, chitosan and hamamelitannin as novel biofilm inhibitors?
AB  == objectives: the colonization of indwelling medical devices and subsequent biofilm formation represents a global challenge since it promotes the persistence of infection and contributes to antimicrobial resistance. the aim of this study was  to determine the antimicrobial activity of cerium, chitosan and hamamelitannin against usual microbial colonizers and to assess their efficacy regarding biofilm formation on polyurethane (pur)-like catheters. methods: the antimicrobial and anti-biofilm effect of cerium nitrate, low molecular weight chitosan (lmwc) and hamamelitannin was tested against staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii and candida albicans strains. biofilm formation was assessed with pur-like catheter segments and the metabolic activity was quantified by colorimetry with a tetrazolium reduction assay. results: cerium nitrate and lmwc inhibited the microbial growth of all microbial strains tested;  hamamelitannin showed no inhibition. regarding biofilm formation on pur-like catheters, with subinhibitory concentrations: cerium nitrate significantly inhibited the metabolic activity of c. albicans; lmwc reduced the metabolic activity of s. epidermidis and c. albicans; and hamamelitannin decreased the metabolic activity of all tested bacteria, but not of yeasts. conclusions: the microbicidal activity of cerium nitrate and lmwc was clearly demonstrated in this study, as was their fungistatic effect at lower concentrations. hamamelitannin significantly reduced biofilm metabolic activity of all tested bacteria. these microbial inhibitors may play a promising role regarding different biomedical applications.

TI  == garlic ointment inhibits biofilm formation by bacterial pathogens from burn wounds.
AB  == when thermal injury damages the skin, the physical barrier protecting underlying  tissues from invading micro-organisms is compromised and the host's immune system becomes supressed, facilitating colonization and infection of burn wounds with micro-organisms. within the wound, bacteria often develop biofilms, which protect the bacteria from the immune response and enhance their resistance to antibiotics. as the prophylactic use of conventional antibiotics drives selection of drug-resistant strains, the use of novel agents to prevent biofilm formation by wound pathogens is essential. in the present study, we utilized our recently developed in vitro wound biofilm model to examine the antibiofilm activity of garlic (allium sativum). wound pathogens were inoculated on sterile cellulose discs, exposed to formulated garlic ointment (garo) or ointment base, and incubated to allow biofilm development. biofilms were quantified and visualized microscopically. garo prevented biofilm development by staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae, and caused a 2-5 log reduction of the bioburden within enterococcus faecalis biofilms. additionally, garo disrupted partially developed  biofilms produced by s. aureus, s. epidermidis and a. baumannii. the antistaphylococcal activity of garo was stable for over 3 months at room temperature. thus, garo could be used as a prophylactic therapy to prevent wound  biofilms caused by both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria from forming, and may be a potential therapy for disrupting established staphylococcal biofilms.

TI  == inhibition of bacterial growth and biofilm production by constituents from hypericum spp.
AB  == biofilm embedded bacterial pathogens such as staphylococcus spp., escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii are difficult to eradicate and are major sources of bacterial infections. new drugs are needed to  combat these pathogens. hypericum is a plant genus that contains species known to have antimicrobial properties. however, the specific constituents responsible for the antimicrobial properties are not entirely known, nor have most compounds been tested as inhibitors of biofilm development. the investigation presented here tested seven secondary metabolites isolated from the species hypericum densiflorum, hypericum ellipticum, hypericum prolificum, and hypericum punctatum  as inhibitors of bacterial growth and biofilm production. assays were conducted against staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, clinical methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii. five of the seven compounds demonstrated growth inhibition against the gram-positive bacteria with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) ranging from 1.95 microg/ml to 7.81 microg/ml. four of the secondary metabolites inhibited biofilm production by certain gram-positive strains at sub-mic concentrations.

TI  == changing trends in antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens, 1985-2005: a study from a medical center in northern taiwan.
AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance is a major health problem worldwide. we evaluated the antimicrobial resistance trends of 16 major bacterial pathogens at  a tertiary medical center in northern taiwan. methods: we conducted a retrospective review of annual summary documents for antimicrobial susceptibility of clinically isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from 1985 to 2005. the numbers of isolates and susceptibilities were calculated for three 7-year periods: first period, 1985-1991; second period, 1992-1998; and the third  period, 1999-2005. results: during the 21-year period, 219,715 bacterial pathogens were identified. a significant increase in incidence over time was found for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s epidermidis, penicillin-nonsusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, erythromycin-resistant s pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, cefotaxime/ceftriaxone-resistant escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, and  imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. additionally, a significant increase  in ciprofloxacin resistance rates over time from 1996 to 2005 was noted for e coli, enterobacter cloacae, and a baumannii (through 1997 to 2005). however, a significant decrease in erythromycin resistance rate with time from 1999 to 2005  was found for groups a and b streptococci, non-a, b, d streptococci, and s pneumoniae. conclusion: resistance to antimicrobial agents increased rapidly in the past two decades in taiwan and has become very common in major bacterial pathogens. continuous enforcement of policies to limit use of antimicrobial agents and active surveillance of antimicrobial resistance through a nationwide system are both warranted.

TI  == chitosan augments photodynamic inactivation of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (pdi) was shown to be a promising treatment modality for microbial infections. this study explores the effect of chitosan, a polycationic biopolymer, in increasing the pdi efficacy against gram-positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa),  as well as the gram-negative bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. chitosan at <0.1% was included in the antibacterial process either by  coincubation with hematoporphyrin (hp) and subjection to light exposure to induce the pdi effect or by addition after pdi and further incubation for 30 min. under  conditions in which hp-pdi killed the microbe on a 2- to 4-log scale, treatment with chitosan at concentrations of as low as 0.025% for a further 30 min completely eradicated the bacteria (which were originally at approximately 10(8)  cfu/ml). similar results were also found with toluidine blue o (tbo)-mediated pdi in planktonic and biofilm cells. however, without pdi treatment, chitosan alone did not exert significant antimicrobial activity with 30 min of incubation, suggesting that the potentiated effect of chitosan worked after the bacterial damage induced by pdi. further studies indicated that the potentiated pdi effect  of chitosan was related to the level of pdi damage and the deacetylation level of the chitosan. these results indicate that the combination of pdi and chitosan is  quite promising for eradicating microbial infections.

TI  == suprathel-antiseptic matrix: in vitro model for local antiseptic treatment?
AB  == acetic acid is a traditional antiseptic agent that has been used for more than 6000 years. the main goal of this study was to demonstrate the suitability of suprathel (polymedics innovations gmbh, denkendorf, germany) in combination with  various antiseptic agents to create an "antiseptic-matrix" especially designed for problematic microorganisms such as proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter baumannii, or pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are frequently associated with burns. the study  was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial effect of a "suprathel-antiseptic matrix" (suprathel combined with acetic acid 3%, povidone-iodine 11% [betaisodona], polyhexanide 0.04% [lavasept], phenoxyethanol 2%/octenidine dihydrochloride 0.1% [octenisept], mafenide acetate 5%, and chlorhexidine gluconate 1.5%/cetrimid 15% [hibicet]). as a means to assess the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following gram-negative and gram-positive  bacteria strains were tested: escherichia coli, p vulgaris, p aeruginosa, a baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s aureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococcus groups a and b. the tests showed a positive bactericidal effect of the suprathel-antiseptic matrix, particularly with problematic gram-negative bacteria such as p vulgaris, p aeruginosa, and a baumannii, except for the combination of  suprathel and mafenide acetate. it can be concluded that suprathel-antiseptic matrix appears to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but clinical studies need to be performed to confirm these in vitro observations. the authors' previous studies have shown that acetic acid demonstrates a wide antiseptic spectrum for microorganisms typically found in burn patients. the combination of  suprathel and acetic acid worked well in this study and appears to be promising for future clinical application.

AB  == 2-aminoimidazoles are an emerging class of small molecules that possess the ability to inhibit and disperse biofilms across bacterial order, class, and phylum. herein, we report the synergistic effect between a 2-aminoimidazole/triazole conjugate and antibiotics toward dispersing preestablished biofilms, culminating with a 3-orders-of-magnitude increase of biofilm dispersion toward staphylococcus aureus biofilms. furthermore, we document that the 2-aminoimidazole/triazole conjugate will also resensitize multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria to the effects of conventional antibiotics, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii.

TI  == dual-action hygienic coatings: benefits of hydrophobicity and silver ion release  for protection of environmental and clinical surfaces.
AB  == coatings that demonstrate reduced attachment of crystalline precipitates and the  medical device colonising staphylococcus epidermidis were prepared by the immobilisation of silver doped perfluoropolyether-urethane siloxane thin films on glass substrates. the presence of stratified hydrophobic perfluoropolyether groups protects the coating surface from the attachment of crystalline hydrophilic species such as chlorides and phosphates, whilst silver ion release inhibited attachment of s. epidermidis and subsequent biofilm formation in vitro. the release of silver ions protects the perfluoro groups from the hydrophobic interactions of s. epidermidis cells, which can reduce the hydrophobicity of the  protective coating. these coatings also exhibited significant antibacterial activity against planktonic acinetobacter baumannii and s. epidermidis bacterial  strains. detailed elemental and chemical surface analysis obtained using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) provided useful information on the effect of bacterial incubation on key indicator hydrophobic and hydrophilic functional groups. xps analysis indicated preferential adsorption of s. epidermidis cells at the hydrophobic sites along the polymeric chain. these dual-action hygienic coatings can be employed to protect against contamination environmental surfaces  and bacterial colonisation on implanted medical devices.

TI  == in vivo model of human pathogen infection and demonstration of efficacy by an antimicrobial pouch for pacing devices.
AB  == background: device-related infections represent a significant clinical challenge. once established, these infections prove difficult to treat with existing antibiotic regimens, compromising the health of device recipients, and usually requiring surgical intervention to resolve. objective: the purpose of this study  was to determine the efficacy of the aigis(rx) antibacterial envelope (tyrx pharma, inc., monmouth junction, nj, usa) designed to reduce device-related infections by incorporating minocycline and rifampin in a controlled release polymer. methods: an infection was established in a rabbit model by creating bilateral subcutaneous implant pockets, into which a pacing device with or without aigis(rx) was placed. the incisions were closed, and a defined dose of bacteria was infused into each implant pocket. after 7 days, devices were explanted and sampled for viable bacteria by swabbing and sonication. results: initial studies evaluated the ability of the aigis(rx) pouch to reduce staphylococcus epidermidis (s. epi) infection in this model using clinical and quantitative microbial endpoints. results demonstrate s. epi infection in all control samples, while no pathogens were recovered from samples with the aigis(rx) pouch. systemic antibiotic levels were undetectable. additional studies tested the efficacy of the aigis(rx) pouch with additional bacterial strains, staphylococcus capitis, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii. in each case, the device and implant pocket with the aigis(rx) pouch was free of any signs of infection. an assessment of biofilm produced by acinetobacter demonstrated the elimination of biofilm formation on the implanted device. conclusion: these results demonstrate that in this animal model, the aigis(rx) device reduces the risk for infection of viable pathogens within implant pockets.

TI  == silver doped perfluoropolyether-urethane coatings: antibacterial activity and surface analysis.
AB  == the colonisation of clinical and industrial surfaces with pathogenic microorganisms has prompted increased research into the development of effective  antibacterial and antifouling coatings. there is evidence that implanted biomedical surfaces coated with metallic silver can be inactivated by physiological fluids, thus reducing the bioactivity of the coating. in this work, we report the biofilm inhibition of staphylococcus epidermidis using a room temperature processed silver doped perfluoropolyether-urethane coating. the release of silver ions from these fluoropolymers over a six-day period inhibited  bacterial encrustation - as observed by scanning electron microscopy (sem). x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) analysis indicated differences in carbon, fluorine and sodium surface composition between silver doped and undoped fluoropolymers after exposure to nutrient rich media. these silver doped perfluoropolyether coatings also exhibited antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii; suggesting potential use in preventing transmission of pathogenic and opportunistic microbes on environmental surfaces in healthcare facilities. the broad-spectrum antibacterial activity of these silver release coatings may be exploited on biomaterials surfaces to combat the development of resistant gram-negative enterobacteriaceae that can occur during prophylactic treatment for urinary tract infections.

TI  == the antimicrobial effect of acetic acid--an alternative to common local antiseptics?
AB  == acetic acid has been commonly used in medicine for more than 6000 years for the disinfection of wounds and especially as an antiseptic agent in the treatment and prophylaxis of the plague. the main goal of this study was to prove the suitability of acetic acid, in low concentration of 3%, as a local antiseptic agent, especially for use in salvage procedures in problematic infections caused  by organisms such as proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter baumannii or pseudomonas aeruginosa. this study was designed to compare the in vitro antimicrobial effect  of acetic acid with those of common local antiseptics such as povidone-iodine 11% (betaisodona), polyhexanide 0.04% (lavasept), mafenide 5% and chlohexidine gluconate 1.5% cetrimide 15% (hibicet). former studies suggest the bactericidal effect of acetic acid, but these data are very heterogeneous; therefore, a standardised in vitro study was conducted. to cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial  strains were tested: escherichia coli, p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa, a. baumannii,  enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and beta-haemolytic streptococcus group a and b. the tests showed excellent bactericidal effect of acetic acid, particularly with problematic gram-negative bacteria such as p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii. the microbiological spectrum of acetic acid is wide, even when tested  at a low concentration of 3%. in comparison to our currently used antiseptic solutions, it showed similar - in some bacteria, even better - bactericidal properties. an evaluation of the clinical value of topical application of acetic  acid is currently underway. it can be concluded that acetic acid in a concentration of 3% has excellent bactericidal effect and, therefore, seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but further clinical studies are necessary.

TI  == microbiology of postoperative infections.
AB  == background: surgical infections, accounting for approximately one quarter of all  nosocomial infections, contribute to longer hospital stays and higher medical costs. clinical failure of antibiotic treatment often is associated with increasing drug resistance. methods: non-duplicated microbial isolates obtained at our institution from surgical patients were identified and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using the sceptor system in 2001-2002 and the phoenix system in 2003-2005. epidemiologic data were extracted using epicenter and powerlab. during selected periods, genetic and biochemical characterization was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, colony blot hybridization, gene amplification and sequencing, isoelectric focusing, and enzyme kinetics. results: the specimens were most commonly isolated from infections at surgical sites (24.0%), the urinary tract (19.0%), and blood stream (10.6%). isolates of escherichia coli showed an increasing prevalence of resistance to penicillins, third-generation cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin, whereas the prevalence of resistant staphylococcus aureus generally declined. highly aggressive multi-drug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were widespread, although colistin remained effective in 100% of cases. a significant  increase was seen in infections attributable to s. epidermidis and candida albicans. the overall number of enterobacteriaceae carrying extended-spectrum beta-lactamases increased continuously, and new resistance traits emerged. it appeared that the tem-92 determinant moved from enterobacteriaceae to nonfermenting gram-negative rods such as acinetobacter baumannii. conclusion: the number and type of antimicrobial-resistance determinants are increasing.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

AB  == background: the pattern of nosocomial pneumonia (np) in infants in a pediatric surgical icu after cardiac surgery may differ from that seen in adult icus. study objectives: the primary aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of np  in infants after cardiac surgery and, secondarily, to describe the changes of the distribution and antibiotic resistance of the pathogen during the last 3 years. methods: data were collected between june 1999 and june 2002 from 311 consecutive infants who underwent open-heart surgery in our hospital. we retrospectively analyzed the distribution and antibiotic resistance pattern of all the pathogenic microbial isolates cultured from lower respiratory tract aspirations. results: of 311 infants, 67 patients (21.5%) acquired np after cardiac surgery. the incidence of np was more frequently associated with complex congenital heart defect (chd) compared to simple chd (43% vs 15.9%, chi(2) = 22.47, p < 0.0001). the proportion of late-onset np was higher in patients with complex chd (chi(2) = 6.02, p = 0.014). a total of 79 pathogenic microbial strains were isolated. gram-negative bacilli (gnb) were the most frequent isolates (68 isolates, 86.1%), followed by fungi (6 isolates, 7.6%) and gram-positive cocci (5 isolates, 6.3%). the main gnb were acinetobacter baumanii (11 isolates, 13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 isolates, 12.7%); other commonly seen gnb were flavobacterium meningosepticum (7  isolates, 8.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (7 isolates, 8.9%), escherichia coli (6 isolates, 7.6%), and xanthomonas maltophilia (5 isolates, 6.2%). the most commonly seen gram-positive cocci were staphylococcus aureus (2 isolates, 2.5%) and staphylococcus epidermidis (2 isolates, 2.5%). the frequent fungi were candida albicans (5 isolates, 6.3%). most gnb were sensitive to cefoperazone-sulbactum, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, amikacin. the bacteria producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases were mainly from k pneumoniae and e coli; the susceptibility of esbl-producing strains to imipenem was 100%. there were one case of methicillin-resistant s aureus (mrsa) and 1 case of methicillin-resistant s epidermidis; their susceptibility to vancomycin, gentamycin, and ciprofloxacin were 100%. from 1999 to 2002 in infants with np after open-heart surgery, there was a trend of increasing frequency of multiresistant gnb such as a baumanii, p aeruginosa, and k pneumoniae. however, no remarkable changes of distribution were found in gram-positive cocci and fungi in the 3-year period. early onset episodes of np were frequently caused by haemophilus influenzae, methicillin-sensitive s aureus, and other susceptible enterobacteriaceae. conversely, in patients who acquired late-onset np, p aeruginosa, a baumannii, other multiresistant gnb, mrsa, and fungi were the predominant organisms. conclusions: the pattern of pathogens and their antibiotic-resistance patterns in np in infants after cardiac surgery had not shown an increasing prevalence of gram-positive pathogens as reported by several  adult icus. gnb still remained the most common pathogens during the last 3 years  in our hospital. there was a trend of increasing antibiotic resistance in these isolates.

TI  == sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  == aims: to test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. methods: the bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 iu/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin b was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees c with five inocula of 14 bacteria. two yeasts  (candida spp) and one aspergillus were also tested. contaminated media were then  inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened  daily by visual inspection. the sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. results: organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria  irrespective of the starting inoculums: streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and haemophilus influenzae. for micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal  only (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, candida kruzei, aspergillus  fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (sd 13.8, range 2-52). in cases of detection by the  blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. conclusions: blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. a total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the national taiwan university hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. for many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. some strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum  inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. moxifloxacin was less active against p. aeruginosa, but was more active against s. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in taiwan.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == use of pcr with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == the ex vivo antimicrobial activity and colonization rate of two antimicrobial-bonded central venous catheters.
AB  == objective: catheter-related sepsis is an important complication associated with the use of central venous catheters. recent studies have suggested that antimicrobial-bonded catheters may reduce catheter colonization and catheter-related sepsis. the aim of this study was to determine the relationship  between the antimicrobial activity and the colonization rate of two commercially  available antimicrobial-bonded central venous catheters. design: prospective, randomized, controlled, nonblinded study. setting: medical intensive care unit of a university-affiliated teaching hospital. patients: one hundred twenty consecutive medical intensive care unit patients requiring new central venous catheters (fresh stick). interventions: patients were randomized to receive a) a  standard arrow; b) an arrowgard; or c) a cook bio-guard spectrum central venous catheter. central venous catheters were removed when they were no longer required or when catheter-related sepsis was suspected. under aseptic conditions, the distal 12 cm of the removed catheters were cut into six 2-cm segments. semiquantitative culture was performed (by roll technique) on the distal segment. colonization was defined as >15 colony-forming units. using a modified kirby-bauer technique, the zone of inhibition of the remaining five segments was  determined against the following organisms: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus  aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, acinetobacter baumannii, and candida albicans catheters that were removed within 24 hrs of insertion were excluded from the analysis. measurements and main results: seven patients were not assessable. the baseline clinical and demographic characteristics were similar among the three groups of patients. eleven standard  arrow (28%), seven arrowgard (19%), and four bio-guard (11%) catheters were colonized (p = .05 for bio-guard vs. control). staphylococci were the most common colonizing organisms. two patients with standard arrow catheters (5%) and one patient with an arrowgard catheter (3%) developed catheter-related sepsis. antibiotic-coated catheters significantly inhibited the growth of all test organisms except c. albicans (p < or = .05). zones of inhibition were significantly larger for the bio-guard compared with the arrowgard catheter when  tested against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and e. faecalis (p < or = .002). conclusion: the bio-guard central venous catheter had greater ex vivo antimicrobial activity  against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and e. faecalis compared with the arrowgard catheter, and this was associated with a significantly lower rate of catheter colonization.

TI  == [bacterial strains isolated from neutropenic patients and their resistance to antibiotics].
AB  == background: although gram negative as well as gram positive bacteria participate  in febrile episodes of neutropenic patients, in particular recently the ratio of  gram positive bacteria is increasing. the objective of the present work was to investigate the incidence and antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacterial agents in neutropenic patients. methods and results: the presence of bacteria was investigated in 446 neutropenic patients hospitalized at the haematological clinic in 1995. haemocultures (apparatus bact/alert 120, cultivation media organon-teknika) and urine were examined. the sensitivity for antibiotics was tested by the standard dilution micromethod. in blood most frequently staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated (45.4%), coagulase-negative strains of staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus hominis and staphylococcus saprophyticus (14.4%), acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (complex 6.3%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.3%). in urine the following were detected: staphylococcus epidermidis (36.5%), enterococcus sp. (14.5%), escherichia coli (13.1%), enterococcus faecalis (11.6%) and enterococcus solitarius (6.5%). in all strains resistance to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic drugs was assessed. conclusions: investigation of the frequency of different bacterial species, along with monitoring of the resistance is an essential prerequisite of initial antibiotic therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients.

TI  == neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == background: airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli (gnb) and gram-positive cocci (gpc) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. whether  gnb are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (bsi) and/or to the severity  of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) is unknown. methods: we prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. the severity of bpd was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. results: after 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with gpc (staphylococus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). superimposed on 36% of these infants was gnb airway colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), enterobacter cloacae (25%), escherichia coli (25%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), serratia marcescen (10%), acinetobacter baumannii and haemophilus influenzae (5%). comparison between 174 gpc- and 86 gnb-colonized infants showed  that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. fifteen percent of gnb-colonized infants developed bsi caused by gnb and 14% developed bsi caused by gpc. no significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and bsi was noted. gnb infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with gpc. gnb colonization was a predictor of severe bpd after controlling for ventilation. ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of gnb-colonized and 33% of noncolonized  infants and was not a predictor of bpd severity. conclusion: gnb airway colonization creates a moderate risk for bsi. antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate gnb. gnb airway colonization is associated with severe bpd, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate gnb from the airways should be undertaken.

TI  == emergence of bacterial resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin in a university hospital.
AB  == we have continuously monitored the in-vitro activities of imipenem and ciprofloxacin against large numbers of non-fastidious clinical isolates. after eight years of use, 97-100% of enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter baumannii remained susceptible to imipenem, but susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa declined from 100% to 91%. after six years of use, 94%-100% of enterobacteriaceae (except providencia stuartii) remained susceptible to ciprofloxacin but susceptibility of p. stuartii, a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa declined from 100%  to 46%, 66% and 84%, respectively. oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were considered to be resistant to imipenem and all beta-lactams. there were no quinolone-resistant staphylococci observed in 1986, but susceptibilities of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus to ciprofloxacin decreased to 85-93% for oxacillin-susceptible strains and to 7-39% for oxacillin-resistant strains. enterococcus faecalis has remained susceptible to imipenem and the modal mic of ciprofloxacin has remained 1 mg/l; however, susceptibility to ciprofloxacin 2 mg/l decreased from 94% to 64%. imipenem-quinolone cross-resistance was observed for staphylococci but not for p. aeruginosa.

TI  == synergistic interaction between ofloxacin and cefotaxime against common clinical  pathogens.
AB  == antimicrobial synergy resulting from combined antibiotic therapy is often important in the treatment of serious bacterial infections. to investigate the interactions between cefotaxime (ctx), desacetylcefotaxime (des), and ofloxacin (ofl), 247 recent clinical isolates were tested for in vitro susceptibility to each antibiotic alone by an agar dilution technique and retested with the various antibiotic combinations using a checkerboard protocol. fractional inhibitory concentrations were calculated for all organisms with all drug combinations. time kill kinetic studies were performed on selected isolates to examine the bactericidal activity of the various antimicrobial combinations. of the 110 gram-negative organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy between ctx, des and ofl was demonstrable for 89 (81%). included in the study were 70 members of the enterobacteriaceae family, 20 isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10 strains of acinetobacter baumannii, and 10 isolates of xanthomonas maltophilia. additive activity was observed against an additional 13 (11%) isolates. findings were similar for the 89 gram-positive isolates examined. organisms tested included methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (9), methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis (10), enterococcus faecalis (10), and streptococcus pneumoniae (20). synergy or partial synergy was observed against 81 (91%). less synergistic activity was detected, however, with members of the bacteroides fragilis group. of the 48 organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy was noted for only 27 (57%). isolates representative of each major group  of organisms included in the study were tested to determine whether synergistic bactericidal activity was also demonstrable with the three drugs. time kill studies supported the checkerboard results.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates obtained in 1989 and 1990.
AB  == the in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. the bacteria studied were staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), escherichia coli, salmonella species, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and bacteroides fragilis. in contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most enterobacteriaceae and a. baumannii. the minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (mic90s) were < 1 microgram/ml against most tested species. ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin  were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. all fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, with mic90s < or = 1 microgram/ml. for methicillin-resistant strains, on  the other hand, the mic90s were > or = 4 micrograms/ml. there was no significant  difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and  -resistant s. epidermidis. sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against b. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. the mic90s of most quinolones assayed against k. pneumoniae, citrobacter spp., e. cloacae, s. aureus and s. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.

TI  == opportunistic nosocomial multiply resistant bacterial infections--their treatment and prevention.
AB  == one of the most difficult problems confronting the clinician who deals with nosocomial infections is that of microbial resistance. the predominant nosocomial infections (urinary tract infections, pneumonia, septicaemia, surgical wound infections) involve increasing numbers of gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus  epidermidis, corynebacterium jeikeium or resistant enterococci as well as new multiresistant gram-negative bacilli such as xanthomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter baumannii and alcaligenes xylosoxydans. the emergence and spread of klebsiella pneumoniae and other enterobacteriaceae producing novel plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases active against third-generation cephalosporins contribute to the difficulty in treating nosocomial infections.
