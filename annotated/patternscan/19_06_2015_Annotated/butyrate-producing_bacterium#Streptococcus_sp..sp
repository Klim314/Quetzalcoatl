TI  == decreased dietary fiber intake and structural alteration of gut microbiota in patients with advanced colorectal adenoma.
AB  == background: accumulating evidence indicates that diet is one of the most important environmental factors involved in the progression from advanced colorectal adenoma (a-cra) to colorectal cancer. objective: we evaluated the possible effects of dietary fiber on the fecal microbiota of patients with a-cra. design: patients with a diagnosis of a-cra by pathological examination were enrolled in the a-cra group. patients with no obvious abnormalities or histopathological changes were enrolled in the healthy control (hc) group. dietary fiber intake was assessed in all patients. short-chain fatty acids (scfas) in feces were detected by gas chromatography. the fecal microbiota community was analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing based on 16s ribosomal rna. results: lower dietary fiber patterns and consistently lower scfa production were observed in the a-cra group (n = 344). principal component analysis showed distinct differences in the fecal microbiota communities of the 2 groups. clostridium, roseburia, and eubacterium spp. were significantly less prevalent in the a-cra group (n = 47) than in the hc group (n = 47), whereas enterococcus and streptococcus spp. were more prevalent in the a-cra group (n = 47) (all p < 0.05). butyrate and butyrate-producing bacteria were more prevalent in a subgroup of hc subjects with a high fiber intake than in those in both the low-fiber hc subgroup and the high-fiber a-cra subgroup (all p < 0.05). conclusion: a high-fiber dietary pattern and subsequent consistent production of scfas and healthy gut microbiota are associated with a reduced risk of a-cra. this trial was registered at www.chictr.org as chictr-trc-00000123.

TI  == structural segregation of gut microbiota between colorectal cancer patients and healthy volunteers.
AB  == despite a long-suspected role in the development of human colorectal cancer (crc), the composition of gut microbiota in crc patients has not been adequately  described. in this study, fecal bacterial diversity in crc patients (n=46) and healthy volunteers (n=56) were profiled by 454 pyrosequencing of the v3 region of the 16s ribosomal rna gene. both principal component analysis and unifrac analysis showed structural segregation between the two populations. forty-eight operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified by redundancy analysis as key  variables significantly associated with the structural difference. one otu closely related to bacteroides fragilis was enriched in the gut microbiota of crc patients, whereas three otus related to bacteroides vulgatus and bacteroides uniformis were enriched in that of healthy volunteers. a total of 11 otus belonging to the genera enterococcus, escherichia/shigella, klebsiella, streptococcus and peptostreptococcus were significantly more abundant in the gut  microbiota of crc patients, and 5 otus belonging to the genus roseburia and other butyrate-producing bacteria of the family lachnospiraceae were less abundant. real-time quantitative pcr further validated the significant reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut microbiota of crc patients by measuring the copy numbers of butyryl-coenzyme a coa transferase genes (mann-whitney test,  p<0.01). reduction of butyrate producers and increase of opportunistic pathogens  may constitute a major structural imbalance of gut microbiota in crc patients.

TI  == preformed enzyme profiles of reference strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
AB  == the preformed (constitutive) enzyme profiles of 30 type strains and reference strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci were determined with two commercial systems, rapid ana and a prototype system from api. both systems identified peptostreptococcus anaerobius, ps. asaccharolyticus, ps. indolicus, ps. magnus and ps. micros accurately, except for one strain of ps. magnus misidentified as ps. micros by the rapid ana system. the indole-negative, butyrate-producing cocci (classified at present as ps. prevotii and ps. tetradius) produced several different, unique patterns with the prototype api system, but the results with rapid ana were often misleading. eight strains of hare group cocci produced previously described profiles. four strains of streptococci produced profiles easily distinguished from those of the gram-positive anaerobic cocci. we conclude that most gram-positive anaerobic cocci can be identified rapidly and reliably to the species level by their preformed enzyme profiles, providing that their underlying classification is sound. problems were encountered with the butyrate-producing cocci, which appear to be a more heterogeneous group of organisms than is currently acknowledged; further taxonomic studies on these organisms are required.
