TI  == antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of the essential oils of portuguese foeniculum vulgare fruits.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation from fruits of six fennel accessions collected from wild populations occurring in the  centre and south of portugal. composition of essential oils was established by gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (gc-fid) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) analysis. the obtained yields of the essential oils were found to vary greatly in the range of 1.1 to 2.9% (v/w) and the chemical composition varied with the region of collection. a total of 16 compounds were identified. the main compounds were fenchone (16.9 - 34.7%), estragole (2.5 - 66.0%) and trans-anethole (7.9 - 77.7%). the percentages of these three main compounds were used to determine the relationship between the different oil samples and to group them into four different chemotypes: anethole/fenchone; anethole; estragole and anethole/estragole. antifungal activity of essential oils was evaluated against six food spoilage fungi: aspergillus niger, a. japonicus, a. oryzae, fusarium oxysporum, rhizophus oryzae and r. stolonifer. antibacterial  activity was assessed against three gram-positive strains: enterococcus faecalis  atcc 29212, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228 and s. aureus atcc 28213; and against six gram-negative strains: escherichia coli atcc 25922; morganella morganii lfg 08; proteus mirabilis lfg 04; salmonella enteritidis lfg 05; s. entiritidis serovar typhimurium lfg 06 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 by the disc diffusion agar method; the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined using the broth macro-dilution method. the mic values varied from 62.5 (e. coli atcc 25922) to 2000 microml (p. aeruginosa atcc 27853).

TI  == urinary tract infections: epidemiology, mechanisms of infection and treatment options.
AB  == urinary tract infections (utis) are a severe public health problem and are caused by a range of pathogens, but most commonly by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus saprophyticus. high recurrence rates and increasing antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens threaten to greatly increase the economic burden of these infections. in this review, we discuss how basic science studies are elucidating  the molecular details of the crosstalk that occurs at the host-pathogen interface, as well as the consequences of these interactions for the pathophysiology of utis. we also describe current efforts to translate this knowledge into new clinical treatments for utis.

TI  == antimicrobial and antifungal activity of pelargonium roseum essential oils.
AB  == purpose: the antiseptic qualities of aromatic and medicinal plants and their extracts have been recognized since antiquity, while attempts to characterize these properties in the laboratory date back the beginning of the xx(th) century. in the current study essential oils obtained from pelargonium roseum (geraniacea) were analyzed for their antibacterial and antifungal activities. methods: the antimicrobial activity of the pelargonium essential oil was tested against gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli), gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis) and  fungi (candida albicans). disc diffusion method was used to study antimicrobial activity. results: inhibition zones showed that the studied essential oils were active against all of the studied bacteria. in the case of candida albicans, the  complete inhibition of the fungus's development was observed. in the cases of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus we observed an inhibition comparable to that obtained by the use of an appropriate antimicrobial substance. conclusion: the volatile oils exhibited considerable inhibitory effects against all the organisms under test, in some cases comparable with those of the reference antibiotics. there were no considerable differences between the antimicrobial activities of the oil obtained by distillation and commercially available pelargonium oils.

TI  == [the urinary bacterial flora in patients with cutaneous ureterostomy].
AB  == twenty-four patients with cutaneous ureterostomy at least 6 months after surgery  were included in this study. single-j ureteral catheters were indwelt in 7 patients. pouch urine was cultured and analyzed from asymptomatic patients and from those with pyelonephritis. forty-eight bacterial strains were isolated from  asymptomatic patients. thirty-five of these strains consisting of 18 species were isolated from the patients without ureteral catheters. enterococcus (e.) faecalis (20.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and proteus (p.) mirabilis (11. 4%) were isolated at high frequency. one methicilline-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus (mrcns) strain was isolated. thirteen bacterial strains consisting of 8 species were isolated from the patients with ureteral catheters. e. faecalis (23.1%), eschericia (e.) coli (23.1%) and pseudomonas (p.) aeruginosa (15.4%) were isolated at high frequency. one e. coli strain harboring extended-spectrum beta lactamase (esbl) and one mrcns strain were isolated. pyelonephritis occurred in 5 patients 14 times during follow-up for at least 6 months after surgery. the  patients with ureteral catheters suffered from pyelonephritis (4/7, 57.1%) more frequently as compared to the patients without catheters (1/17, 5.9%) (p = 0.014). p. aeruginosa (26.9%), e. faecium (15.4%), and p. mirabilis (11.5%) were  isolated inhigh frequency. one e. coli strain harboring esbl and one p. mirabilis strain harboring esbl were isolated. in conclusion, insertion of ureteral catheters in a cutaneous ureterostomy is a strong risk factor for pyelonephritis  and development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. therefore, urine culture is important in these patients who are under surveillance.

TI  == drug resistance and molecular epidemiology of aerobic bacteria isolated from puerperal infections in bangladesh.
AB  == puerperal infection is a common complication during postnatal period in developing countries. bacterial species, drug resistance, and genetic characteristics were investigated for a total of 470 isolates from puerperal infections in bangladesh for a 2-year period (2010-2012). the most common species was escherichia coli (n=98), followed by enterococcus faecalis (n=54), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=33), proteus mirabilis (n=32), staphylococcus aureus (n=27), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=22), and enterobacter cloacae (n=21). s.  aureus and acinetobacter baumannii were isolated at a higher frequency from wound infections after cesarean section, while e. coli, e. cloacae, and k. pneumoniae were isolated from community-acquired endometritis and urinary tract infections.  resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was frequent for enterobacteriacae, and was mainly mediated by blactx-m-1 group beta-lactamases. the ctx-m gene in e. coli from the four phylogroups was identified as blactx-m-15, and phylogroup b2 isolates with blactx-m-15 were classified into st131 with o25b allele, harboring  aac(6')-ib-cr and various virulence factors. carbapenemase genes blandm-1 and blandm-7 were identified in one isolate each of phylogroup a e. coli. methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates had type iv or v sccmec, including isolates of st361 (cc672), which is related to an emerging st672 clone in the indian subcontinent. this study revealed the recent epidemiological status of aerobic bacteria causing puerperal infections in bangladesh, providing useful information to improve clinical practice and infection control.

TI  == aerobic bacterial microbiota isolated from the cloaca of the european pond turtle (emys orbicularis) in poland.
AB  == we conducted a comparative analysis of the aerobic cloacal bacteria of european pond turtles (emys orbicularis) living in their natural environment and juvenile  turtles reared under controlled conditions in a breeding center. we included 130  turtles in the study. the aerobic bacteria isolated from the cloaca of the juvenile turtles were less diverse and more prevalent than the bacteria isolated  from free-living adults. we isolated 17 bacterial species from juvenile captive turtles, among which the dominant species were cellulomonas flavigena (77/96), enterococcus faecalis (96/96), escherichia coli (58/96), and proteus mirabilis (41/96). from the adult, free-living turtles, we isolated 36 bacterial species, some of which are a potential threat to public health (e.g., salmonella enterica  serovars newport, daytona, and braenderup; listeria monocytogenes; yersinia enterocolitica; yersinia ruckeri; klebsiella pneumoniae; vibrio fluvialis; and serratia marcescens), and pathogens that are etiologic agents of diseases of ectothermic animals (e.g., aeromonas sobria, aeromonas caviae, hafnia alvei, edwardsiella tarda, and citrobacter braakii; the last two species were isolated from both groups of animals). the cloacal bacterial biota of the european pond turtle was characterized by numerous species of bacteria, and its composition varied with turtle age and environmental conditions. the small number of isolated bacteria that are potential human pathogens may indicate that the european pond turtle is of relatively minor importance as a threat to public health.

TI  == impact of minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints on local cumulative bacterial susceptibility data and antibiotic consumption.
AB  == background: the phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (ast) of bacteria depends on minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints issued by national and international breakpoint committees. the current study was performed in order to  test the influence of different ast standards on local cumulative ast data and on antibiotic consumption. methods: automated ast was performed with clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, and e. faecium. from each species 100 prospectively collected non-duplicate clinical isolates were tested and mic data were interpreted according to the interpretation standards issued by din and eucast, respectively. in addition cumulative ast data from clinical isolates and antibiotic consumption were monitored before and after implementation of new eucast mic breakpoints. results: the susceptibility rate of p. aeruginosa against piperacillin and gentamicin, and of c. freundii against piperacillin/tazobactam increased significantly, whereas the susceptibility rates of e. cloacae, s. marcescens, and m. morganii against ciprofloxacin decreased significantly after switching from din to eucast mic breakpoints. these changes in the cumulative antibiotic resistance pattern were reflected by enhanced consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam after implementation of eucast mic breakpoints. conclusions: these data show that changes of ast breakpoints have a significant influence on local cumulative ast data and on antibiotic consumption.

TI  == the influence of urinary ph on antibiotic efficacy against bacterial uropathogens.
AB  == objective: to determine the effects of ph on the activity of clinically relevant  antibiotics against bacterial uropathogens. numerous factors affect antibiotic efficacy within the urinary tract including ph. because human urine can substantially vary from acidic (ph 4.5) to alkaline (ph 8) conditions and can be  easily clinically manipulated, it would be a great advantage to better understand the role of ph in antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infection. materials and  methods: this in vitro study investigated the activity of 24 widely used antimicrobial agents against bacterial strains comprising 6 major uropathogenic species (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) over the  range of ph 5-8. standard disk-diffusion and broth-microdilution assays were used. one-way analysis of variance was applied to determine significance (p <.05). results: for 18 of the 24 agents, ph was shown to play a significant role  in overall inhibitory activity. although most agents behaved similarly across most or all of the uropathogens tested, several only showed ph-dependent effects  against certain organisms. the fluoroquinolones, co-trimoxazole, aminoglycosides, and macrolides all functioned optimally at alkaline ph, whereas the tetracyclines, nitrofurantoin, and many of the beta-lactams tested exhibited their highest activity under more acidic conditions. sulfamethoxazole, oxacillin, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, vancomycin, imipenem, and clindamycin were largely unaffected by ph. conclusion: clinicians should consider the urinary ph of their patients when treating urinary tract infection, especially in complicated scenarios. future clinical investigations examining urinary ph and antibiotic efficacy may result in the application of decreased antibiotic dosages and regimen durations, potentially reducing antibiotic resistance development.

TI  == bacteriology of pressure ulcers in individuals with spinal cord injury: what we know and what we should know.
AB  == individuals with spinal cord injury (sci) are at increased risk for the development of pressure ulcers. these chronic wounds are debilitating and contribute to prolonged hospitalization and worse medical outcome. however, the species of bacteria and the role that specific species may play in delaying the healing of chronic pressure ulcers in the sci population has not been well characterized. this study will review the literature regarding what is known currently about the bacteriology of pressure ulcers in individuals with sci. an electronic literature search of medline (1966 to february 2014) was performed. eleven studies detailing bacterial cultures of pressure ulcers in the sci population met inclusion criteria and were selected for review. among these studies, bacterial cultures were often polymicrobial with both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria identified with culture techniques that varied significantly.  the most common organisms identified in pressure ulcers were staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecalis. in  general, wounds were poorly characterized with minimal to no physical description and/or location provided. our present understanding of factors that may alter the microbiome of pressure ulcers in individuals with sci is quite rudimentary, at best. well-designed studies are needed to assess appropriate wound culture technique, the impact of bacterial composition on wound healing, development of infection, and the optimum medical and surgical approaches to wound care.

TI  == bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
AB  == the ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. the frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. a specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial  cells. much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would  allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. the use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.

TI  == role of the bacterial vaccine solco-urovac(r) in treatment and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections of bacterial origin.
AB  == urinary tract infections (uti) represent a serious medical problem with considerably high rate of morbidity. recurrent episodes of urinary tract infection (ruti) may commonly develop in the way of relapse or reinfection. for patients, ruti is always associated with costs, discomfort and decreased quality  of life. standard treatment of ruti is through antibiotics and usually such treatment is required repeatedly. repeat course of antibiotics leads to increase  of resistance of uropathogenic strains. according to the european association of  urology, "the present state of microbial resistance development is alarming". our post-marketing trial was designed to demonstrate the substantial effect of the bacterial vaccine solco-urovac(r) both with independent administration and in conjunction with standard antibacterial medication within therapy and prevention  of ruti. total of 115 patients (men and non-pregnant women) were enrolled in our  open-label post-marketing trial. each patient had more than one year history of ruti and in the past had already taken appropriate course of standard therapy. the trial group included 50 patients: 32 men, 18 women (average age +/- 32.5). 32 patients (men) of the trial group received vaccination with solco-urovac(r) together with the standard antibacterial medication. according to bacteriologic tests, in 62% cases infection was caused by escherichia coli, and in 38% cases by morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis. 18 patients within the trial group were women with no recurrence episode at the start and during the trial period. each woman was involved as the  intercourse partner of the respective man within the trial group. the women received only vaccination with solco-urovac(r). 65 patients of the control group  had more than one year history of ruti and had been treated earlier, too. patients of the control group received appropriate antibacterial medication without solco-urovac(r). after therapy and follow-up examination, results in the  both groups were classified, also in consideration of the pathogen-specified subgroups, and then summarized and compared respectively. during the follow-up period no case of ruti was noticed in women. in total, analysis of the medical records of 50 patients of the trial group demonstrated no case of ruti in 46 patients during the follow-up period. altogether, the rate of improvement of symptoms was as follows: the trial group - 92%, the control group - 74%. through  comparison with the past medical histories of patients, the higher rate of improvement and longer absence of ruti episodes after treatment were certainly associated with the effect of solco-urovac(r). the results of our post-marketing  trial allow recommending solco-urovac(r) for appropriate reference within the georgian national guideline on urologic infections.

TI  == electrokinetic stringency control in self-assembled monolayer-based biosensors for multiplex urinary tract infection diagnosis.
AB  == rapid detection of bacterial pathogens is critical toward judicious management of infectious diseases. herein, we demonstrate an in situ electrokinetic stringency  control approach for a self-assembled monolayer-based electrochemical biosensor toward urinary tract infection diagnosis. the in situ electrokinetic stringency control technique generates joule heating induced temperature rise and electrothermal fluid motion directly on the sensor to improve its performance for detecting bacterial 16s rrna, a phylogenetic biomarker. the dependence of the hybridization efficiency reveals that in situ electrokinetic stringency control is capable of discriminating single-base mismatches. with electrokinetic stringency control, the background noise due to the matrix effects of clinical urine samples can be reduced by 60%. the applicability of the system is demonstrated by multiplex detection of three uropathogenic clinical isolates with similar 16s rrna sequences. the results demonstrate that electrokinetic stringency control can significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the biosensor for multiplex urinary tract infection diagnosis. from the clinical editor: urinary tract infections remain a significant cause of mortality and morbidity as secondary conditions often related to chronic diseases or to immunosuppression. rapid and sensitive identification of the causative organisms  is critical in the appropriate management of this condition. these investigators  demonstrate an in situ electrokinetic stringency control approach for a self-assembled monolayer-based electrochemical biosensor toward urinary tract infection diagnosis, establishing that such an approach significantly improves the biosensor's signal-to-noise ratio.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of zn-norfloxacin complex as a potent cytotoxic and antibacterial agent, proposed model for dna binding.
AB  == a tetrahedral zn(ii) complex with the second generation fluoroquinolone, norfloxacin, was prepared and characterized (nor-zn complex, nzc). the antibacterial efficiency of the nzc was tested on two gram-positive and four gram-negative bacteria by minimum inhibitory concentration method. the cytotoxic  potential of nzc on mda (human breast adenocarcinoma), caco-2 (human colon adenocarcinoma), and hela (human cervix carcinoma) cell lines was studied. the dna interaction property of the nzc has been investigated using uv-vis, fluorescence, fourier transform infrared, as well as cyclic voltammetry methods.  intrinsic binding constant (k(b)), thermodynamic, and other spectroscopic and voltammetric data indicate that the nzc has more affinity for dna than for norfloxacin and interacted with dna via two modes: electrostatic and outside hydrogen binding. the proposed dna binding mode supports the large enhancement in the cytotoxicity and antibacterial activity of nzc.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial and allelopathic activity of tunisian conyza sumatrensis (retz.) e.walker essential oils.
AB  == conyza sumatrensis (retz.) e.walker (asteraceae) is a spontaneous annual herb, fairly widespread throughout tunisia, which has rarely been studied or valued in  any sector. essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation of different parts  (flower heads, leaves, stems, and roots) of c. sumatrensis plants, which were collected in autumn (november 2007) at the flowering stage in the area of monastir, tunisia. in total, 98 compounds, representing 88.1-99.3% of the oil composition, were identified by gc-fid and gc/ms analyses. the root essential oil was distinguished by its high content in acetylenes (matricaria ester, 4; 74.3%), while those from flower heads and leaves were dominated by oxygenated sesquiterpenes (61.1 and 50.3%, resp.). the oils of c. sumatrensis from tunisia belonged to a matricaria ester/caryophyllene oxide chemotype. all the oils were evaluated for antibacterial, antifungal, and allelopathic activities. the results indicate that the leaf oil exhibited significant in vitro antibacterial activity  against enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and proteus mirabilis and that the c. sumatrensis oils isolated from the aerial parts presented high mycelia-growth inhibition of candida albicans and the filamentous fungi tested. moreover, the essential oils of the different plant parts inhibited the shoot and root growth of raphanus sativus (radish) seedlings. indeed, the inhibition of the hypocotyl growth varied from 28.6 to 90.1% and that of the radicle from 42.3 to 96.2%.

TI  == american journal of gastroenterology lecture: intestinal microbiota and the role  of fecal microbiota transplant (fmt) in treatment of c. difficile infection.
AB  == the vital roles that intestinal flora, now called microbiota, have in maintaining our health are being increasingly appreciated. starting with birth, exposure to the outside world begins the life-long intimate association our microbiota will have with our diet and environment, and initiates determination of the post-natal structural and functional maturation of the gut. moreover, vital interactions of  the microbiota with our metabolic activities, as well as with the immunological apparatus that constitutes our major defense system against foreign antigens continues throughout life. a perturbed intestinal microbiome has been associated  with an increasing number of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal diseases including clostridium difficile infection (cdi). it has become recognized that fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) can correct the dysbiosis that characterizes chronic cdi, and effect a seemingly safe, relatively inexpensive, and rapidly effective cure in the vast majority of patients so treated. in addition, fmt has been used to treat an array of other gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disorders, although experience in these other non-cdi diseases is in its infancy. more work needs to be done with fmt to ensure its safety and optimal route of administration. there is a conceptual sea change that is developing in our view of bacteria from their role only as pathogens to that of being critical to health maintenance in a changing world. future studies are certain to narrow the spectrum of organisms that need to be given to patients to  cure disease. fmt is but the first step in this journey.

TI  == persistence of bacteria like pseudomonas aeruginosa in non-healing venous ulcers.
AB  == background: there is evidence that chronic inflammation due to bacterial wound colonization delays wound healing. objective: in this study, in a leipzig (germany) cohort of chronic wound patients, the microbiological spectrum in 2005  and in 2010 was evaluated, as were patients with continuous ulceration sequentially over a decade from 2001-2011. methods: we retrospectively analysed the microbial swabs of 126 patients with chronic leg ulcers caused by chronic venous insufficiency. results: in the cross-sectional analysis in both 2005 and 2010, as well as in the longitudinal analysis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and enterococcus faecalis were respectively the most common pathogens colonizing chronic leg ulcers. in the longitudinal analysis from 2001-2011, the same bacterial species could be identified >/= 3 years consecutively in 20/35 patients. normally only one or two species could persistently be demonstrated over the years. the subgroup of patients with >/= 3  x confirmation of p. aeruginosa in their swabs showed a longer wound duration compared to all patients in the longitudinal group. conclusion: we registered the persistence of bacteria like p. aeruginosa or s. aureus in consecutive bacterial  swabs over the years in individual patients with non-healing venous ulcerations.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == impact of ph on activity of trimethoprim, fosfomycin, amikacin, colistin and ertapenem in human urine.
AB  == objective: although major impairment of activity at lower ph values has been reported for fluoroquinolones, acidification is a widely recommended practice for the prophylaxis and treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (utis). until now, there is little evidence for the influence of ph on the activity on other antimicrobial classes in urine. methods: bacterial growth curves of staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), klebsiella oxytoca (atcc 700324), proteus mirabilis (atcc 14153), escherichia coli (atcc 25922) and enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212) were performed in mueller-hinton broth and in pooled human urine with a ph of between 5.0 and 8.0. bacterial killing of trimethoprim, fosfomycin,  amikacin, colistin and ertapenem against the five strains (where appropriate) was determined consecutively at concentrations equal to the mic. results: while no difference in the bacterial growth of e. coli, s. aureus, p. mirabilis and k. oxytoca was observed at different ph values, bacterial growth of e. faecalis was  significantly reduced at low ph. acidification to ph 5 impaired the antimicrobial activity of all investigated antibiotics, i.e. the net effect of bacterial growth and killing resulted in increased colony-forming units/ml at the end of the experiment. conclusion: the present in vitro findings indicate that acidification of urine during the treatment of utis should be carefully considered. while growth curves of one strain supports the concept of therapeutic or prophylactic acidification during utis, the most common pathogen, e. coli, was not affected by low ph. independent of the investigated strain or antibiotic, ph values below 6 lead to a reduction of antimicrobial activity.

TI  == the relative importance of staphylococcus saprophyticus as a urinary tract pathogen: distribution of bacteria among urinary samples analysed during 1 year at a major swedish laboratory.
AB  == to determine the distribution of urinary tract pathogens with focus on staphylococcus saprophyticus and analyse the seasonality, antibiotic susceptibility, and gender and age distributions in a large swedish cohort. s. saprophyticus is considered an important causative agent of urinary tract infection (uti) in young women, and some earlier studies have reported up to approximately 40% of utis in this patient group being caused by s. saprophyticus. we hypothesized that this may be true only in very specific outpatient settings.  during the year 2010, 113,720 urine samples were sent for culture to the karolinska university hospital, from both clinics in the hospital and from primary care units. patient age, gender and month of sampling were analysed for s. saprophyticus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis.  species data were obtained for 42,633 (37%) of the urine samples. the most common pathogens were e. coli (57.0%), enterococcus faecalis (6.5%), k. pneumoniae (5.9%), group b streptococci (5.7%), p. mirabilis (3.0%) and s. saprophyticus (1.8%). the majority of subjects with s. saprophyticus were women 15-29 years of  age (63.8%). in this age group, s. saprophyticus constituted 12.5% of all urinary tract pathogens. s. saprophyticus is a common urinary tract pathogen in young women, but its relative importance is low compared with e. coli even in this patient group. for women in other ages and for men, growth of s. saprophyticus is a quite uncommon finding.

TI  == antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  == the aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella enterica ser. enteritidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. the tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. in the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the ph values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. the inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. phosphates obviously made the development of most gram-positive bacteria impossible. especially micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. on the other  hand, gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. the exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. it should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates hexa68 and hexa70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. by comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be  concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on ph values.

TI  == standardization of isothermal microcalorimetry in urinary tract infection detection by using artificial urine.
AB  == purpose: isothermal microcalorimetry (imc) has recently been reported as a new method to rapidly detect urinary tract pathogens (utp). however, further application of microcalorimetry in the clinical setting requires a standardized procedure. an important step toward such standardization is to use a reproducible growth medium. in this study, we investigated the potential of artificial urine in combination with microcalorimetry for detection of common utp. methods: a microcalorimeter equipped with 48 channels was used. detection was accomplished,  and growth was monitored for four bacterial strains in artificial urine at 37 degrees c by measuring metabolic heat flow (muw = muj/s) as a function of time. the strains were escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, and  staphylococcus aureus. result: bacterial growth was detected after 3-32 h with decreasing inoculums down to 1 cfu. the gram-negative strains grew and were detected faster than their gram-positive counterparts. the growth rates the different strains were 0.75 +/- 0.11 for e. coli, 0.74 +/- 0.10 for e. faecalis,  1.31 +/- 0.04 for p. mirabilis, and 0.56 +/- 0.20 for s. aureus. the shape of individual heat flow curves was characteristic for each species independent of its initial concentration. conclusions: imc allows rapid detection of utp in artificial urine. clearly, different heat flow patterns enable accurate pathogen  differentiation. utp detection after only 4 h is realistic. the rapid detection of utp tested in standardized artificial urine proves the diagnostic potential of imc and warrants further microcalorimetric studies in the clinical setting of urinary tract infections.

TI  == type i and type ii mechanisms of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy: an in vitro  study on gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background and objectives: antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) employs a non-toxic photosensitizer (ps) and visible light, which in the presence of oxygen produce reactive oxygen species (ros), such as singlet oxygen ((1) o(2), produced via type ii mechanism) and hydroxyl radical (ho(.), produced via type i mechanism). this study examined the relative contributions of (1) o(2) and ho(.)  to apdt killing of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. study design/materials and methods: fluorescence probes, 3'-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-fluorescein (hpf) and singlet oxygen sensor green reagent (sosg) were used to determine ho(.) and (1) o(2) produced by illumination of two  ps: tris-cationic-buckminsterfullerene (bb6) and a conjugate between polyethylenimine and chlorin(e6) (pei-ce6). dimethylthiourea is a ho(.) scavenger, while sodium azide (nan(3)) is a quencher of (1) o(2). both apdt and killing by fenton reaction (chemical generation of ho(.)) were carried out on gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). results: conjugate pei-ce6 mainly produced (1) o(2) (quenched by nan(3)), while bb6 produced ho(.) in addition to (1) o(2) when nan(3) potentiated probe activation. nan(3) also potentiated hpf activation by fenton reagent. all bacteria were killed by fenton reagent but gram-positive bacteria needed a higher concentration than gram-negatives. nan(3) potentiated fenton-mediated killing of  all bacteria. the ratio of apdt killing between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was 2 or 4:1 for bb6 and 25:1 for conjugate pei-ce6. there was a nan(3)  dose-dependent inhibition of apdt killing using both pei-ce6 and bb6 against gram-negative bacteria while nan(3) almost failed to inhibit killing of gram-positive bacteria. conclusion: azidyl radicals may be formed from nan(3) and ho(.). it may be that gram-negative bacteria are more susceptible to ho(.) while  gram-positive bacteria are more susceptible to (1) o(2). the differences in nan(3) inhibition may reflect differences in the extent of ps binding to bacteria (microenvironment) or differences in penetration of nan(3) into cell walls of bacteria.

TI  == gender and age-dependent etiology of community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  == urinary tract infections (utis) are among the most frequent community-acquired infections worldwide. escherichia coli is the most common uti pathogen although underlying host factors such as patients' age and gender may influence prevalence of causative agents. in this study, 61 273 consecutive urine samples received over a 22-month period from outpatients clinics of an urban area of north italy underwent microbiological culture with subsequent bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of positive samples. a total of 13 820 uropathogens were isolated and their prevalence analyzed according to patient's gender and age group. overall escherichia coli accounted for 67.6% of all isolates, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (8.8%), enterococcus faecalis (6.3%), proteus mirabilis (5.2%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%). data stratification  according to both age and gender showed e. coli isolation rates to be lower in both males aged >/=60 years (52.2%), e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa being more prevalent in this group (11.6% and 7.8%, resp.), as well as in those aged </=14 years (51.3%) in whom p. mirabilis prevalence was found to be as high as 21.2%. streptococcus agalactiae overall prevalence was found to be 2.3% although it was  shown to occur most frequently in women aged between 15 and 59 years (4.1%). susceptibility of e. coli to oral antimicrobial agents was demonstrated to be as  follows: fosfomycin (72.9%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (72.9%), ciprofloxacin (76.8%), ampicillin (48.0%), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (77.5%). in conclusion,  both patients' age and gender are significant factors in determining utis etiology; they can increase accuracy in defining the causative uropathogen as well as providing useful guidance to empiric treatment.

AB  == aim: chronic cystitis in diaper-dependent elderly patients can be a causative pathology for recurrent urinary tract infections (utis) in community hospitals. methods: we analyzed hospital infections to determine causative organisms from january 2007 to december 2009 in patients in a long-term care hospital. the reading causes of hospital infections were utis (30.4%), aspiration pneumonia (cap; 26%) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap; 17.2%). of a total of 3,097 hospital infections over the investigation period, utis were the most common (n=940, 30.4%) followed by cap (n=809, 26%) and hap (n=533, 17.2%). of 278 utis in 2007, the causative strains were escherichia coli (n=106, 38%), enterococcus faecalis (n=44, 16%), proteus mirabilis (n=31, 11%), alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (n=22, 8%), and beta-hemolytic streptococcus (n=14, 5%). extended spectrum beta-lactamase (n=14, 13%) strains were noted in 106 patients with escherichia coli. we then retrospectively examined the records of 110 diaper dependent elderly patients, (medical words, n=52, mix-care wards, n=68) for utis  over the same study period. of these 16 (14.5%) had no utis at any time, 12 (11%) were infected 50% of the time, 17 (15.5%) were infected 51% to 99% of the time and 65 (59%) were infected 100% of the time. the uti rate was not correlated with bladder function or between the 2 wards. we treated bacterial cystitis with antibiotics for 3-5 days but these were unsuccessful. antiseptics worked temporarily, but recurrence or re-infection always occurred. it remains unknown if diapers are a potential cause of chronic cystitis in dependent elderly patients. the clinical dilemma of whether recurrent diaper cystitis should be treated and prohibit the growth and spread of drug-resistant strains, remains challenging.

TI  == microbiological aspects of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls.
AB  == this study aimed to establish the vaginal introitus microbial flora in girls with and without symptoms of vulvovaginitis, and to present the distribution of isolated microorganisms by age groups in girls with vulvovaginitis. we enrolled 500 girls with vulvovaginitis symptoms, aged 2-12 years, referred by their pediatricians for microbiological examination of the vaginal introitus swabs, and 30 age-matched asymptomatic girls. similar microbial flora was isolated in both groups, but the symptomatic girls had significantly more common positive microbiological findings compared to controls (p < 0.001). in symptomatic girls,  the following pathogenic bacteria were isolated: streptococcus pyogenes (4.2%), haemophilus influenzae (0.4%), and staphylococcus aureus (5.8%). bacteria of fecal origin were found in vaginal introitus swabs in 33.8% of cases, most commonly proteus mirabilis (14.4%), enterococcus faecalis (12.2%), and escherichia coli (7.0%). the finding of fecal flora was more common compared to controls, reaching a statistical significance (p < 0.05), as well as in girls aged up to 6 years (p < 0.001). candida species were found in 2.4% of girls with  vulvovaginitis symptoms. conclusion: the microbial ecosystem in girls with clinical signs of vulvovaginitis is complex and variable, and the presence of a microorganism does not necessarily imply that it is the cause of infection. the diagnosis of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls requires a complex and comprehensive approach, and microbiological findings should be interpreted in the context of clinical findings.

TI  == antiadhesive activity of the biosurfactant pseudofactin ii secreted by the arctic bacterium pseudomonas fluorescens bd5.
AB  == background: pseudofactin ii is a recently identified biosurfactant secreted by pseudomonas fluorescens bd5, the strain obtained from freshwater from the arctic  archipelago of svalbard. pseudofactin ii is a novel compound identified as cyclic lipopeptide with a palmitic acid connected to the terminal amino group of eighth  amino acid in peptide moiety. the c-terminal carboxylic group of the last amino acid forms a lactone with the hydroxyl of thr3. adhesion is the first stage of biofilm formation and the best moment for the action of antiadhesive and anti-biofilm compounds. adsorption of biosurfactants to a surface e.g. glass, polystyrene, silicone modifies its hydrophobicity, interfering with the microbial adhesion and desorption processes. in this study the role and applications of pseudofactin ii as a antiadhesive compound has been investigated from medicinal and therapeutic perspectives. results: pseudofactin ii lowered the adhesion to three types of surfaces (glass, polystyrene and silicone) of bacterial strains of five species: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus hirae, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis and two candida albicans strains. pretreatment of a polystyrene surface with 0.5 mg/ml pseudofactin ii inhibited bacterial adhesion by 36-90% and that of c. albicans by 92-99%. the same concentration of pseudofactin ii dislodged 26-70% of preexisting biofilms grown on previously untreated surfaces. pseudofactin ii also caused a marked inhibition of the initial adhesion of e. faecalis, e. coli, e. hirae and c. albicans strains to silicone urethral catheters. the highest concentration tested (0.5 mg/ml) caused a total growth inhibition of s. epidermidis, partial (18-37%) inhibition of other bacteria and 8-9% inhibition of c. albicans growth. conclusion: pseudofactin ii showed antiadhesive activity against several pathogenic microorganisms which are potential biofilm formers on catheters, implants and internal prostheses. up to 99% prevention could be achieved by 0.5 mg/ml pseudofactin ii. in addition, pseudofactin ii dispersed preformed biofilms. pseudofactin ii can be used as a disinfectant or surface coating agent against microbial colonization of different surfaces, e.g. implants or urethral catheters.

TI  == rapid detection of urinary tract pathogens using microcalorimetry: principle, technique and first results.
AB  == what's known on the subject? and what does the study add? microcalorimetry has been applied in several microbiological studies, but never in a clinical urological context. in addition, basic knowledge on the growth of urinary pathogens in urine is still scarce and data regarding the growth rate of many urinary pathogens in urine are still not available. the study demonstrates that this innovative application of microcalorimetry is useful in (i) investigating the growth of urinary pathogens in sterilized urine and (ii) as a rapid tool for  diagnosis of urinary infection as well as for further identification of the causative infectious agent. objective: to investigate the value of isothermal microcalorimetry (imc) in the detection and differentiation of common urinary tract pathogens in urine. imc is a non-specific analytical tool for the measurement of heat in the microwatt range. patients and methods: a microcalorimeter equipped with 48 channels was used. detection was accomplished,  and growth was monitored for four bacterial strains in sterilized urine at 37 degrees c by measuring metabolic heat flow (microw = microj/s) as a function of time. the strains were escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus. results: bacterial growth was detected after 3.1 to 17.1 h with decreasing inocula. the detection limit was 1 colony-forming unit (cfu)/ml for e. coli, 10 cfu/ml for p. mirabilis and e. faecalis and 10(3) cfu/ml for s. aureus. the total heat was highest in p. mirabilis ranging from 10 to 12 j, followed by e. coli (3-4 j), s. aureus (2-3 j) and e. faecalis (1.3-1.5 j). the shape of the heat flow curves was characteristic for each species independent of its initial concentration. conclusions: imc allows rapid detection of bacteriuria, much faster than conventional culture. urinary tract pathogen detection after only 3.1 h is realistic. clearly different heat flow patterns enable accurate pathogen differentiation. due to expeditious identification of urine samples that contain only low colony counts (i.e. less than 10(3) cfu/ml),  imc may become a valuable screening tool for detecting the presence of significant bacteriuria.

TI  == broad identification of bacterial type in urinary tract infection using (1)h nmr  spectroscopy.
AB  == to address the shortcomings of urine culture for the rapid identification of urinary tract infection (uti), we applied (1)h-nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy as a surrogate method for fast screening of microorganisms. study includes 682 urine samples from suspected uti patients, 50 healthy volunteers, and commercially available standard strains of gram negative bacilli (gnb) (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, enterobacter, acinetobacter, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter frundii) and gram positive cocci (gpc) (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus group b, staphylococcus saprophyticus). acetate, lactate, ethanol, succinate, creatinine, trimethylamine  (tma), citrate, trimethylamin-n-oxide, glycine, urea, and hippurate were measured by (1)h nmr spectroscopy. all urine specimens were evaluated with culture method. multivariate discriminant function analysis (dfa) reveals that acetate, lactate,  succinate, and formate were able to differentiate, with high accuracy (99.5%), healthy controls from uti patients. this statistical analysis was also able to classify gnb to gpc infected urine samples with high accuracy (96%). this technique appears to be a promising, rapid, and noninvasive approach to probing gnb and gpc infected urine specimens with its distinguishing metabolic profile. the determination of infection will be very important for rapidly and efficiently measuring the efficacy of a tailored treatment, leading to prompt and appropriate care of uti patients.

TI  == vaginal bacterial flora and cytology in proestrous bitches: role on fertility.
AB  == the study of canine vaginal cytology underwent limited evolution over the years.  presence and significance of inflammatory cells in vaginal smears are little considered aspects in the bitch. moreover, occurrence of vaginal bacteria in breeding bitches during follicular phase of the reproductive cycle, in absence of clinical signs of infection, involves the difficult question of antibiotics administration. the aim of this study was to relate findings in vaginal cytology  (presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, erytrocytes and bacteria) and microbial environment during proestrus with fertility outcomes (development of pregnancy, uterine infection, resorption, abortion and neonatal mortality). bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics normally used in small animal practice was also evaluated. bacteria isolated from vagina, in order of frequency, were enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, pasteurella multocida, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, e. coli haemolyticus, arcanobacterium pyogenes, streptococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. no mycoplasmas were observed. the present study showed that proestrous cytological aspects do not affect fertility. eosinophils were never detected, while erythrocytes were always detected. during diestrus, e. coli was found in all pregnant bitches that developed clinical symptoms of uterine disorders (n = 3), resulting in uterine infection, resorption or abortion, but without statistical significance. vaginal presence of streptococcus spp. in proestrus was instead negatively associated with development of uterine infections (p = 0.005). therefore, streptococcus spp. could have a protective competitive role against more dangerous pathogens affecting fertility of the bitch. among the 12 antibiotics tested, gram-negative bacteria showed a significant sensitivity towards the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid association (p = 0.038). however, antibiotic treatment before mating, on the basis of positive culture, yet in the absence of clinical signs, seems to be unnecessary besides harmful leading to imbalance in vaginal commensal flora with adverse effects on fertility. in conclusion, vaginal bacteria, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erytrocytes should be considered as physiological aspect in the bitch during  proestrus that does not require antibiotic therapy when asymptomatic.

TI  == post-operative wound infection in salvage laryngectomy: does antibiotic prophylaxis have an impact?
AB  == salvage laryngectomy carries a high risk of post-operative infection with reported rates of 40-61%. the purpose of this study was to analyse infections in  our own patients and review the potential impact of our current antibiotic prophylaxis (ap). a retrospective analysis of infection in 26 consecutive patients between 2000 and 2010 undergoing salvage total laryngectomy (sl) following recurrent laryngeal cancer after failed radiotherapy or chemo-radiation was undertaken. the antibiotic prophylaxis was intravenous teicoplanin, cefuroxime and metronidazole at induction and for the following 24 h. infection was defined by tabet and johnson's grade 5, categorized as pharyngocutaneous fistula. fifteen patients (58%) developed a post-operative wound infection, which occurred on average at 12 days after surgery. univariate analysis demonstrated three risk variables that had a significant correlation with infection: alcohol consumption (p = 0.01), cn stage of tumour (p < 0.01), and pre-operative albumin  levels <3.2 g/l (p = 0.012). there was a trend, though not significant, for increased infection in patients with high or low bmis. the most common organisms  isolated from clinical samples from infected patients were methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus mrsa (43%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (36%), serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and enterococcus faecalis (7% each). all these organisms are typical hospital-acquired pathogens. pseudomonas and serratia were  not covered by the prophylactic regime we used. the current antibiotic regime following sl is inadequate as the rate of infection is high. it would therefore seem logical to trial a separate antibiotic protocol of ap for patients undergoing sl that would include an extended course of antibiotics after the standard prophylaxis. in addition, infection rates may also be reduced by improving the metabolic state of patients pre-operatively by multi-disciplinary action. steps should also be taken to reduce cross-infection with nosocomial pathogens in these patients. other aspects of surgical management should be also  taken in consideration.

TI  == a self-loading microfluidic device for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration of antibiotics.
AB  == this article describes a portable microfluidic technology for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of antibiotics against bacteria. the microfluidic platform consists of a set of chambers molded in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (pdms) that are preloaded with antibiotic, dried, and reversibly sealed to a second layer of pdms containing channels that connect the  chambers. the assembled device is degassed via vacuum prior to its use, and the absorption of gas by pdms provides the mechanism for actuating and metering the flow of fluid in the microfluidic channels and chambers. during the operation of  the device, degas driven flow introduces a suspension of bacterial cells, dissolves the antibiotic, and isolates cells in individual chambers without cross contamination. the growth of bacteria in the chambers in the presence of a ph indicator produces a colorimetric change that can be detected visually using ambient light. using this device we measured the mic of vancomycin, tetracycline, and kanamycin against enterococcus faecalis 1131, proteus mirabilis hi4320, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli mg1655 and report values that are comparable to standard liquid broth dilution measurements. the device provides a  simple method for mic determination of individual antibiotics against human pathogens that will have applications for clinical and point-of-care medicine. importantly, this device is designed around simplicity: it requires a single pipetting step to introduce the sample, no additional components or external equipment for its operation, and provides a straightforward visual measurement of cell growth. as the device introduces a novel approach for filling and isolating  dead-end microfluidic chambers that does not require valves and actuators, this technology should find applications in other portable assays and devices.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the canward 2007-2009 study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. all  staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (mic(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/ml and 2 mug/ml, respectively). ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), </=  0.06 mug/ml), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic(90), </= 0.06 mug/ml), staphylococcus epidermidis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml), and enterococcus faecalis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml). over 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/ml. ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and k. pneumoniae. the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus  pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (mic(90), 16 mug/ml). the  broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.

TI  == synergy of nitric oxide and silver sulfadiazine against gram-negative, gram-positive, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
AB  == the synergistic activity between nitric oxide (no) released from diazeniumdiolate-modified proline (proli/no) and silver(i) sulfadiazine (agsd) was evaluated against escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis using a modified broth microdilution technique and a checkerboard-type assay. the combination of no and agsd was defined as synergistic when the fractional bactericidal concentration (fbc) was calculated to be <0.5. gram-negative species were generally more susceptible to the individual antimicrobial agents than the gram-positive bacteria, while gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible to combination therapy. the in vitro synergistic activity of agsd and no observed against a range of pathogens strongly supports future investigation of this therapeutic combination, particularly for its potential use in the treatment of burns and chronic wounds.

TI  == seasonal variation, chemical composition, and analgesic and antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from leaves of tetradenia riparia (hochst.) codd  in southern brazil.
AB  == the seasonal variation of the chemical composition of the essential oil from fresh leaves of tetradenia riparia (hochst.) codd grown in southern brazil was analyzed by gc-ms, and the analgesic and antimicrobial activities of this oil were assayed. the yield of essential oil ranged from 0.17% to 0.26%, with the maximum amount in winter and the minimum in spring. the results obtained from principal components analysis (pca) revealed the existence of high chemical variability in the different seasons. the samples were clearly discriminated into three groups: winter, autumn, and spring-summer. samples collected during winter  contained the highest percentages of calyculone (24.70%), abietadiene (13.54%), and viridiflorol (4.20%). in autumn, the major constituents were ledol (8.74%) and cis-muurolol-5-en-4-alpha-ol (13.78%). samples collected in spring-summer contained the highest percentages of fenchone (12.67%), 14-hydroxy-9-epi-caryophyllene (24.36%), and alpha-cadinol (8.33%). oxygenated sesquiterpenes were predominant in all the samples analyzed. the observed chemovariation might be environmentally determined by a seasonal influence. the essential oil, when given orally at a dose of 200 mg/kg, exhibited good analgesic activity on acetic acid-induced writhing in mice, inhibiting the constrictions by 38.94% to 46.13%, and this effect was not affected by seasonal variation. the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil against the bacterial strains: staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, proteus  mirabilis, morganella morganii, and enterobacter cloacae, and the pathogenic fungus candida albicans was assessed by the disc diffusion method and determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration. the results obtained, followed by measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), indicated  that s. aureus, b. subtilis, and candida albicans were the most sensitive microorganisms, showing largest inhibition, and the lowest mic values varied from 15.6 to 31.2 microg/ml, 7.8 to 15.6 microg/ml, and 31.2 to 62.5 microg/ml, respectively.

TI  == [evaluation of the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of microorganisms isolated from urine in the region of vale do sousa and tamega].
AB  == the urinary tract is one of the more common sites of bacterial infections, especially in women. urinary infection can be defined as an infection of urinary  tract structures which occurs, generally, as a consequence of the presence or colonization by urine bacteria. the aim of this study was to determine the etiology of urinary tract infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents in the region of vale do sousa and tamega. from february 2008 to january 2009, 18653 urine cultures were analyzed. from these cultures 1037 were positive. from this total of positive cultures, 18,3% were from males and 81.7% were from females. in bacteriological positive tests, 23 different strains of microorganisms were found. it was verified that the most frequent microorganism was escherichia coli, followed by proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. for antimicrobial susceptibility it was verified that escherichia coli showed low susceptibility to amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole. proteus mirabilis showed good susceptibility to cefotaxime and low to cotrimoxazole, amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin. for klebsiella pneumoniae was found only a reasonable susceptibility to gentamicin and enterococcus faecalis showed amoxicillin susceptibility. pseudomonas aeruginosa showed low susceptibility to all antibiotics analyzed with the exception of the combination piperacillin/tazobactam. in conclusion, this study shows that escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae are the  three main microorganisms that causes urinary infections in the region of vale do sousa and tamega. therefore, the antimicrobial empirically used must have a spectrum against enterobacteria, because they are the most likely to be present in urinary tract infections acquired in the community. a periodic analysis of the susceptibility profile should be performed over time for each region in order to  help in the beginning of the empirical antimicrobial treatment.

TI  == survival of campylobacter jejuni under conditions of atmospheric oxygen tension with the support of pseudomonas spp.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is a major food-borne pathogen. despite causing enteritis in humans, it is a well-adapted intestinal microorganism in animals, hardly ever generating disease symptoms. nevertheless, as a true microaerophilic microorganism it is still puzzling how campylobacter cells can survive on chicken meat, the main source of human infection. in this study, we demonstrate that c. jejuni is able to withstand conditions of atmospheric oxygen tension when cocultured with pseudomonas species, major food-spoiling bacteria that are frequently found on chicken meat in rather high numbers. using an in vitro survival assay, interactions of 145 c. jejuni wild-type strains and field isolates from chicken meat, broiler feces, and human clinical samples with type strains and food isolates of pseudomonas spp., proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, micrococcus luteus, and enterococcus faecalis were studied. when inoculated alone or in coculture with proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, micrococcus luteus, or enterococcus faecalis type strains, campylobacter cells were able to survive ambient oxygen levels for no more than 18 h. in contrast, campylobacter bacteria inoculated with type strains or wild-type isolates of pseudomonas showed a prolonged aerobic survival of up to >48 h. this microbial commensalism was diverse in c. jejuni isolates from different sources; isolates from chicken meat and humans in coculture with pseudomonas putida were able to use this survival support better than fecal isolates from broilers. scanning electron microscopy revealed the development of fiberlike structures braiding p.  putida and c. jejuni cells. hence, it seems that microaerophilic c. jejuni is able to survive ambient atmospheric oxygen tension by metabolic commensalism with pseudomonas spp. this bacterium-bacterium interaction might set the basis for survival of c. jejuni on chicken meat and thus be the prerequisite step in the pathway toward human infection.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
AB  == human beta-defensin 2 (hbd-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. we determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hbd-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to  eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. the native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hbd-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hbd-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. characteristically, a. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (mdr) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hbd-2 (vld(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-mdr (wild-type) a. baumannii  strains (vld(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). bactericidal activity of hbd-2 was less pronounced against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis  strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. these observations give  indications that the natural hbd-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting mdr phenotypes.

TI  == photoantimicrobials as a potential local approach to geriatric utis.
AB  == aims: to test the efficacy of acceptable photoantimicrobial agents against bacterial pathogens implicated in complicated urinary tract infection (uti) in comparison with conventionally employed antibacterials. methods and results: toluidine blue (tb), methylene blue (mb), 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ala), trimethoprim and levofloxacin were employed in the study against the typical uti-implicated pathogens staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and proteus mirabilis. standard bacterial cell culture was used to assay the activity both in the dark and under 660-nm led-illuminated conditions. tb and mb were highly photoactive across the range and exhibited rapid kill rates, their effects being  assayed after 20-min illumination, rather than the 18-h incubation employed with  the other compounds. trimethoprim was inactive against all bacteria except pr. mirabilis, while levofloxacin maintained highly bactericidal activity throughout. ala required high concentrations for effective action but, for porphyrin production in situ, also required an 18-h incubation. conclusions: tb and mb were highly and rapidly photobactericidal in comparison with the remaining agents tested. significance and impact of the study: ubiquitous catheterization of geriatric patients offers a portal for light delivery to the urinary tract. the photoantimicrobial approach thus offers considerable potential.

TI  == [etiological factors of community acquired urinary tract infections in hospitalized patients].
AB  == introduction: etiological factors of community-acquired urinary tract infections  (uti) are specific for age, gender, season, complication of uti and type of uti.  their prevalence and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents shows geographic and  time variability. purpose: to evaluate etiological characteristics of acute community-acquired uti in hospitalised patients. patients and methods: this retrospective-prospective study included 200 adult patients with community-acquired uti who were, in view of the serious clinical picture and unsuccessful ambulatory treatment, hospitalised in the clinic for infectious diseases in tuzla, for a period of two years (2006 and 2007). the data concerning the age, gender, season, complication of uti and type of uti were collected from  the patient's records. urine analysis was done following standard microbiological methods, and the antibiogram was done following standard disc-diffusion method on the mueller-hinton agar. work results: the dominant etiological factors of uti were: e. coli (73.5%), klebsiella spp. (8.5%), proteus mirabilis (5.5%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.5%) and enterococcus faecalis (3%). the predominant etiological factor of this uti was e. coli (p < 0.0001). e. coli was significantly more frequent etiological factor of uti in females (p < 0.0001). there was no significant difference in the frequency between etiological factors  of uti for different age groups of patients (p = 0.173), or for different seasons (p > 0.05). all etiological factors are significantly more frequent during warmer periods of the year (p < 0.05). e. coli is a significantly more frequent etiological factor in complicated and non-complicated pyelonephrytis and cystourethritis (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference of frequency  between etiological factors of prostatitis (p = 0.7163). by analyzing the susceptibility for antimicrobials, we found that e. coli has good susceptibility  for cephalosporins of the third generation, for gentamycin, nitrofurantoin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and pipemidin acid (susceptibility higher than 88.7%), klebsiella spp. for imipenem and meropenem (susceptibility 100%), proteus mirabilis for imipenem (susceptibility 100%) and relatively for amikacin (susceptibility 81.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa for imipenem (susceptibility 100%) and for meropenem (susceptibility 87.5%) and enterococcus faecalis for vancomycin (susceptibility 100%) and relatively for ampicillin, amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin,  doxicyclin and nitrofurantoin (susceptibility 83.4%). conclusion: etiological characteristics of uti are specific for different regions. evaluation of these characteristics in our region is the basis for empirical antimicrobial therapy of uti, which is necessary for a timely and successful treatment of uti.

TI  == proteolytic bacteria in the lower digestive tract of poultry may affect avian influenza virus pathogenicity.
AB  == proteolytic cleavage of hemagglutinin is required for cell entry by receptor-mediated endocytosis and plays a key role in pathogenicity of the influenza virus. despite several studies describing relationships between bacterial proteases and influenza a viral activation in mammals, very little is known about the role of the normal bacterial flora of birds on hemagglutinin activation. we examined the indigenous intestinal microflora of 100 mixed-sex, 27-d-old ross chickens from a commercial poultry facility for protease-secreting  bacteria. protease-secreting bacteria were isolated from 82 of 100 chickens with  50 birds exhibiting 2 or more protease-secreting bacterial species. a total of 20 protease-secreting bacterial species were identified: 17 gram-positive cocci, 2 gram-positive rods, and 1 gram-negative rod. enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus  gallinarum, and proteus mirabilis were the most frequently observed protease-secreting bacterial species. the presence of proteolytic bacteria in the intestinal tract of poultry in this study suggests the possibility of yet-to-be-described role(s) in cleavage of hemagglutinin that may alter the pathogenicity of avian influenza viruses.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of selected plant species from "the argentine puna" against sensitive and multi-resistant bacteria.
AB  == aim: the plant species reported here are traditionally used in the "puna" or "altiplano" of argentina for ailments related to bacterial infections. the aim of this study was to evaluate their antimicrobial properties against a panel of sensitive and multi-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. materials and methods: the antimicrobial activity of tinctures and aqueous extracts (baccharis boliviensis, chiliotrichiopsis keidelii, chuquiraga atacamensis, fabiana bryoides, fabiana densa, fabiana punensis, frankenia triandra, parastrephia lucida, parastrephia lepidophylla, parastrephia phyliciformis, tetraglochin cristatum) was determined using the agar macrodilution and broth microdilution methods recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi, formerly nccls). the antibiotic resistant clinical strains were  isolated from nosocomial infection in human lesions of skin and soft parts. results: the ethanolic extracts of 11 plant species inhibited the growth of one or more of the following strains: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa. ethanol extracts (tinctures) of aerial parts of baccharis, fabiana and parastrephia showed the highest levels of  antibacterial activity on methicillin, oxacillin and gentamicin resistant staphylococcus with mic values from 20 to 150 microg/ml. baccharis boliviensis and fabiana bryoides were more active than the other plant species on enterococcus faecalis with different phenotype. the most interesting activity on  multi-resistant gram-negative strains was obtained from chuquiraga atacamensis. parastrephia species showed activity against enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. the ethanolic extracts exhibited stronger activity and broader spectrum of action than aqueous extracts. the extracts were  bactericidal in most cases. conclusions: the presence of antibacterial activity in puna plant extracts against multi-resistant bacteria give support to their traditional use for treating conditions associated with microorganisms in humans  and animals and consequently seems promising for the treatment of multi-resistant bacteria.

TI  == catheter-related urinary tract infection in patients suffering from spinal cord injuries.
AB  == urinary tract infection is commoner in patients with spinal cord injuries because of incomplete bladder emptying and the use of catheters that can result in the introduction of bacteria into the bladder. 145 patients suffering from spinal cord injuries, admitted to the institute for physical medicine and rehabilitation, centre for paraplegia of the clinical centre of the university of sarajevo, were included. the patients were divided in three groups according to the method of bladder drainage: group a (n=61) consisted of patients on clean intermittent catheterization; group b (n=54) consisted of patients with indwelling catheters; group c (n=30) consisted of patients who had performed self-catheterization. from a total of 4539 urine samples, 3963 (87,3%) were positive and 576 (12,7%) were sterile. more than 90% of the infected patients were asymptomatic. the overall rate of urinary infection amounted to about 2,1 episodes, and bacteriuria to 8,1 episodes per patient. 77% of infections (113/145) were acquired within seven days from catheterization. infection was usually polymicrobial; the greatest number of urine samples 1770/3943 (44,9%) included more than one bacterium. the vast majority of cases of urinary tract infection and bacteriuria are caused by gram-negative bacilli and enterococci, commensal organisms of the bowel and perineum, representative of those from the hospital environment. providencia stuarti (18,9%) being the most common, followed by proteus mirabilis (16,3%), escherichia coli (11,8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10,2%), klebsiella pneumoniae (8,1%), morganella morgani (5,4%), acinetobacter baumannii (4,6%), providencia rettgeri (3,5%). 15,7% of isolates were gram-positive with enterococcus faecalis (8,6%) as the most common. 55,3% of isolates were multidrug-resistant, and the highest rates of resistance were found among acinetobacter baumannii (87,8%), providencia rettgeri (86,7%), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (85,4%), providencia stuarti (84,3%) and morganella morgani (81,0%). lower rates of resistance were found in group c, i.e. patients on intermittent self-catheterisation. eradication of organisms was achieved in only 53 (10,05%) of patients; hence, antibiotic therapy had no or very low effect. significant correlations were found between the method of catheterization and the frequency of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections. the analysis of group c showed a rate of lower urinary tract infection and bacteriuria than the other two groups of patients. the objective of this study is the update of etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility in urinary tract infections in this group of patients. in addition, possible correlations between uti and the type of bladder  management were examined.

TI  == large scale multiplex pcr improves pathogen detection by dna microarrays.
AB  == background: medium density dna microchips that carry a collection of probes for a broad spectrum of pathogens, have the potential to be powerful tools for simultaneous species identification, detection of virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance determinants. however, their widespread use in microbiological diagnostics is limited by the problem of low pathogen numbers in  clinical specimens revealing relatively low amounts of pathogen dna. results: to  increase the detection power of a fluorescence-based prototype-microarray designed to identify pathogenic microorganisms involved in sepsis, we propose a large scale multiplex pcr (lsplex pcr) for amplification of several dozens of gene-segments of 9 pathogenic species. this protocol employs a large set of primer pairs, potentially able to amplify 800 different gene segments that correspond to the capture probes spotted on the microarray. the lsplex protocol is shown to selectively amplify only the gene segments corresponding to the specific pathogen present in the analyte. application of lsplex increases the microarray detection of target templates by a factor of 100 to 1000. conclusion:  our data provide a proof of principle for the improvement of detection of pathogen dna by microarray hybridization by using lsplex pcr.

AB  == the crystalline bacterial biofilms that encrust foley catheters compromise the care of many elderly and disabled patients. the aim of this study was to examine  whether the biocide triclosan can prevent encrustation by the mixed flora of uropathogens that commonly infect patients undergoing long-term catheterization.  models of the catheterized bladder were inoculated with communities of organisms  isolated from patients who were experiencing catheter blockage. the catheter retention balloons were inflated with water or triclosan (3 g triclosan l(-1) in  0.1 m sodium carbonate) and urine was supplied to the models for up to 7 days. the effect of triclosan was recorded on the viable cell populations, the ph of the residual urine and the times that catheters took to block. the extent of encrustation of the catheters was visualized by scanning electron microscopy. in  models inoculated with communities containing proteus mirabilis, triclosan prevented the rise in urinary ph that drives crystalline biofilm formation and catheter blockage. the biocide had no effect on populations of enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli and  klebsiella pneumoniae were eliminated from the residual urine and the catheters drained freely for the 7-day experimental period. in models inoculated with a mixed community containing providencia rettgeri, catheters inflated with triclosan continued to block rapidly. although k. pneumoniae and proteus vulgaris were eliminated from the residual urine, there was no effect on the viability of  providencia rettgeri. the results indicate that the triclosan strategy should be  limited to the treatment of patients who are infected with proteus mirabilis.

TI  == [influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial  susceptibility test results by the automated microbial systems].
AB  == the influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results was evaluated for the three automated microbial systems, walkaway-40 (dade microscan, west sacramento, ca, usa), vitek  2 compact (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) and raisus (nissui pharmaceutical, tokyo). in the evaluation, two different species or two different strains were mixed in serial ratios and adjusted to the inoculum cell suspension for the respective systems, and then tested for the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. for the species-identification, all the three automated systems experienced incorrect identifications others from the species inoculated with higher likelihoods (> 90%), e.g. enterobacter cloacae plus klebsiella pneumoniae resulted in k. ornithinolytica or e. aerogenes with 93% to  97% likelihoods at the mixing ratio 9 to 1. whereas, the mixings extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing and non-producing escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant (mrsa) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant (vr) and vancomycin-susceptible (vs) enterococcus faecalis, always resulted in correct detection of a small portion of resistant cells. however, minimum ratios of resistant cells for the correct detection varied by the systems, that is, raisus required 70% of mrsa, vitek 2 compact was 8%, and the walkaway-40 was 1%. also, when the cell suspension of vs  e. faecalis spiked with proteus mirabilis was tested, the walkaway-40 reported as being very rare biotype, but both vitek 2 compact and raisus reported as the test inoculum being vr e. faecalis. with these results, it can be concluded that: first, incorrect species-identifications others from the inoculated species easily occur when the inoculum contains different species even at the ratio visibly indiscernible on the primary isolation agar plate. secondly, the automated microbial systems always intend to detect antimicrobial resistant cells in the inoculum rather than to detect major susceptible cells to prevent us from  reporting very major error interpretation.

TI  == surveillance study in europe and brazil on clinical aspects and antimicrobial resistance epidemiology in females with cystitis (aresc): implications for empiric therapy.
AB  == background: uncomplicated cystitis in females is among the most frequent infections in community. objective: to determine clinical aspects, epidemiology,  and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens. intervention: patients were investigated clinically and with urinalysis and urine culture. measurements: this survey started in 2003 and ended in 2006 including 68 centres in nine european countries and in brazil. female patients between 18 and 65 yr with symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis were consecutively enrolled and clinically evaluated. uropathogens were identified and their susceptibility tested for nine antimicrobials. results and limitations: clinical data of 4264 eligible patients  were analysed. a positive urine culture was found in 74.6%. within the 3018 pathogens, escherichia coli (e. coli) was most frequent (76.7%), followed by enterococcus faecalis (4.0%), staphylococcus saprophyticus (3.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.5%), and proteus mirabilis (3.5%). e. coli showed the highest rate  of susceptibility to fosfomycin (98.1%) followed by mecillinam (95.8%), nitrofurantoin (95.2%), and ciprofloxacin (91.8%). the lowest rate was found for  ampicillin (45.1%). for the total spectrum the order was fosfomycin (96.4%), mecillinam (95.9%), ciprofloxacin (90.3%), and nitrofurantoin (87.0%). in all countries a susceptibility rate to e. coli above 90% was found only for fosfomycin, mecillinam, and nitrofurantoin. the susceptibility rates varied significantly from country to country (p<0.0001), except for fosfomycin, mecillinam, and nitrofurantoin. conclusions: despite wide cross-country variability of bacterial susceptibility/resistance rates to the other antimicrobials tested, fosfomycin, mecillinam, and nitrofurantoin have preserved  their in vitro activity in all countries investigated. they may represent good options for the empiric therapy of female patients with uncomplicated cystitis.

TI  == first prize: novel uropathogen-resistant coatings inspired by marine mussels.
AB  == background and purpose: success in the prevention of urinary device infections has been elusive, largely due to multiple bacterial attachment strategies and the development of urinary conditioning films. we investigated a novel anti-fouling coating consisting of mussel adhesive protein mimics conjugated to polyethylene glycol (mpeg-dopa(3)) for its potential to resist conditioning film formation and uropathogen attachment in human urine. methods: model tio(2) -coated silicon disks ( approximately 75 mm(2)) were either coated with mpeg-dopa(3) or left uncoated and sterilized using ethylene oxide gas. for bacterial attachment experiments, coated and uncoated surfaces were separately challenged with bacterial strains comprising six major uropathogenic species for 24 hours at 37 degrees c in human pooled urine. starting inoculum for each strain was 10(5) cfu/ml and 0.5 ml was used per disk. following incubation, the disks were thoroughly rinsed in phosphate buffered saline to remove non-adherent and weakly-adherent organisms and cell scrapers were employed to dislodge those that  were firmly attached. adherent bacteria were quantitated using dilution plating.  representative disks were also examined using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray analysis, and live/dead viability staining. results: the  mpeg-dopa(3) coating significantly resisted the attachment of all uropathogens tested, with a maximum >231-fold reduction in adherence for escherichia coli gr-12, enterococcus faecalis 23241, and proteus mirabilis 296 compared to uncoated tio(2) disks. scanning electron microscopy and viability staining analyses also reflected these results and demonstrated the ability of the coating to resist urinary constituent adherence as well. conclusion: model surfaces coated with mpeg-dopa(3) strongly resisted both urinary film formation and bacterial attachment in vitro. future in vitro and in vivo studies will be conducted to assess whether similar findings can be demonstrated when these polymer coatings are applied to urologic devices.

TI  == the establishment of resistance phenotypes for bacteria isolated from outpatients in urine cultures.
AB  == from 1911 outpatients, who addressed a timisoara private clinical laboratory, from january to december 2005, we collected 1,889 urine cultures, 431 being positive. bacteria identification was generally done using morphological, cultural, biochemical characters and pathogenicity tests. sensitivity testing to  antimicrobial medical drugs was done by using the classical diffusion kirby-bauer method and the automatic analyzer osiris, also. the main bacteria involved in the etiology of these infections were represented by enterobacteriaceae, head of the  list being escherichia coli (81.21%), followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (8.35%) and proteus mirabilis (3.02%). we also isolated gram positive cocci (in a much smaller proportion), mainly represented by enterococcus faecalis (1.16%), staphylococcus aureus (0.93%), streptococcus agalactiae, and also gram negative non-fermentative bacilli, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.93%) or acinetobacter baumanii (0.23%). as soon as we performed the sensitivity tests, we divided them  in resistance phenotypes: most of the enterobacteriaceae were integrated in the wild phenotype, followed by the penicillinase producing phenotype. an e. coli strain (0.29%) and 3 klebsiella pneumoniae strains (8.33%) were integrated in the large spectrum, multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing phenotype, also associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; non-fermentative bacilli did not present special resistance problems, the four pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were integrated in the wild phenotype (secreting induced chromosomal cephalosporinase). as for staphylococcus aureus it was identified a strain having fluoroquinolone resistance, two strains secreting penicillinase and having a k (nm) phenotype and a strain secreting penicillinase  only. antibiotic resistance represents a major concern for patients, physicians,  healthcare managers, and policymakers. the use of antibiotics is closely linked with the development of acquired antibiotic resistance.

TI  == [epidemiology and treatment of acute prostatitis after prostatic biopsy].
AB  == objective: acute prostatitis is the main complication of prostatic biopsies (pb)  and sometimes requires hospitalisation and appropriate antibiotic therapy. this study evaluated the pathogens responsible and proposes a statistically adapted empirical antibiotic therapy. patients and methods: this retrospective (from 2000 to 2006) two-centre study included 17 patients hospitalised for acute prostatitis after pb in a series of 1,216 biopsies. bacteriological documentation was based on urine cultures, blood cultures, identification of bacteria and antibiotic susceptibility testing. results: all patients received prophylactic antibiotics with a single dose of systemic fluoroquinolone at least 1 h before pb. bacterial  identification was possible in fourteen cases: e. coli (nine cases), proteus mirabilis (one case), klebsiella pneumoniae (one case), enterococcus faecalis (one case), staphylococcus spp (one case), clostridium perfringens (one case). only urine culture was positive in 6 cases (35%), only blood culture was positive in 3 cases (17%), and urine cultures and blood cultures were positive and concordant in 5 cases (29%). a high rate of resistance of e. coli to fluoroquinolones was observed in 88% of cases and to cotrimoxazole in 77% of cases. however, the strain was susceptible to second and third generation cephalosporins (2gc and 3gc) and amikacin in 100% of cases. prostatitis was associated with epididymo-orchitis (3 cases), acute urinary retention (4 cases) and infective endocarditis (1 case). conclusions: identification of the micro-organism responsible for acute prostatitis after biopsy requires a combination of blood cultures and urine cultures. empirical antibiotic therapy is based on the use of 2gc or 3gc, alone or in combination with amikacin depending on the severity of the clinical features.

TI  == in-vitro activity of triclosan-eluting ureteral stents against common bacterial uropathogens.
AB  == background and purpose: ureteral stents are commonly used in urology today, but the biofilms that form on them within hours of placement may harbor bacteria that can result in infection or encrustation. triclosan is an antimicrobial commonly used in consumer and medical products that inhibits bacterial fatty-acid synthesis. the bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect of a triclosan-eluting ureteral stent was tested against clinical isolates of common bacterial uropathogens in an in-vitro setting. materials and methods: triclosan eluted from a drug-loaded ureteral stent was suspended in artificial urine with bacterial pathogens (escherichia coli c1214, proteus mirabilis 296, enterococcus faecalis 1131, klebsiella pneumoniae 280, staphylococcus aureus newman, pseudomonas aeruginosa ak1) to assess growth, virulence-promoter activity, and bacterial adherence to the stent. generic stents were utilized as controls. results: triclosan inhibited the growth of e. faecalis, k. pneumoniae, s. aureus, and p. mirabilis in a dose-dependent manner. pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance. lower concentrations of triclosan downregulated e. coli virulence-factor promoters of outer membrane protein x and p-fimbriae. triclosan  stents had significantly fewer adherent viable bacteria than control stents. conclusions: triclosan-eluting ureteral stents inhibit the growth of common bacterial uropathogens and thus may reduce the incidence of urinary-tract infections and, potentially, encrustation. this drug-eluting stent provides both  mechanical drainage of the upper urinary tract and local antibiosis.

TI  == bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. it is active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. the aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers  and non-producers). gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteroides fragilis. ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs). killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the  first few hours of the kinetic curves against e. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) reduction in the first 2h), b. fragilis (4 log(10) cfu reduction in 4h), mssa (3 log(10) cfu reduction in 4-6h), k. ozaenae (esbl+), k. pneumoniae (esbl+ and -), e. cloacae (esbl-) in 1h and p. mirabilis (esbl+) in the first 2h. the potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of e. coli-b. fragilis and e. coli-b. fragilis-e. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of s. aureus-p. mirabilis. these results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == effective prevention of microbial biofilm formation on medical devices by low-energy surface acoustic waves.
AB  == low-energy surface acoustic waves generated from electrically activated piezo elements are shown to effectively prevent microbial biofilm formation on indwelling medical devices. the development of biofilms by four different bacteria and candida species is prevented when such elastic waves with amplitudes in the nanometer range are applied. acoustic-wave-activated foley catheters have  all their surfaces vibrating with longitudinal and transversal dispersion vectors homogeneously surrounding the catheter surfaces. the acoustic waves at the surface are repulsive to bacteria and interfere with the docking and attachment of planktonic microorganisms to solid surfaces that constitute the initial phases of microbial biofilm development. fimh-mediated adhesion of uropathogenic escherichia coli to guinea pig erythrocytes was prevented at power densities below thresholds that activate bacterial force sensor mechanisms. elevated power  densities dramatically enhanced red blood cell aggregation. we inserted foley urinary catheters attached with elastic-wave-generating actuators into the urinary tracts of male rabbits. the treatment with the elastic acoustic waves maintained urine sterility for up to 9 days compared to 2 days in control catheterized animals. scanning electron microscopy and bioburden analyses revealed diminished biofilm development on these catheters. the ability to prevent biofilm formation on indwelling devices and catheters can benefit the implanted medical device industry.

TI  == 1h nmr spectroscopy in the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  == the (1)h nmr spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (uti). k. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-pd), acetate, ethanol and succinate. the quantity of 1,3-pd produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. other common bacteria causing uti (except for citrobacter frundii), such as escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), enterobacter  aerogenes, acinetobacter baumanii, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gp b and staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. citrobacter frundii (c. frundii) also gives the same nmr results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary  tract infection. the method provides a single-step documentation of k. pneumoniae (and c. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of uti was obtained in 516 cases (84%). the nmr-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. in the present authors' experience, the results of nmr spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.

TI  == rigid sigmoidoscopy: a potential hazard for cross-contamination.
AB  == background: rigid sigmoidoscopy using a disposable or nondisposable sigmoidoscope is a common outpatient procedure. it has been assumed that the nondisposable bellows and light head of the sigmoidoscope remain free from enteric organisms so that the procedure is sterile if a disposable or nondisposable (metal) sigmoidoscope shaft is used. the aim of this study was to identify the presence of organisms within the bellows or light head of the sigmoidoscope. methods: of 21 patients undergoing rigid sigmoidoscopy with a disposable instrument, bacterial cultures were taken from the inside of sterile jackson-pratt bulbs in 12 patients, with the bulbs being used to simulate the nondisposable insufflation bellows. in an additional nine patients, swabs were taken for culture from the inside of the nondisposable light head. results: enteric gram-negative escherichia coli and mixed anaerobic organisms were cultured from the jackson-pratt bulbs in two cases, and gram-positive organisms were cultured in another case. gram-negative organisms, including bacillus, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella, and enterococcus faecalis, were cultured from the inside of the light head in two cases. conclusion: sigmoidoscopy using a disposable instrument is not a sterile procedure and may pose a risk of patient-to-patient cross-contamination by potentially harboring organisms in the bellows or light head.

TI  == effect of triclosan on the development of bacterial biofilms by urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  == objectives: to examine (i) the effect of triclosan on the formation of catheter biofilms by urinary tract pathogens and (ii) the diffusion of triclosan through the retention balloons of urinary catheters. methods: models of the catheterized  bladder were infected with eight different urinary tract pathogens and the effect of triclosan on biofilm formation was assessed by determining the numbers of viable cells colonizing the catheters and by scanning electron microscopy. hplc was used to determine the triclosan concentration in urine draining from models that had been fitted with triclosan-inflated silicone catheters. results: when catheters were inflated with triclosan (10 g/l) the formation of catheter biofilm by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis was prevented. the numbers of enterococcus faecalis and providencia stuartii cells colonizing catheters were also significantly reduced (p<0.05). serratia marcescens, morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, were able to produce extensive catheter biofilms in the presence of triclosan. only p. mirabilis produced alkaline urine and encrusted the catheters. concentrations of 0.02-0.16 mg/l of the biocide were detected in urine draining from the model over the 48 h experimental period. conclusions: triclosan diffused through silicone catheter balloons and produced urinary concentrations that prevented catheter encrustation by p. mirabilis and biofilm formation by several  other common pathogens of the catheterized urinary tract. it had little effect on urease-producing p. aeruginosa, s. marcescens or m. morganii but these species did not produce alkaline urine or crystalline biofilms.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sm-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  == sm-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. in agar dilution susceptibility testing, the mic of sm-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains tested (mic(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was  comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. sm-216601 was also very potent against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (mic(90) = 8 microg/ml). sm-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, moraxella  catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, with mic(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa. the therapeutic efficacy of sm-216601 against experimentally induced  infections in mice caused by s. aureus, e. faecium, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. thus, sm-216601 is a promising  candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.

TI  == analysis of antibiotic susceptibility and resistance of leg ulcer bacterial flora in patients hospitalized at dermatology department, poznan university hospital.
AB  == effective treatment of frequently infected, poorly healing wounds such as leg ulcers due to chronic venous insufficiency poses a major clinical problem. antibiotic resistance in dermatology patients, especially those with non-healing  leg ulcers, is a widespread phenomenon. various antibiotics, mainly broad-spectrum agents, are frequently and sometimes inappropriately prescribed, which often leads to the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria strains. the  aim of this study was to analyze antibiotic susceptibility and resistance of bacterial isolates cultured from leg ulcers. wound swabs were obtained from patients admitted to dermatology department, poznan university of medical sciences, during the 1998-2002 period. bacteriologic diagnosis of 175 wound swabs was performed in compliance with compulsory laboratory methods. the analysis yielded 173 positive results, predominated by staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. bacterial isolates were evaluated for resistance to commonly used antibiotics, taking into consideration the presence of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus strains. antibiotic resistance profiles were compared between the years 1998 and 2002, with detailed account of clinical characteristics and history of leg ulcers disease. the study pointed to an increasing tendency of antibiotic resistance in the study group of patients.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of contemporary pathogens from uncomplicated urinary tract infections isolated in a multicenter italian survey:  possible impact on guidelines.
AB  == during 2004 four italian laboratories assessed the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens causing acute uncomplicated cystitis in female out-patients. a total of 600 urine samples from individuals aged 18-65 were studied. the overall prevalence of escherichia coli was 85.3%. klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus saprophyticus, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis and other rarer species were far less represented. determination of the  antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the entire collection of e. coli (512 organisms) revealed that among the drugs analyzed ampicillin was the least active molecule with only 62.5% of the strains being inhibited. amoxicillin-clavulanate  and cefuroxime displayed a higher potency (87.7% and 89.2% respectively). cotrimoxazole inhibited only 70.1% of the uropathogens. the three fluoquinolones  tested had comparable activity ranging from 83.0% for ciprofloxacin, to 83.6% for levofloxacin and 84.9% for prulifloxacin, indicating an identical spectrum of cross resistance. nitrofurantoin (96.7%) and fosfomycin (98.6%) were the most potent drugs. against the whole collection of uropathogens, only cefuroxime, nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin overcame the threshold of 90% activity, with the fluoroquinolones and amoxicillin-clavulanate suffering from about 15% resistance. the results of this survey strongly support the conclusions of recent italian guidelines concerning the best empiric treatment of uti in this country today.

TI  == peptides selected for binding to a virulent strain of haemophilus influenzae by phage display are bactericidal.
AB  == nontypeable haemophilus influenzae (nthi) is an obligate parasite of the oropharynx of humans, in whom it commonly causes mucosal infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, and bronchitis. we used a subtractive phage display approach to affinity select for peptides binding to the cell surface of a novel invasive nthi strain r2866 (also called int1). over half of the selected phage peptides tested were bactericidal toward r2866 in a dose-dependent manner. five of the clones encoded the same peptide sequence (kqrtsirategclps; clone hi3/17),  while the remaining four clones encoded unique peptides. all of the bactericidal  phage peptides but one were cationic and had similar physical-chemical properties. clone hi3/17 possessed a similar level of activity toward a panel of  clinical nthi isolates and h. influenzae type b strains but lacked bactericidal activity toward gram-positive (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus) and  gram-negative (proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella enterica) bacteria. these data indicate that peptides binding to bacterial surface structures isolated by phage display may prove of value in developing new antibiotics.

TI  == (1)h nmr spectroscopy in the diagnosis of pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced urinary  tract infection.
AB  == the utility of (1)h nmr spectroscopy is suggested and demonstrated for the diagnosis of pseudomonas aeruginosa in urinary tract infection (uti). the specific property of p. aeruginosa of metabolizing nicotinic acid to 6-hydroxynicotinic acid (6-ohna) is exploited. the quantity of 6-ohna produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. other common bacteria causing uti such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, enterobacter aerogenes, acinetobacter baumanii, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter frundii, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gp b and staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize nicotinic acid under similar conditions. the method provides a single-step documentation of p. aeruginosa qualitatively as well as quantitatively. the nmr method is demonstrated on urine samples from 30 patients with uti caused by p. aeruginosa.

AB  == background: globally icus are encountering emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and for some pathogens there are few therapeutic options available. methods: antibiotic in vitro susceptibility data of predominant icu pathogens during 2000-2 were analyzed using data from the surveillance network (tsn) databases in europe (france, germany and italy), canada, and the united states (us). results: oxacillin resistance rates among staphylococcus aureus isolates ranged from 19.7% to 59.4%. penicillin resistance  rates among streptococcus pneumoniae varied from 2.0% in germany to as high as 20.2% in the us; however, ceftriaxone resistance rates were comparably lower, ranging from 0% in germany to 3.4% in italy. vancomycin resistance rates among enterococcus faecalis were < or = 4.5%; however, among enterococcus faecium vancomycin resistance rates were more frequent ranging from 0.8% in france to 76.3% in the united states. putative rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production among enterobacteriaceae were low, <6% among escherichia coli in the five countries studied. ceftriaxone resistance rates were generally lower  than or similar to piperacillin-tazobactam for most of the enterobacteriaceae species examined. fluoroquinolone resistance rates were generally higher for e. coli (6.5% - 13.9%), proteus mirabilis (0-34.7%), and morganella morganii (1.6-20.7%) than other enterobacteriaceae spp (1.5-21.3%). p. aeruginosa demonstrated marked variation in beta-lactam resistance rates among countries. imipenem was the most active compound tested against acinetobacter spp., based on resistance rates. conclusion: there was a wide distribution in resistance patterns among the five countries. compared with other countries, italy showed the highest resistance rates to all the organisms with the exception of enterococcus spp., which were highest in the us. this data highlights the differences in resistance encountered in intensive care units in europe and north america and the need to determine current local resistance patterns by which to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy for intensive care infections.

TI  == the three-dimensional structure of catalase from enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis haem catalase was crystallized using lithium sulfate at neutral ph. the crystals belong to space group r3, with unit-cell parameters a =  b = 236.9, c = 198.1 a. the three-dimensional structure was determined by molecular replacement using a subunit of the proteus mirabilis catalase structure. it was refined against 2.3 a synchrotron data to a free r factor of 21.8%. like other catalases, the e. faecalis catalase is a homotetramer with a fold and structure similar to those of its structurally closest relative p. mirabilis. the solvent structure in the active site is identical in the four subunits but differs from that found in other catalases. the structural consequences of the ramachandran outlier ser196 are discussed.

TI  == [bacterial pathogens, resistance patterns and treatment options in community acquired pediatric urinary tract infection].
AB  == background: epidemiology and resistance patterns of bacterial pathogens in pediatric uti show large interregional variability and rates of bacterial resistances are changing due to different antibiotic treatment. we intended to evaluate data from northern germany. patients and methods: in 100 children (53 female, 47 male, mean age 4.4 +/- 4.2 years) with community acquired uti, who presented in the emergency department of our medical school from 2000 - 2002, urine cultures were performed. inclusion criteria were: acute voiding symptoms, significant bacteriuria with growth of at least 10 (5) colony-forming units/ml urine, leukocyturia > 50/ micro l. exclusion criteria were underlying renal diseases, anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract, age < 2 months and recurrent uti. results: patients presented with a mean rectal temperature of 38.6 +/- 1.3 degrees c, mean crp of 66 +/- 68 mg/dl, mean wbc 13 500 +/- 5 600/ micro  l and mean urinary leukocytes of 425 +/- 363/ micro l. in urine cultures e. coli  was found in 47 % of the cases, enterococcus faecalis 23 %, proteus mirabilis 8 %, klebsiella oxytoca 4 %, pseudomonas aeruginosa 5 % and others 13 %. in 76 % one and in 24 % two different bacterial species (60 % enterococcus faecalis) were cultured. mean resistance rates were in all bacteria (in e. coli): ampicillin 53  % (69 %), ampicillin and sulbactam 51 % (61 %), cefalosporin 1 (st) generation (cefaclor) 48 % (24 %), cefalosporin 2 (nd) generation (cefuroxim) 40 % (3 %), cefalosporin 3 (rd) generation (cefuroxim) 33 % (0 %), tobramycin 30 % (2 %), ciprofloxacine 0 %, cotrimoxazole 40 % (42 %), nitrofurantoin 12 % (0 %). conclusion: the resistance rates to ampicillin (+/- sulbactam) did not increase as compared to previous analyses (1990 - 1995), however, resistance rates to cotrimoxazole and 1 (st) generation cefalosporines increased about 20 %. we conclude that the policies for treatment of uti in children should be re-evaluated every 5 years according to local resistance rates.

TI  == urinary bactericidal activity, urinary excretion and plasma concentrations of gatifloxacin (400 mg) versus ciprofloxacin (500 mg) in healthy volunteers after a single oral dose.
AB  == in an open randomised double-crossover study 12 volunteers (six men, six women) received a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400 mg) or ciprofloxacin (500 mg) to assess urinary bactericidal activity (in eight intervals up to 120 h) and pharmacokinetic (pk) parameters (up to 36 h). plasma concentrations and urinary excretion were determined by hplc with fluorescence detection, and urinary bactericidal titers (ubt) by microdilution-method, using antibiotic-free urine of each volunteer. the mean maximum plasma concentration of gatifloxacin was 3.35 mg/l and that of ciprofloxacin 2.12 mg/l. the mean (median) cumulative renal excretion of the parent drug was for gatifloxacin 81 (83)% of the administered dose within 120 h and for ciprofloxacin 43 (45)%. the ubts, i.e. the highest two-fold dilution (antibiotic-free urine as diluent) of urine still being bactericidal, were determined for an escherichia coli atcc reference strain and nine clinical uropathogens with the following mics (mg/l) for gatifloxacin/ciprofloxacin (microdilution, mhb): e. coli atcc 25922 (0.008/0.008); e. coli 523 (0.06/0.06); klebsiella pneumoniae 1058 (0.03/0.016);  proteus mirabilis 524 (0.125/0.016); pseudomonas aeruginosa 561 (1/0.125); enterococcus faecalis strains 60 an 55 (0.5/1 and 8/32); staphylococcus aureus strains 248 and 596 (both 0.03/0.125) and s. saprophyticus ho94 (0.125/0.25). the median ubts measured within the first 6h for gatifloxacin were between 1:16 and 1:>or=1024 for the gram-negative strains including p. aeruginosa and between 1:8  and 1:>or=1024 for the five gram-positive strains. the median ubts for ciprofloxacin were between 1:64 and 1:>or=1024 for the gram-negative strains (incl p. aeruginosa) and between 1:1.5 and 1:768 for the five gram-positive strains. the ubts up to 12 < 0.05 h showed no difference (p<0.05 ) for both e. coli strains, but ciprofloxacin was superior to gatifloxacin against klebsiella,  proteus and pseudomonas strains and gatifloxacin was superior to ciprofloxacin against all gram-positive strains. for the ubts at 12-24 h, gatifloxacin was generally superior to ciprofloxacin, but showed no difference in the proteus and  pseudomonas strains. the areas under the ubt-time-curve (aubt) up to 120 h showed statistically significant (p ) differences between both quinolones in favour of gatifloxacin against 8 of 10 strains tested, no difference for p. mirabilis and significantly higher activity of ciprofloxacin against p. aeruginosa. in conclusion, gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin had overall comparable initial urinary bactericidal activity with some differences for specific pathogens, some times in favour of gatifloxacin (gram-positives) and some times of ciprofloxacin (usually  gram-negatives), suggesting that for empiric therapy a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400mg) would be clinically equivalent to ciprofloxacin (500 mg) twice daily-in agreement with the results of a clinical study in complicated uti  performed previously [int. j. antimicrob. agents (2004)].

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2001). i. susceptibility distribution].
AB  == the bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 10 institutions in japan were supplied between the period of september and december 2001. then, the susceptibilities of them to a variety of antimicrobial agents were investigated. the number of them were 496 strains. the  breakdown of these strains was gram-positive bacteria as 29.6% and gram-negative  bacteria as 70.4%. susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; against staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (vcm) showed a strong  activity, and this drug also had a strong activity against mrsa in preventing growth of all strains at 1 microgram/ml. in addition, arbekacin (abk) showed strong activity with the mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml against mrsa and prevented growth of all strains at 4 micrograms/ml. abk also showed a strong activity against staphylococcus epidermidis in preventing growth of all strains at 0.5 microgram/ml. ampicillin (abpc) and cefozopran (czop) showed a relatively strong  activity against s. epidermidis (mic90: 8 micrograms/ml). abpc, imipenem (ipm), and vcm showed strong activities against enterococcus faecalis. no increase of low-susceptible strains in e. faecalis was observed against these antimicrobial agents. against escherichia coli, carbapenems showed the highest activities: meropenem (mepm) prevented growth of all strains at 0.25 microgram/ml; ipm prevented growth of all strains at 0.5 microgram/ml. czop and cefotiam (ctm) also showed strong activities against e. coli: mic90 of czop was within 0.125 microgram/ml; mic90 of ctm was within 0.5 microgram/ml. quinolone-resistant e. coli was detected at frequency of 9.3%, which was lower than that in the last year, and was higher level than those in up to 1999. mepm showed the strongest activity against citrobacter freundii in preventing growth of all strains at 0.125 microgram/ml. almost all drugs showed strong activities against klebsiella  pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis, and mepm prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. against serratia marcescens, the mic90 of gentamicin (gm) was the lowest value being 2 micrograms/ml, and those of ipm and carumonam were 8 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost all drugs  were not so active. the mic90 of gm was 8 micrograms/ml, those of ipm and amikacin were 16 micrograms/ml, and those of all other drugs were over than 32 micrograms/ml.

TI  == high-resolution backscatter electron imaging of colloidal gold in lvsem.
AB  == high-resolution backscatter electron (bse) imaging of colloidal gold can be accomplished at low voltage using in-lens or below-the-lens fesems equipped with  either autrata-modified yttrium aluminium garnet (yag) scintillators doped with cerium, or with bse to secondary electron (se) conversion plates. the threshold for bse detection of colloidal gold was 1.8 kev for the yag detector, and the bse/se conversion was sensitive down to 1 kev. gold particles (6, 12 and 18 nm) have an atomic number of 79 and were clearly distinguished at 500,000x by materials contrast and easily discriminated from cell surfaces coated with platinum with an atomic number of 78. bse imaging was relatively insensitive to charging, and build up of carbon contamination on the specimen was transparent to the higher energy bse.

TI  == high resolution cryofesem of microbial surfaces.
AB  == the outer surfaces of three microorganisms, giardia lamblia, enterococcus faecalis, and proteus mirabilis, were investigated by cryo-immobilization followed by sublimation of extracellular ice and cryocoating with either pt alone or pt plus carbon. cryocoated samples were examined at -125 degrees c in either an in-lens field emission sem or a below-the-lens field emission sem. cryocoating with pt alone was sufficient for low magnification observation, but attempts to do high-resolution imaging resulted in radiolysis and cracking of the specimen surface. double coating with pt and carbon, in combination with high resolution backscatter electron detectors, enabled high-resolution imaging of the glycocalyx of bacteria, revealing a sponge-like network over the surface. high resolution examination of bacterial flagella also revealed a periodic substructure. common artifacts included radiolysis leading to "cracking" of the surface, and insufficient deposition of pt resulting in the absence of detectable surface topography.

TI  == diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  == among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (aa) is one of the most important. aa has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on helicobacter pylori. however, there are limited studies on the possible role of aa and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (pa) on the growth and survival of h. pylori. in the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that aa in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mm) inhibited  h. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. in contrast,  under aerobic conditions aa in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mm) significantly increased the survival of h. pylori presumably eliminating the  toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. the hydrophobic derivative of aa, pa (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mm). this effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, clostridium sporogenes and campylobacter jejuni. among these bacterial strains, pa showed a similar inhibitory effect on b. cereus and b. subtilis as observed with h. pylori. the results suggest that pa may be considered an important aa derivative  in eradication of h. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.

TI  == the influence of inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment on patients with bloodstream infections in an intensive care unit.
AB  == objective: to determine the occurrence of inadequate antimicrobial therapy among  critically ill patients with bacteremia and the factors associated with it, to identify the microorganisms that received inadequate antimicrobial treatment, and to determine the relationship between inadequate treatment and patients outcome.  methods: from june 1995 to january 1999 we collected data on all clinically significant icu-bacteremias in our teaching hospital. clinical and microbiological characteristics were recorded and the adequacy of empirical antimicrobial treatment in each case was determined. we defined inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment as applying to infection that was not being effectively treated at the time the causative microorganism and its antibiotic susceptibility were known. multivariate analysis was used to determine the variables associated with inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment and to  evaluate the influence of this on the related mortality to bacteremia, using the  spss package (9.0). results: among 166 intensive care unit patients with bacteremia, 39 (23.5%) received inadequate antimicrobial treatment. in this last  group the mean age of patients was 64.1 +/- 13.2 years, and 64% were men. bacteremia was hospital-acquired in 92% of these cases. eleven percent developed  septic shock and 37.7% severe sepsis, and ultimately fatal underlying disease was present in 28.2% of patients given inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment.  the main sources of bacteremias in this group were: a vascular catheter (15.3%),  respiratory (7.6%) or unknown (53.8%). the microorganisms most frequently isolated in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (29.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (27.3%), enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and candida species (4.5% each). the frequency of coagulase-negative staphylococci in the cases with inappropriate treatment was higher than in the group with appropriate treatment (or 2.62; 95% ci: 1.10-6.21;  p = 0.015). the global mortality rate was 56% and the related mortality was 30% in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment. the only factor associated with inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was the absence of abdominal or respiratory focus (p = 0.04; or = 0.35; 95% ci: 0.12-0.97). septic shock was related to attributable mortality (p = 0.03; or = 3.19; 95% ci: 1.08-9.40), but not inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment (p = 0.24; or =  1.71; 95% ci: 0.66-4.78). conclusion: almost a quarter of critically ill patients with bloodstream infections were given inadequate empirical antibiotic treatment, but mortality was not higher in the group with inadequate treatment than in the group with adequate treatment. this fact was probably due to microbiological factors and clinical features, such as the type of microorganism most frequently  isolated and the source of the bacteremia.

TI  == in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against bacteria from hospitalised patients in the british isles.
AB  == piperacillin/tazobactam is used for empirical therapy of severe and complex infections. we assessed its activity, 9 years after launch, against consecutive,  clinically significant isolates from in-patients in uk and ireland. standardised  disc susceptibility tests were performed on 5031 isolates at 28 hospitals. for quality assurance purposes, 5% of these isolates were collected centrally for mic tests, as were those with exceptional resistances. compared with a similar pre-launch survey in 1991, there were major increases in the proportions of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-haemolytic streptococci and enterococcus faecium isolates collected, balanced by decreases in escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and coagulase-negative staphylococci. these changes in species prevalence mostly favoured organisms with inherent resistance(s) or-in the case of s. aureus-reflected the massive increase of mrsa, up from 0.7% of all isolates in 1991 to 14.8% in 2001. based on the disc tests, piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity against 87% of enterobacteriaceae isolates, 95% of p. aeruginosa, 99% of streptococci and 96% of enterococcus faecalis. resistance nevertheless had increased since 1991 in e. coli from 4 to 10%, klebsiella spp. (5 to 21%) and in ampc-inducible enterobacteriaceae (17 to 23%), though not in p. mirabilis or p. aeruginosa. mic tests confirmed most of the piperacillin/tazobactam resistance found by disc tests in enterobacter spp.,  but indicated susceptibility for about half of the e. coli isolates recorded as resistant in disc tests. this situation might be remedied by reducing the zone breakpoint, but this would increase the "false susceptible" rate unacceptably. thus, if disc tests suggest that an isolate is marginally resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam and the drug is sought as therapy, it is recommended that mic be determined with, e.g., an etest.

TI  == a uk multicentre study of the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens causing urinary tract infection.
AB  == objectives: to determine the prevalence of resistance amongst urinary tract pathogens against antimicrobials used to treat urinary tract infections (utis) in the uk to provide data to help direct empirical therapy. method: during 1999-2000, a total of 1291 bacterial isolates causing uti were collected from 8 centres in the uk. isolates were cultured from patients with (1). community-acquired uti in those less than 65 years old (397), (2). hospital-acquired uti other than those admitted with pyelonephritis (394), (3). pyelonephritis (108) and (4). community-acquired uti in those greater than 65 years old (392). after re-identification, mics for a range of antimicrobials were determined and interpreted using nccls procedures and interpretive guidelines. results: escherichia coli was the predominant pathogen in all categories but the  total percentage for each category varied (56.3-77.3%). the next three pathogens  of importance were enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis which varied in prevalence slightly from category to category. the activity of amoxycillin against e. coli (51.3% susceptible) was greatly reduced as a result of beta-lactamase production and only partially restored by the addition of clavulanic acid (78.8% susceptible). cefuroxime was very active against e. coli using parenteral form breakpoints (97.1% susceptible) but less so using oral form breakpoints (68.6% susceptible). cefuroxime was inactive against  enterococcus spp. and pseudomonas spp. nitrofurantoin was very active against isolates of e. coli (96.3% susceptible) and e. faecalis but not against k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis or pseudomonas aeruginosa. overall susceptibility to trimethoprim ranged from 58.1% to 84.5% for the most prevalent pathogens. ciprofloxacin was highly active against the uti pathogens examined in this study  with susceptibilities of between 88.6% and 97.7% for the most prevalent pathogens (e. coli, n=864, 97.7% susceptible) and was the only oral agent tested with activity against pseudomonas spp. conclusion: these data provide much needed information on the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance amongst pathogens currently causing uti in the uk.

TI  == evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the newly developed rapid lumi eiken/is60 (rl/is60) system automatically determines mics by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. the present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility  testing. chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with mics determined by the reference microdilution method. when the mics of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (qc) strains (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the rl/is60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the qc limits  proposed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the system  was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including e. coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, p. aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae. overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the rl/is60 system and the reference microdilution method. our  results suggest that the rl/is60 system provides rapid and reliable mics of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as qc strains.

AB  == effectors of the innate immune system, the anti-bacterial peptides, have pivotal  roles in preventing infection at epithelial surfaces. here we show that proteinases of the significant human pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis and streptococcus pyogenes, degrade the  antibacterial peptide ll-37. analysis by mass spectrometry of fragments generated by p. aeruginosa elastase in vitro revealed that the initial cleavages occurred at asn-leu and asp-phe, followed by two breaks at arg-ile, thus inactivating the  peptide. proteinases of the other pathogens also degraded ll-37 as determined by  sds-page. ex vivo, p. aeruginosa elastase induced ll-37 degradation in human wound fluid, leading to enhanced bacterial survival. the degradation was blocked  by the metalloproteinase inhibitors gm6001 and 1, 10-phenantroline (both of which inhibited p. aeruginosa elastase, p. mirabilis proteinase, and e. faecalis gelatinase), or the inhibitor e64 (which inhibited s. pyogenes cysteine proteinase). additional experiments demonstrated that dermatan sulphate and disaccharides of the structure [deltaua(2s)-galnac(4,6s)], or sucroseoctasulphate, inhibited the degradation of ll-37. the results indicate that proteolytic degradation of ll-37 is a common virulence mechanism and that molecules which block this degradation could have therapeutic potential.

TI  == chemical constituents and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of lantana  xenica.
AB  == the aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition of lantana xenica essential oil and its antimicrobial activity. the oil from the aerial parts of lantana xenica mold. (verbenacea) was obtained by steam distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. the major constituent of the oil was (e)-caryophyllene (35.2 %), with minor amounts of gamma-cadinene (13.3 %), alpha-pinene (9.3 %), ocimene (9.2 %) and germacrene d (6.6 %). the antimicrobial assays showed that the essential oil of l. xenica inhibited the growth of bacillus cereus and proteus mirabilis and both bacteria were inhibited by (e)-caryophyllene, the major component of the oil. enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis and s. aureus showed a lower inhibition. the bacteria  micrococcus luteus, klebsiella sp., escherichia coli and the yeast candida albicans were insensitive to both the oil and (e)-caryophyllene.

TI  == antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  == in this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (hsp) and fresh frozen plasma (ffp) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. due to the clinical use of hsp and ffp for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that hsp contains marked igg antibody reactivity against antigens of escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter sakazakii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, chlamydia pneumoniae, and candida albicans. although no igm antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in hsp, moderate iga reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. immunoblot analysis  demonstrated specific iga and igg responses against the endoproteinase glu-c and  the superantigens enterotoxin a and b of s. aureus, the iga-protease of neisseria gonorrhoeae, and shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic e. coli. by using 3 different hsp batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. this antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of ffp.

TI  == [can we rely on the results of urine microscopy and culture when tests are performed in general practice?].
AB  == introduction: urinary tract infections (uti) account for 2-5% of consultations in general practice, but only about half the patients with dysuria have significant  bacteriuria (> 100,000 bacteria per ml). a microbiological diagnosis can be made  by examination of a urine sample, and in danish family practice the diagnosis of  uti is often reached by a microscopic analysis or a dip-slide culture test. these methods have a high validity when performed in hospital, but we need knowledge about the validity of microbiological urine examinations when performed in general practice. the aim of this study was to validate detection of bacteriuria  by urine microscopy and dip-slide culture in general practice. material and methods: urine specimens artificially produced by adding a known quantity of bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis) to sterile urine were sent  to 25 general practices for microscopic examination and dip-slide culture. no prior instruction in testing procedure was given. as the gold standard, the results of a standardised culture method performed by skilled laboratory technicians at the department of microbiology, university of southern denmark, were used. results: significant bacteriuria was identified by microscopy with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 83%. the corresponding figures for urine  culture were 95% and 96%. the morphology of bacteria was interpreted correctly in 80% of microscopic examinations, and 60% of the bacteria strains were classified  correctly in terms of their motility. discussion: the results of urine microscopy and culture performed in general practice are to be relied on.

AB  == we report four cases of non-clostridial gas gangrene. all cases were associated with diabetes mellitus as the underlying disease. case 1: a 60-year-old male developed an ulcerative lesion on the dorsum of his left foot. peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, citrobacter freundii and staphyrococcus epidermidis were identified in culture from odoriferous pus. case 2: a 81-year-old female developed a lesion on her vulva spreading to the right lower abdomen. bacteroides bivius, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus and streptococcus faecalis were identified in culture of the odoriferous pus. case 3: a 80-year-old male developed a swollen area with ulcer on the right foot. bacteroides fragiris, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis were identified by culture. case 4: a 52-year-old female developed swelling of her left groin. enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus anginosus were identified in culture from the odoriferous pus. in all patients, a radiological examination revealed the presence of subcutaneous gas in the lesion. prognosis of non-clostridial gas gangrene is usually poor. these four patients, however, all survived. once an infectious sign is seen in the diabetic patient, it is important to discover a gas figure by using the radiological examination (plain film or computed tomography). earlier diagnosis and debridement are the most important for a better prognosis. because workers with diabetes mellitus are now increasing in number, occupational physicians should always keep in mind that a serious infectious disease like non-clostridial gas gangrene can develop even from minor accidental trauma, and they should control the working environment in  the workplace where accidents often happen.

TI  == rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing of urinary tract isolates and samples  by flow cytometry.
AB  == a multiparametric flow cytometry antimicrobial susceptibility test was developed  and its performance was evaluated on clinical urine isolates and samples in comparison with standard methods. alterations in cytoplasmic membrane integrity were monitored by propidium iodide, and the anionic probe bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol (dibac4(3)) was used to measure changes in membrane potential. microbial size and cellular content were analysed by light scattering. twelve antibiotics were tested on 6 atcc control strains, 22 urine isolates and 19 clinical urine samples, variously containing escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, s. saprophyticus and s.  epidermidis. agreement between the flow cytometry results, broth microdilution and disk diffusion tests was 93.9% (n = 328 tests). of the 20 discrepancies observed, 18 were for species other than e. coli. perfect correlation was obtained with five antibiotics, whereas norfloxacin, nitrofurantoin and tetracycline were responsible for 13(65%) of the 20 discrepancies.

TI  == the bactericidal activity of gatifloxacin in plasma and urine.
AB  == objective: to investigate the bactericidal activity of gatifloxacin in serum and  urine against relevant pathogens. methods: serum and urine samples obtained in a  single rising dose pharmacokinetic study were investigated for bactericidal activity. the doses employed were placebo, and 200, 400, 600 and 800 mg of gatifloxacin. results: the titers obtained reflected the dose and susceptibility  of the pathogen. in serum a titer of greater-than-or-equal1:8 was observed for escherichia coli for >24 h after 400 mg; for staphylococcus aureus and acinetobacter baumanii the titer was greater-than-or-equal1:8 for between 12--24  h after 600 mg; for serratia marcescens it was greater-than-or-equal1:8 for >12 h following 800 mg; and for streptococcus pneumoniae it was greater-than-or-equal1:8 for 8 h following 800 mg. in urine, the titers were greater, and for escherichia coli, staphylococcus saprophyticus, proteus mirabilis and enterococcus faecalis the titer was >1:8 for 12--24 h after 200 mg  and for 24--36 h after a 400-mg dose. pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated a titer of >1:8 for 18--24 h following 600 mg. conclusions: these data suggest that gatifloxacin should be efficacious for a wide range of systemic and urinary tract infections.

TI  == the migration of proteus mirabilis and other urinary tract pathogens over foley catheters.
AB  == objective: to examine the ability of organisms that infect the catheterized urinary tract to migrate over the surfaces of foley catheters. materials and methods: in a simple laboratory model, organisms were challenged to migrate across sections of hydrogel-coated latex, hydrogel/silver-coated latex, silicone-coated latex and all-silicone catheters. the sections (1 cm long) were placed as bridges in channels between blocks of agar and the test organisms inoculated onto the agar adjacent to one side of each bridge. the plates were incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h and examined for growth of the test organisms  on the agar on the other side of the bridges. a collection of swarming, swimming  and nonmotile species were tested in the model. the relative mobilities of the test organisms were expressed as migration indices, calculated as the percentage  of tests in which bacterial migration was observed over each type of catheter bridge. results: the swarmer cells of proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris migrated  successfully (migration indices of 73-100) over all four types of catheter. the migration index of serratia marcescens swarmers was reduced to 33 over the silver-coated catheters, but these cells crossed over the other catheter surfaces with ease (indices of 100). pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most mobile of the swimming, non-swarming organisms with indices of 70-22, but this group was less capable of migration than the swarmers. indices were 0-33 for nonmotile organisms. the mean migration indices for the nine species for each type of catheter were 57 (hydrogel-coated latex), 49 (silver/hydrogel-coated latex), 41 (silicone-coated latex) and 35 (all-silicone). the swarmer cells of p. mirabilis  moved through populations of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis, and then migrated over sections  of hydrogel-coated latex catheters with little or no reduction in migration index. they were also capable of transporting the nonmotile cells of k. pneumoniae and s. aureus over the catheters. the migration index of p. mirabilis  swarmers was substantially reduced in the presence of ps. aeruginosa and s. marcescens. conclusions: hydrogel coatings facilitate the migration of urinary tract pathogens over catheter surfaces. with the exception of s. marcescens, the  incorporation of silver into the hydrogel did not inhibit migration. swarmer cells were particularly effective at moving over catheters and p. mirabilis swarmers were also capable of transporting other species. this suggests that inhibitors of swarming could be useful in controlling catheter-associated infection and the complications resulting from the spread of bacterial biofilm over catheters.

TI  == urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of gemifloxacin and ofloxacin after a single oral dose in healthy volunteers.
AB  == in a randomized crossover study, 16 volunteers (8 men, 8 women) received single oral doses of 320 mg of gemifloxacin and 400 mg of ofloxacin on two separate occasions in the fasting state to assess the urinary excretion and urinary bactericidal titers (ubts) at intervals for up to 144 h. ofloxacin showed higher  concentrations in urine compared with those of gemifloxacin. the median (range) cumulative excretion of gemifloxacin was 29.7% (8.4 to 48.7%) of the parent drug  administered, and median (range) cumulative excretion of ofloxacin was 84.3% (46.5 to 95.2%) of the parent drug administered. the ubts, i.e., the highest twofold dilutions (with antibiotic-free urine as the diluent) of urine that were  still bactericidal, were determined for a reference strain and nine uropathogens  for which the mics of gemifloxacin and ofloxacin were as follows: escherichia coli atcc 25922, 0.016 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively; klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.03 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively; proteus mirabilis, 0.125 and 0.125 microg/ml, respectively; escherichia coli, 0.06 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively;  pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; staphylococcus aureus, 0.008 and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively; enterococcus faecalis, 0.06 and 2 microg/ml, respectively; staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; enterococcus faecalis, 0.5 and 32 microg/ml, respectively; and staphylococcus aureus, 2 and 32 microg/ml, respectively. generally, the ubts for  gram-positive uropathogens were higher for gemifloxacin than for ofloxacin and the ubts for gram-negative uropathogens were higher for ofloxacin than for gemifloxacin. according to the ubts, ofloxacin-resistant uropathogens (mics, >or=4 mg/liter) should also be considered gemifloxacin resistant. although clinical trials have shown that gemifloxacin is effective for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, whether an oral dosage of 320 mg of gemifloxacin once daily is also adequate for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections has yet to be confirmed.

TI  == dental unit waterlines: review and product evaluation.
AB  == dental practitioners must be knowledgeable regarding microbial contamination and  biofilm formation in dental unit waterlines. education should stress the need for improvement in the quality of water delivered to patients during treatment. manufacturers must also play an important role by providing training and education regarding the proper use and maintenance of their systems. dental facilities, both public and private, need reliable methods to prevent the development of biofilms within duws. these methods must be economical and require minimal effort to use on the part of the dental staff. in order for the system to work efficiently, the effluent water that is produced must be compatible with dental materials and be potentially free from toxic or carcinogenic materials. there are numerous models of water filtration units and chemical flushes available to the dental practitioner. however, the food and drug administration have not approved all products currently on the market. our evaluation of zerosil, a new waterline-cleaning product, indicates that it is very easy to use  and is extremely effective in killing the commonly found microorganisms in dental unit waterlines, as well as eliminating existing biofilms. it is also economical  and requires minimum staff time to keep the waterlines clean. following the initial treatments during week one, the water emanating from the duws was free from any viable microorganisms. this effect was present the entire three weeks in which the waterlines were treated. the elimination of viable microorganisms continued into a fourth study week, even though no further treatment of the duws  was performed. although the manufacturer recommends weekly treatment of duws following the initial treatment regimen, this result indicates that the product has a longer lasting effect than previously thought. finally, the product can be  delivered through any of the commercially available reservoir/bottle water delivery systems. from our study, zerosil appears to meet the demanding requirements of keeping dental unit waterlines clean. based on the research that  has been done thus far, no universal treatment protocol can be recommended. a combination of approaches may offer the best available assurance of high-quality  dental treatment water. independent water reservoir systems, when used with a periodic chemical treatment protocol, have demonstrated safety and efficacy. until we reach a point when a recommendation based on thorough evaluations can be made, dental offices should follow current ada, osap, and cdc guidelines: flush waterlines for two to three minutes at the beginning of each day and for 20 to 30 seconds between each patient, and anti-retraction valves should be installed to prevent oral fluids from being drawn into dental waterlines. it is expected that  in the near future, the dental practitioner will have a choice of proven systems  and products to deal with this issue. until that time, one should carefully evaluate any product or system being considered to prevent the formation of biofilms in duws.

TI  == urinary tract infections in general practice in a rural community in south trinidad.
AB  == objective: a prospective study was carried out at a general practice in south trinidad, to assess the sensitivity profiles of urinary isolates in this remote rural community. methods: quantitative bacteriologic cultures were performed according to standard procedures. identification of isolates was based on gram reaction, morphology and biochemical reactions. susceptibility testing was carried out using commonly prescribed antimicrobials for the treatment of urinary tract infections. results: from 779 urine specimens, 49% were culture positive for counts >105 organisms per ml. three hundred and eighteen were aged 21 years and above and 85.5% of these were females. the lowest incidence of urinary tract  infections, 8%, was seen among the 13-20 year old age group. most males above 50  years had indwelling urethral catheters due to prostatic disease. escherichia coli was the predominant isolate, 71%, followed by proteus mirabilis, 9%, and klebsiella pneumoniae, 7%. all urinary tract infections isolates were fully sensitive to ofloxacin and >96% (except for citrobacter species, 63%) were sensitive to cefuroxime. apart from enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus saprophyticus, the overall sensitivity to ampicillin by all isolates was <33%. the prevalence of multi-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa in community-acquired urinary tract infections is increasing. all pseudomonas aeruginosa were fully sensitive to gentamicin and ofloxacin. conclusion: the high frequency of single and multiple antibiotic resistances in this rural community should cause alarm. the ease of procuring antibiotics in these areas without a prescription can result in uncontrolled self-medication. also, the absence of antibiotic prescribing policies and inadequate information on patterns of bacterial resistance, may all contribute to the emergence of resistant strains.

AB  == this study compares the antibacterial activities of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recently isolated urinary tract pathogens, by evaluating their mics and mbcs in accordance with nccls susceptibility tests, time-kill curves and interference with bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells. a total of 200 clinical isolates was tested, including the species escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. all e. coli isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin and only one was resistant to ciprofloxacin, and there were no differences between beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains. k. pneumoniae strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were also resistant to levofloxacin. methicillin-resistant s. aureus seemed to be less susceptible than methicillin-susceptible strains to these quinolones. s. epidermidis strains were  susceptible to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with the exception of two isolates. incubation of s. aureus and e. coli with subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations reduced their capacity to adhere to uroepithelial cells; this was  statistically significant at 0.25 x mic with respect to controls (p < 0.05). inhibition of adhesion ranged from 36 to 43% when bacteria were incubated in the  presence of 0.25 x mic of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and from 10 to 27% at 0.125 x mic. these findings suggest that levofloxacin is an effective alternative to ciprofloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections and that sub-inhibitory concentrations may contribute to efficacy.

TI  == an intelligent rapid odour recognition model in discrimination of helicobacter pylori and other gastroesophageal isolates in vitro.
AB  == two series of experiments are reported which result in the discrimination between helicobacter pylori and other bacterial gastroesophageal isolates using a newly developed odour generating system, an electronic nose and a hybrid intelligent odour recognition system. in the first series of experiments, after 5 h of growth (37 degrees c), 53 volatile 'sniffs' were collected over the headspace of complex broth cultures of the following clinical isolates: staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella sp., h. pylori, enterococcus faecalis (10(7) ml(-1)), mixed infection  (proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and e. faecalis 3 x 10(6) ml each) and sterile cultures. fifty-six normalised variables were extracted from 14 conductive polymer sensor responses and analysed by a 3-layer back propagation neural network (nn). the nn prediction rate achieved was 98% and the test data (37.7% of all data) was recognised correctly. successful clustering of bacterial  classes was also achieved by discriminant analysis (da) of a normalised subset of sensor data. cross-validation identified correctly seven 'unknown' samples. in the second series of experiments after 150 min of microaerobic growth at 37 degrees c, 24 volatile samples were collected over the headspace of h. pylori cultures in enriched (hpp) and normal (hp) media and 11 samples over sterile (n)  cultures. forty-eight sensor parameters were extracted from 12 sensor responses and analysed by a 3-layer nn previously optimised by a genetic algorithm (ga). ga-nn analysis achieved a 94% prediction rate of 'unknown' data. additionally the 'genetically' selected 16 input neurones were used to perform da-cross validation that showed a clear clustering of three groups and reclassified correctly nine 'sniffs'. it is concluded that the most important factors that govern the performance of an intelligent bacterial odour detection system are: (a) an odour  generation mechanism, (b) a rapid odour delivery system similar to the mammalian  olfactory system, (c) a gas sensor array of high reproducibility and (d) a hybrid intelligent model (expert system) which will enable the parallel use of ga-nns and multivariate techniques.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to see whether it is possible to prevent bacterial  adherence to bioabsorbable self-reinforced l-lactic acid polymer (sr-plla) urological stents. the sr-plla stents were coated with silver nitrate blended epsilon-caprolactone/l-lactide copolymer. the adherence of five bacterial strains (pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis and two strains of escherichia coli) to coated and non-coated sr-plla wires were tested. it was found that silver nitrate coating prevented the adherence of bacteria (except e.  faecalis) to sr-plla stents. the preventive effect correlated with the silver nitrate concentration. it was also found that silver nitrate coating reduced the  amount of bacteria in ambient urine. in conclusion, silver nitrate coating may reduce stent-associated bacterial infections by preventing the adherence of bacteria. further studies are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety in clinical practice.

TI  == bacterial adherence to ofloxacin-blended polylactone-coated self-reinforced l-lactic acid polymer urological stents.
AB  == objective: to determine whether ofloxacin coating has any effect on bacterial adherence to bioresorbable self-reinforced l-lactic acid polymer (sr-plla) urological stents. materials and methods: sr-plla stents were coated with epsilon-caprolactone/l-lactide copolymer blended with ofloxacin at three different concentrations of ofloxacin (0.5, 2 and 5% w/w). the adherence of five  bacterial strains (pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis and two strains of escherichia coli) to the coated sr-plla stents was analysed. uncoated stent pieces were used as controls. the effect of ofloxacin coating on bacterial growth in the microenvironment of the stent pieces was also  analysed. results: ofloxacin coating prevented bacterial adherence to sr-plla stent material; this effect correlated significantly with the ofloxacin concentration of the caprolactone coating. ofloxacin coating reduced the amount of bacteria in the microenvironment of the stent, but because of natural resistance, ofloxacin coating had little effect on e. faecalis. conclusion: except for e. faecalis, ofloxacin coating may reduce stent-associated infections. however, further studies are needed to confirm its biocompatibility and efficacy  in clinical use.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1998). i. susceptibility distribution].
AB  == the frequencies of bacterial isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 538 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 9 hospitals during the period of june 1998 to  may 1999. of the above bacterial isolates, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.3% and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.7%. susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; against enterococcus faecalis isolated from patients with utis, vancomycin (vcm), ampicillin (abpc) and imipenem (ipm) had strong activities. among e. faecalis strains, those with low susceptibilities to all drugs have increased in 1998, compared with those in  1997. vcm showed the highest activity against mrsa isolated from patients with utis. the mics of vcm for all 34 strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. arbekacin (abk) was also active against mrsa with the mic90s of 2  micrograms/ml. against escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, all drugs except penicillins were active. particularly, meropenem (mepm) showed the highest activity with the mics of 0.125 micrograms/ml or below. almost all the drugs except minocycline (mino) showed high activities against proteus mirabilis. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, all drugs were not so active, with the mic90s of  16 micrograms/ml or above. mepm, ipm and gentamicin (gm) showed high activities against serratia marcescens. generally, it seemed that resistant strains of s. marcescens had decreased since 1996.

TI  == use of pcr with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == [frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of urinary pathogens isolated in the microbiology and virology laboratory of the careggi general hospital in the period july-december 1996].
AB  == background: the aim of the study was to evaluate the isolation frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of pathogens isolated form urinocoltures. methods: 2192 bacterial strains obtained from urine cultures with bacterial count > 100,000 ufc/ml were examined in our laboratory from july through december 1996. inpatients as well as outpatients were considered. five different ward typologies were taken into account (surgery, medicine, obstetrics, spinal unit and high risk wards). isolation frequencies were evaluated for each ward, but in order to get an adequate statistical sample they were divided into in two categories, e.g. strains isolated from inpatients and from outpatients. antibiotic susceptibility  was also evaluated dividing the data into the same two categories. for strains isolated with lower frequencies that was not possible, and data from inpatients were grouped with data from outpatients. results: the results obtained show that  bacterial species most frequently isolated among inpatients are escherichia coli  (45.7%), enterococcus faecalis (16.8%), proteus mirabilis (9.1%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.9%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (6.4%). those most frequently isolated among outpatients are escherichia coli (58.1%), enterococcus faecalis (12.3%), proteus mirabilis (9.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (4.4%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (4.0%). as far as antibiotic susceptibility is concerned,  whenever a statistically significant difference in sensitivity could be observed  between strains isolated from inpatients and strains isolated from outpatients, sensitivity was always higher for outpatients strains. conclusions: isolation frequency and antibiotic susceptibility are different depending on the place of origin of the patients (inpatients/outpatients). this implies a different approach to the empiric therapy in urinary tract infections.

TI  == antibodies to urinary tract pathogens in patients with spinal cord lesions.
AB  == chronic or recurrent urinary tract infection (uti) is a significant problem or patients with spinal cord lesions (scl). utis are thought to be a major factor in the development of reduced renal function. to investigate the pathogenesis 151 patients with scl were included in this study during a 7 year period. results of  intravenous pyelography and isotope renography were recorded as well as the bladder emptying methods. one to seven blood samples were obtained from each patient and tested for plasma creatinine, and the presence of precipitating antibodies against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, klebsiella ozaenae, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. we found significant correlation between duration of scl and precipitating antibodies against urinary tract pathogens (pau) (r = 0.23, p < 0.005), between plasma creatinine and pau in patients with spina bifida (r = 0.64, p < 0.01), between pau and the number of positive urine cultures (r = 0.17; p < 0.05) and a relation between abnormal urological findings and pau. in addition, the pau was significantly higher in patients with indwelling urethral catheters (p < 0.001).  thus it seems that pau can be of prognostic value in scl patients, and pau might  be an indicator for intensified treatment of recurrent uti.

TI  == urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of a single oral dose of 400 milligrams of fleroxacin versus a single oral dose of 800 milligrams of pefloxacin in healthy volunteers.
AB  == twelve healthy volunteers participated in this randomized crossover study to compare the concentrations and recovery levels of fleroxacin and pefloxacin in urine and to assess their bactericidal activities against 12 strains of urinary pathogens with different susceptibilities over a wide range of mics. the volunteers received a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin or 800 mg of pefloxacin. the mean cumulative renal excretion of unchanged fleroxacin, n-demethyl-fleroxacin, and n-oxide-fleroxacin accounted for 67, 7, and 6% of the  total dose, respectively. the total urinary recovery of pefloxacin and the active metabolite norfloxacin was 34%. in the time-kill and the urinary bactericidal titer (ubt) studies, only the subjects' urine not supplemented with broth was used. with most tested organisms and both quinolones it took more than 8 h to achieve a reduction in cfu of 99.9% (3 log units). overall, there was a good correlation between ubts and mics for the strains. against escherichia coli atcc  25922 the median ubts were similar for both antibiotics and at least 1:8 for 96 h; against the e. coli strain for which the mic was 0.5 microgram/ml the ubt was  at least 1:4 for 48 h. the ubts of both drugs against klebsiella pneumoniae were  at least 1:16 for 72 h. the ubts for staphylococcus aureus (the mic for which was 16 micrograms/ml) of both antibiotics were low, and in some of the samples, no bactericidal titers were observed. ubts for proteus mirabilis of pefloxacin are significantly higher than those of fleroxacin. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the median ubts were present for the 24-to-48-h interval. the same is true for enterococcus faecalis. against staphylococcus saprophyticus, ubts were present for at least 48 h with both quinolones. overall, a single oral dose of 400 mg of  fleroxacin exhibits ubts comparable to those of 800 mg of pefloxacin. therefore,  it may be expected that half of the dose of fleroxacin gives comparable results in the treatment of urinary tract infections; this should be substantiated in comparative clinical trials.

TI  == urinary bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of enoxacin versus norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in healthy volunteers after a single oral dose.
AB  == in an open, randomised monocentric crossover study in six male and six female healthy volunteers, the urinary antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetics of enoxacin, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were assessed. urine was collected up to  6 days, and venous blood samples up to 12 h, after a single oral dose of 400 mg enoxacin, 400 mg norfloxacin and 500 mg ciprofloxacin. enoxacin (250 mg/l) demonstrated the highest peak concentration (median) in the urine (0-6 h), followed by ciprofloxacin (237 mg/l) and norfloxacin (157 mg/l) as determined by  the hplc assay. the total amount (mean) excreted by the kidneys as parent drugs were as follows: enoxacin 54% of dose, ciprofloxacin 33% of dose, and norfloxacin 22% of dose. the mean plasma concentrations decreased from 1 to 4 h after administration for enoxacin from 1.9 to 1.4 mg/l, for ciprofloxacin from 2.0 to 0.8 mg/l and for norfloxacin from 1.3 to 0.5 mg/l. the antibacterial activity in  urine was determined as urinary bactericidal titers (ubt), i.e. the highest 2-fold dilution of urine still bactericidal for the reference organism (e. coli atcc 25,922) and for five uropathogens with minimal inhibitory (mic) and bactericidal (mbc) concentrations ranging from highly susceptible to resistant cultured from the urine of patients with complicated urinary tract infections (uti). for the e. coli atcc 25,922, the organism with the lowest mic, median ubts of ciprofloxacin were present for 4 days, decreasing from 1:512 to 1:2, that of enoxacin for 2 days, decreasing from 1:256 to 1:4, and that of norfloxacin for 2  days, decreasing from 1:128 to 1:2. for the five uropathogens (with increasing mics: k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, e. coli (resistant to nalidixic acid), p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis), the ubts decreased in general, according to mics, demonstrating the same relations of ubts for ciprofloxacin (highest) versus enoxacin (medium) versus norfloxacin (lowest) with one exception (p. mirabilis) for which norfloxacin showed higher ubts than enoxacin. the minimal urinary bactericidal concentrations (mubc), as derived from urinary concentrations, and ubts showed a fairly wide inter- and intraindividual range and were generally higher than the corresponding mbcs as determined in mueller hinton broth. in conclusion, according to antibacterial activity in urine determined as ubts, a single oral dose of ciprofloxacin (500 mg) generally resulted in the highest and  longest-lasting ubts followed by that of enoxacin (400 mg) and norfloxacin (400 mg). a dose of 400 mg enoxacin can be expected to be at least equivalent if not superior to that of 400 mg norfloxacin. only enoxacin and ciprofloxacin exhibited urinary bactericidal activity against all test organisms up to 12 h in all individuals. therefore, clinical comparison of enoxacin versus ciprofloxacin in the treatment of complicated uti could be worth testing.

TI  == translocated intestinal bacteria cause spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic rats: molecular epidemiologic evidence.
AB  == background/aims: intestinal bacterial translocation is common in cirrhotic rats with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and it is thought to play a major pathogenic role. there has so far been no evidence for clonality between bacteria isolated from intestine and ascites. this study aimed to use molecular epidemiology techniques to show that spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is due to  translocated intestinal bacteria. methods: samples of ascitic fluid, portal blood, mesenteric lymph nodes and ileal contents from healthy (n=10) and ascitic  cirrhotic rats with (n=12) or without (n=15) spontaneous bacterial peritonitis were cultured. in six infected rats, dna macrorestriction fragments of 30 bacterial isolates [escherichia coli (n=13), enterococcus faecalis (n=12) and proteus mirabilis (n=5)] from ascites (n=8), mesenteric lymph nodes (n=7), portal blood (n=6), and ileal flora (n=9) were compared. results: bacterial translocation was more frequent in animals with (58%) than in those without spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (20%, p=0.049) or controls (10%, p=0.026). the  same bacterial strain was simultaneously isolated in ascites and in mesenteric lymph nodes and/or ileum in 7/8 (87%) instances. the identity rate for bacteria present in both ascites and mesenteric lymph nodes was 80% (4/5). likewise, identity was demonstrated in 3/4 instances of bacteria found in both ascites and  portal blood. conclusions: these results indicate that spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic rats is mainly due to intestinal bacteria translocated to mesenteric lymph nodes. portal blood could be a less frequent route.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

AB  == a comparison of mics of trovafloxacin (cp-99,219) determined by the standard microdilution broth method versus the etest was performed for multiple strains of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. a comparison was also made of the in-vitro activity of trovafloxacin versus ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. the mic50  and mic90 were determined by both methods for each species tested. the etest resulted in mics one to two dilutions higher than the microdilution broth method. trovafloxacin was the most active agent against gram-positive organisms. ciprofloxacin was the most active agent against citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and serratia marcescens, while trovafloxacin had equal or greater activity compared with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against the other gram-negative organisms tested. overall, ofloxacin was the least active agent tested. in addition, the in-vitro activity of trovafloxacin or ciprofloxacin in combination with ampicillin/sulbactam, gentamicin or vancomycin was evaluated. the combination of trovafloxacin and gentamicin was synergic against two of 20 enterococcus faecium isolates, the combination of trovafloxacin and ampicillin/sulbactam was synergic against two of 24 enterococcus faecalis isolates, and the combination of ciprofloxacin and gentamicin was synergic against one of 25 stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates.  all other antibiotic combinations resulted in an additive or indifferent effect.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheter.
AB  == the main objective of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel indwelling bladder catheter impregnated with minocycline and rifampin. thirty antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheters were inserted transurethrally in spinal cord-injured patients and removed, in six groups of five catheters each, at 3, 7, 10, 14, 17 or 21 days. removed catheters had detectable zones of inhibition against two different clinical isolates of each of the 10 tested uropathogens (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus saprophyticus and candida albicans) for greater than 14 days after catheter insertion. the residual zones of inhibition and levels of antimicrobial agents in removed catheters were  both inversely related to the duration of catheter placement. minocycline and rifampin were undetectable in serum and urine. these results support the ongoing  efforts for examining the clinical efficacy of these experimental bladder catheters.

TI  == is the ability of urinary tract pathogens to accumulate glycine betaine a factor  in the virulence of pathogenic strains?
AB  == the regulation of intracellular concentrations of organic solutes, including glycine betaine, is an important adaptive response to osmotic stress for escherichia coli. the clinical significance of glycine betaine to uropathogens is not clear. clinical isolates of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. saprophyticus, and enterococcus faecalis accumulated glycine betaine from hyperosmotic media. the addition of glycine betaine to hyperosmotic minimal medium accelerated the growth rates of all species tested except p. mirabilis. however, when clinical strains of e. coli were transferred from urine with low osmolality to hyperosmotic urine, there was no slowing of the growth rate. there  was no difference in growth rates of e. coli isolates from acute pyelonephritis,  cystitis, and asymptomatic bacteriuria nor from fecal isolates. the ability to accumulate osmolytes, although it may be a factor in the adaptation to hypertonic environments, was not related to virulence.

AB  == translocating enteric bacteria have been visualized within intact intestinal epithelial cells in animal models of bacterial translocation. although the ability of the enterocyte to engulf bacteria has been well documented in both in  vivo and in vitro experimental models, relatively little is known about the enterocyte's ability to degrade internalized bacteria. intracellular survival of  eight strains of enteric bacteria (two strains of listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, two strains of escherichia coli, and two strains of enterococcus faecalis) was quantified over a 20 h period using two different types of terminally differentiated polarized enterocytes considered relevant in vitro models of human small intestinal epithelium, namely caco-2 and  ht-29 cells. caco-2 enterocytes were generally more permissive for bacterial uptake when compared with ht-29 enterocytes. however, bacterial survival was similar within each type of enterocyte, and most strains of enteric bacteria remained viable within enterocytes for the 20 h duration of the assay. in addition, with the exception of one strain of l. monocytogenes in caco-2 cells, intracellular enteric bacteria had no noticeable effect on host enterocyte viability for this 20 h duration. transmission electron microscopy was used to visualize both intact and degraded bacteria within individual enterocytes, suggesting that prolonged bacterial survival might have resulted from simultaneous bacterial degradation and replication. thus, although enterocytes internalize enteric bacteria, enterocytes might not kill internalized bacteria as efficiently as leukocytes. observations of bacterial intracellular survival supported the hypothesis that the enterocyte might be a portal of entry for translocating microbes, and observations of intracellular bacterial degradation might have implications for the role of the enterocyte as an antigen-presenting cell.

AB  == objective: to clarify the effect of hypoxia on bacteria-enterocyte interactions.  design: randomized. setting: research laboratory. subjects: enteric bacterial and cultured human intestinal epithelial cells, ht-29 cells. interventions: the effect of hypoxia on bacterial internalization and intracellular survival was studied, using enterocytes cultured for 21 days in either 20%, 10%, or 5% oxygen. the effect of bacterial growth conditions on bacterial internalization by enterocytes was studied, using bacterial cells in either the log phase or stationary phase of aerobic growth, and using bacterial cells in stationary phase, grown either under low oxygen conditions or under anaerobic conditions. measurements and main results: individual strains of enteric bacteria were incubated with ht-29 cells for 1 hr. numbers of internalized bacteria were subsequently quantified after enterocyte lysis. bacterial growth conditions (anaerobic vs. aerobic and log-phase vs. stationary-phase bacterial cells) had no noticeable effect on the numbers of salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia coli internalized by enterocytes. enterocytes cultivated in 20%,  10%, or 5% oxygen were >95% viable. enterocytes cultivated in 20% oxygen were confluent, but those enterocytes cultivated in hypoxia were not confluent and were fewer in number compared with enterocytes cultivated in normoxia. compared with enterocytes grown in normoxia, enterocytes cultivated in 5% and 10% oxygen internalized greater numbers of each of seven strains of enteric bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes (two strains), enterococcus faecalis (two strains), and p. mirabilis, e. coli (two strains), with statistically significant increases noted for five of these seven bacterial strains. intracellular survival of l. monocytogenes and p. mirabilis was assayed. both species survived intracellularly for 22 hrs, with no noticeable differences in the numbers of intracellular bacteria recovered from enterocytes cultivated in 20%, 10%, and 5%  oxygen. conclusion: these in vitro results suggest that augmented bacterial endocytosis by enterocytes might at least partially explain the increased frequency of bacterial translocation associated with tissue ischemia.

TI  == bacteroides fragilis enterotoxin modulates epithelial permeability and bacterial  internalization by ht-29 enterocytes.
AB  == background & aims: enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis has been associated with  diarrheal disease, and the enterotoxin has a cytopathic effect on cultured ht-29  enterocytes. experiments were designed to determine the effect of b. fragilis enterotoxin on bacteria-enterocyte interactions. methods: confluent ht-29 enterocytes were incubated for 1 hour with b. fragilis enterotoxin, followed by 1 hour of incubation with pure cultures of enteric bacteria, namely, salmonella typhimurium (two strains), listeria monocytogenes (three strains), proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli (three strains), and enterococcus faecalis. enterocyte viability was assessed using vital dyes, epithelial permeability was measured using transepithelial electrical resistance, enterocyte morphology and bacteria-enterocyte interactions were visualized using light and electron microscopy, and bacterial internalization was assessed using a quantitative culture of lysed enterocytes. results: b. fragilis enterotoxin did not affect enterocyte viability but decreased transepithelial electrical resistance, and individual enterocytes pulled apart. enterotoxin pretreatment decreased internalization of l. monocytogenes (p < 0.01) but increased (p < 0.01) internalization of the other strains of enteric bacteria. augmented bacterial internalization was associated with preferential bacterial adherence on the exposed lateral surface of enterotoxin-treated enterocytes. conclusions: b. fragilis enterotoxin was associated with ht-29 cell rounding and with augmented internalization of selected strains of enteric bacteria that were preferentially  adherent on the exposed enterocyte lateral surface.

TI  == exposure of the lateral enterocyte membrane by dissociation of calcium-dependent  junctional complex augments endocytosis of enteric bacteria.
AB  == intestinal bacterial translocation is facilitated in a variety of clinical conditions involving increased intestinal permeability, such as shock and trauma. because there is both in vivo and in vitro evidence that enteric bacteria can be  internalized by intestinal epithelial cells, experiments were designed to test the effect of increased intestinal permeability on enterocyte endocytosis of enteric bacteria. mature, confluent cultures of ht-29 enterocytes were placed in  a calcium-free solution for 1 h. enterocyte viability was not noticeably altered, but transepithelial electrical resistance was significantly decreased (indicating a decrease in epithelial junctional integrity), and the enterocytes were pulled apart. electron microscopic observations revealed enteric bacteria preferentially adherent on the exposed enterocyte lateral surface, and the numbers of viable enteric bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecalis) internalized by these enterocytes were significantly increased. restoration of calcium restored confluency to enterocyte cultures, and bacterial internalization reverted to control levels. thus, calcium-dependent junctional integrity might play a role in augmenting bacterial translocation in clinical conditions associated with increased intestinal permeability.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1989). i. susceptibility distribution].
AB  == the frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 1,032 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of june 1989 to may 1990. of the above total bacterial isolates, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.8% and a  majority of them were enterococcus faecalis. gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.2% and most of them were escherichia coli. 1. enterococcus faecalis imipenem (ipm) showed the highest activity against e. faecalis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. the followings, ampicillin (abpc) and vancomycin (vcm)  showed potent activities, with the mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml. piperacillin (pipc), minocycline (mino) and chloramphenicol (cp) were also active with the mic90s of 8 micrograms/ml. the others were not so active with the mic90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 2. staphylococcus aureus vcm showed the highest activity  against s. aureus with mic90 of 1 microgram/ml. dicloxacillin (mdipc) and arbekacin (abk) were active with the mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml. mino showed the mic90 of 4 micrograms/ml. all other agents except ciprofloxacin (cpfx) showed lower activity. 3. staphylococcus epidermidis mino showed the highest activity against s. epidermidis. its mic90 was 0.25 microgram/ml. the followings, abk and  vcm were also active with the mic90s of 0.5 microgram/ml, 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the others except cpfx were not so active. 4. coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) most of the agents were active against cns. ipm, abk and mino showed the highest activities with the mic90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. mdipc, cefazolin (cez), cefotiam (ctm) and vcm were also active with the mic90s of 1 microgram/ml. clindamycin (cldm) showed lower activity, with the mic90 of 128 micrograms/ml. 5. streptococcus agalactiae cez, cefuzonam (czon), ipm and cldm showed the potent activity, all strains were inhibited at the mic of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. the followings, cefmenoxime (cmx) and erythromycin (em) were active with the mic90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. pipc and vcm were also active with the mic90s 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively  amikacin (amk) showed lower activity. escherichia coli ipm, ctm, flomoxef (fmox), cmx, carumonam (crmn), norfloxacin (nflx), ofloxacin (oflx) and cpfx showed the highest activities against e. coli. the mic90s of them were .125 microgram/ml or  below. ceftazidime (caz) and czon were also active with the mic90s of 0.25 microgram/ml. penicillins except mecillinam (mpc) were not so active showing the  mic90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 7. klebsiella pneuminiae fmox, cmx, cefixime (cfix), ipm, crmn and nflx showed the highest activities against k. pneumoniae.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == experimental investigations on the immunomodulating activity of polybacterial preparation for peroral immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis of uroinfections.
AB  == the immunomodulating effect of a polybacterial immunostimulator urostim in experimental animal models was investigated. the preparation was created for immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis of uroinfections. it consists of killed bacterial cells and their lysates of four microbial species: escherichia coli expressing type 1 pili, rc mutant of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and enterococcus faecalis, balb/c mice and guinea-pigs were treated orally with urostim for 5 or 10 days, respectively. a stimulatory effect of urostim on phagocytosis (increased phagocytic index and phagocytic number) of mice peritoneal exudate cells was observed. an increased number of plaque-forming cells and elevated titres of haemagglutinating antibodies in mice demonstrated activation of humoral immunity. lymphoproliferative studies showed a significant  response to phytohaemagglutinin (pha) and urostim, especially after the second application of the preparation. at the same time no changes in the absolute number of peripheral blood lymphocytes were found. an active protection of mice against a systemic infection and of guinea-pigs against uroinfection caused by gram-negative bacteria was obtained. in conclusion, the results obtained characterize urostim as an effective immunostimulator. its peroral application leads to the activation of innate resistance, cell-mediated, humoral and local immunity.

TI  == toc-39, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin with excellent activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == toc-39, a new parenteral cephalosporin, is a hydroxyimino-type cephem antibiotic  with vinylthio-pyridyl moiety at the 3 position. toc-39 was evaluated for antibacterial activity against various clinically isolated strains. toc-39 had excellent activity, stronger than that of methicillin, oxacillin, the cephalosporins tested, imipenem, gentamicin, minocycline, tobramycin, ofloxacin,  and ciprofloxacin against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and  had an mic comparable to that of vancomycin (the mics of toc-39 and vancomycin for 90% of the strains tested were 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively). against enterococcus faecalis strains, which are resistant to cephalosporins, toc-39 was twice as active as ampicillin. against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp., and streptococcus pneumoniae, toc-39 was twice as active as or more active than cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome. against streptococcus pyogenes, toc-39 was superior to cefotiam, ceftazidime, and flomoxef and was similar to cefpirome. in addition, the activity of toc-39 was equal to or greater than that of cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome against haemophilus influenzae, escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and morganella morganii. in terms of bactericidal effect against mrsa, toc-39 was superior to vancomycin. no mutant resistant to toc-39 or vancomycin was obtained from susceptible mrsa strains. in  murine systemic infection models, toc-39 showed potent activity against s. aureus and e. coli. against highly mrsa, the activity of toc-39 was comparable to that of vancomycin.

AB  == antimicrobial activities were examined for sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc) against clinically isolated microbial strains in 1987, 1990, 1994. besides, the beta-lactamase productivity and mics of these strains were measured, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. the ratio of beta-lactamase producing strains were 90% of methicillin (dmppc)-susceptible staphylococcus aureus subsp.  aureus (mssa), about 80% of dmppc-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), 100% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis, 95% of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis and 15-20% of haemophilus influenzae.  several kinds of beta-lactamase productivity were observed. 2. antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc against beta-lactamase producing strains of mssa, m. (b.)  catarrhalis, h. influenzae, and almost all of enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (abpc) and piperacillin (pipc), but antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were weak against mrsa and cephems (ceps)-resistant strains detected in some of enterobacteriaceae. 3. it appeared that benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp) or pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) and ceps-resistant escherichia coli increased  year by year. 4. antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were strong against streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, m. (b.) catarrhalis and h. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of sbt was observed against beta-lactamase produced by s. aureus and k. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. thus, sbt/abpc is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness,  especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.

TI  == development of wound infection or separation after cesarean delivery. prospective evaluation of 2,431 cases.
AB  == wound infections are a common surgical complication, often requiring a prolonged  hospital stay and leading to increased costs. over a one-year period, 2,431 patients were followed after cesarean delivery with prompt evaluation and culture of all suspicious wounds. seventy subjects (2.8%) developed confirmed wound infection, and 42 (1.7%) developed noninfected open surgical wounds. seven (0.3%) fascial dehiscences were diagnosed, requiring surgical repair. forty of 63 (64%)  infected wounds had positive bacterial cultures, with staphylococcus epidermidis  (29%), enterococcus faecalis (17%), staphylococcus aureus (17%), escherichia coli (11%) and proteus mirabilis (10%) the most frequent isolates. only 7 of 42 (17%)  noninfected wounds had positive cultures, with only s aureus, s epidermidis and corynebacterium species isolated. ninety-five percent of the noninfected wounds had blood or serous collections present. rupture of membranes lasting longer than six hours, emergency cesarean delivery and morbid obesity were associated with a  statistically increased likelihood of the development of infected wounds. emergency cesarean delivery and morbid obesity, but not prolonged rupture of membranes, were associated with an increased likelihood of the development of noninfected wounds. therefore, it appears that at least two mechanisms are responsible for the development of postcesarean open wounds: (1) increased amniotic fluid and wound colonization due to prolonged rupture of membranes, resulting in a wound infection containing one or more bacterial species derived from the cervicovaginal flora, and (2) increased exogenous bacterial contamination and flora consistent with skin species or breaks in sterile technique, often accompanying difficult or emergency surgery.

TI  == a plasmid-encoded surface protein on enterococcus faecalis augments its internalization by cultured intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  == aggregation substance, a plasmid-encoded enterococcus faecalis surface protein, plays a role in mediating the formation of mating aggregates, resulting in plasmid transfer. the role of aggregation substance in the internalization of e.  faecalis by cultured intestinal epithelial cells, namely ht-29 cells, was analyzed. it was associated with a significant increase in endocytosis of e. faecalis by ht-29 cells: numbers of internalized enterococci were fewer than of an invasive strain of listeria monocytogenes, similar to salmonella typhimurium and another l. monocytogenes strain, and greater than relatively noninvasive strains of e. faecalis, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia coli. electron microscopy confirmed aggregation substance on the surface of strains interacting  with the enterocyte microvillous surface, and intracellular enterococci were localized within membrane-bound vacuoles in the enterocyte cytoplasm. thus, aggregation substance may facilitate e. faecalis internalization by host epithelial cells.

AB  == previous in vivo evidence has shown that bacterial phagocytosis by enterocytes may be an initial step in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelium. this study analyzed the interactions of cultured enterocytes, namely  caco-2 cells, with nine strains of enteric bacteria, tested in pure culture and in mixed culture. these nine strains had a spectrum of invasive potential and included salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes (three strains), escherichia coli (three strains), proteus mirabilis, and enterococcus faecalis. numbers of viable intracellular bacteria recovered from caco-2 cells were: l. monocytogenes > s. typhimurium > p. mirabilis > e. coli > e. faecalis. uptake of  a given microbe by enterocytes was strain-specific and was not influenced by the  presence of another strain, regardless of the invasive ability of the coinfecting strain. electron microscopic visualization of bacterial adherence and uptake by caco-2 cells indicated that the epithelial interactions of normal enteric bacteria were similar to these observed with invasive strains of salmonella and listeria.

TI  == [staghorn renal lithiasis treated with shock waves. bacteriologic aspects].
AB  == struvite renal stones are caused by infection of the urine with bacteria that synthesize the enzyme urease. ammonium is released by the breakdown of urea by urease, the urine becomes highly alkaline, and magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and carbonate apatite crystallize. incorporation of the infecting bacteria within the developing stone, results in a focus of infection that is resistant to conventional antimicrobial therapy, and which is manifested clinically by repeated urinary tract infection caused by persistent bacteriuria.  extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (eswl) currently is accepted as the election treatment for most renal calculi. this trial examines the bacteriologic  aspects pre and post-eswl. eighty adult patients, 47 females and 33 males, without clinical signs of urinary tract infections (uti) were submitted to urine  cultures pre and post-eswl. the first 50 patients underwent during and post-eswl, 150 blood cultures, which all proved to be negative, confirming very low risk of  generalized sepsis. no patient presented fever, chills or rigors pre or postprocedures. with respect to urine cultures 43 patients (52.5%) had a pre-eswl uti, in comparison to 49 (60%) who had a uti post-eswl. the distribution of organisms pre and post-eswl was as follows: proteus mirabilis (22/22), escherichia coli (11/11), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4/5), klebsiella pneumoniae (2/2), enterobacter cloacae (0/1), alcaligenes odorans (1/2) enterococcus faecalis (1/3), staphylococcus saprophyticus (1/2) and candida albicans (1/1). in this study 6 patients presented bacteriuria post-eswl probably due to bacteria from inside the calculi. according to these results, the risk of bacteremia seems to be very low. in 60% of staghorn renal stones we could demonstrate a bacterial  infection.

TI  == blockage of urethral catheters by bacterial biofilms.
AB  == we report the case of a 63-year-old woman whose indwelling urethral catheter became blocked regularly at 4-5 day intervals over a period of 10 weeks. 'worm-like' structures 25-30 cm in length were found either in the catheter, completely occluding the lumen, or in the drainage tube thereby blocking the valve of the drainage bag. electron microscopy showed that these structures were  composed of bacteria, while culture revealed them to be mixed communities of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis and proteus mirabilis. following treatment with ciprofloxacin, catheter drainage continued freely for a further period of 10 weeks.

TI  == bacterial adherence to hydrophilic polymer-coated polyurethane stents.
AB  == biliary stent blockage by adherence of bacteria and formation of biofilm is a major problem in endoscopic stenting procedures. we have investigated bacterial adherence to hydrophilic polymer (hydromer)-coated polyurethane stents in stationary and perfusion experiments. adherence of gram negative and gram positive organisms under stationary conditions was similar between hydromer-coated and non-coated control polyurethane stents; however, a marked 1 to 3 log reduction in adherence to hydromer-coated stents occurred when perfusion experiments in phosphate buffer solution or bile were performed. the results suggest that hydromer-coated polyurethane stents could be useful in preventing complications caused by biliary stent blockage.

TI  == effect of lps on epithelial integrity and bacterial uptake in the polarized human enterocyte-like cell line caco-2.
AB  == bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps) has been speculated to facilitate bacterial translocation by a mechanism involving physical disruption of the gut mucosal barrier. polarized, cultured intestinal epithelial cells (caco-2 cells) were used to study the effect of lps on enterocyte structure, viability, and susceptibility to bacterial invasion. varying concentrations of biologically active lps were incubated with enterocytes for 1 and 16 hr. lps had no noticeable effect on enterocyte viability or morphology, as measured by uptake of vital dyes, by distribution of cytoskeletal filamentous actin, and by visualization of subcellular ultrastructure. transepithelial electrical resistance was similar in  enterocyte cultures incubated with lps for 1 hr, but there was a noticeable decrease after 16 hr, indicating a loss of epithelial integrity after prolonged exposure to lps. the effect of lps on bacterial uptake was studied using six strains of enteric bacteria with varying abilities to invade caco-2 cells: listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli (2 strains), and enterococcus faecalis. electron microscopy showed enteric bacteria in intimate association with enterocyte apical microvilli, and internalized bacteria were consistently observed within cytoplasmic, membrane-bound vacuoles. following a 1-hr incubation of individual strains of enteric bacteria with caco-2 cells, numbers of viable intracellular bacteria varied significantly between individual bacterial strains, but numbers of intracellular bacteria were similar for each strain incubated with enterocytes exposed to 0, 10, and 100 micrograms lps for 1 and 16 hr. thus, although prolonged exposure to lps might have some effect on enterocyte culture integrity  (as measured by decreased electrical resistance), lps had no discernible effect on enterocyte structure, viability, and susceptibility to bacterial invasion. these results suggested that lps-induced bacterial translocation might not involve loss of epithelial viability, or facilitated entry of bacteria into intestinal epithelial cells.

TI  == multicentre survey of the comparative in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against bacteria from hospitalized patients in the british isles.
AB  == twenty-nine british and irish hospitals each collected up to 300 bacterial isolates from in-patients. the organisms were identified by an appropriate api system or, for staphylococci, by their gram and coagulase reactions. disc susceptibility tests were performed. isolates that gave zones < or = 25 mm to piperacillin/tazobactam (75 micrograms + 10 micrograms) discs were sent to a central laboratory for re-examination and determination of mic, together with a sample of the more susceptible organisms. results were evaluated for 6724 isolates. over 95% of the isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiellae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus, moraxella and bacteriodes, spp. streptococci, pneumococci and enterococcus faecalis were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (defined as giving a zone > or = 22 mm to a 75 micrograms + 10 micrograms disc), as were 86% of acinetobacter spp. and 82% of the citrobacter, enterobacter, morganella and serratia group. tazobactam particularly extended the activity of piperacillin against e. coli isolates (96% susceptible cf. 61% to piperacillin alone) klebsiellae (95% cf. 70%), p. mirabilis (99% cf. 86%), and acinetobacter spp. (86% cf. 53%). occasional (18%) resistance in enterobacter, serratia and citrobacger spp. was probably caused by stable depression of class i beta-lactamases, which are inhibited poorly by tazobactam.  high resistance frequencies (> 25%) were found for enterococcus faecium and xanthomonas maltophilia. tazobactam potentiated piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, but the mode inhibition zone of piperacillin/tazobactam discs was only 26 mm, compared to 38 mm for beta-lactamase-negative isolates. nevertheless, fewer than 5% of the enzyme producers appeared resistant to 8 + 4 mg/l piperacillin/tazobactam in mic  tests. similar behaviour was noted for coagulase-negative staphylococci. amongst  the eleven comparator drugs, ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were as active as piperacillin/tazobactam against most enterobacteria. however, acinetobacter and bacteroides spp. and enterococci were resistant to ceftazidime, and bacteroides spp., enterococci, pneumococci and other streptococci were inherently resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. cefuroxime, ampicillin and  co-amoxiclav had narrower spectra. only imipenem showed a consistently wider spectrum and lower frequency of resistance than piperacillin/tazobactam.

TI  == [a nationwide survey of antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics in japan (1988-1990)].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  antibacterial agents at 149 hospitals throughout japan from september to december in both 1989 and 1990. in this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testings were performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci showed high or moderate resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics, but streptococcus pyogenes  and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly susceptible to them. enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to imipenem (ipm) and piperacillin but resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. haemophilus influenzae, escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs and aminoglycosides. enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa had a good susceptibility to ipm and aminoglycosides. bacteroides fragilis was highly susceptible to ipm. ipm had strong antibacterial activity to many species of clinical isolates, including strains which were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.

TI  == oral infectivity and bacterial interactions with mononuclear phagocytes.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to clarify the association between the oral infectivity of a bacterial strain and its susceptibility to ingestion by mononuclear phagocytes or ability to survive within them. ten bacterial strains tested--all of known oral infectivity--comprised salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes (three strains), escherichia coli (two strains), proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, and a bacteroides sp. the phagocytic uptake of each strain was measured as the bacteria to phagocyte ratio after mononuclear phagocytes in mouse peritoneal exudate were permitted to ingest bacteria in vivo for 3 min. the three listeria strains were the most susceptible  to phagocytic uptake and the salmonella strain was relatively resistant. the intracellular survival of each strain was studied during a subsequent 2 h in-vitro incubation of the mononuclear phagocytes that had been permitted to ingest bacteria in vivo. the strains with the best intracellular survival were ent. faecalis and two of the three listeria strains. the ability of s. typhimurium to survive intracellularly was intermediate but better than that of the two e. coli strains. oral infectivity was not consistently correlated with susceptibility to ingestion by mononuclear phagocytes or ability to survive within them.

TI  == quantitative and qualitative analysis of bacteria in er(iii) solution by thin-film magnetopheresis.
AB  == magnetic deposition, quantitation, and identification of bacteria reacting with the paramagnetic trivalent lanthanide ion, er, was evaluated. the magnetic deposition method was dubbed thin-film magnetopheresis. the optimization of the magnetic deposition protocol was accomplished with escherichia coli as a model organism in 150 mm nacl and 5 mm ercl(3) solution. three gram-positive bacteria,  staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, and enterococcus faecalis, and four gram-negative bacteria, e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and klebsiella pneumoniae, were subsequently investigated. quantitative analysis consisted of the microscopic cell count and a scattered-light scanning of the magnetically deposited material aided by the computer data acquisition system. qualitative analysis consisted of gram stain differentiation and fluorescein isothiocyanate staining in combination with selected antisera against specific types of bacteria on the solid substrate. the  magnetic deposition protocol allowed quantitative detection of e. coli down to the concentration of 10 cfu ml, significant in clinical diagnosis applications such as urinary tract infections. er did not interfere with the typical appearance of the gram-stained bacteria nor with the antigen recognition by the antibody in the immunohistological evaluations. indirect antiserum-fluorescein isothiocyanate labelling correctly revealed the presence of e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa in the magnetically deposited material obtained from the mixture of these two bacterial species. on average, the reaction of gram-positive organisms  was significantly stronger to the magnetic field in the presence of er than the reaction of gram-negative organisms. the thin-film magnetophoresis offers promise as a rapid method for quantitative and qualitative analysis of bacteria in solutions such as urine or environmental water.

TI  == prevention of radiation-induced bacteraemia by post-treatment with ok-432 and aztreonam.
AB  == the effects of combined treatment with ok-432, an immunomodulator prepared from streptococcus haemolyticus, and aztreonam, a monobactum antibiotic, in the prevention of radiation-induced bacteraemia and mortality were examined in icr-mch mice irradiated with 9.5 gy. the organisms recovered from the irradiated  mice were streptococcus faecalis and proteus mirabilis. treatment with aztreonam  reduced the incidence of mice infected with proteus mirabilis (p < 0.01), but it  showed no efficacy on streptococcus faecalis. ok-432 could reduce the frequency of bacteraemia attributed to both organisms (p < 0.05). combined treatment with ok-432 and aztreonam further decreased the incidence of bacteraemia by both organisms; no organisms were recovered at 14 days following irradiation. the survival rate at 30 days following irradiation was 80% in mice treated with ok-432 plus aztreonam and 55% with ok-432 alone, while it was 0% in the groups treated with aztreonam or saline alone. these results indicated that combined treatment with ok-432 and a suitable antibiotic such as aztreonam is more effective than ok-432 or aztreonam alone.

TI  == microbial adhesion and biofilm formation on ureteral stents in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == thirty ureteral stents, inserted for 5 to 128 days following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, were examined for the presence of bacterial biofilms. of these, 90% had adherent pathogens (44% mixed organisms) on the stents, 45% of which were present in low numbers (10(1)-10(2) per 1 cm3 section) and 55% were in small and  large microcolony biofilms (> 2 x 10(2)-10(7)). the organisms were recovered from the stents even though urine culture was only positive in 27% of patients. of the organisms isolated, 77% were gram positive cocci, 15% gram negative rods and 8% candida. no blockage of the stents occurred. all of the patients had received antimicrobial therapy post-insertion, and in 15 cases biofilms were found while on treatment. none of the patients received therapy for urinary tract infections  while the stent remained in place. in vitro experiments demonstrated the ability  of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis uropathogens to adhere and form biofilms on ureteral stents within 24 hours. clearly, bacterial biofilms do occur on ureteral stents and urinary culture may not detect their presence. the high recovery rate of gram positive organisms may indicate a preferential adhesion to the biomaterial surface. the findings also indicate that unlike biofilm formation on many other prosthetic implants, colonization with gram positive organisms on ureteral stents does not necessarily coincide with the development symptomatic infection.

AB  == an electrical device designed to prevent microbial attachment to plastic intravascular cannulae is described. the device produced an electrical current (10 microa) in both carbon-impregnated and 'hydrocath' cannulae. in-vitro models  were utilized to demonstrate that the current can block several mechanisms by which microorganisms gain initial access to intravascular devices, including extra- and intra-luminal routes. the electrical system prevented organisms from traversing along both the external and internal surfaces of the cannulae. effective prevention of cannula colonization was demonstrated subsequent to challenge with staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. the findings suggest that the electrical device may offer in-vivo cannula protection  from microbial attachment and colonization, thereby reducing the potential for infection.

TI  == detection by elisa of low numbers of shiga-like toxin-producing escherichia coli  in mixed cultures after growth in the presence of mitomycin c.
AB  == techniques currently available to detect shiga-like toxin (slt)-producing escherichia coli lack sensitivity or require specialised equipment and facilities, and in some cases detect only strains belonging to serotype o157. we  have used an elisa technique, capable of detecting both slti and sltii with crude p1 glycoprotein from hydatid cysts, in combination with enhancement of toxin production by culture with mitomycin c. supernates of tryptone soya broth cultures containing mitomycin c 200 ng/ml were tested for sltii. for slti, cell lysates pre-treated with polymyxin b were tested. in tests with e. coli o157:h7 in mixed culture with e. coli strain c600 alone, or with e. coli c600, proteus mirabilis and enterococcus faecalis, slti could be detected when the proportion of toxigenic organisms represented 1% of the mixture, and sltii when the proportion was 0.025%. when faecal samples with added e. coli o157:h7 were examined in this system, sltii-producing strains were detected when they comprised less than 0.1% of the coliform population. this technique is a sensitive and specific assay for detecting low numbers of slt-producing organisms in mixed culture such as occurs in cases of haemolytic uraemic syndrome and haemorrhagic colitis.

AB  == a trivalent lanthanide ion, erbium (er3+), has been used in combination with a magnetic separation technique to isolate seven bacterial species from suspensions in 0.9% saline. erbium has an exceptionally high atomic magnetic moment of 9.3 bohr magnetons, and following addition as ercl3 (final concentration 5 mm) to bacterial suspensions, it imparts the magnetic moment to the bacterial cells by ionic binding to the cell surface. strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus and enterococcus faecalis were obtained from the quality control depository of the cleveland clinic foundation, cleveland, ohio, usa as suspensions in 0.9% nacl, in concentrations ranging from  10(2) to 10(8) c.f.u. ml-1. bacteria were separated from solution inside a capillary flow cell exposed to a highly non-homogeneous magnetic field (maximum field intensity was 0.4 t) and quantified by a light scattering method. the quantity of cellular deposition in the magnetic field was correlated with the initial concentration of cells in the suspension, expressed in c.f.u. ml-1, and sample volume (1.5 and 3.0 ml), sample ph (prior to ercl3 addition), affinity to  gram stain (negative vs positive) and species.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == in order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (oflx) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. the following conclusions were reached. 1. comparison of the mic distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of oflx-resistant isolates with the passage of time of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella ssp., enterobacter spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. most common elevations of mic  values against these bacteria were observed in mic80 and mic90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in mic50 values. however, mic50's of oflx against serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. most of the oflx-resistant strains of s.  aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (mrsa). furthermore, mic80 of oflx against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. susceptibility of streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. the results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of oflx-resistant strains even in 1990 were proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, campylobacter spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. 4. recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of oflx-resistant strains among many bacteria. however, the bacteria which contained high percentages of oflx-resistant strains except for mrsa were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of mic values were only observed in mic80 and mic90. these results suggested that oflx preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.

AB  == to study the relative contributions of host and microbial factors in bacterial translocation, germfree mice were mono-associated with either proteus mirabilis,  escherichia coli, or enterococcus faecalis. germfree mice included t-cell-deficient nude mice and normal littermates, natural killer cell-deficient  beige mice and normal littermates, and triply immunodeficient mice with beige, t-cell, and b-cell mutations and their littermates. each bacterial species colonized the cecum in similarly high numbers. bacteria were recovered from the mesenteric lymph node of every mouse in inconsistent numbers, eg, greater numbers of p mirabilis and e coli were recovered from t-cell-deficient nude mice than from their normal littermates, but the opposite was observed with e faecalis. comparing the three bacterial species resulted in relatively consistent observations, eg, the incidence of e faecalis translocation to the liver was greater than that of e coli or p mirabilis translocation. thus, the identity of the translocating microbe significantly affected the recovery of viable translocating bacteria.

TI  == comparison of norfloxacin versus nalidixic acid in therapy of acute urinary tract infections.
AB  == thirty-seven adult patients with acute urinary tract infections (uti) were randomized to receive either a seven day (lower uti) or a 14 day (upper uti) course of norfloxacin 400 mg orally twice daily, or nalidixic acid 1 g orally four times per day. mean age, underlying disease and infecting organisms were similar in the two groups. nine patients in the norfloxacin group and seven in the nalidixic acid group had presumptive evidence of upper uti. overall, 12 patients had antibody-coated bacteria-positive infections. the infecting organisms were: escherichia coli (27), coagulase-negative staphylococci (four), citrobacter freundii (three), klebsiella pneumoniae (three), and proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter agglomerans, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis (one of each). all of the organisms were susceptible to norfloxacin, while 81% were susceptible to nalidixic acid. the effects on the periurethral and anal canal flora were similar in both groups. five patients in each group experienced adverse clinical effects. the cure rates for norfloxacin and nalidixic acid were 79 and 83%, respectively.  there were two failures, two relapses and four reinfections in the norfloxacin group. in the nalidixic acid group, there were two failures, one relapse and four reinfections. one of the failure patients in the nalidixic acid group developed resistance to the drug, and two of the four reinfections were due to organisms resistant to nalidixic acid. in this patient population it was concluded that nalidixic acid may be as effective as norfloxacin in the treatment of acute, symptomatic uti.

TI  == recurrent postoperative endophthalmitis.
AB  == we treated five patients for postoperative endophthalmitis who demonstrated an initially good response to intravitreal management of their infection and then suffered a later recurrence. four of the five patients received a single intravitreal injection of antibiotics as the only intravitreal therapy, and the fifth patient received a single antibiotic injection in addition to a partial vitrectomy. all recurrent infections occurred between 10 and 21 days after the original intravitreal injection of antibiotics. at the time of the recurrence, all five patients remained culture positive with the same organism that was initially isolated. the bacterial species isolated were s. epidermidis, group d streptococcus, p. acnes, p. mirabilis, and p. aeruginosa. all patients were ultimately sterilized with repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics, vitrectomy, and/or intraocular lens removal. factors that were related to recurrent infection were marginal susceptibility of the organism to the originally injected antibiotics, infection with a slowly replicating organism, and infection with a gram-negative bacillus. a single intravitreal injection of antibiotics may only partially treat bacterial endophthalmitis. patients should be observed for at least 3 weeks following treatment of endophthalmitis for recurrence of their infection, and aggressive management, including vitrectomy and repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics, should be used to treat recurrent infections.

AB  == for the first time, co(ii), ni(ii) and zn(ii) complexes have been synthesized involving an intermediate schiff base, indane-1,3-dione-2-imine-n-acetic acid the condensed product of ninhydrin and glycine. these coloured complexes were characterised by elemental analysis, molar conductivity, thermogravimetric analyses/differential thermal analysis, infrared, magnetic susceptibility, nmr and electronic spectral studies. mechanisms for their formation have been proposed. the experimental studies reveal that the complexes possess octahedral stereochemistry whereas the schiff base behaves as a monobasic tridentate ligand. a molecular structure for the metal complexes is also proposed. a comparative study of the antimicrobial activity of ninhydrin and the corresponding metal complexes against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus and  streptococcus faecalis has been undertaken and the results are discussed.

TI  == [effects of sulbactam on the activity of cefoperazone against various clinical isolates].
AB  == sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz) have been used in clinical infusion at ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 in japan and u.s.a., respectively. after an administration of these drugs as a 1:1 parenteral formulation, the ratio of levels of cpz and sbt in blood was 1:1/4 to 1:1/5 for 1 to 2 hours, whereas the ratio of free, unbound drug levels was 1:1.4 to 1:1.5. in urine these drugs were excreted at a ratio between 1:1 and 1:4 during 6 hours after the infusion. antimicrobial interaction  studies using various combinations of cpz and sbt were performed to obtain information with respect to the effect of sbt on the antimicrobial activity of cpz in vivo and the most appropriate ratio of these drugs for the in vitro test system. antimicrobial activities were determined using the agar dilution method and the disk diffusion susceptibility test. sbt increased the activity of cpz against various clinical isolates tested except enterococcus faecalis. cpz-sbt at a fixed ratio of 1:1/5 significantly increased the antimicrobial activity of cpz, resulting in decreases in mic values and increases in disk inhibitory zone diameters. these drugs at ratios 1:1 to 1:3 maximized the synergistic enhancement of the activity. therefore, a fixed ratio between 1:1/5 and 1:1 would be appropriate for the in vitro antimicrobial test system using either the agar dilution method or the disk susceptibility test. based on pharmacokinetic data for cpz and sbt, results of the present study on antimicrobial activity would support that the parenteral formulation of cpz-sbt at the fixed ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 for the intravenous infusion used in japan and u.s.a., respectively, are appropriate. the effect of sbt on the activity of cpz was more marked against clinical isolates with greater production abilities of beta-lactamase than against those with less production abilities. sbt/cpz, however, exerted a synergistic effect against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus without beta-lactamase production. the mic80 of sbt/cpz (1:1) against various clinical isolates with 10(6) cfu/ml inoculum size were as follows: s. aureus 12.5 micrograms/ml, staphylococcus epidermis 3.13 micrograms/ml, and e. faecalis 50 micrograms/ml. those of gram-negative bacilli were: escherichia coli 0.20 microgram/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae 0.20 micrograms/ml, proteus mirabilis 0.78 microgram/ml, proteus vulgaris 0.78 microgram/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa 12.5 micrograms/ml, serratia marcescens 25 micrograms/ml, enterobacter spp. 3.13 micrograms/ml, citrobacter spp. 12.5 micrograms/ml and acinetobacter spp. 0.78 microgram/ml.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

TI  == in vivo antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == the therapeutic activities of orally administered fk482 were compared with those  of reference antibiotics against systemic and local infections with a variety of  bacteria in mice and rabbits. in systemic infections in mice, oral fk482 was almost as effective as oral cefaclor (ccl) and more effective than oral cephalexin (cex) against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis infections. however, fk482 afforded superior protective activity when given subcutaneously against e. coli infection in mice,  and this activity was more potent than that of subcutaneously given ccl. in comparison with ccl, the reason that the in vivo activity of orally given fk482 against mouse systemic infections was weaker than had been anticipated from its potent in vitro activity was due to its poor oral absorption in mice. in local infections in rabbits, a species in which fk482 was better absorbed than in mice, fk482 was more effective than ccl, cex or amoxicillin (ampc). against pneumonia induced by s. aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, fk482 was as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs of infected rabbits. in the oral treatment of experimental ascending pyelonephritis in rabbits, fk482 was superior to ccl and ampc against methicillin-resistant s. aureus infection, as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl against enterococcus faecalis infection, and as effective as cefixime (cfix) and more effective than ccl and ampc against e. coli infection in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the kidneys and urine.

AB  == the role of intestinal flora in the production of anorexigenic substance was investigated. proteus mirabilis (p. mirabilis) and escherichia coli (e. coli) were found to produce an anorexigenic substance, while enterococcus faecalis (e.  faecalis, type 1 and 2) and staphylococcus intermedius (s. intermedius) did not.  the anorexigenic substance was purified and was detected as, a single though broad band by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). the specific activity of the final form of the purified substance was 120 units/mg carbohydrate. the substance contained no protein residue and appeared to be a lipopolysaccharide. the evidence that intestinal flora produces  an anorexigenic substance leads to an interesting assumption that the intestinal  flora may be responsible for regulating food intake.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach in estimating the effective dosage of cefamandole].
AB  == reliability of the cefamandole (cmd) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 246 strains with showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of cmd). clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the cmd disc tests, which is normally used in japan, was also evaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of a proper dose  of administration. the results obtained with the disc method were compared with mics determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. the results of the cmd disc susceptibility test were well correlated with mics, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of mics. break points in mic values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are () mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. only 4 (1.6%) out the 246 strains tested showed false positive results and 11 (4.5%) showed false negative results, showing the excellent reliability of this test. in this study,  approximately 90% of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis isolated from clinical materials randomly were inhibited by cmd at concentrations less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes were sensitive to cmd at 67 and 69% of strains, respectively, at concentrations below 6.25 micrograms/ml. cmd was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens and enterococcus faecalis. about 90% of staphylococcus aureus were inhibited at dose levels smaller than 6.25 micrograms/ml and 70% of the strains at levels less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. susceptibilities to 15 micrograms/ml cmd of highly methicillin-resistant strains  (mic greater than 30 micrograms/ml) of s. aureus were examined. ten of 12 strains examined were found susceptible to cmd, but only 6 of the 12 to cefmetazole. imipenem/cilastatin was effective to 5 of the 12 strains at levels lower than 3 micrograms/ml and to one at a level less than 15 micrograms/ml. minocycline was effective against 11 strains at concentrations below 2 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == a shift from acute to chronic spontaneous pyelonephritis in male mm mice associated with a change in the causal micro-organisms.
AB  == proteus mirabilis was the predominant cause of acute diabetes-associated pyelonephritis occurring spontaneously in male mm mice until they were segregated in a new environment. thereafter pasteurella pneumotropica and streptococcus faecalis emerged collectively as the most common causal organisms, the pyelonephritis became more chronic and proteus mirabilis isolates from faeces and urine produced atypical non-swarming colonies on blood agar plates. this did not  account for the reduced pathogenicity of proteus mirabilis; when mm males were returned to the original environment the pyelonephritis again became acute but was associated with the atypical type of proteus mirabilis although the normal type was abundant in the environment. the mm mice were caesarean-derived and cross-fostered shortly before their transfer to the second environment, which probably accounts for their changed microbial status, but the reason for the emergence of the atypical type of proteus mirabilis is not understood. the acute  nature of the male mm pyelonephritis when caused by proteus mirabilis parallels the situation described in other animals and humans.

TI  == trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in cyst fluid from autosomal dominant polycystic kidneys.
AB  == cyst infection in patients with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (adpkd) is often refractory to therapy, in part because of the limited entry of commonly used antibiotics into cyst fluid. to study the efficacy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in cyst infection, cyst fluid was obtained by percutaneous aspiration or at surgery from eight patients with adpkd receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. cysts were categorized as nongradient or gradient  by cyst-fluid sodium concentration. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole concentrations  within cysts were determined and cyst fluid inhibitory and bactericidal titers were assessed in vitro against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and streptococcus fecalis. the mean cyst fluid trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole concentrations were 15.2 micrograms/ml and 42.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. preferential accumulation of trimethoprim was observed in gradient cysts, exceeding serum levels more than eightfold. sulfamethoxazole penetrated cysts to  a lesser extent, with concentrations ranging from 10 to 70 percent of the serum level. cyst fluid sampled prior to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole administration (control) demonstrated no antibacterial activity, while cyst fluid inhibitory and bactericidal titers following antibiotic administration were 1:32 or greater in most instances. these studies indicate that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is likely to be efficacious in the treatment of cyst infection in polycystic kidneys.

AB  == bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. in order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14c-taurocholate (tc) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. the results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. supernatants from haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14c-tc uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides  fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- sem) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14c-tc uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). the results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == escherichia coli adherence to anion exchange resin. in vitro model for initial screening of potential antiadherence agents.
AB  == the first step in developing a bladder infection is attachment of bacteria to the bladder epithelium. removing the bladder mucin increases bacterial adherence up to a thousand-fold, and this increase can be prevented by pretreating the mucin-deficient bladder with heparin. to develop a rapid, in vitro antiadherence  screening assay, we studied the adherence of escherichia coli to various chromatography resins and the ability of heparin and other agents to antagonize this attachment. the results can be summarized as follows: although e. coli attached to all resins, only the adherence to the anion exchange resin was inhibited by heparin (up to 95%). agents which did not effect e. coli adherence to the resin did not affect attachment to the bladder. agents which inhibited e.  coli adherence to the bladder also inhibited e. coli adherence to the resin. similar to the effect of heparin on e. coli attachment, the adherence of klebsiella ozaene, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus fecalis to both bladder epithelium and anion exchange resin were also antagonized. these studies indicate that the adherence of e. coli (as well as other bacterial species) to anion exchange resin responds to heparin and other chemical agents in a similar manner  as does adherence to the mucin-deficient rabbit urinary bladder. because of the ease and rapid nature of this in vitro assay, it serves as a useful screen for potential bacterial antiadherence agents and could be used to help elucidate mechanisms of bacterial attachment.

TI  == the efficacy of pefloxacin in comparison to gentamicin in the treatment of experimentally induced peritonitis in rats.
AB  == a reproducible experimental model of intra-abdominal infections in rats has been  devised in order to stimulate intra-abdominal sepsis in patients. pre-operatively, the rats were fed with lean ground beef for two weeks in order to change the intestinal flora to one similar to that of humans. a 1 cm segment of ileum was isolated on its vascular pedicle. the intestine was then divided at  each end of the segment and intestinal continuity was re-established by an end-to-end anastomosis. the segment of ileum was then returned to the abdominal cavity. this experimental model was used to compare the efficacy of pefloxacin alone and in combination with metronidazole with the combination gentamicin and metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections. seventy per cent of the untreated animals died within two days. within three days 40% of the animals  receiving pefloxacin died. animals treated with pefloxacin plus metronidazole or  gentamicin plus metronidazole had a significantly decreased mortality and increased cure rates during the experimental period. only 5% of these animals died. thus the combination of pefloxacin and metronidazole seems to be as successful as gentamicin plus metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == bacterial colonization of hemasite access devices.
AB  == vascular access ports (hemasites) were recovered from patients in whom they had become foci of infection and were examined according to microbiologic and morphologic techniques. all were covered on their extraluminal surfaces by well-developed biofilms consisting of host material and bacteria and their extracellular products. one hemasite from which staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis were cultured was covered by a biofilm that consisted of coccoid bacterial cells and occasional fungal cells. another hemasite from which  proteus mirabilis was cultured was covered by a polymicrobial biofilm consisting  of at least six morphologically distinct bacterial types and their extracellular  products. this direct observation of the biofilm mode of bacterial growth on these devices suggests that the colonizing organisms will not be completely recovered by routine microbiologic techniques and that bacteria in the biofilm will tend to resist both host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. removal of the device, with its accretion of bacterial biofilm, should allow the  resolution of the associated infection.

AB  == tissue obtained by biopsy of the bladder from 33 patients with various urinary tract symptoms was studied by conventional bacteriological techniques and by scanning electron microscopy (sem). all the patients had recurrent urinary tract  symptoms which had not completely responded to antibiotic therapy. eleven of the  patients had greater than or equal to 10(8) colony-forming units (cfu) of bacteria/1 urine; six had between 10(6) and 10(7) cfu/1, and 16 were abacteruric. bacteria were isolated, however, from the tissue obtained by biopsy from eight of the 16 patients with sterile urine and bacteria were seen on the uro-epithelium in 14 of these patients. by comparison, in all samples of tissue obtained from the 11 patients with greater than or equal to 10(8) cfu/1 of urine bacteria were  seen on the uro-epithelium and from nine of these, bacteria were subsequently grown. fastidious organisms were not isolated from any of the patients. the uro-epithelium of all those studied was also shown to be grossly disrupted with increased disturbance and loss of the epithelial cells when compared with tissue  obtained from uninfected patients. the degree of uro-epithelial disturbance was greatest in patients with histories of urinary tract infections lasting more than 4 months. the findings suggest that bacteriological examination of the urine does not always reflect bacterial infection on the bladder surface nor disruption of the uro-epithelium. the changes on the bladder surface may explain the patients'  symptoms. in view of the results, a scheme is proposed that explains the development of symptoms in patients with urinary tract and bladder infections.

TI  == further characterization of bacterial adherence to urinary bladder mucosa: comparison with adherence to anion exchange resin.
AB  == bacterial adherence to anion exchange resin has recently been reported to provide a useful, rapid, in vitro screening assay for identifying putative antiadherence  agents. the studies presented in this report provide additional evidence that adherence to anion exchange resin is similar to urinary bladder mucosa adherence. results are as follows. 1) heparin inhibits the adherence of escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus fecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa to both the mucin deficient bladder and anion exchange resin. 2) drugs which inhibit e. coli adherence to the bladder also inhibit e. coli adherence to  the resin and conversely, drugs which do not effect e. coli adherence to the resin do not affect attachment to the bladder. 3) extracts from mammalian urinary bladder mucosa prevent e. coli adherence to both the bladder and resin. 4) the ability of heparin to displace preattached bacteria from anion exchange resin is  inversely proportional to the time the bacteria are in contact with resin. similar results were obtained for the ability of heparin to displace bacteria from the bladder. these studies indicate that bacterial adherence to anion exchange resin responds to heparin and other chemical agents in a manner similar  to the mucin deficient rabbit urinary bladder. because of the ease and rapid nature of this in vitro assay, it serves as a useful screen for potential bacterial antiadherence agents and could be used to help elucidate mechanisms of  bacterial attachment.

TI  == detection of beta-lactamase activity with nitrocefin of multiple strains of various microbial genera.
AB  == the production or presence of beta-lactamase(s) was studied by the rapid method utilizing the chromogenic cephalosporin compound nitrocefin in cultures of multiple strains belonging to the same genus as well as groups of microorganisms. the genera were: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, rare enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae. with this sensitive and rapid assay for beta-lactamase, it was possible to verify and separate the beta-lactamase producing cultures from the non-producers and include the useful strains to on-going research, such as beta-lactam screen, beta-lactamase inhibitory study and lytic properties of beta-lactams. the data also provide evidence for the possible role of beta-lactamase(s) in the physiology, biochemistry and pathogenicity of bacterial strains. the nitrocefin method was found a very specific and extremely useful procedure for the detection and estimation of beta-lactamase activity.

TI  == scanning electron microscopy detects bacteria within infection stones.
AB  == the viability and location of bacteria within infection stones were investigated. many stones were infected with urea-splitting bacteria, such as proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. large numbers of bacterial impressions and bodies were found in the interstices surrounded by crystals of apatite and struvite from the nuclei to the peripheral layers. the presence of bacterial colonies even in the nuclear portion of the stones suggests that bacteria participate in the initial stone formation as well as in growth of infection stones. streptococcus faecalis, a nonurea -splitting bacteria, also was found in some infection stones  and probably represents a superimposed infection as a result of changes in bacterial flora owing to treatment with antibiotics.

TI  == the effects of heparin on the adherence of five species of urinary tract pathogens to urinary bladder mucosa.
AB  == previous studies performed in our laboratory have indicated that the primary antibacterial defense mechanism of the rabbit urinary bladder is the antiadsorptive action of the surface mucopolysaccharide. removal of this layer with an acid rinse increases bacterial adherence up to 100 fold. exogenous mucopolysaccharide (heparin) has been shown to restore escherichia coli adherence to control levels. to determine whether this antiadherence action of heparin is species specific, we compared the adherence of 5 common urinary tract pathogens (escherichia coli, klebsiella ozonae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  and streptococcus fecalis) to both mucin intact and mucin deficient rabbit bladders with and without prior heparin exposure. bacteria were radiolabeled by addition of 3h-adenine to the culture broth so that the number of bacteria adhering to the bladder could be determined using liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. results were as follows: acid removal of the mucin layer significantly increased the adherence approximately 10 fold for all 5 species tested. briefly exposing the mucin deficient bladders to heparin decreased the adherence of all species tested except pseudomonas to mucin intact control levels. heparin treatment of mucin intact bladders slightly decreased adherence of all species except pseudomonas below mucin intact controls, however, results were not statistically significant. the magnitude of klebsiella adherence was nearly 20 fold greater than all other species tested. while this non-species specific adherence inhibition of heparin may prove useful in the clinical setting, it appears to be less effective against pseudomonas.

TI  == a microbiological evaluation of apalcillin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of apalcillin was tested against 350 clinical isolates of escherichia coli, enterobacter, klebsiella, proteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus faecalis. using a minimal inhibitory concentration of 16 mg/l as the breakpoint, only 19.7% of the strains were resistant to apalcillin. a regression analysis demonstrated that it is possible to test bacteria for sensitivity with a 20 micrograms apalcillin disc. the results on mueller-hinton agar are very similar to those on iso-sensitest medium. like other ureido penicillins, apalcillin is sensitive to most beta-lactamases; it is effective against ampicillin-resistant strains since it penetrates the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria well and is highly effective against target proteins. strains producing high amounts of beta-lactamases do become resistant to apalcillin.

TI  == simple additives to increase the activity of chlorhexidine digluconate against urinary pathogens.
AB  == the concentration of chlorhexidine digluconate required to kill gram-negative bacteria which cause urinary tract infection associated with urethral catheterisation also damages the bladder mucosa. increased bactericidal activity  was obtained by the addition of a chelating agent (edta) and a buffer (tris) enabling a low concentration of chlorhexidine (0.01 per cent) to be effective against escherichia coli nctc 86, pseudomonas aeruginosa nctc 7650 proteus mirabilis nctc 8309 and streptococcus faecalis nctc 8213. the type of fluid in which the bacteria were suspended affected the time required to achieve 99.9 per  cent killing. the 0.01 per cent chlorhexidine solution with added edta and tris did not cause severe erosive damage to the bladder mucosa of rats. the potential  of this solution for use as a skin antiseptic prior to catheterisation and as a bladder instillation after catheterisation is discussed.

TI  == response of bacteria in wastewater sludge to moisture loss by evaporation and effect of moisture content on bacterial inactivation by ionizing radiation.
AB  == two studies were carried out to determine the influence of moisture content of the survival of bacteria in raw wastewater sludge. the first study involved the effect of water loss by evaporation on the bacterial population. the second used  these dewatered samples to measure the effects of moisture content on the inactivation of bacteria sludge by ionizing radiation. both studies involved survival measurements of six representative fecally associated bacteria grown separately in sterilized sludge as well as survival data on bacteria indigenous to sludge. growth of bacteria was stimulated in sludge during the initial phase of moisture removal by evaporation, but the reduction of moisture content below about 50% by weight caused a proportional decrease in bacterial numbers. in comparison with the original sludge, this decrease reached about one-half to one  order of magnitude in all dried samples except those containing proteus mirabilis, which decreased about four orders of magnitude. the rates of inactivation of bacteria by ionizing radiation in sludge were usually modified to some degrees by variations in moisture content. most bacteria were found to be somewhat protected from ionizing radiation at reduced moisture levels. the largest effect was found with salmonella typhimurium, whose radiation resistance  approximately doubled in dried sludge. however, no excessively large d10 values were found for any bacterial species tested.

TI  == effects of moisture content on long-term survival and regrowth of bacteria in wastewater sludge.
AB  == the effects of moisture content on the survival and regrowth of seeded and indigenous enteric bacteria in raw sludge were determined. cultures of six strains of fecally associated bacteria grown in sterilized, liquid sludge (5% solids) were all quite stable at this moisture level for over 90 days at 21 degrees c. when the moisture content of the sludge containing these organisms was reduced by evaporation and the samples were stored at 21 degrees c for extended periods, bacterial inactivation rates were generally proportional to the moisture losses of the samples. a dramatic reversal in this effect was observed in samples containing more than 90% solids. in this dried sludge, every bacterial species studied except proteus mirabilis was found to be extremely stable. bacteria indigenous to sludge were also found to survive for long periods in dried sludge. regrowth of bacterial isolates in sterilized raw sludge was found to occur readily at 37 degrees c in samples containing less than or equal to 75% solids, but no growth was observed in samples with greater than or equal to 85% solids. some growth, but to less than saturation densities, occurred with 80% solids. growth of seeded salmonella typhimurium was also found to occur in the presence of indigenous organisms in both liquid and dewatered raw sludges. however, the population density attained was well below that found in sterilized samples of the same sludges. in addition, the number of salmonellae dropped below detectable limits within a few days in sludges containing viable indigenous organisms, whereas little decrease occurred during this time with salmonellae grown in previously sterilized sludges.

TI  == bacterial effect of hydrogen peroxide on urinary tract pathogens.
AB  == bacterial contamination of urinary drainage bags is a frequent source of bladder  bacteriuria in patients with indwelling catheters. previous work demonstrated that the addition of 30 ml of 3% h2o2 prevented bacterial contamination of urinary drainage bags for up to 8 h in patients with urinary infections (greater  than 10(5) colony-forming units per ml). survival curves of a variety of organisms in filter-sterilized urine with various concentrations of h2o2 (0.6 to  0.01%) were constructed. organisms with high cellular catalase activity (staphylococcus aureus, serratia marcescens, and proteus mirabilis) required 30 to 60 min of exposure to 0.6% h2o2 for a reduction of 10(8) to less than 1 colony-forming unit per ml, whereas escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., and pseudomonas sp. required only 15 min of exposure. the efficacy of h2o2 in urine was maintained despite exposure to room temperature for 5 days and reinoculation  with bacterial suspensions. h2o2 is inexpensive and relatively nontoxic, and these data suggest that periodic instillation of h2o2 into urinary drainage bags  may eliminate a source of bladder bacteriuria and environmental contamination.

TI  == minimal antibiotic concentrations of aminoglycosides and beta-lactam antibiotics  for some gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci.
AB  == the minimal antibiotic concentration (mac) is the lowest concentration of an antibacterial agent that produces a decrease of 1 log in the number of organisms/ml as compared with a control culture in drug-free medium. various gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci were grown in the presence of amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, oxacillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and cefamandole at concentrations varying from eight  times the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) to 1/128 of the mic. colony forming units (cfu) were counted, the mic was determined, and the mic:mac ratio,  which indicates the magnitude of the effective range, was calculated. the mic:mac ratio appears to be characteristic for a given species and antibiotic. there is no relation between the mics and the mic:mac ratios. the highest ratios were given by proteus mirabilis with aminoglycosides (mic:mac mean, 29.2 with tobramycin), and the lowest ratios were given with beta-lactam antibiotics by pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus faecalis (mic:mac means, 2.1 with carbenicillin and cefamandole, respectively).

AB  == the role of peroxidase-mediated bacterial killing by rabbit alveolar macrophages  was examined. during 3 h of incubation in vitro, alveolar macrophages ingested and killed greater than 88% of the streptococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, or  streptococcus pneumoniae present in the incubation mixture. preincubation of alveolar macrophages with inhibitors of catalase, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole or sodium nitrite, did not alter their bactericidal potential. iodination of ingested zymosan particles, a peroxidase-dependent and hydrogen peroxide-dependent reaction, was not observed, in spite of vigorous phagocytosis  by alveolar macrophages. furthermore, iodination by alveolar macrophages was not  significantly increased when peroxidase-coated zymosan particles were ingested. the results suggest that hydrogen peroxide may not be available to the phagocytic vacuole for microbial killing. since tetrazolium dye reduction reflects the activity of an oxidase responsible for stimulated oxygen consumption by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, this reaction was also measured. rabbit alveolar macrophages incubated with latex particles did not exhibit an increased dye reduction compared with resting cells. the absence of significant stimulation of  tetrazolium dye reduction indicates that the oxidase reaction does not occur in the proximity of the phagocytic vacuole of alveolar macrophages.

TI  == a critical look at chemical disinfection of anaesthetic apparatus.
AB  == studies were carried out to test the efficacy of disinfection of a previously contaminated corrugated anaesthetic tube and reservoir bag. bacteriological swabs and sampling with broth were evaluated as methods of detecting contamination. gross contamination was detected by broth sampling on occasions when swabbing failed to reveal contamination. the presence of up to 18% by volume of residual air within the apparatus was detected. a method of ensuring elimination of all air is described and studies showed that disinfection was then complete.

TI  == [experimental investigations concerning spectrum, serum concentration, and excretion of spectacillin (author's transl)].
AB  == by means of the diffusion test, the range of action of the ampicillin successive  preparation spectacillin was determined using 12 000 pathological germs freshly isolated from in-patients. the result was a range of action similar to that of ampicillin. a comparison, however, is only possible in case the test platelets (without over-dosage) are each charged with exactly, e.g., 25 gamma. the analyses of serum concentrations have shown that spectacillin is satisfactorily absorbed after oral as well as after parenteral application. thus, the calculation of the  accumulated area of infinity beneath the serum concentration curve had the following results: after single intravenous injection of 1 g spectacillin (n equals 12) 51.46 gamma/ml - h; after single intravenous injection of 2 g spectacillin 86.20 gamma/ml - h; after intramuscular injection (twice) - interval of 12 hours - 29.94 gamma/ml - h after 12 hours; same values as before, but after 24 hours, 29.37 gamma/ml - h. after a single oral application of one capsule of spectacillin (capsule equals 500 mg), the value of the accumulated area was 8.46  gamma/ml - h. in analogy of the good absorption, excretion in urine/24 hrs (after application of 1 g spectacillin intravenously) was 61.74 p.c., after 2 g i.v. 54.30 p.c., and after applying twice 1 g spectacillin intramuscularly 61.40 p.c.; after oral application of 500 mg, the percentage was 28.42. tolerance of spectacillin was good after oral as well as after parenteral application. no side effects were observed.

TI  == asymptomatic bacteriuria in schoolchildren in newcastle upon tyne.
AB  == a screening survey for asymptomatic bacteriuria (asb) in 13464 schoolgirls aged 4 to 18 years in newcastle upon tyne showed an overall prevalence of 1.9%. in girls 4 to 6 years it was 1.4%, in girls aged 7 to 11 years it was 2.5%, in girls aged  12 to 18 years it was 1.6%, a statistically significant rise and fall. renal scarring was found in 39 (15%) of 254 girls with asb. neither the prevalence nor  the severity of renal scarring increased with age. there was no association between asb and social class. of the 254 girls with asb, 24% had no symptoms. infections with klebsiella were more frequently associated with renal scarring than infections with esch. coli. the prevalence of asb in 1595 boys aged 5 to 18  was low, 0.2%. ureteric reflux was present in 15% of girls without renal scarring and in 46% of those with renal scarring (p less than 0.001). renal scarring also  showed a significant association with duplication, hydroureter, or single saccules in the bladder. the greater the severity of scarring the more frequently was reflux present. this study gave no evidence that asymptomatic bacteriuria leads to progressive renal damage during childhood. it therefore does not support the recommendation for prescriptive screening of schoolchildren, but emphasizes the need for prospective studies of the natural history of asb.

TI  == antibacterial activity of human cervical mucus.
AB  == the antimicrobial property of human uterine cervical mucus was tested in three groups of women. healthy women, using no contraception, women using an intrauterine device and women receiving hormonal treatment for contraception. cervical mucus was taken on the 10th, 14th, 18th and 22nd day of the menstrual cycle. cervical mucus had a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of micrococcus lysodeicticus in all three groups. the strength of the inhibitory effect on the other microorganisms were in the following order: staphylococcus albus, staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, candida albicans, streptococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus faecalis. use of an intrauterine device did not affect the antimicrobial effect of cervical mucus. the use of hormonal contraceptive canceled the antimicrobial effect on the series of microorganisms,  with the exception of m. lysodeicticus. the maximum inhibitory effect occurred on the 14th day and declined toward the end of the menstrual cycle.

TI  == qualitative assessment of midstream urine cultures in the detection of bacteriuria.
AB  == 3550 women attending cervical smear and family planning clinics have been screened for bacteriria. suprapubic aspiration of urine was carried out in 131 patients from whom two consecutive midstream urine specimens contained either a pure growth of gram positive cocci or a growth in which gram negative bacilli predominated. 95 patients were found to have bacteriuria; in 93 the urine was infected with a gram negative organism. of 53 patients with a count of more than  10-5 gram negative organisms per milliliter on two consecutive midstream urine samples, 48 (91%) had bacteriuria. however, 45 (48%) of the 93 patients with bacteriuria did not have two consecutive counts greater than 10-5 organisms per milliliter , and 10 (11%) had counts of less than 10-4 organisms per milliliter in at least one of the two midstream urine samples. it is concluded that midstream urine counts of less than 10-5 organisms per milliliter in which gram negative bacilli predominate may be indicative of bacteriuria and should be confirmed by suprapubic aspiration.

TI  == effect of heat on the antimicrobial activity of brillant green dye.
AB  == antimicrobial activity of brilliant green dye in trypticase soy broth (bbl) is reduced and ultimately destroyed by prolonged autoclaving at 121 c. loss of antimicrobial activity is accompanied by decolorization of the dye. this is consistent with other evidence that antimicrobial activity of brilliant green resides in the colored dye ion. the dye is not decolorized when heated in distilled water or peptone, but is decolorized by heating in glucose, glycine, or sodium dodecyl sulfate, showing that decolorization results from reaction with components of the medium. to ensure optimal results, it is recommended that bacteriological media be sterilized by heat prior to addition of brilliant green  dye.

AB  == the activity of cefoxitin was compared with that of cephalothin against 229 bacterial strains. cefoxitin was more active against most gram-negative strains,  notably against indole-producing proteus spp., which are usually resistant to the cephalosporins. cefoxitin was not susceptible to any significant extent to degradation by beta-lactamases produced by gram-negative organisms. against gram-positive organisms, however, cefoxitin was considerably less active than cephalothin, but minimum inhibitory concentrations for staphylococcus aureus were well within therapeutically attainable blood levels.pharmacokinetic studies in 18 volunteers showed a higher and longer sustained antibiotic activity in serum and  urine after injections of cefoxitin than after equal doses of cephalothin. urinary recovery of cefoxitin activity was also much higher than that of cephalothin. no evidence of toxicity due to cefoxitin was found. cefoxitin was slightly less painful after intramuscular injection than cephalothin.

TI  == amoxycillin: a new semi-synthetic penicillin.
AB  == amoxycillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzylpenicillin) is a new semi-synthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin. penicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci were sensitive to concentrations of 0.1 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. strains of haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by a level of 0.5 mug/ml, and most strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, shigella sonnei, salmonella species, and streptococcus faecalis were sensitive to a concentration of 5 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. penicillinase-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus and strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole-positive proteus, klebsiella, and enterobacter were insensitive to amoxycillin. the new penicillin was bactericidal in activity, as with other penicillins, and its antibacterial activity was not reduced in the presence of serum. after oral administration to volunteer subjects amoxycillin produced serum concentrations twice as high as those obtained with similar doses of ampicillin, and the penicillin was recovered unchanged in high concentrations in the urine. the absorption of amoxycillin was not greatly influenced by food, and administration  of probenecid resulted in increased and more prolonged concentrations of amoxycillin in serum.

TI  == media exchange method for demonstrating killing of l-phase variants in solid media by normal human serum.
AB  == normal human serum has been shown to kill l-phase variants in a fluid system by the action of antibody plus complement. previous studies, however, failed to demonstrate such killing in solid media. this failure probably resulted from inhibition of complement by medium components such as agar and nacl. a method was developed which circumvents the problems of the anticomplementary properties of agar media and the requirement of some l-phase variants for concentrations of salt that inhibit complement. using this method, we have demonstrated in solid media the killing by normal human serum of the l-phase variants of staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, s. faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhi. this method provides a relatively simple and graphic means for studying host humoral factors lethal for l-phase variants.

TI  == effect of different media on in vitro studies of antibiotic combinations.
AB  == in an effort to determine the adequacy of a standard broth medium in the evaluation of antibiotic combinations, 20 strains of various bacterial species were studied simultaneously in mueller-hinton broth and in freshly drawn human serum from apparently healthy volunteers. studies of growth dynamics by use of the usual plate dilution technique for quantitating colony-forming units were performed with strains of staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible), streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, aerobacter, klebsiella, and proteus mirabilis. a variety of different antibiotics were investigated. with 19 of the 20 strains, interpretations of synergism or antagonism were the same in both media. therefore, despite minor variations when  the same strain was studied in both serum and broth, it is concluded that mueller-hinton broth is an adequate medium for use in studies of chemotherapeutic combinations in vitro. a simplified method for studying bactericidal activity is  described, which is deemed practical for clinical microbiology laboratories and which led to the same conclusions regarding the combinations as were obtained by  the more arduous plate dilution test.
