TI  == combined moist airtight storage and feed fermentation of barley by the yeast wickerhamomyces anomalus and a lactic acid bacteria consortium.
AB  == this study combined moist airtight storage of moist grain with pig feed fermentation. starter cultures with the potential to facilitate both technologies were added to airtight stored moist crimped cereal grain, and the impact on storage microflora and the quality of feed fermentations generated from the grain was investigated. four treatments were compared: three based on moist barley, either un-inoculated (m), inoculated with wickerhamomyces anomalus (w), or inoculated with w. anomalus and lab starter culture, containing pediococcus acidilactici dsm 16243, pediococcus pentosaceus dsm 12834 and lactobacillus plantarum dsm 12837 (wlab); and one treatment based on dried barley (d). after 6  weeks of storage, four feed fermentations fm, fw, fwlab, and fd, were initiated from m, w, wlab, and d, respectively, by mixing the grain with water to a dry matter content of 30%. each treatment was fermented in batch initially for 7 days and then kept in a continuous mode by adding new feed daily with 50% back-slop. during the 6 week storage period, the average water activity decreased in m, w and wlab from 0.96 to 0.85, and cereal ph decreased from approximately 6.0 at harvest to 4.5. feed fermentation conferred a further ph decrease to 3.8-4.1. in  m, w and wlab, molds and enterobacteriaceae were mostly below detection limit, whereas both organism groups were detected in d. in fermented feed, enterobacteriaceae were below detection limit in almost all conditions. molds were detected in fd, for most of the fermentation time in fm and at some sampling points in fw and fwlab. starter organisms, especially w. anomalus and l. plantarum comprised a considerable proportion of the yeast and lab populations, respectively, in both stored grain and fermented feed. however, autochthonous pichia kudriavzevii and kazachstania exigua partially dominated the yeast populations in stored grain and fermented feed, respectively.

TI  == identification and antimicrobial activity detection of lactic acid bacteria isolated from corn stover silage.
AB  == a total of 59 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains were isolated from corn stover silage. according to phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) sequences and reca gene polymerase chain reaction amplification, these lab isolates were identified as five species: lactobacillus (l.) plantarum subsp. plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, enterococcus mundtii, weissella cibaria and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, respectively. those strains were also screened for antimicrobial activity using a dual-culture agar plate assay. based on excluding the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide, two l. plantarum subsp. plantarum strains zzu 203 and 204, which strongly inhibited salmonella enterica atcc 43971(t), micrococcus luteus atcc 4698(t) and escherichia coli atcc 11775(t) were selected for further research on sensitivity of the antimicrobial substance to heat, ph and protease. cell-free culture supernatants of the two strains exhibited strong heat stability (60 min at 100 degrees c), but the antimicrobial activity was eliminated after treatment at 121 degrees c for 15 min. the antimicrobial substance remained active under acidic condition (ph 2.0 to 6.0), but became inactive under neutral and alkaline condition (ph 7.0 to 9.0). in addition, the antimicrobial activities of these two strains decreased remarkably after digestion by protease k. these results preliminarily suggest that the desirable antimicrobial activity of strains zzu 203 and 204 is the result of the production of a bacteriocin-like substance, and these two strains with antimicrobial activity could be used as silage additives to inhibit proliferation of unwanted microorganism during ensiling and preserve nutrients of silage. the nature of the antimicrobial substances is being investigated in our laboratory.

TI  == anti-inflammatory properties of fermented soy milk with lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis s-su2 in murine macrophage raw264.7 cells and dss-induced ibd model mice.
AB  == six lactic acid bacteria strains (four lactobacillus plantarum strains and one each of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and pediococcus pentosaceus) have been isolated and shown to possess anti-oxidant activity. in this study, we determined their acid, bile, salt resistance, and adhesion activity on human enterocyte-like ht-29-luc and caco-2 cells. an isolate lc. lactis s-su2 showed highest bile resistance and adhesion activity compared to type strains. s-su2 could ferment both 10% skimmed milk and soy milk while the type strain could not ferment soy milk. soy milk fermented with s-su2 showed an increased nitric oxide (no) secretion in the mouse macrophage raw264.7 cells without bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps). furthermore, the inhibitory effects of the fermented soy milk on escherichia coli o111 lps-induced no secretion were higher than those of fresh soy milk. inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) was induced in mice fed either 5% (w/v) dextran sodium sulfate (dss) in drinking water or 50% soy milk in drinking water. shortening of colon length, breaking of epithelial cells, lowering liver and thymus weights, and enlargement of spleen are some of the characteristics observed in the ibd, which were prevented by the use of soy milk  fermented with lc. lactis s-su2.

TI  == genetic and technological characterisation of vineyard- and winery-associated lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == vineyard- and winery-associated lactic acid bacteria (lab) from two major pdo regions in greece, peza and nemea, were surveyed. lab were isolated from grapes,  fermenting musts, and winery tanks performing spontaneous malolactic fermentations (mlf). higher population density and species richness were detected in nemea than in peza vineyards and on grapes than in fermenting musts. pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus graminis were the most abundant lab on  grapes, while lactobacillus plantarum dominated in fermenting musts from both regions. no particular structure of lactobacillus plantarum populations according to the region of origin was observed, and strain distribution seems random. lab species diversity in winery tanks differed significantly from that in vineyard samples, consisting principally of oenococcus oeni. different strains were analysed as per their enological characteristics and the ability to produce biogenic amines (bas). winery-associated species showed higher resistance to low  ph, ethanol, so2, and cuso4 than vineyard-associated isolates. the frequency of ba-producing strains was relatively low but not negligible, considering that certain winery-associated lactobacillus hilgardii strains were able to produce bas. present results show the necessity of controlling the mlf by selected starters in order to avoid ba accumulation in wine.

TI  == characterization, identification and application of lactic acid bacteria isolated from forage paddy rice silage.
AB  == there has been growing interest to develop forage rice as a new feed resource for livestock. this study was to characterize the natural population of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and select potentially excellent strains for paddy rice silage preparation in china. one hundred and twenty-six strains were isolated and screened from paddy rice silage prepared using a small-scale fermentation system, and ninety-nine of these isolates were considered to be lab based on their gram-positive and catalase-negative morphology and the production of most of their metabolic products as lactic acid. these isolates were divided into eight groups (a-h) on the basis of their morphological and biochemical characteristics. the group a to h strains were identified as lactobacillus (l.) plantarum subsp. plantarum (species ratio: 8.1%), l. casei (5.1%), leuconostoc (ln.) pseudomesenteroides (11.1%), pediococcus (p.) pentosaceus (24.2%), enterococcus (e.) mundtii (12.1%), lactococcus (lc.) garvieae (15.2%), e. faecium (9.1%) and lc. lactis subsp. lactis (15.2%) based on sequence analyses of their 16s rrna and reca genes. p. pentosaceus was the most abundant member of the lab population in  the paddy rice silage. a selected strain, namely l. casei r 465, was found to be  able to grow under low ph conditions and to improve the silage quality with low ph and a relatively high content of lactic acid. this study demonstrated that forage paddy rice silage contains abundant lab species and its silage can be well preserved by inoculation with lab, and that strain r 465 can be a potentially excellent inoculant for paddy rice silage.

TI  == biodiversity and gamma-aminobutyric acid production by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional alpine raw cow's milk cheeses.
AB  == "nostrano-cheeses" are traditional alpine cheeses made from raw cow's milk in trentino-alto adige, italy. this study identified lactic acid bacteria (lab) developing during maturation of "nostrano-cheeses" and evaluated their potential  to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba), an immunologically active compound and neurotransmitter. cheese samples were collected on six cheese-making days, in three dairy factories located in different areas of trentino and at different stages of cheese ripening (24 h, 15 days, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 months). a total  of 1,059 lab isolates were screened using random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and differentiated into 583 clusters. lab strains from dominant clusters (n = 97) were genetically identified to species level by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. lab species most frequently isolated were lactobacillus paracasei, streptococcus thermophilus, and leuconostoc mesenteroides. the 97 dominant clusters were also characterized for their ability in producing gaba by  high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). about 71% of the dominant bacteria clusters evolving during cheeses ripening were able to produce gaba. most gaba producers were lactobacillus paracasei but other gaba producing species included  lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, pediococcus pentosaceus, and streptococcus thermophilus. no enterococcus faecalis or sc. macedonicus isolates produced gaba. the isolate producing the highest amount of gaba (80.0+/-2.7 mg/kg) was a sc. thermophilus.

TI  == effect of microbial inoculants on the quality and aerobic stability of bermudagrass round-bale haylage.
AB  == the objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of using 4 commercially available microbial inoculants to improve the fermentation and aerobic stability  of bermudagrass haylage. we hypothesized that the microbial inoculants would increase the fermentation and aerobic stability of the haylages. bermudagrass (4-wk regrowth) was harvested and treated with (1) deionized water (control); (2) buchneri 500 (b500; lallemand animal nutrition, milwaukee, wi) containing 1x10(5) of pediococcus pentosaceus and 4x10(5) of lactobacillus buchneri 40788; (3) biotal plus ii (bpii; lallemand animal nutrition) containing 1.2x10(5) of p. pentosaceus and propionibacteria freudenreichii; (4) silage inoculant ii (si; agriking inc., fulton, il) containing 1x10(5) of lactobacillus plantarum and p. pentosaceus; and (5) silo king (sk; agriking inc.), containing 1x10(5) of l. plantarum, enterococcus faecium, and p. pentosaceus, respectively. forty round bales (8 per treatment; 441+/-26kg; 1.2x1.2 m diameter) were made and each was wrapped with 7 layers of plastic. twenty bales were stored for 112 d and the remaining 20 were stored for 30 d and sampled by coring after intermediary storage periods of 0, 3, 7, and 30 d. the ph of control and inoculated haylages sampled on d 3 did not differ. however, b500 and bpii had lower ph (5.77+/-0.04 vs. 6.16+/-0.04; 5.06+/-0.13 vs. 5.52+/-0.13) than other treatments by d 7 and 30, respectively. at final bale opening on d 112, all treatments had lower ph than the control haylage (4.77+/-0.07 vs. 5.37+/-0.07). the b500, bpii, and si haylages had greater lactic acid and lactic-to-acetic acid ratios than sk and control haylages. no differences were detected in neutral detergent fiber digestibility, dry matter losses, dry matter, lactic and acetic acid concentrations, and yeast and coliform counts. the sk haylage had lower clostridia counts compared with the control (1.19+/-0.23 vs. 1.99+/-0.23 cfu/g).  treatments b500, bpii, si, and sk tended to reduce mold counts and they improved  aerobic stability by 236, 197, 188, and 95%, respectively, compared with the control (276+/-22 vs. 99+/-22h).

TI  == probiotic bacteria, b. longum and l. acidophilus inhibit infection by rotavirus in vitro and decrease the duration of diarrhea in pediatric patients.
AB  == background and objectives: evidence suggests that specific probiotics may be antagonistic to enteric pathogens and enhance immunity, and thus, provide a means of preventing or treating diarrheal diseases. in the present study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of probiotic strains isolated from koreans for the treatment of viral gastroenteritis in young children and against rotavirus in vitro. methods: in vitro antiviral activities of probiotic isolates on rotavirus  infection were investigated in the vero cell using a plaque reduction assay. then several probiotic strains with the high antiviral activity were chosen for further clinical trials. twenty-nine pediatric patients who presented with symptoms of viral gastroenteritis were enrolled in a double-blind trial and randomly assigned at admission to receive six probiotic strains (bifidobacterium  longum, b. lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. plantarum, and pediococcus pentosaceus) at a dose of 10(9) colony forming units/g or a comparable placebo twice daily for 1 week. results and conclusions: of the tested probiotic strains, b. longum isolated from an infant showed the greatest inhibitory effect and l. acidophilus showed the second-highest inhibitory effect. these probiotics significantly shortened the duration of diarrhea as compared with a placebo (6.1 +/- 0.5 vs 7.2 +/- 1.9, p = 0.030) and did not induce any adverse effects. our findings suggest that the probiotic strains selected in the  present study may be useful for the treatment of acute rotaviral gastroenteritis  or as an alternative therapy without adverse effects.

TI  == safety evaluation of multiple strains of lactobacillus plantarum and pediococcus  pentosaceus in wistar rats based on the ames test and a 28-day feeding study.
AB  == three lactic acid bacterial strains, lactobacillus plantarum, hk006, and hk109, and pediococcus pentosaceus pp31 exhibit probiotic potential as antiallergy agents, both in vitro and in vivo. however, the safety of these new strains requires evaluation when isolated from infant faeces or pickled cabbage. multiple strains (hk006, hk109, and pp31) were subject to a bacterial reverse mutation assay and a short-term oral toxicity study. the powder product exhibited mutagenic potential in salmonella typhimurium strains ta98 and ta1535 (with or without metabolic activation). in the short-term oral toxicity study, rats received a normal dosage of 390 mg/kg/d (approximately 9 x 10(9) cfu/kg/d) or a high dosage of 1950 mg/kg/d (approximately 4.5 x 10(10) cfu/kg/d) for 28 d. no adverse effects were observed regarding the general condition, behaviour, growth, feed and water consumption, haematology, clinical chemistry indices, organ weights, or histopathologic analysis of the rats. these studies have demonstrated that the consumption of multiple bacterial strains is not associated with any signs of mutagenicity of s. typhimurium or toxicity in wistar rats, even after consuming large quantities of bacteria.

TI  == the use of maldi-tof mass spectrometry, ribotyping and phenotypic tests to identify lactic acid bacteria from fermented cereal foods in abidjan (cote d'ivoire).
AB  == matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) protein analysis, automated ribotyping, and phenotypic tests (e.g., cell morphology, gas production from glucose, growth and acid production on homofermemtative-heterofermentative differential (hhd) agar medium, sugar fermentation patterns) were used to identify 23 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from fermented cereal foods available in abidjan, cote d'ivoire. pediococcus acidilactici (56.5%), lactobacillus fermentum (30.4%), l. salivarius  (4.3%), p. pentosaceus (4.3%) and l. plantarum subsp. plantarum (4.3%) were the species and subspecies identified. protein based identification was confirmed by  automated ribotyping for selected isolates and was similar to that provided by the phenotypic characterization. maldi-tof ms protein analysis provided a high level of discrimination among the isolates and could be used for the rapid screening of lab starter cultures.

TI  == assessment of probiotic properties in lactic acid bacteria isolated from wine.
AB  == probiotic properties are highly strain-dependent but rarely studied in enological lactic acid bacteria (lab). in this study, the probiotic features of 11 strains of lactobacillus spp., pediococcus spp., and oenococcus oeni, including saliva and acid resistance, bile tolerance and exopolysaccharides' production, were investigated. the assays included two probiotic reference strains (lactobacillus  plantarum clc 17 and lactobacillus fermentum cect5716). the lactobacillus and pediococcus strains showed high resistance to lysozyme (>80% resistance to 100 mg/l of lysozyme under conditions simulating the in vivo dilution by saliva) and  were capable of surviving at low ph values (ph 1.8) and bile salts, suggesting good adaptation of the wine strains to gastrointestinal conditions. the ability of the strains to adhere to the intestinal mucosa and the inhibition of the adhesion of escherichia coli to human intestinal cells were also evaluated. adhesion levels of enological lab to caco-2 cells varied from 0.37% to 12.2%, depending on the strain. in particular, pediococcus pentosaceus cial-86 showed a  high percentage of adhesion to intestinal cells (>12%), even higher than that shown by the probiotic reference strains, and a high anti-adhesion activity against e. coli cial-153 (>30%), all of which support this wine lab strain as a potential probiotic.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic characterization of some lactic acid bacteria isolated from bee pollen: a preliminary study.
AB  == in the present work, five hundred and sixty-seven isolates of lactic acid bacteria were recovered from raw bee pollen grains. all isolates were screened for their antagonistic activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. neutralized supernatants of 54 lactic acid bacteria (lab) cultures from 216 active isolates inhibited the growth of indicator bacteria. they were phenotypically characterized, based on the fermentation of 39 carbohydrates. using the simple matching coefficient and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages (upgma), seven clusters with other two members were defined at the 79% similarity level. the following species were characterized: lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus acidilactici, pediococcus pentosaceus, and unidentified lactobacilli. phenotypic characteristics of major and minor clusters were also identified. partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene of representative isolates from each cluster was performed, and ten strains were assigned to seven species:  lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus ingluviei, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus acidipiscis and weissella cibaria. the molecular method used failed to determine the exact taxonomic status of bh0900 and ah3133.

TI  == administration of lactobacillus salivarius li01 or pediococcus pentosaceus li05 improves acute liver injury induced by d-galactosamine in rats.
AB  == this work investigated the effect of the intragastric administration of five lactic acid bacteria from healthy people on acute liver failure in rats. sprague-dawley rats were given intragastric supplements of lactobacillus salivarius li01, lactobacillus salivarius li02, lactobacillus paracasei li03, lactobacillus plantarum li04, or pediococcus pentosaceus li05 for 8 days. acute liver injury was induced on the eighth day by intraperitoneal injection of 1.1 g/kg body weight d-galactosamine (d-galn). after 24 h, samples were collected to  determine the level of liver enzymes, liver function, histology of the terminal ileum and liver, serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, bacterial translocation, and composition of the gut microbiome. the results indicated that pretreatment with l. salivarius li01 or p. pentosaceus li05 significantly reduced elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, prevented the increase in total bilirubin, reduced the histological abnormalities of both the liver and the terminal ileum, decreased bacterial translocation, increased the serum level of interleukin 10 and/or interferon-gamma, and resulted in a cecal microbiome that differed from that of the liver injury control. pretreatment with l. plantarum li04 or l. salivarius li02 demonstrated no significant effects during this process, and pretreatment with l. paracasei li03 aggravated liver injury. to the best of our knowledge, the effects of the three species-l. paracasei, l. salivarius, and p. pentosaceus-on d-galn-induced liver injury have  not been previously studied. the excellent characteristics of l. salivarius li01  and p. pentosaceus li05 enable them to serve as potential probiotics in the prevention or treatment of acute liver failure.

TI  == prevalence of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria isolated from the faeces of broiler chicken in malaysia.
AB  == background: probiotics are commonly used as feed additive to substitute antibiotic as growth promoter in animal farming. probiotic consists of lactic acid bacteria (lab), which enhance the growth and health of the animal. probiotic also have higher possibility to become pathogenic bacteria that may carry antibiotic resistant gene that can be transmitted to other lab species. the aim of this study was to identify the lab species in the faeces of broiler chicken and to determine the prevalence of antibiotic resistant in lab of broiler chicken. methods: sixty faeces samples were collected from wet markets located in klang valley of malaysia for the isolation of lab using de-mann rogosa sharpe medium. thirteen species of lab were obtained in this study and the identification of lab was performed by using api test kit on the basis of carbohydrate fermentation profile. antibiotic susceptibility assay was then carried out to determine the prevalence of lab antibiotic resistance. results: lactococcus lactis subsp lactis was found in nine out of sixty faecal samples. lactobacillus paracasei was the second common lab species isolated from chicken faecal. no significant difference (p > 0.05) was found between the occurrence of  lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus plantarum, leuconostoc lactis mesenteroides subsp mesenteroides/dectranium and pediococcus pentosaceus isolated from 5 different locations. most of the isolated lab was resistant to antibiotic and high variability of the antibiotic resistance was observed among the lab against 15 types of antibiotics. penicillin, amoxicillin,  chloramphenicol, and ampicillin had significant higher (p< 0.05) inhibitory zone  than nalidixic acid, gentamycin, sulphamethoxazole, kanamycin, and streptomycin.  conclusions: many species of lab were isolated from the faecal samples of broiler chicken that resistance to the common antibiotics used in the farm. the development of resistant against antibiotics in lab can be attributed to the long term exposure of antibiotic as growth promoter and therapeutic agents. thus, it is essential to advise farmer the safety measure of antibiotic application in animal farming. additionally, the supplementation of probiotic in animal feeding  also needs more attention and close monitoring.

TI  == identification of thermo tolerant lactic acid bacteria isolated from silage prepared in the hot and humid climate of southwestern japan.
AB  == to develop high-quality silage starters adapted to hot and humid weather, 12 lab  isolates from silage produced in kyushu and okinawa, japan were characterized based on their morphological features, growth curves and sugar utilization. in addition, the nucleotide sequences of the v2-v3 region of their 16s rrna genes and the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer (its) regions were determined. the isolates were also subjected to rapd-pcr analysis, dna-dna hybridization, g+c content analysis and immuno-identification using species-specific monoclonal antibodies and sds-page profiling. nearly all of the isolates exhibited high thermotolerance and rapid growth. combining its sequence analysis, rapd-pcr and immuno-identification enabled rapid and accurate identification of closely related lab strains that other methods failed to appropriately differentiate; for example, l. plantarum was distinguished from l. pentosus, and l. casei was distinguished from l. rhamonsus. using the aforementioned techniques, the isolated strains were identified as l. plantarum, l. rhamonsus, l. rapi, pediococcus pentosaceus and p. lolii. our findings also showed that there is greater diversity among thermophilic labs in silage prepared in a hot and humid environment.

TI  == proteolytic characterisation in grass carp sausage inoculated with lactobacillus  plantarum and pediococcus pentosaceus.
AB  == the proteolysis in grass carp sausages inoculated with lactobacillus plantarum zy40 and pediococcus pentosaceus gy23 was investigated. as fermentation progressed, sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar proteins in both sausages were obviously degraded, and the proteolytic process was more intense in sausages inoculated with p. pentosaceus gy23. the increases in alpha-amino nitrogen, trichloroacetic acid (tca)-soluble peptides and free amino acids were also detected in both sausages. the differences in alpha-amino nitrogen content and free amino acids concentration were due to the activity of inoculated lactic acid bacteria, while endogenous enzymes contributed to the release of tca-soluble peptides. our findings indicate that lactic acid bacteria influence proteolytic characterisation in fermented fish sausage, with strain-dependent activity.

TI  == a description of the lactic acid bacteria microbiota associated with the production of traditional fermented vegetables in vietnam.
AB  == an important part of the daily nourishment in vietnam constitutes of fermented vegetables. bacteria and especially lactic acid bacteria play a central role in the production of many fermented vegetables. the current study was conducted to investigate the diversity of native lactic acid bacteria (lab) populations in 'dua muoi' (mustard and beet fermentation) and 'ca muoi' (eggplant fermentation), three types of popular traditional fermented vegetables of vietnamese origin. to  this end a polyphasic approach combining matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) and phes gene sequence analysis was used. in addition, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was performed as a culture-independent method to complement the observed culturable diversity data. a total of 881 lab isolates were recovered from 21 different samples. predominant lab associated with 'dua muoi' and 'ca muoi' were identified as lactobacillus fermentum (56.6%), lactobacillus pentosus  (24.4%) and lactobacillus plantarum (17.1%). less abundant species were pediococcus pentosaceus (1.0%) and lactobacillus brevis (0.5%). species present less than 0.1% included lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus pantheris and pediococcus acidilactici. in contrast to fermented mustard and beet with the highest prevalence of l. fermentum, the species most recovered from fermented eggplant samples was l. pentosus. in addition, an important degree of genetic variability within the different predominant species was observed and strain dependency correlating with the type of fermented vegetable or location of production could be demonstrated using multivariate statistics. this research gives an extensive and detailed inventory of the lab diversity associated with the production of diverse vietnamese fermented vegetables and demonstrates the influence of type of raw material and/or production location and conditions on this diversity.

AB  == obushera includes four fermented cereal beverages from uganda namely: obutoko, enturire, ekitiribita and obuteire, whose microbial diversity has not hitherto been fully investigated. knowledge of the microbial diversity and dynamics in these products is crucial for understanding their safety and development of appropriate starter cultures for controlled industrial processing. culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques including denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and mixed dna sequencing of polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) amplified ribosomal rna genes were used to study the bacteria and  yeast diversity of obushera. the ph dropped from 6.0-4.6 to 3.5-4.0 within 1-2 days for obutoko, enturire and obuteire whereas that of ekitiribita decreased to  4.4 after 4 days. counts of lactic acid bacteria (lab) increased from 5.0 to 11.0 log cfug(-1) and yeasts increased from 3.4 to 7.1 log cfug(-1) while coliform counts decreased from 2.0 to <1 log cfug(-1) during four days of fermentation. lab and yeast isolates were identified by rrna gene sequence analysis. lab isolates included: enterococcus spp., lactobacillus (lb.) plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus (s.) infantarius subsp. infantarius, pediococcus pentosaceus and weisella (w.) confusa. dgge indicated predominance of s. gallolyticus, s. infantarius subsp. infantarius, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, w. confusa, lb. reuteri, fructobacillus spp., l. lactis and l. lactis. yeast isolates included clavispora  lusitaniae, cyberlindnera fabianii, issatchenkia orientalis and saccharomyces cerevisiae. dgge indicated predominance of s. cerevisiae in obutoko, enturire and obuteire and also detected pichia spp. and i. orientalis in obutoko. obushera produced in the laboratory was initially dominated by enterobacteriaceae and later by lactococcus spp. enterobacteriaceae and bacillus spp. were also detected in ekitiribita. development of starters for obushera may require combinations of  lab and s. cerevisiae for obutoko, enturire and obuteire and lab for ekitiribita.

TI  == fast identification of wine related lactic acid bacteria by multiplex pcr.
AB  == the microflora of must and wine consists of yeasts, acetic acid bacteria and lactic acid bacteria (lab). the latter group plays an important role for wine quality. the malolactic fermentation carried out by lab leads to deacidification  and stabilisation of wines. nevertheless, lab are often associated with wine spoilage. they are mainly responsible for the formation of biogenic amines. furthermore, some strains produce exopolysaccharide slimes, acetic acid, diacetyl and other off-flavours. in this context a better monitoring of the vinification process is crucial to improve wine quality. moreover, a lot of biodiversity studies would also profit from a fast and reliable identification method. in this study, we propose a species-specific multiplex pcr system for a rapid and simultaneous detection of 13 lab species, frequently occurring in must or wine: lactobacillus brevis, lb. buchneri, lb. curvatus, lb. hilgardii, lb. plantarum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, oenococcus oeni, pediococcus acidilactici, p. damnosus, p. inopinatus, p. parvulus, p. pentosaceus and weissella paramesenteroides.

TI  == a combination of two lactic acid bacteria improves the hydrolysis of gliadin during wheat dough fermentation.
AB  == the evaluation of gliadin hydrolysis during dough fermentation by using two lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus plantarum crl 775 and pediococcus pentosaceus crl 792, as pooled cell suspension (lab) or cell free extract (cfe) was undertaken. the cfe pool produced a greater (121%) increase in amino acid concentration than the lab pool (70-80%). these results were correlated with the  decrease (76,100 and 64,300 ppm) in the gliadin concentration of doughs supplemented with cfe and lab, respectively, compared to control doughs. the use  of lab peptidases seemed to be a viable technologic alternative to reduce the gliadin concentration in wheat dough without using living bacteria as starter.

TI  == optimization of electrotransformation conditions for leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides atcc8293.
AB  == aims: to establish an efficient genetic transformation protocol for leuconostoc species, methods for competent-cell preparation and electroporation conditions were optimized. methods and results: leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides atcc8293 cells were sequentially treated with penicillin g and lysozyme, and the plasmid pleucm was subsequently transformed into the cells. our results demonstrated that transformation efficiencies were significantly increased (100-fold), and increased electric field strength also contributed to enhance transformation efficiency. maximum transformation efficiency (1x10(4) or  more transformants per mug dna) was achieved when cells were grown in de man, rogosa, sharpe (mrs) media containing 0.25 mol l(-1) sucrose and 0.8 mug ml(-1) penicillin g, followed by treatment with 600 u ml(-1) lysozyme and electroporation at a field strength of 10 kv cm(-1). when this protocol was used  to transform pleucm into leuc. mesenteroides, leuconostoc gelidum, leuconostoc fallax and leuconostoc argentinun, successful transformations were obtained in all cases. furthermore, this procedure was applicable to species belonging to other genera, including lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus and weissella confusa. conclusions: the results demonstrate that the transformation efficiency for leuconostoc spp. could be increased via optimization of the entire electroporation procedures. significance and impact of the study: these optimized conditions can be used for the extensive genetic study and the metabolic engineering of not only leuconostoc spp. but also different species of lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == cultivable microbiota of lithobates catesbeianus and advances in the selection of lactic acid bacteria as biological control agents in raniculture.
AB  == the cultivable microbiota of skin and cloaca of captive lithobates catesbeianus includes microorganisms generally accepted as beneficial and potentially pathogenic bacteria. in order to select a group of potentially probiotic bacteria, 136 isolates were evaluated for their surface properties and production of antagonistic metabolites. then, 11 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains were selected and identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactococcus lactis, l. garvieae and enterococcus gallinarum. studies of compatibility indicate that all the strains could be included in a multi-strain probiotic, with the exception of ent. gallinarum crl 1826 which inhibited lab species through a bacteriocin-like metabolite. these results contribute to the design of a probiotic product to improve the sanitary status of bullfrogs in intensive culture systems, to avoid the use of antibiotics and thus  to reduce production costs. it could also be an alternative to prevent infectious diseases during the ex situ breeding of amphibian species under threat of extinction.

TI  == presence of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes in lactic acid bacteria from fermented foods of indian origin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) resistant to erythromycin were isolated from different food samples on selective media. the isolates were identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus lactis, enterococcus casseliflavus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides. of the total 60 isolates, 88 % harbored the ermb gene. the efflux gene msra was identified in e. faecium, e. durans, e. lactis, e. casseliflavus, p. pentosaceus  and l. fermentum. further analysis of the msra gene by sequencing suggested its homology to msrc. resistance to tetracycline due to the genes tetm, tetw, teto, tetk and tetl, alone or in combination, were identified in lactobacillus species. the tetracycline efflux genes tetk and tetl occurred in p. pentosaceus and enterococcus species. since it appeared that lab had acquired these genes, fermented foods may be a source of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == molecular characterization of lactic acid bacteria and in situ amylase expression during traditional fermentation of cereal foods.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria play an important role in traditional fermented foods consumed in different countries. study of their taxonomic structure and diversity is necessary for starter culture selection, improved safety and nutritional enhancement. to achieve these objectives, microbial genomic typing methods were used to study genetic differences of autochthonous bacteria and their distribution in two traditional african fermented cereal foods. a total of 85 predominant bacterial species were isolated from ogi and kunu-zaki obtained from  northern and southern geographical region of nigeria. they were identified using  combination of 16s rrna gene sequencing, multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa) based on rpoa, phes and atpa genes as well as m13-pcr gel fingerprints. the results showed that lactobacillus fermentum was the most frequently isolated species in ogi (71.4%) and kunu-zaki (84.5%). other species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) identified were lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus and pediococcus pentosaceus. non lactic acid bacteria isolated from these foods were species belonging to the bacillus and staphylococcus. non-metric multidimensional scaling (nmds) analysis of the m13-pcr fingerprints for lab strains showed clonal diversity among strains of the same species. in vitro and in situ expression of amylase gene during fermentation by amylolytic l. plantarum ulag11 was detected, indicating the potential usefulness of such species for development of starter cultures and for controlled fermentation processes.

TI  == genotypic characterization and safety assessment of lactic acid bacteria from indigenous african fermented food products.
AB  == background: indigenous fermented food products play an essential role in the diet of millions of africans. lactic acid bacteria (lab) are among the predominant microbial species in african indigenous fermented food products and are used for  different applications in the food and biotechnology industries. numerous studies have described antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of lab from different parts  of the world. however, there is limited information on antimicrobial resistance profiles of lab from africa. the aim of this study was to characterize 33 lab previously isolated from three different african indigenous fermented food products using (gtg)5-based rep-pcr, sequencing of the 16s rrna gene and species-specific pcr techniques for differentiation of closely related species and further evaluate their antibiotic resistance profiles by the broth microdilution method and their haemolytic activity on sheep blood agar plates as  indicators of safety traits among these bacteria. results: using molecular biology based methods and selected phenotypic tests such as catalase reaction, co2 production from glucose, colonies and cells morphology, the isolates were identified as lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus ghanensis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, pediococcus acidilactici, pediococcus pentosaceus and weissella confusa. the bacteria were susceptible to ampicillin, chloramphenicol,  clindamycin and erythromycin but resistant to vancomycin, kanamycin and streptomycin. variable sensitivity profiles to tetracycline and gentamicin was observed among the isolates with lb. plantarum, lb. salivarius, w. confusa (except strain sk9-5) and lb. fermentum strains being susceptible to tetracycline whereas pediococcus strains and lb. ghanensis strains were resistant. for gentamicin, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lb. ghanensis and ped. acidilactici strains were resistant to 64 mg/l whereas some w. confusa and lb. plantarum strains had a mic value of 16 mg/l and 32 mg/l respectively. no beta-haemolytic activity was observed, however, alpha-haemolytic activity was observed in 27% (9) of the strains comprising lb. salivarius (6), w. confusa (2) and lb. delbrueckii  (1) isolates. conclusions: the resistance to kanamycin and vancomycin is probably an intrinsic feature since similar observations were reported in the literature for lab. low prevalence of pathogenicity indicator traits were observed among the isolates especially with the presence of poor haemolytic activities and they could therefore be considered as interesting candidates for selection of starter  cultures or probiotics for different applications.

TI  == identification and characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from mixed pasture of timothy and orchardgrass, and its badly preserved silage.
AB  == in order to understand the relationship between lactic acid bacteria (lab) species and silage fermentation, a total of 65 lab strains isolated from mixed pasture of timothy (phleum pratense l.) and orchardgrass (dactylis glomerata l.), and its badly preserved silages were subjected to phenotypic and genetic analysis. according to these analyses, the isolates were divided into 13 groups,  including enterococcus gallinarum, lactobacillus acidipiscis, l. coryniformis subsp. coryniformis, l. coryniformis subsp. torquens, l. curvatus, l. paraplantarum, l. plantarum subsp. argentoratensis, l. plantarum subsp. plantarum, l. sakei subsp. carnosus, lactococcus garvieae, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, pediococcus acidilactici, pediococcus pentosaceus, weissella hellenica, weissella paramesenteroides and carnobacterium divergens. this is the first report to document that c. divergens, l. acidipiscis, l. sakei subsp. carnosus, l. garvieae, phenotypically novel l. lactis subsp. cremoris, e. gallinarum and w. hellenica are present in vegetative  forage crops. l. plantarum group strains were most frequently isolated from the badly preserved silages. some isolates showed a wide range of growth preferences  for carbohydrate utilization, optimal growth ph and temperature in vitro, indicating that they have a high growth potential. these results are useful in understanding the diversity of lab associated with decayed silage of timothy and  orchardgrass.

TI  == the obesity and fatty liver are reduced by plant-derived pediococcus pentosaceus  lp28 in high fat diet-induced obese mice.
AB  == we evaluated the effect of an oral administration of a plant-derived lactic acid  bacterium, pediococcus pentosaceus lp28 (lp28), on metabolic syndrome by using high fat diet-induced obese mice. the obese mice were divided into 2 groups and fed either a high fat or regular diet for 8 weeks. each group was further divided into 3 groups, which took lp28, another plant-derived lactobacillus plantarum sn13t (sn13t) or no lactic acid bacteria (lab). the lean control mice were fed a  regular diet without inducing obesity prior to the experiment. lp28 reduced body  weight gain and liver lipid contents (triglyceride and cholesterol), in mice fed  a high fat diet for 8 weeks (40%, 54%, and 70% less than those of the control group without lab, and p = 0.018, p<0.001, and p = 0.021, respectively), whereas  sn13t and the heat treated lp28 at 121 degrees c for 15 min were ineffective. abdominal visceral fat in the high fat diet mice fed with lp28 was also lower than that without lab by 44%, although it was not significant but borderline (p = 0.076). the sizes of the adipocytes and the lipid droplets in the livers were obviously decreased. a real-time pcr analyses showed that lipid metabolism-related genes, such as cd36 (p = 0.013), scd1 encoding stearoyl-coa desaturase 1 (not significant but borderline, p = 0.066), and ppargamma encoding  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (p = 0.039), were down-regulated by taking lp28 continuously, when compared with those of the control group. in conclusion, lp28 may be a useful lab strain for the prevention and reduction of the metabolic syndrome.

TI  == characteristics of isolated lactic acid bacteria and their effectiveness to improve stylo (stylosanthes guianensis sw.) silage quality at various temperatures.
AB  == two lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains, pediococcus pentosaceus sc1 and lactobacillus paraplantarum sc2 isolated from king grass silage, were characterized and their effectiveness to improve the silage fermentation quality  of stylo (stylosanthes guianensis sw.) was studied. strain sc1 was able to grow at a high temperature of 45 degrees c, while sc2 did not. sc2 normally grew at a  low ph of 4.0, while sc1 could not. these two strains and a commercial inoculant  of lab (l. plantarum, lp) were used as additives to stylo silage preparation at various temperatures (20 degrees c, 30 degrees c and 40 degrees c). all lab inoculants significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the ph value and ammonia-n content, and increased the ratio of lactic acid to acetic acid and quality score compared  with the control. in addition, inoculating lab strains markedly (p < 0.05) reduced butyric acid content at the temperatures of 30 degrees c and 40 degrees c. compared to sc2 and lp strains, strain sc1 was the most effective for improving stylo silage quality at 20 degrees c, indicated by the increase in lactic acid, ratio of lactic acid to acetic acid and quality score. at 30 degrees c and 40 degrees c, there were no significant differences among sc1, sc2 and lp treatments in ph values, contents of acetic acid, butyric acid and ammonia-n (p > 0.05).

TI  == biodiversity of yeasts, lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria in the fermentation of "shanxi aged vinegar", a traditional chinese vinegar.
AB  == shanxi aged vinegar is a famous traditional chinese vinegar made from several kinds of cereal by spontaneous solid-state fermentation techniques. in order to get a comprehensive understanding of culturable microorganism's diversity present in its fermentation, the indigenous microorganisms including 47 yeast isolates, 28 lactic acid bacteria isolates and 58 acetic acid bacteria isolates were recovered in different fermenting time and characterized based on a combination of phenotypic and genotypic approaches including inter-delta/pcr, pcr-rflp, eric/pcr analysis, as well as 16s rrna and 26s rrna partial gene sequencing. in the alcoholic fermentation, the dominant yeast species saccharomyces (s.) cerevisiae (96%) exhibited low phenotypic and genotypic diversity among the isolates, while lactobacillus (lb.) fermentum together with lb. plantarum, lb. buchneri, lb. casei, pediococcus (p.) acidilactici, p. pentosaceus and weissella  confusa were predominated in the bacterial population at the same stage. acetobacter (a.) pasteurianus showing great variety both in genotypic and phenotypic tests was the dominant species (76%) in the acetic acid fermentation stage, while the other acetic acid bacteria species including a. senegalensis, a. indonesiensis, a. malorum and a. orientalis, as well as gluconobacter (g.) oxydans were detected at initial point of alcoholic and acetic acid fermentation  stage respectively.

TI  == in vitro testing of commercial and potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == probiotics are defined as live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of selected commercial and potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria using common in vitro screening assays such as transit tolerance in the upper human gastrointestinal tract, adhesion capacity to human intestinal cell lines and effect on epithelial barrier function. the selected bacteria include strains of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus farciminis, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus reuteri and pediococcus pentosaceus. viable counts after simulated  gastric transit tolerance showed that l. reuteri strains and p. pentosaceus tolerate gastric juice well, with no reduction of viability, whereas l. pentosus, l. farciminis and l. sakei strains lost viability over 180min. all strains tested tolerate the simulated small intestinal juice well. the bacterial adhesion capacity to human intestinal cells revealed major species and strain differences. overall, l. plantarum mf1298 and three l. reuteri strains had a significant higher adhesion capacity compared to the other strains tested. all strains, both  living and uv-inactivated, had little effect on the epithelial barrier function.  however, living l. reuteri strains revealed a tendency to increase the transepithelial electrical resistance (ter) from 6 to 24h. this work demonstrates the diversity of 18 potential probiotic bacteria, with major species and strain specific effects in the in vitro screening assays applied. overall, l. reuteri strains reveal some interesting characteristics compared to the other strains investigated.

TI  == effects of wilting and molasses addition on fermentation and bacterial community  in guinea grass silage.
AB  == aims: acetic acid is considered an important preservative in tropical grass ensiling. the objective of the current experiments was to follow the ensiling fermentation of low dry matter (dm) tropical grass as a model to study changes in bacterial communities during acetic acid fermentation. methods and results: direct-cut and wilted guinea grass silage was prepared with and without molasses. a high acetic acid level was observed during the fermentation of direct-cut silage, and long storage increased the butyric acid and ethanol content if molasses was not added. the lactic acid production in wilted silage was greater than the acetic acid production, but prolonged ensiling decreased the lactic to acetic acid ratio regardless of molasses addition. adding molasses enhanced the lactic acid content in both direct-cut and wilted silage. the bacterial community, identified by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, was affected by wilting and molasses addition. bands for pantoea sp. and morganella sp. became faint when acetic acid fermentation was suppressed, and those for pediococcus pentosaceus and lactococcus garvieae were detected when lactic acid fermentation  was enhanced by wilting and molasses addition. lactobacillus plantarum and lactococcus lactis were found throughout the ensiling process in all silage types. conclusion: distinct changes occurred in the bacterial community in guinea grass silage because of wilting and molasses addition. these changes could explain how lactic acid fermentation was enhanced but could not help determine which bacteria were associated with enhanced acetic acid fermentation. significance and impact of the study: the study reveals the effects of wilting and molasses during ensiling of low dm tropical grasses and the associated bacteria.

TI  == wine phenolic compounds influence the production of volatile phenols by wine-related lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the effect of wine phenolic compounds on the production of volatile phenols (4-vinylphenol [4vp] and 4-ethylphenol [4ep]) from the metabolism of p-coumaric acid by lactic acid bacteria (lab). methods and results: lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus collinoides and pediococcus pentosaceus were grown in mrs medium supplemented with p-coumaric acid, in the presence of different phenolic compounds: nonflavonoids (hydroxycinnamic and benzoic acids) and flavonoids (flavonols and flavanols). the inducibility of the enzymes involved in the p-coumaric acid metabolism was studied in resting cells. the hydroxycinnamic acids tested stimulated the capacity of lab to synthesize volatile phenols. growth in the presence of hydroxycinnamic acids, especially caffeic acid, induced the production of 4vp by resting cells. the hydroxybenzoic  acids did not significantly affect the behaviour of the studied strains. some of  the flavonoids showed an effect on the production of volatile phenols, although strongly dependent on the bacterial species. relatively high concentrations (1 g  l(-1) ) of tannins inhibited the synthesis of 4vp by lact. plantarum. conclusions: hydroxycinnamic acids were the main compounds stimulating the production of volatile phenols by lab. the results suggest that caffeic and ferulic acids induce the synthesis of the cinnamate decarboxylase involved in the metabolism of p-coumaric acid. on the other hand, tannins exert an inhibitory effect. significance and impact of the study: this study highlights the capacity  of lab to produce volatile phenols and that this activity is markedly influenced  by the phenolic composition of the medium.

TI  == biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in spontaneously-fermented buckwheat and teff sourdoughs.
AB  == in this study, four different laboratory scale gluten-free (gf) sourdoughs were developed from buckwheat or teff flours. the fermentations were initiated by the  spontaneous biota of the flours and developed under two technological conditions  (a and b). sourdoughs were propagated by continuous back-slopping until the stability was reached. the composition of the stable biota occurring in each sourdough was assessed using both culture-dependent and -independent techniques.  overall, a broad spectrum of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts species, belonging mainly to the genera lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, kazachstania and candida, were identified in the stable sourdoughs. buckwheat and teff sourdoughs were dominated mainly by obligate or facultative heterofermentative lab, which are commonly associated with traditional wheat or rye sourdoughs. however, the spontaneous fermentation of the gf flours resulted also in the selection of species which are not consider endemic to traditional sourdoughs, i.e. pediococcus pentosaceus, leuconostoc holzapfelii, lactobacillus  gallinarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus graminis  and weissella cibaria. in general, the composition of the stable biota was strongly affected by the fermentation conditions, whilst lactobacillus plantarum  dominated in all buckwheat sourdoughs. lactobacillus pontis is described for the  first time as dominant species in teff sourdough. among yeasts, saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida glabrata dominated teff sourdoughs, whereas the solely kazachstania barnetti was isolated in buckwheat sourdough developed under condition a. this study allowed the identification and isolation of lab and yeasts species which are highly competitive during fermentation of buckwheat or teff flours. representatives of these species can be selected as starters for the production of sourdough destined to gf bread production.

AB  == this work aimed to evaluate the effect of certain factors on the production of volatile phenols from the metabolism of p-coumaric acid by lactic acid bacteria (lab) (lactobacillus plantarum, l. collinoides and pediococcus pentosaceus). the  studied factors were: ph, l-malic acid concentration, glucose and fructose concentrations and aerobic/anaerobic conditions. it was found that, in the ph range of 3.5 to 4.5, the higher the ph the greater the production of volatile phenols. this behaviour is correlated with the effect of ph on bacterial growth.  increasing levels of l-malic acid in the medium diminished the production of 4-vinylphenol (4vp) and stimulated the production of 4-ethylphenol (4ep) by l. plantarum ncfb 1752 and l. collinoides esb 99. the conversion of 4vp into 4ep by  the activity of the vinylphenol reductase may be advantageous to the cells in the presence of l-malic acid, presumably due to the generation of nad+, a cofactor required by the malolactic enzyme. relatively high levels of glucose (20 g/l) led to an almost exclusive production of 4vp by l. plantarum ncfb 1752, while at low  concentrations (</= 5 g/l), 4ep is mainly or solely produced. part of the glucose may be diverted to the production of mannitol as an alternative pathway to regenerate nad+. this is corroborated by the experiments done with fructose, a compound that can be used as an electron acceptor by some bacteria becoming reduced to mannitol. in anaerobiosis, the reduction of 4vp into 4ep is clearly favoured, which is consistent with the need to increase the availability of nad+  in these conditions. this study shows that the amount and the ratio 4vp/4ep produced by lab are greatly affected by certain environmental and medium composition factors. the behaviour of the bacteria seems to be driven by the intracellular nad+/nadh balance.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic analyses of lactic acid bacteria in local fermented food, breast milk and faeces of mothers and their babies.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are generally accepted as beneficial to the host and their presence is directly influenced by ingestion of fermented food or probiotics. while the intestinal lactic microbiota is well-described knowledge on its routes of inoculation and competitiveness towards selective pressure shaping  the intestinal microbiota is limited. in this study, lab were isolated from faecal samples of breast feeding mothers living in syria, from faeces of their infants, from breast milk as well as from fermented food, typically consumed in syria. a total of 700 isolates were characterized by genetic fingerprinting with  random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) and identified by comparative 16s rdna sequencing and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) analyses. thirty six different species of lactobacillus, enterococcus, streptococcus, weissella and pediococcus were identified. rapd and maldi-tof-ms patterns allowed comparison of the lactic microbiota on species and strain level. whereas some species were unique for one  source, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus brevis were found in all sources. interestingly, identical rapd genotypes of l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis and p. pentosaceus were found in the faeces of mothers, her milk and in faeces of her babies. diversity of rapd types found in food versus human samples suggests the importance of host factors in colonization and individual host specificity, and support the hypothesis that there is a vertical  transfer of intestinal lab from the mother's gut to her milk and through the milk to the infant's gut.

TI  == evaluation of different starter cultures (staphylococci plus lactic acid bacteria) in semi-ripened salami stuffed in swine gut.
AB  == the ripening properties were evaluated in semi-ripened pork salami started by different cultures: cxp (pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus xylosus and staphylococcus carnosus); rap (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, s. xylosus and s. carnosus); and gy2 (l. sakei, s. xylosus and s. carnosus). these starters were chosen by their technological activities: cxp (rapid acidifying); rap (medium acidifying); and gy2 (slow acidifying plus intense reddening-flavouring). salami was enhanced with ponceau 4r red and sodium glutamate, stuffed in pig gut and aged for 12 days at 15 degrees c/65-85%rh. dehydration, reddening, proteolysis, fat acidity and lipid oxidation were hardly  affected by the starters. acidification by lab strongly influenced the flavour. l. sakei plus l. plantarum provided a better flavouring than a low dose of l. sakei, and, especially, than over-acidifying p. pentosaceus. a final ph of 5 seems to be suitable for preventing aroma and taste defects in semi-ripened salami. spontaneous lactic microflora showed great acidifying potential.

TI  == robustness of lactobacillus plantarum starters during daily propagation of wheat  flour sourdough type i.
AB  == this study aimed at investigating the robustness of selected sourdough strains of lactobacillus plantarum. seven strains were singly used as sourdough type i starters under daily back-slopping propagation (ten days) using wheat flour. cell numbers of presumptive lactic acid bacteria varied slightly (median values of 9.13-9.46 log cfu g(-1)) between and within started sourdoughs, as well as the acidifying activity (median values of 1.24-1.33). after three days also the control sourdough (unstarted) had the same values. as shown by rapd-pcr analysis, five (db200, 3dm, g10c3, 12h1 and lp20) out of seven strains maintained elevated  cell numbers (ca. 9 log cfu g(-1)) throughout ten days. the other two strains progressively decreased to less than 5 log cfu g(-1). as identified by partial sequencing of 16s rrna and reca genes, l. plantarum (11 isolates), pediococci (7), lactobacillus casei (3) and lactobacillus rossiae (2) dominated the flour microbiota. monitoring of lactic acid bacteria during sourdough propagation was carried out by culture dependent approach and using pcr-dgge (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis). except for the sourdough started with l. plantarum lp20, in all other sourdoughs at least one autochthonous strain of l. plantarum emerged. all emerging strains of l. plantarum showed different rapd-pcr profiles. l. rossiae and pediococcus pentosaceus were only found in the control and sourdough  started with strain 12h1. the characterization of the catabolic profiles of sourdoughs (biolog system) showed that sourdoughs containing persistent starters  behaved similarly and their profiles were clearly differentiated from the others. one persistent strain (db200) of l. plantarum and lactobacillus sanfranciscensis  ls44, previously shown to be persistent (siragusa et al., 2009), were used as the mixed starter to produce a wheat flour sourdough. both strains cohabited and dominated during ten days of propagation.

TI  == community dynamics of bacteria in sourdough fermentations as revealed by their metatranscriptome.
AB  == the lactic acid bacterial (lab) community dynamics of two wheat and two spelt sourdough fermentations that were daily back-slopped were monitored during a period of 10 days by hybridizing time-related rna samples, representing the metatranscriptome, to an lab functional gene microarray. to indicate the species  present in each hybridized sample, annotation information for the 2,269 oligonucleotides on the microarray was used. the overall hybridization data revealed that after a transition phase of 5 days, in which atypical sourdough lab species, including enterococcus species, were found, a stabilized ecosystem was established with lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus fermentum as the dominating lab species. compared with the combined outcome of culture-dependent and culture-independent identification techniques, the microarray data revealed a functional role for lactococcus lactis in the early stage ecosystem and the dominance of pediococcus pentosaceus in most of the fermentations, besides l. plantarum and l. fermentum. consequently, metatranscriptome hybridization data obtained using an lab functional gene microarray was shown to be an interesting alternative to microbiological analysis of the community dynamics of complex food ecosystems.

AB  == we established a chelex 100-microwave method for the purification of bacterial genomic dna (gdna) in less than 20 min with high yield and good quality, useful for multiple purposes. it combines chelex 100, proteinase k, rnase a and heating  in a microwave oven. the resulting gdna was used directly to identify bacterial species of the order lactobacillales by means of pcr amplification of their 16s rdna gene, isolated from sediments on the yucatan peninsula, mexico. this method  produced gdna free of phenolic and protein residual contaminants from 100 of these isolated bacteria. 16s rdna amplification and sequencing showed pediococcus acidilactici to prevail in inland lagoons, and pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sp., and lactobacillus fermentum to be most abundant in the soils of livestock farms. the combination of chelex 100, enzymes and microwave heating used in the chelex 100-microwave method produced large amounts of highly pure gdna from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria,  in less than 20 min.

TI  == quorum sensing in sourdough lactobacillus plantarum dc400: induction of plantaricin a (plna) under co-cultivation with other lactic acid bacteria and effect of plna on bacterial and caco-2 cells.
AB  == this work aimed at showing the effect of pheromone plantaricin a (plna) by lactobacillus plantarum dc400 towards other sourdough lactic acid bacteria and the potential of plna to protect the function of the human intestinal barrier. growth and survival of sourdough lactic acid bacteria were differently affected by co-cultivation with l. plantarum dc400. compared to mono-cultures, lactobacillus sanfranciscensis dppma174 and pediococcus pentosaceus 2xa3 showed growth inhibition and decreased viability when co-cultured with l. plantarum dc400. l. sanfranciscensis dppma174 induced the highest synthesis of plna. survival of strain dppma174 only slightly varied by comparing the addition of plna to the culture medium and the co-cultivation with l. plantarum dc400. compared to mono-culture, the proteome of l. sanfranciscensis dppma174 grown in co-culture with l. plantarum dc400 showed the variation of expression of 58 proteins (47 over expressed and 11 repressed). thirty-four of them were also over expressed or repressed during growth of dppma174 with plna. fifty-one of the above 58 proteins were identified. they had a central role in stress response, amino acid, energy and nucleotide metabolisms, membrane transport, regulation of  transcription, and cell redox homeostasis. plna markedly increased the viability  of human caco-2/tc7 cells and the transepithelial electrical resistance.

TI  == gene cloning, expression, and characterization of phenolic acid decarboxylase from lactobacillus brevis rm84.
AB  == phenolic acid decarboxylase (pad) catalyzes the synthesis of vinyl phenols from hydroxycinnamic acids. the gene encoding pad from lactobacillus brevis was cloned and expressed as a fusion protein in escherichia coli. the recombinant pad enzyme is a heat-labile enzyme that functions optimally at 22 degrees c and ph 6.0. the  purified enzyme did not show thermostability at temperatures above 22 degrees c.  l. brevis pad is able to decarboxylate exclusively the hydroxycinnamic acids, such as p-coumaric, caffeic, and ferulic acids, with k (m) values of 0.98, 0.96,  and 0.78 mm, respectively. the substrate specificity exhibited by l. brevis pad is similar to the pad isolated from bacillus subtilis and b. pumilus, but different from that of l. plantarum and pediococcus pentosaceus. as the c-terminal region may be involved in determining pad substrate specificity and catalytic capacity, amino acid differences among these proteins could explain the differences observed. the substrate specificity shown by l. brevis pad shows promise for the synthesis of high-added value products from plant wastes.

TI  == coculture with specific bacteria enhances survival of lactobacillus plantarum nc8, an autoinducer-regulated bacteriocin producer, in olive fermentations.
AB  == bacteriocin production in lactobacillus plantarum nc8 is activated by coculture with specific bacteriocin production-inducing bacterial strains. the system is further regulated by a three-component regulatory system involving a specific autoinducer peptide (plnc8if). we have used l. plantarum nc8 as a starter culture in spanish-style green olive fermentations and examined the influence of coculturing in its survival. we found that l. plantarum nc8 greatly enhanced its  growth and survival in the olive fermentations when co-inoculated with two specific bacteriocin-production inducing strains, i.e. enterococcus faecium 6t1a-20 and pediococcus pentosaceus fbb63, when compared to singly-inoculated fermentations. in addition, a constitutive bacteriocin-producer nc8-derivative strain was used as a control in the olive fermentations and showed also better viability than the parental nc8 strain. our results suggest the involvement of bacteriocin production in the viability enhancement found in both cases. we postulate that the presence of specific bacteria is recognized by l. plantarum nc8 as an environmental stimulus to switch a specific adaptive response on, most  probably involving bacteriocin production. the design of novel bacteriocin-producing starter cultures for food fermentations should consider their constitutive versus regulated character.

TI  == evaluation of lactic acid bacteria for sourdough fermentation of amaranth.
AB  == spontaneous fermented sourdoughs prepared from five amaranth flours were investigated for the presence of lactic acid bacteria predominating the autochthonous microbiota and thus may be suitable as starter cultures. the doughs were fermented with daily back-slopping on a laboratory scale at 30 degrees c for 10 days. each day, ph-values and total titratable acidity degrees were determined and samples were analyzed for lactic acid bacteria and yeasts by cultural methods. the identity of the strains was tracked with randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr during fermentation. taxonomic identity of the strains was revealed by sequence analysis of 16s rdna. sugar and organic acid profiles of fermented doughs were determined with hplc. the strains lactobacillus plantarum rta12, l. sakei rta14, and pediococcus pentosaceus rta11 were selected and applied as starters in laboratory scale fermentations. all strains were predominant in repeated experiments, both as single strains and in combination, regardless of the amaranth flour used. the competitiveness of the strains l. plantarum rta12 and p. pentosaceus rta11 was characterized in further growth experiments. both strains facilitated fast declines of ph-values, overgrew the autochthonous microbiota, and allowed stable fermentation characteristics at different temperatures. thus, the characterized strains may be considered as candidates for amaranth sourdough starter cultures.

TI  == biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in french wheat sourdough as determined by molecular characterization using species-specific pcr.
AB  == the lactic acid microflora of nine traditional wheat sourdoughs from the midi-pyrenees area (south western france) was previously isolated and preliminary characterized using conventional morphological and biochemical analysis. however, such phenotypic methods alone are not always reliable and have a low taxonomic resolution for identification of lactic acid bacteria species. in the present study, a total of 290 lab isolates were identified by pcr amplification using different sets of specific primers in order to provide a thorough characterization of the lactic flora from these traditional french sourdoughs. overall, the lab isolates belonged to 6 genera: lactobacillus (39%, 8 species), pediococcus (38%, 1 species), leuconostoc (17%, 2 species), weissella (4%, 2 species), lactococcus (1%, 1 species) and enterococcus (<1%, 1 species) and 15 different species were detected: l. plantarum, l. curvatus, l. paracasei, l. sanfranciscensis, l. pentosus, l. paraplantarum, l. sakei, l. brevis, p. pentosaceus, l. mesenteroides, l. citreum, w. cibaria, w. confusa, l. lactis and  e. hirae. facultative heterofermentative lab represent more than 76% of the total isolates, the main species isolated herein correspond to l. plantarum and p. pentosaceus. obligate heterofermentative lactobacilli (l. sanfranciscencis, l. brevis) represent less than 3% of the total isolates whereas leuconostoc and weissella species represent 21% of the total isolates and have been detected in eight of the nine samples. detection of some lab species was preferentially observed depending on the isolation culture medium. the number of different species within a sourdough varies from 3 to 7 and original associations of hetero- and homofermentative lab species have been revealed. results from this study clearly confirm the diversity encountered in the microbial community of traditional sourdough and highlight the importance of lab cocci in the sourdough  ecosystem, along with lactobacilli.

TI  == probiotics, critical illness, and methodologic bias.
AB  == it has been proposed that probiotics can favorably influence the course of critically ill patients. to address this question, a limited systematic review was undertaken (medline search for articles published in english) to identify randomized, controlled trials that compared a group of critically ill patients taking probiotics with a group that did not. ten such trials, mostly with high risks of methodologic bias, were identified. when the data were combined, the probiotics did not appear to influence mortality or duration of hospitalization.  however, the recipients of the probiotics had fewer infectious episodes (absolute risk difference-21%). this effect was seen particularly in trials employing one combination of probiotic agents (pediococcus pentosaceus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum). unfortunately,  this effect may be overly optimistic, as methodologic shortcomings could have introduced biases into the trials. three trials of patients with severe acute pancreatitis were not included in this primary analysis because not all of the patients were in the intensive care unit. the largest of these, and the one with  the lowest risk of bias, demonstrated that probiotics increased mortality, in part because of the precipitation of ischemic bowel disease (in patients who were also receiving postpyloric enteral nutrition infusions). probiotics also appeared to reduce the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in hospitalized patients, although these trials did not specifically focus only on those who were critically ill. in summary, it is not clear that probiotics are beneficial (and they may even be harmful) in the critically ill patient group.

AB  == four types of sourdoughs (l, c, b, q) from artisanal bakeries in northern italy were studied using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. in all samples, the yeast numbers ranged from 160 to 10(7)cfu/g, and the numbers of lactic acid bacteria (lab) ranged from 10(3) to 10(9)cfu/g. the isolated lab were sequenced, and a similarity was noted between two samples (c, q), both in terms of the species that were present and in terms of the percentage of isolates. in these two samples, lactobacillus plantarum accounted for 73% and 89% of the bacteria, and lactobacillus brevis represented 27% and 11%. in the third sample (b), however, the dominant lab isolate was lb. brevis (73%), while lb. plantarum  accounted for only 27%. the fourth sourdough (l) was completely different from the others. in this sample, the most prominent isolate was weisella cibaria (56%), followed by lb. plantarum (36%) and pediococcus pentosaceus (8%). in three out of four samples (l, c and q), all of the yeasts isolated were identified as saccharomyces cerevisiae, yet only candida humilis (90%) and candida milleri (10%) were isolated in the fourth sample (b). the microbial ecology of the sourdoughs was also examined with direct methods. the results obtained by culture-independent methods and dgge analysis underline a partial correspondence  between the dna and rna analysis. these results demonstrate the importance of using a combined analytical approach to explore the microbial communities of sourdoughs.

TI  == effect of applying molasses or inoculants containing homofermentative or heterofermentative bacteria at two rates on the fermentation and aerobic stability of corn silage.
AB  == this study determined how the fermentation and aerobic stability of corn silage are affected by treatment with molasses or 2 dual-purpose inoculants applied at or above the recommended rate. corn forage (dekalb 69-70) was harvested at 39% dry matter (dm) and ensiled after treatment with no additives (control, con), molasses (mol), buchneri 500 inoculant, or pioneer 11c33 inoculant. molasses was  applied at 3% of forage dm. buchneri 500 was applied at the recommended rate of 8 mg/kg fresh forage to supply 1 x 10(5) cfu/g of pediococcus pentosaceus 12455 and 4 x 10(5) cfu/g of lactobacillus buchneri 40788 (bb) or at twice the recommended  rate (dbb). pioneer 11c33 inoculant was applied at the recommended rate of 1.1 mg/kg fresh forage to supply 1 x 10(5) cfu/g of a mixture of lactobacillus plantarum, l. buchneri, and enteroccocus faecium (pn) or at twice the recommended rate (dpn). each treatment was applied in quadruplicate and the treated forages were ensiled within 20-l mini silos for 135 d at 18 to 35 degrees c. molasses-treated silages had greater ash and starch concentrations than con silages and greater lactate and ethanol concentrations than other silages. like con silages, mol silages had high yeast counts (>10(5) cfu/g); consequently, they deteriorated within 30 h as shown by temperature increase. inoculant-treated silages had lower lactate to acetate ratios than con or mol silages largely because they had greater acetate concentrations. consequently, all inoculant-treated silages had fewer yeasts (<10(5) cfu/g) and were more stable (>30 h) than con and mol silages. when applied at recommended rates, pn and bb had similar effects on silage chemical composition, fermentation, fungal counts,  and aerobic stability, except for a lower lactate concentration in pn silages. concentrations of vfa, and nh(3)-n, ph, and extent of aerobic stability were similar for pn, dpn, bb, and dbb silages. however, lactate concentration was greater in dpn than in pn. in conclusion, mol application increased ethanol and lactate concentration and did not improve aerobic stability. both dual-purpose inoculants made the fermentation more heterolactic and thereby improved the aerobic stability of corn silage. doubling the rate of application of either inoculant did not further improve fermentation or aerobic stability.

TI  == functionality of lactic acid bacteria peptidase activities in the hydrolysis of gliadin-like fragments.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the role of the peptidase activities from sourdough lactic acid bacteria (lab) in the degradation of alpha-gliadin fragments. methods and results: different proline-containing substrates were hydrolysed by lab indicating pro-specific peptidase activities. lactobacillus plantarum crl 775 and pediococcus pentosaceus crl 792 displayed the highest tri- and di-peptidase activities, respectively. lactobacillus plantarum strains hydrolysed more than 60%alpha-gliadin fragments corresponding to the 31-43 and 62-75 amino acids in the protein after 2 h. none of the lab strains alone could hydrolyse 57-89 alpha-gliadin peptide; however, the combination of l. plantarum crl 775 and p. pentosaceus crl 792 led to hydrolysis (57%) of this peptide in 8 h. conclusions:  the capacity of lab strains to degrade alpha-gliadin fragments was not correlated to individual peptidase activities. several strains separately degraded the 31-43 and 62-75 alpha-gliadin fragments, while the 57-89 peptide degradation was associated with the combination of peptidase profiles from pooled lab strains. this is the first report on the peptide hydrolase system of sourdough pediococci  and its ability to reduce alpha-gliadin fragments. significance and impact of the study: this study contributes to a better knowledge of sourdough lab proteolytic  system and its role in the degradation of proline-rich alpha-gliadin peptides involved in celiac disease.

TI  == molecular screening of wine lactic acid bacteria degrading hydroxycinnamic acids.
AB  == the potential to produce volatile phenols from hydroxycinnamic acids was investigated for lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from spanish grape must and  wine. a pcr assay was developed for the detection of lab that potentially produce volatile phenols. synthetic degenerate oligonucleotides for the specific detection of the pdc gene encoding a phenolic acid decarboxylase were designed. the pdc pcr assay amplifies a 321 bp dna fragment from phenolic acid decarboxylase. the pdc pcr method was applied to 85 strains belonging to the 6 main wine lab species. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and pediococcus pentosaceus strains produce a positive response in the pdc pcr assay, whereas oenococcus oeni, lactobacillus hilgardii, and leuconostoc mesenteroides strains did not produce the expected pcr product. the production of vinyl and ethyl derivatives from hydroxycinnamic acids in culture media was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. a relationship was found between pdc pcr  amplification and volatile phenol production, so that the lab strains that gave a positive pdc pcr response produce volatile phenols, whereas strains that did not  produce a pcr amplicon did not produce volatile phenols. the proposed method could be useful for a preliminary identification of lab strains able to produce volatile phenols in wine.

TI  == taxonomic structure and monitoring of the dominant population of lactic acid bacteria during wheat flour sourdough type i propagation using lactobacillus sanfranciscensis starters.
AB  == the structure and stability of the dominant lactic acid bacterium population were assessed during wheat flour sourdough type i propagation by using singly nine strains of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis. under back-slopping propagation with wheat flour type 0 f114, cell numbers of presumptive lactic acid bacteria varied  slightly between and within starters. as determined by randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr and restriction endonuclease analysis-pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analyses, only three (ls8, ls14, and ls44) starters dominated throughout 10 days of propagation. the others progressively decreased to less than 3 log cfu g(-1). partial sequence analysis of the 16s rrna and reca genes and pcr-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis analysis using the rpob gene allowed identification of weissella confusa, lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rossiae, lactobacillus brevis, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus, and lactobacillus spp. as the dominant species of the raw wheat flour. at the end of propagation, one autochthonous strain of l. sanfranciscensis was found in all the sourdoughs. except for l. brevis, strains of the above species were variously found in the mature sourdoughs. persistent starters were found in association with other biotypes of l. sanfranciscensis and with w. confusa or l. plantarum. sourdoughs were characterized for acidification, quotient of fermentation, free amino acids, and community-level catabolic profiles by using biolog 96-well eco microplates. in particular, catabolic profiles of sourdoughs containing persistent starters behaved similarly and were clearly differentiated from the others. the three persistent starters were further used for the production of sourdoughs and propagated by using another wheat flour whose lactic acid bacterium population in part differed from the previous one. also, in this case all three starter strains persisted during propagation.

TI  == microbial diversity of traditional vietnamese alcohol fermentation starters (banh men) as determined by pcr-mediated dgge.
AB  == the diversity of fungi and bacteria associated with traditional vietnamese alcohol fermentation starters (banh men) was investigated by pcr-mediated dgge. from 52 starter samples, 13 species of fungi (including yeasts) and 23 species of bacteria were identified. the fungal composition of the starters was consistent with little variation among samples. it consisted of amylase producers (rhizopus  oryzae, r. microsporus, absidia corymbifera, amylomyces sp., saccharomycopsis fibuligera), ethanol producers (saccharomyces cerevisiae, issatchenkia sp., pichia anomala, candida tropicalis, p. ranongensis, clavispora lusitaniae), and (opportunistic) contaminants (xeromyces bisporus, botryobasidium subcoronatum). the bacterial microflora of starters was highly variable in species composition and dominated by lactic acid bacteria (lab). the most frequent lab were pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus plantarum, l. brevis, weissella confusa, and w. paramesenteroides. species of amylase-producing bacillus (bacillus subtilis, b. circulans, b. amyloliquefaciens, b. sporothermodurans), acetic acid  bacteria (acetobacter orientalis, a. pasteurianus), and plant pathogens/environment contaminants (burkholderia ubonensis, ralstonia solanacearum, pelomonas puraquae) were also detected. fungal dgge was found to be useful for evaluating starter type and starter quality. moreover, in view of the  high biological diversity of these substrates, bacterial dgge may be useful in determining the identity of a starter. the constant occurrence of opportunistic contaminants highlights the need for careful examination of the role of individual components in starters.

TI  == the effect of probiotics and organic acids on shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in shiga-toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for stec. shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and  hemolytic uremic syndrome. stec possesses shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and shiga toxin 2  (stx2), both of which have a and b subunits. although stec containing both stx1 and stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. thus, the effect of lactobacillus, pediococcus, and bifidobacterium strains on stx2a expression levels in stec was investigated. lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included l. rhamnosus gg, l. curvatus, l. plantarum, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. reuteri, p. acidilactici, p. cerevisiae, p. pentosaceus, b. thermophilum, b. boum, b. suis and b. animalis. e. coli o157:h7 (edl 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. following rna extraction and cdna synthesis, relative stx2a mrna levels were determined according to a comparative  critical threshold (ct) real-time pcr. data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and the level of stx2a expression between treated and untreated stec was compared. observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2a was down-regulated, when compared to the control  culture. probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in  ph, influenced stx2a gene expression.

AB  == the diversity of populations of yeast and lactic acid bacteria (lab) in pig feeds fermented at 10, 15, or 20 degrees c was characterized by rrna gene sequencing of isolates. the feeds consisted of a cereal grain mix blended with wet wheat distillers' grains (wwdg feed), whey (w feed), or tap water (wat feed). fermentation proceeded for 5 days without disturbance, followed by 14 days of daily simulated feed outtakes, in which 80% of the contents were replaced with fresh feed mixtures. in wwdg feed, pichia galeiformis became the dominant yeast species, independent of the fermentation temperature and feed change. the lab population was dominated by pediococcus pentosaceus at the start of the fermentation period. after 3 days, the lactobacillus plantarum population started to increase in feeds at all temperatures. the diversity of lab increased after the addition of fresh feed components. in w feed, kluyveromyces marxianus dominated, but after the feed change, the population diversity increased. with increasing fermentation temperatures, there was a shift toward pichia membranifaciens as the dominant species. l. plantarum was the most prevalent lab  in w feed. the wat feed had a diverse microbial flora, and the yeast population changed throughout the whole fermentation period. pichia anomala was the most prevalent yeast species, with increasing occurrence at higher fermentation temperatures. pediococcus pentosaceus was the most prevalent lab, but after the feed change, l. plantarum started to proliferate. the present study demonstrates  that the species composition in fermented pig feed may vary considerably, even if viable cell counts indicate stable microbial populations.

TI  == method for reliable isolation of lactobacillus sakei strains originating from tunisian seafood and meat products.
AB  == in tunisia, several food products derived from meat or seafood are naturally processed, without any addition of bacterial starters. such fermented, dried-cured, salted, or marinated products, as well as the raw meat or fish may thus provide a source to isolate the natural microflora colonizing such environments. we isolated lactic acid bacteria from a representative range of flesh-foods sold or manufactured in different parts of tunisia, and selectively searched for lactobacillus sakei, a lactic acid bacterium potentially useful as starter or protective culture. eighty six (86) strains were isolated from various seafood (anchovy, sardine, sole, mullet, and octopus), or meat (pork, veal, beef, sheep, chicken, and turkey) products that were either fresh, or transformed by different traditional processes. several methods were used in order to develop a  rapid and reliable protocol for the direct identification of l. sakei. amplified  ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra) classified the various isolates into 9 distinct groups. search for the presence of the l. sakei specific kata gene indicated that all positive isolates were grouped in the same ardra group. sequencing of 16s rdna confirmed those isolates as l. sakei. those 22 different l. sakei strains represent 25.6% of the total isolates, while other isolates found in the different ardra groups were tentatively ascribed to lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis/garviae, enterococcus avium, streptococcus parauberis, hafnia alvei, pediococcus pentosaceus, and lactobacillus curvatus through 16s rdna sequencing. a fast and reliable method to isolate and discriminate l. sakei from complex food environments is proposed.

TI  == glucan and fructan production by sourdough weissella cibaria and lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == after a large screening on sourdough lactic acid bacteria, exopolysaccharide (eps)-forming strains of weissella cibaria, lactobacillus plantarum, and pediococcus pentosaceus were selected. after 6 days of incubation at 30 degrees c, the synthesis of eps in mrs-based broth ranged from 5.54 to 7.88 mg ml-1. eps  had an apparent molecular mass of ca. 104 da. as shown by carbohydrate consumption, the synthesis of eps was found from sucrose only. two types of homopolysaccharides were synthesized: glucans simultaneously with growth and fructans after 1 day of incubation. two protein bands of ca. 180-200 kda were in  situ detected on sds-page gels incubated with sucrose. pcr products of ca. 220 bp were found for l. plantarum pl9 (100% of identity to putative priming glycosyltransferase of l. plantarum wcfs1) and w. cibaria wc4 (80% of identity to putative glycosyltransferase, epsd, of bacillus cereus g9241) by using hybrid primers for the priming gtf genes. degenerated primers dexreur and dexreuv showed a unique pcr product, and the predicted amino acid sequences were identical for w. cibaria wc4 and l. plantarum pl9. the sequence had similarity with polysaccharide biosynthesis glycosyltransferases. w. cibaria wc4 or l. plantarum  lp9 synthesized ca. 2.5 g kg-1 eps during sourdough fermentation with sucrose added. compared to the sourdough started with an eps-negative strain, the sourdough started with w. cibaria wc4 or l. plantarum lp9 increased the viscosity, and the resulting bread had higher specific volume and lower firmness. the synthesis of eps by selected sourdough lactic acid bacteria could be considered as a useful tool to replace the additives for improving the textural properties of baked goods.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of non-enterococcal intrinsic glycopeptide-resistant gram-positive organisms.
AB  == non-enterococcal gram-positive bacteria that are intrinsically vancomycin-resistant have been infrequently isolated in association with serious  infections. however, well-documented infections have lately been reported with increasing frequency. because these organisms may be pathogens, we tested the mics of 19 antimicrobial agents by the agar dilution method for predicting susceptibility. the activity of these antimicrobial agents was assessed against 28 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 6; lactobacillus acidophilus, 1; lactobacillus casei, 1; lactobacillus fermentum, 2; lactobacillus brevis, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1; weissella confusa, 2; leuconostoc mesenteroides, 7; leuconostoc lactis, 4; pediococcus acidilactici, 2; pediococcus pentosaceus, 1),  isolated from clinical specimens in an argentinian university hospital from 1997  to 2003. the mics of penicillin for 67% of the lactobacillus strains and 100% of  the leuconostoc spp. and pediococcus spp. strains tested were in the 0.25-2 microg/ml range. erythromycin was the most active antimicrobial overall. multiresistance was observed in 2 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1).

TI  == assessment of antibiotic susceptibility within lactic acid bacteria strains isolated from wine.
AB  == susceptibility to 12 antibiotics was tested in 75 unrelated lactic acid bacteria  strains of wine origin of the following species: 38 lactobacillus plantarum, 3 lactobacillus hilgardii, 2 lactobacillus paracasei, 1 lactobacillus sp, 21 oenococcus oeni, 4 pediococcus pentosaceus, 2 pediococcus parvulus, 1 pediococcus acidilactici, and 3 leuconostoc mesenteroides. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of the different antibiotics that inhibited 50% of the strains of  the lactobacillus, leuconostoc and pediococcus genera were, respectively, the following ones: penicillin (2, < or =0.5, and < or =0.5 microg/ml), erythromycin  (< or =0.5 microg/ml), chloramphenicol (4 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (64, 8, and 128 microg/ml), vancomycin (> or =128 microg/ml), tetracycline (8, 2, and 8 microg/ml), streptomycin (256, 32, and 512 microg/ml), gentamicin (64, 4, and 128 microg/ml), kanamycin (256, 64, and 512 microg/ml), sulfamethoxazole (> or =1024  microg/ml), and trimethoprim (16 microg/ml). all 21 o. oeni showed susceptibility to erythromycin, tetracycline, rifampicin and chloramphenicol, and exhibited resistance to aminoglycosides, vancomycin, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, that could represent intrinsic resistance. differences were observed among the o. oeni strains with respect to penicillin or ciprofloxacin susceptibility. antibiotic resistance genes were studied by pcr and sequencing, and the following genes were detected: erm(b) (one p. acidilactici), tet(m) (one l. plantarum), tet(l) (one p. parvulus), aac(6')-aph(2") (four l. plantarum, one p. parvulus, one p. pentosaceus and two o. oeni), ant(6) (one l. plantarum, and two p. parvulus), and aph(3')-iiia (one l. plantarum and one o. oeni). this is the first time, to our knowledge, that ant(6), aph(3')-iiia and tet(l) genes are found in lactobacillus and pediococcus strains and antimicrobial resistance genes are reported in o. oeni strains.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum and pediococcus pentosaceus starter cultures as a tool for microflora management in malting and for enhancement of malt processability.
AB  == lactobacillus plantarum vtt e-78076 (e76) and pediococcus pentosaceus vtt e-90390 (e390) starter cultures were added to the steeping water of normal malting barley in order to balance the microbial community and to enhance malt processability. in this study, we also investigated the effects of lactic acid-acidified mrs-spent medium (mrs-la) on malting performance. malting trials with five different two-row barley varieties were carried out in 25 kg pilot scale. the starter cultures promoted yeast growth during malting and restricted the growth of harmful bacteria and fusarium fungi. furthermore, they had positive effects on malt characteristics. reduction in wort viscosity and beta-glucan content and enhanced xylanase and microbial beta-glucanase activities were observed. starter  cultures notably improved lautering performance. some of the beneficial effects were due to the lactic acid and low ph, as similar effects were obtained with mrs-la. starter cultures offer a tool for tailoring of malt properties.

TI  == fermentation of wheat: effects of backslopping different proportions of pre-fermented wheat on the microbial and chemical composition.
AB  == the objective of the study was to examine effect of backslop on the chemical and  microbiological characteristics of fermented wheat (fw). coarsely ground wheat was mixed with water (1:3 wt/wt) and inoculated with 6 log cfu ml(-1) each of an  overnight culture of lactobacillus plantarum and pediococcus pentosaceus. four fermentation treatments were conducted in 45 1, closed, pvc containers over 48 hours. three treatments investigated the benefits of the addition of previously fermented wheat (backslopping, bsl) at different proportions (0.20, 0.33 or 0.42  kg) to freshly prepared wheat. the control treatment contained no addition of bsl. elimination of coliforms from the fw within 48 h was only achieved through backslopping; where coliform bacteria counts decreased from approximately 6.5 log10 cfu ml(-1) to less than 3 log10 cfu ml(-1). there was no apparent advantage in increasing the backslop proportion above 0.20. however, the exclusion of coliform bacteria required the ph to remain below 4.0 for at a minimum of 24 h. the results of these studies indicate that fermentation of wheat has the potential to reduce the risk of feed-borne colibacillosis and provides a practical alternative to producers that cannot ferment multiple diets or have limited fermentation capacity.

TI  == behaviour of the constitutive biota of two types of spanish dry-sausages ripened  in a pilot-scale chamber.
AB  == the behaviour of the constitutive biota in eighty four samples belonging to two different types of spanish dry-cured sausages during the ripening process in a pilot-scale chamber was investigated. samples were analyzed in three stages during production: fresh product, first drying stage and finished product. lactic acid bacteria (lab) and coagulase-negative cocci (cnc) were identified by the api system. in general, evolution of lab and cnc during the ripening process of spanish dry-cured sausages increased during the first days after which numbers of these organisms remained stable. pediococcus pentosaceus and staphylococcus xylosus, were the dominant species. lactobacillus plantarum, staphylococcus saprophyticus staphylococcus simulans and kocuria varians were also present. the  results obtained show that the ripening process in a pilot-scale chamber under controlled conditions contributes to a more homogeneous behaviour of the constitutive biota, in comparison with commercial production standards.

AB  == aims: to evaluate the growth and metabolic activity of lactobacilli and pediococci strains in a gluten base medium (gbm), formulated for a proper selection of proteolytic strains to be used in sourdough fermentation. methods and results: proteolytic activity by lactic acid bacteria (lab) was evaluated by  sds-page and by the amino acids released determined by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. only 13 lab (nine lactobacilli and four pediococci), among the 42 evaluated were able to utilize gluten as nitrogen source and to grow in gbm. pediococcus pentosaceus crl 797 showed a similar proteolytic activity to lactobacilli strains. in the majority of the cultures, basic amino acid group increased (c. 80% after 12 h incubation) mainly due to the release of ornithine, a flavour precursor of bread. lysine, a limiting essential  amino acid in wheat flour, increased by 150% in cultures of p. pentosaceus crl 797. conclusions: this study allows selecting p. pentosaceus crl 797 and l. plantarum crl 759 as potential starter culture for type iii sourdough fermentation. it is shown for the first time that pediococci strains isolated from sourdough are proteolytically active on gluten. significance and impact of the study: the physiological studies on gluten breakdown by lab will contribute to the better selection of strains to produce breads with enhanced organoleptic characteristics.

TI  == microbiological study of lactic acid fermentation of caper berries by molecular and culture-dependent methods.
AB  == fermentation of capers (the fruits of capparis sp.) was studied by molecular and  culture-independent methods. a lactic acid fermentation occurred following immersion of caper berries in water, resulting in fast acidification and development of the organoleptic properties typical of this fermented food. a collection of 133 isolates obtained at different times of fermentation was reduced to 75 after randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis. isolates were identified by pcr or 16s rrna gene sequencing as lactobacillus plantarum (37 isolates), lactobacillus paraplantarum (1 isolate), lactobacillus pentosus (5 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (9 isolates), lactobacillus fermentum (6 isolates), pediococcus pentosaceus (14 isolates), pediococcus acidilactici (1  isolate), and enterococcus faecium (2 isolates). cluster analysis of rapd-pcr patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among lactobacilli (with four major  groups and five subgroups), while pediococci clustered in two closely related groups. a culture-independent analysis of fermentation samples by temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis (ttge) also indicated that l. plantarum is the predominant species in this fermentation, in agreement with culture-dependent results. the distribution of l. brevis and l. fermentum in samples was also determined by ttge, but identification of pediococcus at the species level was not possible. ttge also allowed a more precise estimation of the distribution of  e. faecium, and the detection of enterococcus casseliflavus (which was not revealed by the culture-dependent analysis). results from this study indicate that complementary data from molecular and culture-dependent analysis provide a more accurate determination of the microbial community dynamics during caper fermentation.

AB  == real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) was used to quantify seven species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in alfalfa silage prepared in the presence or absence of four commercial inoculants and in uninoculated corn stover harvested and stored under a variety of field conditions. species-specific pcr primers were designed based on reca gene sequences. commercial inoculants improved the quality of alfalfa silage, but species corresponding to those in the inoculants displayed variations in persistence over the next 96 h. lactobacillus brevis was the most abundant lab (12 to 32% of total sample dna) in all of the alfalfa silages by 96  h. modest populations (up to 10%) of lactobacillus plantarum were also observed in inoculated silages. pediococcus pentosaceus populations increased over time but did not exceed 2% of the total. small populations (0.1 to 1%) of lactobacillus buchneri and lactococcus lactis were observed in all silages, while lactobacillus pentosus and enterococcus faecium were near or below detection limits. corn stover generally displayed higher populations of l. plantarum and l. brevis and lower populations of other lab species. the data illustrate the utility of rt-pcr for quantifying individual species of lab in conserved forages  prepared under a wide variety of conditions.

TI  == nucleotide sequence, structural organization and host range of prs4, a small cryptic pediococcus pentosaceus plasmid that contains two cassettes commonly found in other lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the complete nucleotide sequence of the cryptic plasmid prs4 (3550 bp) from pediococcus pentosaceus rs4 was determined. sequence analysis revealed the presence of three open reading frames (orfs). the putative protein coded by orf 1 showed 93% identity with the mobilization protein of lactobacillus casei plasmid  plc88 and 94% identity with a sequenced fragment of the mobilization protein of p. damnosus plasmid pf8801, suggesting a common origin for these three mobilization proteins. the putative protein coded by orf 2 showed 92% identity with the replication protein of l. plantarum plasmid pwcfs101, a plasmid that replicates via the rolling circle (rc) mechanism, suggesting a similar replication mechanism for prs4. supporting this hypothesis, a putative double strand origin (dso) and a region with palindromic sequences that could function as single strand origin (sso), were detected in prs4. a function could not be assigned to orf 3. since orf 1 exhibits high identity with l. casei plasmid plc88 but lower identity (58%) with other lactobacillus plasmids, and orf 2 exhibits high identity with the l. plantarum plasmid pwcfs101 but lower identity (55-58%)  with other lactobacillus plasmids (including plc88), two independent cassettes, from different sources, seem to be involved in the structure of prs4. plasmids derived from prs4 containing the chloramphenicol resistance gene were successfully electrotransformed in l. plantarum, l. casei, p. pentosaceus, and pediococcus acidilactici, suggesting that prs4 could be used as a cloning vector  for lactic acid bacteria. to our knowledge prs4 is the first rc-replicating plasmid of p. pentosaceus that has been completely sequenced and used as cloning  vector.

TI  == cloning, deletion, and characterization of padr, the transcriptional repressor of the phenolic acid decarboxylase-encoding pada gene of lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == lactobacillus plantarum displays a substrate-inducible pada gene encoding a phenolic acid decarboxylase enzyme (pada) that is considered a specific chemical  stress response to the inducing substrate. the putative regulator of pada was located in the pada locus based on its 52% identity with padr, the pada gene transcriptional regulator of pediococcus pentosaceus (l. barthelmebs, b. lecomte, c. divies, and j.-f. cavin, j. bacteriol. 182:6724-6731, 2000). deletion of the l. plantarum padr gene clearly demonstrates that the protein it encodes is the transcriptional repressor of divergently oriented pada. the padr gene is cotranscribed with a downstream open reading frame (orf1), the product of which may belong to a group of universal stress proteins (usp). the padr deletion mutant overexpressed pada constitutively, and the pada promoter appears to be tightly regulated in this bacterium. gel mobility shift assays using the pada gene promoter region and purified padr expressed in escherichia coli indicated that operator dna binding by padr was not eliminated by addition of p-coumarate.  gel mobility shift assays using partially purified extracts of native padr protein from both phenolic acid-induced and noninduced l. plantarum cells demonstrate that inactivation of padr by phenolic acids requires the integrity of l. plantarum and mediation by a specific protein absent in e. coli.

AB  == a total of 77 tannase producing lactobacilli strains isolated from human feces or fermented foods were examined for their genotypic profiles and intensities of tannase production. with a pcr-based assay targeting reca gene, all strains except one isolate were assigned to either lactobacillus plantarum, l. paraplantarum, or l. pentosus whereas a 16/23s rdna targeted pcr-based assay identified all except 6 isolates (inclusive of the above one isolate) as one of the closely related species. subsequent dna/dna hybridization assays revealed that these 6 exceptional isolates showed low homology (between 1.2% and 55.8% relative dna binding) against type strains of the three species. supplemental carbohydrate fermentation profiles on the 6 isolates indicated that two of them were identified as l. acidophilus, one as pediococcus acidilactici, one as p. pentosaceus, and two remained unidentifiable. the evidence suggests that the 16/23s rdna targeted pcr assay can be used as a reliable identification tool for  the closely related lactobacilli, and that the tannase gene is widely distributed within members of the lactobacillaceae family. meanwhile, a randomly amplified polymorphism dna (rapd) analysis revealed that all except 8 isolates were well allocated in 4 major rapd clusters, though not species specific, consisting of two l. plantarum predominant clusters, one l. paraplantarum predominant, and one  l. pentosus predominant. the rapd patterns of the 8 non-clustered isolates, which consisted of the 6 unidentifiable isolates and 2 isolates identified as l. pentosus, were <40% similarity to those belonging to the 4 clusters. a quantitative assay of the tannase activities showed that there was a marked variation in the activities among the strains, which did not correlate with either species identification or clustering by rapd.

TI  == two distinct pathways for the formation of hydroxy fa from linoleic acid by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == twenty-three of 86 strains of lactic acid bacteria transformed linoleic acid into hydroxy fa. two distinct conversion pathways were in operation. two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of pediococcus pentosaceus produced 13(s)-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid 113(s)-oh 18:11 and 10,13dihydroxyoctadecanoic  acid (10,13-oh 18:0) as main and minor products, respectively, whereas 13 strains, including l. casei subsp. casei, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. lactis subsp. cremoris, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus produced 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid (10-oh 18:1). seven strains of l. plantarum converted linoleic acid to 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10-oh 18:0) through 10-oh 18:1. linoleic acid at 2 g/l was converted by l. acidophilus  ifo13951t to 1.3 g of 13(s)-oh 18:1 and 0.09 g of 10,13-oh 18:0 in 7 d. lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei jcm 1111 produced 10-oh 18:1 in 91% yield, and l. plantarum jcm 8341, 10-oh 18:0 in 59% yield from linoleic acid (2 g/l) under optimal conditions. to our knowledge, this is the first report on the  production of 13(s)-oh 18:1 by lactic acid bacteria other than ruminal bacteria,  and of 10,13-oh 18:0 by any bacteria.

TI  == the effects of using lactic acid bacteria inoculants in maize silage on the formation of biogenic amines.
AB  == silages from five ripened varieties of silage maize with dry matter contents ranging between 275 and 410 g/kg were prepared in five laboratory experiments. whole-plant maize was fermented at 22 degrees c and silages were then stored at the same temperature for 4 months. spontaneously fermented silages were prepared  as control variants and compared with silages inoculated with commercial strains  of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobzcillus buchneri and a mixed preparation microsil containing l. plantarum, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium and pediococcus pentosaceus. the starter cultures were applied at doses 5 x 10(5) and 5 x 10(6) cfu/g of chopped maize. seven biogenic amines and polyamines were extracted from silages with perchloric acid and determined as n-benzamides by micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography. common chemical criteria of silage quality were also determined. all three inoculants, mainly at the higher dose, decreased significantly contents of tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine, three undesirable amines occurring at the highest levels. l. plantarum was the most effective. contents of histamine and tryptamine were low in all experimental silages. also relatively low were levels of polyamines spermidine and mainly of spermine.

TI  == proteolytic activities in togwa, a tanzanian fermented food.
AB  == proteolytic activities were investigated in sorghum-based togwa prepared by natural fermentation and using starter cultures previously isolated from the native product, i.e., lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, and issatchenkia orientalis in coculture with either l. brevis or l. plantarum. both  proteinase and aminopeptidase activities were substantially higher in naturally fermented togwa than in those with starters (14-30%, 12-70%, respectively). a variable but substantial part of the proteinase activity followed the particulate fraction of togwa; aminopeptidase activity was mainly in that fraction. the breakdown of relatively high molecular mass protein (64 kda) in togwa was detected by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page); the products were mainly in the 14-30 kda range. reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography (rp-fplc)-protein/peptide patterns changed during fermentation with some variation between togwa of different cultures. supplementation of gruel with malt increased the concentration of total protein [from 9.5% to 11.0% (w/w) on dry weight basis)] and of most of the free amino acids. fermentation had no effect on total protein content; however, the concentration of most of the amino acids was reduced, except for the proline content that increased. natural fermentation also increased the concentration of  glutamic acid and ornithine. fermentation by p. pentosaceus increased aspartic acid, while l. cellobiosus, l. fermentum, and l. brevis in coculture with i. orientalis increased the concentration of citrulline.

TI  == broad and complex antifungal activity among environmental isolates of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == more than 1200 isolates of lactic acid bacteria isolated from different environments were screened for antifungal activity in a dual-culture agar plate assay. approximately 10% of the isolates showed inhibitory activity and 4% showed strong activity against the indicator mould aspergillus fumigatus. the antifungal spectra for 37 isolates with strong activity and five isolates with low or no activity were determined. several of the strains showed strong inhibitory activity against the moulds a. fumigatus, aspergillus nidulans, penicillium commune and fusarium sporotrichioides, and also against the yeast rhodotorula mucilaginosa. penicillium roqueforti and the yeasts pichia anomala and kluyveromyces marxianus were not inhibited. several isolates showed reduced antifungal activity after storage and handling. the majority of the fungal inhibitory isolates were identified by 16s rdna sequencing as lactobacillus coryniformis. lactobacillus plantarum and pediococcus pentosaceus were also frequently identified among the active isolates. the degree of fungal inhibition  was not only related to production of lactic or acetic acid. in addition, antifungal cyclic dipeptides were identified after hplc separation and several other active fractions were found suggesting a highly complex nature of the antifungal activity.

TI  == phylogenetic diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with paddy rice silage  as determined by 16s ribosomal dna analysis.
AB  == a total of 161 low-g+c-content gram-positive bacteria isolated from whole-crop paddy rice silage were classified and subjected to phenotypic and genetic analyses. based on morphological and biochemical characters, these presumptive lactic acid bacterium (lab) isolates were divided into 10 groups that included members of the genera enterococcus, lactobacillus, lactococcus, leuconostoc, pediococcus, and weissella: analysis of the 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) was used to  confirm the presence of the predominant groups indicated by phenotypic analysis and to determine the phylogenetic affiliation of representative strains. the virtually complete 16s rrna gene was pcr amplified and sequenced. the sequences from the various lab isolates showed high degrees of similarity to those of the genbank reference strains (between 98.7 and 99.8%). phylogenetic trees based on the 16s rdna sequence displayed high consistency, with nodes supported by high bootstrap values. with the exception of one species, the genetic data was in agreement with the phenotypic identification. the prevalent lab, predominantly homofermentative (66%), consisted of lactobacillus plantarum (24%), lactococcus lactis (22%), leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (20%), pediococcus acidilactici (11%), lactobacillus brevis (11%), enterococcus faecalis (7%), weissella kimchii  (3%), and pediococcus pentosaceus (2%). the present study, the first to fully document rice-associated lab, showed a very diverse community of lab with a relatively high number of species involved in the fermentation process of paddy rice silage. the comprehensive 16s rdna-based approach to describing lab community structure was valuable in revealing the large diversity of bacteria inhabiting paddy rice silage and enabling the future design of appropriate inoculants aimed at improving its fermentation quality.

TI  == purification and genetic characterization of plantaricin nc8, a novel coculture-inducible two-peptide bacteriocin from lactobacillus plantarum nc8.
AB  == a new, coculture-inducible two-peptide bacteriocin named plantaricin nc8 (plnc8)  was isolated from lactobacillus plantarum nc8 cultures which had been induced with lactococcus lactis mg1363 or pediococcus pentosaceus fbb63. this bacteriocin consists of two distinct peptides, named alpha and beta, which were separated by  c(2)-c(18) reverse-phase chromatography and whose complementary action is necessary for full plantaricin nc8 activity. n-terminal sequencing of both purified peptides showed 28 and 34 amino acids residues for plnc8 alpha and plnc8 beta, respectively, which showed no sequence similarity to other known bacteriocins. mass spectrometry analysis showed molecular masses of 3,587 da (alpha) and 4,000 da (beta). the corresponding genes, designated plnc8a and plnc8b, were sequenced, and their nucleotide sequences revealed that both peptides are produced as bacteriocin precursors of 47 and 55 amino acids, respectively, which include n-terminal leader sequences of the double-glycine type. the mature alpha and beta peptides contain 29 and 34 amino acids, respectively. an open reading frame, orfc, which encodes a putative immunity protein was found downstream of plnc8b and overlapping plnc8a. upstream of the putative -35 region of plnc8b, two direct repeats of 9 bp were identified, which  agrees with the consensus sequence and structure of promoters of class ii bacteriocin operons whose expression is dependent on an autoinduction mechanism.

TI  == fermentation and microflora of plaa-som, a thai fermented fish product prepared with different salt concentrations.
AB  == plaa-som is a thai fermented fish product prepared from snakehead fish, salt, palm syrup and sometimes roasted rice. we studied the effects of different salt concentrations on decrease in ph and on microflora composition during fermentation. two low-salt batches were prepared, containing 6% and 7% salt (w/w) as well as two high-salt batches, containing 9% and 11% salt. ph decreased rapidly from 6 to 4.5 in low-salt batches, whereas in high-salt batches, a slow or no decrease in ph was found. lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts were isolated as the dominant microorganisms during fermentation. lab counts increased to 10(8)-10(9) cfu g(-1) and yeast counts to 10(7)-5 x 10(7) cfu g(-1) in all batches, except in the 11% salt batch, where counts were 1-2 log lower. phenotypic tests, its-pcr, carbohydrate fermentations and 16s rrna gene sequencing identified lab isolates as pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus alimentarius/farciminis, weisella confusa, l. plantarum and lactococcus garviae.  the latter species was only isolated from high-salt batches. phenotypic characteristics, its-pcr and carbohydrate assimilation identified 95% of the yeasts as zygosaccharomyces rouxii. it is concluded that the fermentation of plaa-som is delayed by a salt-level of 9% due to an inhibition of lab growth. the growth of z. rouxii has no influence on the fermentation rate, but may contribute positively to the flavour development of the product.

TI  == characterisation of is153, an is3-family insertion sequence isolated from lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  == an insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis dsm 20451t as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. the sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfa and orfb, from which three putative proteins are produced. orfab is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf a and orf b that is presumed to be the transposase. the large orfab of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the is3 family. in l. sanfranciscensis type strain dsm 20451t multiple truncated is elements were identified. inverse pcr was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly at rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. multiple copies of is153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of l. sanfranciscensis. resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16s rdna. with a pcr based approach is153 or highly similar sequences were detected in l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. malefermentans, l. plantarum, l. hilgardii, l. collinoides l. farciminis l. sakei and l. salivarius, l. reuteri as well as in enterococcus faecium, pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus.

TI  == the effect of lactobacillus buchneri and other additives on the fermentation and  aerobic stability of barley silage.
AB  == whole-plant barley (39.4% dry matter) was treated with various chemical and biological additives to assess their effects on silage fermentation and aerobic stability. treatments were untreated forage, forage treated with several amounts  of lactobacillus buchneri and enzymes (l. buchneri at 1 x 10(5), 5 x 10(5), and 1 x 10(6) cfu/g of fresh forage), forage treated with an inoculant containing (lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, propionibacterium freudenreichii, and enzymes), or forage treated with a buffered propionic acid-based additive (0.2% of fresh weight). sixty-nine d after ensiling, silages  treated with l. buchneri and enzymes had lower ph, but had higher concentrations  of acetic and propionic acids and higher concentrations of ethanol when compared  with untreated silage. silage treated with the multistrain inoculant containing l. plantarum had lower ph and higher concentrations of lactic acid, but lower concentrations of ammonia-n, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber than did untreated silage. the addition of the buffered propionic acid additive resulted in silage with higher concentrations of lactic and acetic acid compared  with untreated silage. numbers of yeasts in all silages were low at silo opening  (less than 3.0 log cfu/g) and were numerically the lowest in silages treated with l. buchneri but only treatment with the intermediate and high level of l. buchneri improved the aerobic stability of silage. because of the altered fermentation pattern, inoculation with l. buchneri, when applied at equal to or more than 5 x 10(5) cfu/g, and enzymes improved the aerobic stability of barley silage.

TI  == expression in escherichia coli of native and chimeric phenolic acid decarboxylases with modified enzymatic activities and method for screening recombinant e. coli strains expressing these enzymes.
AB  == four bacterial phenolic acid decarboxylases (pad) from lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, bacillus subtilis, and bacillus pumilus were expressed in escherichia coli, and their activities on p-coumaric, ferulic, and caffeic acids were compared. although these four enzymes displayed 61% amino acid sequence identity, they exhibit different activities for ferulic and caffeic acid metabolism. to elucidate the domain(s) that determines these differences, chimeric pad proteins were constructed and expressed in e. coli by exchanging their individual carboxy-terminal portions. analysis of the chimeric enzyme activities suggests that the c-terminal region may be involved in determining pad substrate specificity and catalytic capacity. in order to test phenolic acid toxicity, the levels of growth of recombinant e. coli displaying and not displaying pad activity were compared on medium supplemented with different concentrations of phenolic acids and with differing phs. though these acids already have a slight inhibitory effect on e. coli, vinyl phenol derivatives, created during decarboxylation of phenolic acids, were much more inhibitory to the e. coli control strain. to take advantage of this property, a solid medium with the appropriate ph and phenolic acid concentration was developed; in this medium the recombinant e. coli strains expressing pad activity form colonies approximately five times smaller than those formed by strains devoid of pad activity.

AB  == pediococcus pentosaceus displays a substrate-inducible phenolic acid decarboxylase (pad) activity on p-coumaric acid. based on dna sequence homologies between the three pads previously cloned, a dna probe of the lactobacillus plantarum pdc gene was used to screen a p. pentosaceus genomic library in order to clone the corresponding gene of this bacteria. one clone detected with this probe displayed a low pad activity. subcloning of this plasmid insertion allowed  us to determine the part of the insert which contains a 534-bp open reading frame (orf) coding for a 178-amino-acid protein presenting 81.5% of identity with l. plantarum pdc enzyme. this orf was identified as the pada gene. a second orf was  located just downstream of the pada gene and displayed 37% identity with the product of the bacillus subtilis yfio gene. subcloning, transcriptional analysis, and expression studies with escherichia coli of these two genes under the pada gene promoter, demonstrated that the genes are organized in an autoregulated bicistronic operonic structure and that the gene located upstream of the pada gene encodes the transcriptional repressor of the pada gene. transcription of this pad operon in p. pentosaceus is acid phenol dependent.

AB  == the growth and the effects of four species of staphylococci and six lactic acid bacteria (lab) of the genus carnobacterium, lactobacillus and pediococcus on unsaturated free fatty acids were studied. the strains were grown in complex medium supplemented either with oleic, linoleic or linolenic acids. growth was followed and oxidation of the substrates measured by tbars. the strains of staphylococcus xylosus 873, 16, staphylococcus warneri 863 and staphylococcus saprophyticus grew well on all the substrates. whereas, the growth of the two strains of staphylococcus carnosus and staphylococcus xylosus 831 was inhibited in the media with linolenic acid. the addition of manganese to this media allowed good growth of these strains. all the lab did not grow well in the media with linoleic acid, but their growth was favoured by addition of manganese to the media. under our conditions, only linoleic and linolenic acids were oxidised. all the strains had no prooxidant activity. all the staphylococci limited oxidation of linoleic acid and had a small effect on linolenic acid. lab did not limit oxidation of linoleic acid. with manganese in the media: the oxidation of the sterile controls was delayed for 2 days and then increased; strains of s. carnosus and s. xylosus inhibited oxidation of linolenic acid; and lactobacillus  plantarum and pediococcus pentosaceus limited oxidation of linoleic acid. the two carnobacterium, whatever the conditions, had no antioxidant properties.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a thai low-salt fermented  fish product and the role of garlic as substrate for fermentation.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from raw materials (fish, rice, garlic and banana leaves) and processed som-fak (a thai low-salt fermented fish product) were characterized by api 50-ch and other phenotypic criteria. lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and leuconostoc citreum were specifically associated with fish fillet and minced fish, lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei with boiled rice and weisella confusa with garlic mix and banana leaves. in addition, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus and pediococcus pentosaceus were  isolated from raw materials. a succession of aciduric, homofermentative lactobacillus species, dominated by lb. plantarum/pentosus, was found during fermentation. in total, 9% of the strains fermented starch and 19% fermented garlic, the two main carbohydrate components in som-fak. the ability to ferment garlic was paralleled by a capacity to ferment inulin. an increased percentage of garlic fermenting strains was found during fermentation of som-fak, from 8% at day 1 to 40% at day 5. no starch fermenting strains were isolated during fermentation. three mixed lab cultures, composed of either starch fermenting lc.  lactis subsp. lactis and lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, or garlic fermenting lb. plantarum and pd. pentosaceus, or a combination of these strains were inoculated  into laboratory prepared som-fak with or without garlic. in som-fak without garlic, ph was above 4.8 after three days, irrespective of addition of mixed lab  cultures. the starch fermenting lab were unable to ferment som-fak and sensory spoilage occurred after three days. fermentation with the combined mix of starch  and garlic fermenting strains led to production of 2.5% acid and a decrease in ph to 4.5 in two days. the fermentation was slightly slower with the garlic fermenting strains alone. this is the first report describing the role of garlic  as carbohydrate source for lab in fermented fish products.

TI  == some characteristics of lactic acid bacteria present in commercial sucuk samples.
AB  == a total of 10 sucuk samples, obtained from denizli, turkey were analysed for some physical, chemical and microbiological characteristics. in addition, lactic acid  bacteria (lab) strains producing bacteriocin-like metabolites were isolated and identified. the production of some typical metabolites of the cultures isolated was investigated. at the end of the research, the average values of the ph, water and fat content were 5.1, and 37.2% and 30.5%, respectively. microbiological analyses results were determined: average 8.34 log cfu/g tamb, 8.91 log cfu/g lab (at the mrs agar) and average 8.25 log cfu/g lab (at the elliker's lactic agar).  the average counts of yeast-mould, coliform and enterobacteriaceae were found to  be 5.0 log cfu/g, 3.28 log cfu/g and 3.27 log cfu/g, respectively. in this study, counts of yeast-mould in the two samples, coliform counts in the five samples, and enterobacteriaceae counts in the three samples were < 1.0 log cfu/g. a total  of 6 of 100 lab isolates obtained from the sucuk samples were found as a strain producing bacteriocin-like metabolites. these 6 strains were identified as follows; 3 strains lactobacillus plantarum and 3 strains pediococcus pentosaceus. according to the findings, these strains have the potential to be used as a sucuk starter culture. additionally, acid and flavour compounds, other undesirable metabolite-producing activities of the strains, were determined in the model system. from these results it was concluded, after the determination of the toxicological properties, that the 4 strains of lab identified (l. plantarum 13 p. pentosaceus 15 p. pentosaceus 74 and p. pentosaceus 75) would be useful as the starter and protective culture in the processing of the sucuk and similar fermented products.

TI  == microbiology of mesu, a traditional fermented bamboo shoot product.
AB  == the use of mesu as a pickle and as the base of curry is a tradition in the darjeeling hills and sikkim of india. a total of 327 strains of lactic acid bacteria, representing lactobacillus plantarum, l. brevis and pediococcus pentosaceus were isolated from 30 samples of mesu. these species were present in  all samples of raw bamboo shoots tested. mesu was dominated by l. plantarum followed by l. brevis; p. pentosaceus was isolated less frequently and recovered  from only 40-50% of the mesu samples. the fermentation was initiated by p. pentosaceus, followed by l. brevis, and finally succeeded by l. plantarum species. during fermentation, the titratable acidity increased from 0.04 to 0.95%, resulting in the decline in ph from 6.4 to 3.8.

TI  == the antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria from fermented maize (kenkey)  and their interactions during fermentation.
AB  == a total of 241 lactic acid bacteria belonging to lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus fermentum/reuteri and lactobacillus brevis from various processing stages of maize dough fermentation were investigated. results indicated that each processing stage has its own microenvironment with strong antimicrobial activity. about half of the lact. plantarum and practically  all of the lact. fermentum/reuteri investigated were shown to inhibit other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, explaining the elimination of these organisms during the initial processing stages. further, widespread microbial interactions amounting to 85% to 18% of all combinations tested were demonstrated amongst lactic acid bacteria within the various processing stages, i.e. raw material, steeping, 0 h and 48 h of fermentation, explaining the microbial succession taking place amongst lactic acid bacteria during fermentation. the antimicrobial effect was explained by the combined effect of acids, compounds sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and other compounds with antimicrobial activity  with the acid production being the most important factor. the pattern of antimicrobial factors was not species-specific and the safety and storage stability of fermented maize seem to depend on a mixed population of lactic acid  bacteria with different types of antimicrobial characteristics. this means that introduction of pure cultures as starters may impose a risk to the product.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria in fermented foods in thailand.
AB  == traditional fermented foods (fish, meat and vegetable products), produced by many different processes, are eaten in many parts of thailand. lactic acid bacteria are responsible for the souring and ripening of these foods. homofermentative strains of lactobacillus pentosus, l. plantarum and pediococcus pentosaceus are dominant in foods with low salt concentrations whereas p. halophilus strains are  present in foods containing high salt. strains of lactobacillus sake, other lactobacillus spp., p. acidilactici and p. urinaeequi are frequently found. heterofermentative strains of l. brevis, l. confusus, l. fermentum, l. vaccinostercus, other lactobacillus spp., and of leuconostoc spp. are distributed as minor bacteria and strains of staphylococcus, enterococcus and halobacterium are occasionally isolated.

TI  == fermentation of fructans by epiphytic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == a total of 712 strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from forage grasses were  studied for their ability to ferment fructans of phlein- as well as inulin-type.  only 16 strains utilized phlein and eight of these also fermented inulin. they were identified as lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, lact. plantarum, lact. brevis and pediococcus pentosaceus. in the species lact. paracasei subsp. paracasei, all strains gave positive results, whereas the other positive strains  possessed unique properties within their own species. in all but two cases (strains of the species lact. plantarum), the phlein was more intensively fermented than the inulin, as indicated by a lower ph and a higher lactic acid concentration. on the basis of the outcome of this study it seems worthwhile to inoculate grasses of low sugar content before ensiling with an active strain that can ferment fructans.

TI  == characterization and frequency distribution of species of lactic acid bacteria involved in the processing of mawe, a fermented maize dough from benin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria involved in the natural fermentation of both home-produced and commercial mawe were investigated during a 72 h fermentation period. lactobacillus spp. constitute the majority (94%) of the strains of the lactic acid bacteria isolated, among which 89% represent the betabacterium group. they include l. fermentum (biotype cellobiosus) (41%), l. fermentum or l. reuteri (19%), l. brevis (26%), l. confusus (less than 2%), l. curvatus (less than 1%) and l. buchneri (less than 1%). other isolated lactic acid bacteria were l. salivarius, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus, pediococcus acidilactici and leuconostoc mesenteroides. several species were detected at the early stage of fermentation, but the final stage was dominated by l. fermentum (biotype cellobiosus) and l. fermentum or l. reuteri totalling 90% of the isolated strains. the trend was the same for both home-produced and commercial mawe. no strains of l. plantarum, generally reported as dominating lactic acid bacteria at the final stage of fermentation of most plant foods, were isolated.

TI  == the occurrence and growth of microorganisms during the fermentation of fish sausage.
AB  == minced fish (mullet) sausage mixes containing added sugar, salt, nitrate, nitrite and spices were fermented (48 h, 30 degrees c) by indigenous flora or by a starter culture (pediococcus acidilactici) and the microbial ecology and behaviour of various bacteria was monitored. pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus plantarum dominated the indigenous fermentation, achieving populations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g by 48 h, and decreasing the ph of the mix to 4.5-4.7. significant growth (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g) of staphylococcus warneri, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis. micrococcus varians and micrococcus luteus also occurred during this fermentation. less growth was exhibited by bacillus megaterium and yeasts. pediococcus acidilactici dominated the fermentation when it was inoculated as a starter culture, but indigenous lactic acid bacteria (p. pentosaceus and l. plantarum) also grew to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g. the growth of other bacteria and yeasts was restricted during fermentation with starter culture. inoculated escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella sofia, and staphylococcus aureus grew to 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g in the sausage mix during indigenous fermentation. lesser growth occurred for bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and vibrio parahaemolyticus. growth of these bacteria was significantly inhibited in sausage mix fermented with p. acidilactici.

TI  == growth characteristics of meat starter cultures.
AB  == the australian code of practice for manufacture of dry and semi-dry sausage (salami) states that fermentation temperatures must not exceed 25 degrees c and that a ph of 5.2 must be achieved in the product within 48 h. in order to select  the most appropriate starter cultures for fermentation, lactobacillus plantarum,  pediococcus pentosaceus and staphylococcus carnosus were characterised with respect to growth and acid production determined at constant ph (4.7, 5.5 and 6.3). l. plantarum and p. pentosaceus showed similar characteristics over the ph  range studied while s. carnosus was sensitive to lower ph. also, p. pentosaceus showed greater psychrotrophic growth without ph control than l. plantarum or s. carnosus. salami made with p. pentosaceus maintained higher viable numbers in the product over 8 days than did l. plantarum. growth of s. carnosus in salami could  not be detected in the presence of the more ph-tolerant organisms. the growth of  l. plantarum and p. pentosaceus did not prevent the development of high levels of non-starter flora, a factor that can be important in determining salami quality.  however, the more psychrotrophic p. pentosaceus ensured a greater dominance of starter over non-starter flora.

TI  == antibacterial activity of plantaricin sik-83, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == lactobacillus plantarum sik-83 produces a bacteriocin, designated plantaricin sik-83, which inhibits 66 of 68 lactic acid bacteria from the genera lactobacillus, leuconostoc, pediococcus and streptococcus. a 500-fold dilution of l. plantarum sik-83 mrs culture supernatant with phosphate buffer was sufficient  to kill 10(5) cells/ml of pediococcus pentosaceus within 120 s. the killing of a  sensitive population followed exponential kinetics. it was shown that the bacteriocin binds specifically to sensitive cells but not to nonsensitive lactic  acid bacteria, the producer strain or gram-negative bacteria. sensitive cells, after exposure to the bacteriocin, could be rescued by treatment with proteolytic enzymes. in buffer, plantaricin sik-83 was adsorbed to the cell surface almost immediately, and morphological lesions were observed within 2 h after the cells were exposed to the bacteriocin. the lethal mode of action appeared to be due to  damage to the cell membrane, resulting in cell lysis, which was detected by electron microscopy and by determination of released intracellular components.
