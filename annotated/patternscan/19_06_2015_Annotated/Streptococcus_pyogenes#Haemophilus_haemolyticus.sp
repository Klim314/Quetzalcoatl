TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == [laboratory and clinical studies of rokitamycin dry syrup in the field of pediatrics].
AB  == laboratory and clinical studies on rokitamycin (rkm) dry syrup, a new macrolide antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. the results are summarized as follows. 1. plasma concentrations and urinary recovery rates after  oral administration on fasting of rkm dry syrup at doses of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg to 2 and 1 cases, respectively, were determined. peak plasma levels were obtained in 30 minutes after administration of both dosages with half-lives of 1.5 to 2.2  hours. a clear-cut dose response was observed. urinary recovery rates in the first 6 hours after administration ranged from 1.75 to 2.26%. 2. the mics of rkm  against 80 clinical isolates (streptococcus pyogenes 9, streptococcus pneumoniae  14, branhamella catarrhalis 4, haemophilus influenzae 27, haemophilus parainfluenzae 9, haemophilus haemolyticus 2, haemophilus parahaemolyticus 14 and campylobacter jejuni 1) were compared with mics of midecamycin acetate (mom), josamycin (jm) and erythromycin (em). the antibacterial activity of rkm was superior to those of mom and jm and slightly inferior to that of em. 3. twenty-eight pediatric patients with acute infectious diseases (acute tonsillitis 4, streptococcal infection 4, acute bronchitis 9, pneumonia 4, mycoplasmal pneumonia 2 and campylobacter enteritis 5) were treated with rkm dry syrup at a daily dose of 12-42.9 mg/kg t.i.d. as a rule. efficacy rates were 92.9% clinically and 58.6% bacteriologically. 4. no adverse reactions were observed. abnormal laboratory findings were mild; thrombocytosis in 2 and eosinophilia in 1. 5. the taste and the odor of rkm dry syrup preparation were sufficiently tolerable for the pediatric patients to accept it.

TI  == [per rectal administration of antibiotics. clinical use of ampicillin in respiratory tract infection in children].
AB  == as one of our clinical studies on per rectal administration of antibiotics, children who suffered respiratory tract infection (rti) were administered with ampicillin (abpc) through this route. our conclusions drawn from this study are as follows: 1. one hundred and eighty strains of aerobic bacteria which were isolated by us in 1984-1985 were tested for the sensitivity to abpc using plate-disk method. mic's of abpc for all the strains of streptococcus pyogenes were lower than 0.024 micrograms/ml. mic's for all the strains of streptococcus haemolyticus were 0.05-0.20 microgram/ml. mic's for 88% of the strains tested of  haemophilus influenzae were 0.10-0.78 microgram/ml. 2. bacterial flora in the respiratory tract of 97 cases of children, who suffered rti, were cultured. almost half of them were gram-positive cocci, the rest belonged to gram-negative  groups. this indicates that broad-spectrum antibiotics should be chosen first even before the diagnosis of causative organisms is established. 3. soon after a  per rectal administration of abpc to children, high blood concentrations of the drug were observed by paper-disk method. 4. eleven cases, which included 2 cases  of pneumonia, of 15 children who suffered rti and were given this antibiotic were greatly improved within 3-10 days. no serious side effects were observed. 5. our  brief study reported here indicates that abpc administration by rectal route is safe and useful for the clinical treatment of rti of children.
