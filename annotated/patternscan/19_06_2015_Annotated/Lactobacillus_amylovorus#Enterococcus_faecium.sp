TI  == effects of the probiotic enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 on selected lactic acid bacteria and enterobacteria in co-culture.
AB  == enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 is used as a probiotic for piglets and has been  shown to modify the porcine intestinal microbiota. however, the mode of action of this probiotic modification is still unclear. one possible explanation is the direct growth inhibiting or stimulating effect of the probiotic on other indigenous bacteria. therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the growth interactions of the probiotic with different indigenous porcine bacteria in vitro. reference strains were cultivated with the probiotic e. faecium strain  ncimb10415 (sf68) in a checkerboard assay with 102 to 105 cells/ml inoculum per strain. growth kinetics were recorded for 8 h and used to determine specific growth of the co-cultures. additionally, total dna was extracted from the co-cultures at the end of the incubation to verify which strain in the co-culture was affected. co-cultivation with eight enterococcus spp. tester strains showed strain-specific growth differences. three of four e. faecium strains were not influenced by the probiotic strain. pcr results showed reduced growth of the probiotic strain in co-culture with e. faecium dsm 6177. three of four enterococcus faecalis strains showed reduced specific growth in co-culture with the probiotic strain. however, e. faecalis dsm 20478 impaired growth of the probiotic e. faecium strain. the growth of lactobacillus johnsonii dsm 10533 and  lactobacillus reuteri dsm 20016 was enhanced in co-culture with the probiotic strain, but co-cultivations with lactobacillus mucosae dsm13345 or lactobacillus  amylovorus dsm10533 showed no differences. co-cultures with the probiotic e. faecium showed no impact on the growth rate of four different enterobacterial reference strains (2 strains of salmonella enterica and 2 strains of escherichia  coli), but pcr results showed reduced cell numbers for a pathogenic e. coli isolate at higher concentration of the probiotic strain. as the in vitro effect of the probiotic e. faecium on enterococci was strain specific and the growth of  certain lactobacillus spp. was enhanced by the probiotic, these results indicate  a direct effect of the probiotic on certain members of the porcine gastro intestinal microbiota.

TI  == use of probiotics to reduce faecal shedding of shiga toxin-producing escherichia  coli in sheep.
AB  == shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) are zoonotic, foodborne pathogens of humans. ruminants, including sheep, are the primary reservoirs of stec and there is a need to develop intervention strategies to reduce the entry of stec into the food chain. the initiation of the majority of bacterial, enteric infections involves colonisation of the gut mucosal surface by the pathogen. however, probiotic bacteria can serve to decrease the severity of infection via a number of mechanisms including competition for receptors and nutrients, and/or the synthesis of organic acids and bacteriocins that create an environment unfavourable for pathogen development. the aim of the current study was to determine whether the administration of a probiotic mixture to sheep experimentally infected with a non-o157 stec strain, carrying stx1, stx2 and eae  genes, was able to decrease faecal shedding of the pathogen. the probiotic mixture contained lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and enterococcus faecium. the numbers of non-o157 stec in faecal samples collected from sheep receiving daily doses of the probiotic mixture were significantly lower at the 3rd, 5th and 6th week post-inoculation when compared to the levels recorded in untreated animals. it was concluded that administration of the probiotic mixture reduced faecal shedding of non-o157 stec in sheep, and holds potential as a pre-harvest intervention method to reduce transmission to humans.

TI  == effects of citrus junos by-products fermented with multistrain probiotics on growth performance, immunity, caecal microbiology and meat oxidative stability in broilers.
AB  == 1. the present study was conducted to develop citrus junos probiotics (cjp), using by-products of citrus junos fermented with multispecies probiotic bacteria  including saccharomyces cerevisiae, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus and bacillus subtilis. the effects of dietary cjp on the growth performance, immune status, caecal microbiology and meat oxidative stability of broiler were investigated. 2. a total of 240 one-day-old ross broiler chicks were used in a 35-d experiment in which the chicks were randomly allotted to one of the 4 dietary treatments (0, 5, 10 and 20 g cjp/kg diet) in a completely randomised design. 3. dietary supplementation of 5 g/kg cjp significantly increased body weight, average daily gain and average daily feed intake of broiler during the overall experimental period. 4. serum immunoglobulin (ig)m concentration was significantly increased by 10 and 20 g/kg cjp, whereas the igg  and iga concentration remained unaffected. in addition, 20 g/kg cjp significantly inhibited proliferation of escherichia coli without affecting the concentration of lactobacillus or bacillus spp. 5. a significant reduction in the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances values of breast and thigh meat was observed in response to increasing concentration of dietary cjp. 6. thus, the results suggest that cjp up to a concentration of 20 g/kg can be used in the diet of broilers to improve immunity and to reduce caecal e. coli and tbars values of  breast and thigh meat without any adverse effects on growth performance.

TI  == effect of probiotics on biomarkers of cardiovascular disease: implications for heart-healthy diets.
AB  == the objectives of this article are to review clinical trials that have examined the effects of probiotics on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c) and to assess the potential of probiotic intake as a therapeutic lifestyle change (tlc)  dietary option. twenty-six clinical studies and two meta-analyses are reviewed. significant ldl-c reductions were observed for four probiotic strains: lactobacillus reuteri ncimb 30242, enterococcus faecium, and the combination of lactobacillus acidophilus la5 and bifidobacterium lactis bb12. two synbiotics, l. acidophilus cho-220 plus inulin and l. acidophilus plus fructo-oligosaccharides,  also decreased ldl-c. of the probiotics examined, l. reuteri ncimb 30242 was found to best meet tlc dietary requirements by 1) significantly reducing ldl-c and total cholesterol, with robustness similar to that of existing tlc dietary options, 2) improving other coronary heart disease risk factors, such as inflammatory biomarkers, and 3) having "generally recognized as safe" (gras) status. based on these results, the probiotic l. reuteri ncimb 30242 is a viable  candidate both for future tlc dietary studies and as a potential option for inclusion in tlc dietary recommendations.

TI  == individual responses of mother sows to a probiotic enterococcus faecium strain lead to different microbiota composition in their offspring.
AB  == pregnant gilts were fed the probiotic enterococcus faecium ncimb10415 (sf68) one  month before birth of piglets. dna extracts of sow faeces taken in weekly intervals as well as extracts from the intestine of their offspring during the suckling period at 12 and 26 days of life were analysed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and quantitative pcr. dgge profiles of faecal bacterial communities from three out of six probiotic-fed sows were distinctly different from the control and other probiotic-fed sows at all time points after  probiotic supplementation. the probiotic-fed sows and their offspring were therefore divided into non-responder (n=3) and responder (n=3) groups. the probiotic strain significantly increased faecal lactobacilli cell numbers in mother sows, which could be assigned to a significant increase of lactobacillus amylovorus and lactobacillus acidophilus. responding sows showed a more pronounced increase than non-responding sows. similarly, suckling piglets from non-responding and responding sows showed numeric and significant differences for different bacterial groups and species. dgge profiles of suckling piglets from responding sows also grouped more closely than profiles from control animals. non-metric multiscaling of suckling piglets showed the same tendency for suckling piglets, but not for post-weaning piglets. this study showed that the probiotic e. faecium strain modified the faecal microbiota of sows. this modification is carried over to their offspring, but leads to changes that do not mirror the quantitative composition in the mother sow. individual variations in the bacterial composition of mother sows before probiotic feed intake may influence the impact of a probiotic in sows and their offspring.

TI  == effects of antibiotics on bacterial species composition and metabolic activities  in chemostats containing defined populations of human gut microorganisms.
AB  == the composition and metabolic activities of the human colonic microbiota are modulated by a number of external factors, including diet and antibiotic therapy. changes in the structure and metabolism of the gut microbiota may have long-term  consequences for host health. the large intestine harbors a complex microbial ecosystem comprising several hundreds of different bacterial species, which complicates investigations on intestinal physiology and ecology. to facilitate such studies, a highly simplified microbiota consisting of 14 anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, clostridium butyricum, c. perfringens, c. bifermentans, c. innocuum, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus) was used in this investigation. ampicillin [9.2 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to two chemostats  operated at different dilution rates (d; 0.10 h(-1) and 0.21 h(-1)), and metronidazole [76.9 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to a third vessel (d = 0.21 h(-1)). perturbations in bacterial physiology and metabolism were sampled over a  48-h period. lactobacillus acidophilus and c. bifermentans populations did not establish in the fermentors under the imposed growth conditions. ampicillin resulted in substantial reductions in bacteroides and c. perfringens populations  at both dilution rates. metronidazole strongly affected bacteroides communities but had no effect on bifidobacterial communities. the bacteriostatic effect of ampicillin on bifidobacterial species was growth rate dependent. several metabolic activities were affected by antibiotic addition, including fermentation product formation and enzyme synthesis. the growth of antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria in the large bowel may enable them to occupy ecological niches left vacant after antibiotic administration, preventing colonization by pathogenic species.

TI  == the effect of a multispecies synbiotic mixture on the duration of diarrhea and length of hospital stay in children with acute diarrhea in turkey: single blinded randomized study.
AB  == probiotics have been successfully used for the treatment of acute diarrhea in children and this effect depends on the strains and dose. the aim of this study was to assess the effect of a synbiotic mixture on the duration of diarrhea and the length of hospital stay in children with acute watery diarrhea. this is a prospective randomized, multicenter single blinded clinical trial in hospitalized children with acute watery diarrhea. all children were treated with conventional  hydration therapy with or without a daily dose of a synbiotic (2.5 x 10(9) cfu live bacteria including lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, enterococcus faecium, and 625 mg fructooligosaccharide) for 5 days. the primary endpoint was duration of diarrhea  and duration of hospitalization was the secondary endpoint. among 209 eligible children, 113 received the synbiotic mixture and 96 served as a control. the duration of diarrhea was significantly shorter ( approximately 36 h) in children  receiving the synbiotic group than the controls (77.9 +/- 30.5 vs. 114.6 +/- 37.4 h, p < 0.0001). the duration of hospitalization was shorter in children receiving the synbiotic group (4.94 +/- 1.7 vs. 5.77 +/- 1.97 days, p = 0.002). the effect  of synbiotic mixture on diarrhea started after 24th hours and stool frequency significantly decreased after 24th and 48th hours. the percentage of diarrhea-free children is significantly higher in synbiotic group at 48th and 72nd hours of synbiotic group. in conclusion, this study showed a reduction in diarrhea duration by approximately 36 h and a reduction in the duration of hospitalization with approximately 1 day in children with acute diarrhea with this synbiotic mixture.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly irish subjects.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects,  using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus),  gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to  growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.

TI  == evaluation of probiotic strains for development of fermented alisma canaliculatum and their effects on broiler chickens.
AB  == the present study was conducted to select appropriate microbial strains for the development of fermented alisma canaliculatum a. br. et bouche (fac) feed additive and to examine their effects on broilers. in experiment 1, 16 strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, enterococcus faecium, bacillus subtilis, bacillus coagulans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae from the korean collection for type cultures (kctc) were evaluated. the strains were tested for their acid, bile, and heat tolerance levels. among them, l. acidophilus kctc 3111, e. faecium kctc 2022, b. subtilis kctc 3239, and s. cerevisiae kctc 7928 were selected to produce fac. for experiment 2, 140 ross broiler chicks were allocated to four 5-wk-long dietary groups: nc (basal diet),  pc (basal diet with 0.005% oxytetracycline), ac (basal diet with 0.5% a. canaliculatum rhizome powder), and fac (basal diet with 0.5% fac). final bw and total bw gain were increased (p < 0.05) upon the addition of fac, whereas feed conversion ratio improved (p < 0.05) in the supplemented groups compared with the nc group. crude protein content increased and crude fat decreased (p < 0.05) in the breast meat of the fac group compared with the ac and pc groups, respectively. proventriculus and kidney relative weights of the fac group differed (p < 0.05) from the ac group but not from the pc group. lower (p < 0.05) thiobarbituric acid reactive substances value of thigh meat was observed in the fac group compared with the other groups. the fac diet increased (p < 0.05) alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid in meat. alteration of these fatty acids led to increased levels of polyunsaturated fatty acid, polyunsaturated fatty acid /saturated fatty acid, n-3 and n-6 fatty acids, and decreased n-6/n-3 ratio in breast or thigh meat (p < 0.05). it is concluded that fac confers high tolerance  to acid, bile and heat; and beneficially affects growth, meat composition, oxidative stability, and fatty acid composition. the fac may be a functional feed additive in broilers.

AB  == objectives: the most prevalent type of acquired glycopeptide resistance is encoded by the vana transposon tn1546 located mainly on transferable plasmids in  enterococcus faecium. the limited occurrence in other species could be due to the lack of inter-species transferability and/or stability of tn1546-containing plasmids in other species. we investigated the in vitro transferability of 14 pre-characterized vana-containing plasmids hosted by e. faecium (n = 9), enterococcus faecalis (n = 4) and enterococcus raffinosus (n = 1) into several enterococcal, lactobacterial, lactococcal and bifidobacterial recipients. methods: a filter-mating protocol was harmonized using procedures of seven partner laboratories. donor strains were mated with three e. faecium recipients,  three e. faecalis recipients, a lactobacillus acidophilus recipient, a lactococcus lactis recipient and two bifidobacterium recipients. transfer rates were calculated per donor and recipient. transconjugants were confirmed by determining their phenotypic and genotypic properties. stability of plasmids in the new host was assessed in long-term growth experiments. results: in total, 282 enterococcal matings and 73 inter-genus matings were performed and evaluated. in  summary, intra-species transfer was far more frequent than inter-species transfer, if that was detectable at all. all recipients of the same species behaved similarly. inter-genus transfer was shown for broad host range control plasmids (pip501/pambeta1) only. acquired resistance plasmids remained stable in  the new host. conclusions: intra-species transfer of enterococcal vana plasmids was far more frequent than transfer across species or genus barriers and may thus explain the preferred prevalence of vana-containing plasmids among e. faecium. a  reservoir of vana plasmids in non-enterococcal intestinal colonizers does not seem to be reasonable.

TI  == the effect of selected microbial strains on internal milieu of broiler chickens after peroral administration.
AB  == the aim of this work was to investigate the effect of probiotic preparation with  multi-strains composition (lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus lat 187, lactobacillus acidophilus lat 180, lactobacillus helveticus lat 179, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis lat 182, streptococcus thermophilus lat 205 and enterococcus faecium e 253) on internal milieu, antioxidant status and body weight of broiler chickens. chickens were divided into three groups (c, control;  e1 and e2, experimental groups). experimental chickens received the probiotic preparation in drinking water. probiotic preparation caused a significant increase of serum calcium and potassium content. in the group with higher dose of probiotic strains serum triglycerides level decreased. total antioxidant status in groups with addition of probiotic strains showed higher values in comparison to control group. serum albumin level was found to increase after consumption of  probiotic preparation in group with higher dose of probiotic strains. probiotic strains improved body weight in last observed weeks of feeding.

TI  == inducer bacteria, unique signal peptides, and low-nutrient media stimulate in vitro bacteriocin production by lactobacillus spp. and enterococcus spp. strains.
AB  == bacteriocins (bcn) are antimicrobial peptides that provide potential to control bacterial infections in a variety of applications. we previously reported on three class iia bcn molecules produced by lactobacillus salivarius b-30514 (or-7), enterococcus faecium b-30746 (e 50-52), and enterococcus durans/faecium/hirae b-30745 (e-760). these bcn are notably effective against a wide array of pathogenic bacteria. to commercially apply such bcn, adequate quantities must be produced and harvested. we determined that a combination of host producer synthesized signal peptides (sp) in the presence of both producer and inducer bacteria grown in a dilute fermentation medium enabled marked increases in the synthesis of bcn. these sp contained 24-30 amino acid residues with sizes ranging from 2095 to 3065 da having the unique terminal carboxyl sequence of vkglt. the inducer bacterial isolates used were lactobacillus acidophilus b-30510 and lactobacillus crispatus b-30884. we used a nutrient-limited medium of 10% brucella broth (containing 0.01% glucose) to enhance bcn production. using the combination of these above three parameters enabled us to reproducibly harvest at least 200 mg of bcn/l of the spent fermentation broth. this information can be used to assist in the production of bcn.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic activities of animal intestinal strains against swine-associated pathogens.
AB  == a wide range of enteropathogens cause costly diarrhoeal diseases in fattening piglets and account for food-related infections in humans. the objective of this  study was to screen beneficial bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract  of various animal sources for antagonistic activity against diverse pathogens associated with hazardous pig production times. using agar spot assays, 15 well-characterized strains belonging to lactobacillus, enterococcus, bifidobacterium and bacillus were studied for inhibition of clostridium perfringens type a, various serovars of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, as well as brachyspira pilosicoli. strong antagonists were further analyzed by studying their cell-free supernatants with and without ph neutralization, proteinase k and catalase treatment. enterobacteriaceae were effectively inhibited by lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus reuteri strains, independent from the animal source, and on a lower level by single strains belonging to lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus amylovorus and bifidobacterium thermophilum, due to organic acid production. the bacillus subtilis strain was found to produce an anti-clostridial and anti-brachyspira metabolite of proteinaceous nature. homofermentative lactobacilli and b. thermophilum could suppress the growth of b. pilosicoli, the causative agent of intestinal spirochaetosis, whereas heterofermentative strains belonging to l. reuteri and l. mucosae had no effect. the lactic acid bacteria exerted their activity primarily by organic acid release, except one enterococcus faecium and l. amylovorus strain, which exhibited antagonism through joint activity of lactate and hydrogen peroxide. the findings of this study provide a basis for further in vitro studies and encourage feeding studies to evaluate the antagonistic potential of promising strains in pig production.

TI  == ileal microbiota of growing pigs fed different dietary calcium phosphate levels and phytase content and subjected to ileal pectin infusion.
AB  == two experiments with growing pigs were conducted to determine the effects of dietary p and ca levels, phytase supplementation, and ileal pectin infusion on changes in bacterial populations in the ileum and on ileal and fecal fermentation patterns. growing pigs (bw 30.1 +/- 1.3 kg) were fitted with simple t-cannulas at the distal ileum and were fed a low-p corn-soybean meal control diet (3 g of p/kg), or the control diet supplemented with either 15 g of monocalcium phosphate (mcp)/kg (exp. 1) or 1,000 phytase units of phytase/kg (exp. 2). daily infusion treatments consisted of either 60 g of pectin dissolved in 1.8 l of demineralized water or 1.8 l of demineralized water as a control infusion, infused via the ileal cannula. in each experiment, 8 barrows were assigned to 4 dietary treatments according to a double incomplete 4 x 2 latin square design. the dietary treatments in exp. 1 were the control diet with water infusion, the control diet with pectin infusion, the mcp diet with water infusion, or the mcp diet with pectin infusion. in exp. 2, the pigs received the same control treatments as in exp. 1 and the phytase diet in combination with water or pectin  infusion. gene copy numbers of total bacteria, lactobacillus spp., lactobacillus  reuteri, lactobacillus amylovorus/lactobacillus sobrius, lactobacillus mucosae, enterococcus spp., enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, bifidobacteria, the clostridium coccoides cluster, the clostridium leptum cluster, the bacteroides-prevotella-porphyrmonas group, and enterobacteriaceae were determined by quantitative pcr in dna extracts of ileal digesta. in exp. 1, addition of mcp  reduced ileal gene copy numbers of enterococcus spp. (p = 0.048), e. faecium (p = 0.015), and the c. leptum cluster (p = 0.028), whereas pectin infusion enhanced (p = 0.008) ileal d-lactate concentration. in exp. 2, supplemental phytase led to greater ileal gene copy numbers of the c. coccoides (p = 0.041) and c. leptum (p  = 0.048) clusters and the bacteroides-prevotella-porphyrmonas group (p = 0.033),  whereas it reduced (p = 0.027) fecal n-butyrate concentration. pectin infusion reduced (p = 0.005) ileal gene copy number of the c. leptum cluster. in conclusion, ileal bacterial populations and fermentation patterns are susceptible to changes in the intestinal availability of ca and p as well as to the supply of pectin as a fermentable substrate. greater intestinal ca availability decreased the numbers of some gram-positive bacteria, whereas greater p availability in the small intestine caused by phytase activity enhanced the growth of strictly anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of porcine bacteria that inhibit  the growth of brachyspira hyodysenteriae in vitro.
AB  == aims: to identify bacilli, lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria that inhibit the growth of brachyspira hyodysenteriae. methods and results: a total of 80 isolates were obtained from various porcine intestinal compartments using selective conditions and grouped into 15 similarity clusters based on whole-cell  protein profiles. random amplified polymorphic dna pcr patterns identified 24 genotypes. 16s rdna sequencing assigned all genotypes, except eight aerobes, to established species (bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus amylovorus, bifidobacterium thermophilum). according to their minimum inhibitory  concentrations, four strains (ent. faecium, lact. reuteri, lact. amylovorus, bif. thermophilum) were susceptible to all clinically relevant antibiotics. two lactobacilli showing multiresistance harboured the erm(b) determinant. a cross-section of eight representative strains was examined for growth suppression of two strains of brach. hyodysenteriae, the aetiological agent of swine dysentery, and compared with intestinal strains derived from other animal sources. the brachyspira strains were inhibited by strains of lact. salivarius, bif. thermophilum, ent. faecium and b. subtilis. conclusions: three porcine strains of ent. faecium, bif. thermophilum and b. subtilis were found to be suitable as probiotic candidates because of their well-established identity, antibiotic susceptibility and antagonistic activity. significance and impact of the study: for the first time, antagonistic activity of well-characterized porcine strains against brach. hyodysenteriae is presented. these findings suggest that certain intestinal strains might have a potential as probiotic feed  additives for prevention of swine dysentery.

TI  == biodiversity of the microbial community in a spanish farmhouse cheese as revealed by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == the microbial diversity within alberquilla cheese, made from a spontaneously fermented mixture of raw goats' and sheep's milk in the alpujarra mountains (granada, south-east spain), has been studied by the classical culturing method and also by molecular analysis of community dna. a collection of 206 isolates was obtained from the cheese on different selective/differential media, which were then re-grouped to 52 after randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analyses. isolates on man-rogosa and sharpe-agar (mrs), m17-glucose agar and kenner fecal (kf)-agar medium were identified by specific pcr or 16s rrna gene sequencing and belonged mainly to the lactic-acid bacteria group. the predominant genus was lactobacillus, which accounted for more than 50% of the isolates, the most abundant species being lactobacillus paracasei, followed by considerably less quantities of lb. plantarum and lb. brevis. other lactic-acid bacteria identified were pediococcus urinaequi, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuc. mesenteroides, lactococcus lactis and even the enterococci enterococcus faecium and e. devriesei. cluster analyses of rapd-pcr patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among the lactobacilli. the gram-negative bacterial strains belonged mainly to hafnia alvei species. the microbes occurring in alberquilla cheese were also studied by pcr temporal temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge) of the 16s rrna v3 region and partial 16s rrna sequencing of the ttge bands. the results showed a major presence of lactic-acid bacteria closely related to lc. lactis, lb. paracasei, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. acidophilus and enterococcus sp. the non-lactic-acid bacterium detected was identified as escherichia coli. all the enterococcus strains showed great susceptibility to the most clinically relevant antibiotics, harbouring only the virulence gene efaafm.  on the basis of their antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes we chose two strains of ln. mesenteroides that produced mesenterocin b105 and mesenterocin y105, as revealed by pcr techniques.

TI  == fermentation characteristics of exopolysaccharide-producing lactic acid bacteria  from sourdough and assessment of the isolates for industrial potential.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) with antimicrobial activity and high exopolysaccharide (eps) production ability isolated from sourdough were studied for their fermentation characteristics as potential new starter cultures. the values of ph, titratable acidity, and viable cell counts were 4.06+/-0.009-4.50+/- 0.015, 0.787+/-0.020%-1.172+/-0.018%, and 8.78+/-0.08-8.98+/- 0.06 log cfu/ml, respectively. in order to select probiotics with a high survival rate in the gut, isolates were tested to assess resistance against the artificial gastric acid and bile juice. viable lab counts were significantly (p<0.05) affected by the acidity. at ph 2.0, the total declines in the initial bacterial counts were 4.52+/-0.07 log for s. thermophilus st-body-1, >7.98+/-0.03 log for e. flavescens du-10, >7.95+/-0.05 log for e. faecium du-12, and 3.15+/- 0.06 log for l. amylovorus du-21. among the strains, l. amylovorus du-21 was the only strain that had bile tolerance under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. in order to improve eps production by l. amylovorus du- 21, the influence of carbon source was studied. when glucose was used as a carbon source, eps production dramatically increased to 17.19+/-0.28 g/l (p<0.05). the maximum cell growth (10.012+/-0.012 log cfu/ml) and eps production (18.71+/-0.19 g/l) were achieved when 15 g/ l of glucose was employed as the carbon source.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from stool samples of longevous people in regions of hotan, xinjiang and bama, guangxi, china.
AB  == a total of 567 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains were isolated from the stool samples of longevous people in regions of hotan, xinjiang and bama, guangxi, china. in order to reduce the number of strains for further examinations, 36 isolates were screened out for further examination whilst the other strains, which had lower probiotic properties, were not suitable for yogurt production due to the absence of growth in ph 3.5 mrs medium and no curding during fermentation, and so were excluded. the result of identification by api, sequence analysis of 16s rrna and random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis showed that there were three strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, 10 strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus, three strains of lactobacillus casein, three strains of lactobacillus  brevis, two strains of enterococcus faecium, two strains of enterococcus faecalis, four strains of bifdibacterium infantis, three strains of bifdibacterium brevise, three strains of bifdibacterium bifidium, two strains of  bifdibacterium adolecentis and one strain of bifdibacterium longam among the 36 isolates. these strains were evaluated by in vitro methods including survival upon exposure to ph 2.0, 3.0 and/or 0.3% oxgall and adhesion to the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line caco-2 as well as antimicrobial activity against potential pathogens. the results presented here show that l. rhamnosus lv108, l.  rhamnosus f, b. brevise r39 and b. infantis r42 are acid and bile tolerant, adhere to the cultured human intestinal caco-2 cell line, antagonistic activity against potential pathogenic bacteria infection in vitro, and so are potential strains for probiotic use.

TI  == probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics.
AB  == according to the german definition, probiotics are defined viable microorganisms, sufficient amounts of which reach the intestine in an active state and thus exert positive health effects. numerous probiotic microorganisms (e.g. lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri, bifidobacteria and certain strains of l. casei or the l. acidophilus-group) are used in probiotic food, particularly fermented milk products, or have been investigated--as well as escherichia coli strain nissle 1917, certain enterococci (enterococcus faecium sf68) and the probiotic yeast saccharomyces boulardii--with regard to their medicinal use. among the numerous purported health benefits attributed to probiotic bacteria, the (transient) modulation of the intestinal microflora of the host and the capacity to interact  with the immune system directly or mediated by the autochthonous microflora, are  basic mechanisms. they are supported by an increasing number of in vitro and in vivo experiments using conventional and molecular biologic methods. in addition to these, a limited number of randomized, well-controlled human intervention trials have been reported. well-established probiotic effects are: 1. prevention  and/or reduction of duration and complaints of rotavirus-induced or antibiotic-associated diarrhea as well as alleviation of complaints due to lactose intolerance. 2. reduction of the concentration of cancer-promoting enzymes and/or putrefactive (bacterial) metabolites in the gut. 3. prevention and alleviation of unspecific and irregular complaints of the gastrointestinal tracts in healthy people. 4. beneficial effects on microbial aberrancies, inflammation and other complaints in connection with: inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, helicobacter pylori infection or bacterial overgrowth. 5. normalization of passing stool and stool consistency in subjects suffering from obstipation or an irritable colon. 6. prevention or alleviation of allergies and  atopic diseases in infants. 7. prevention of respiratory tract infections (common cold, influenza) and other infectious diseases as well as treatment of urogenital infections. insufficient or at most preliminary evidence exists with respect to cancer prevention, a so-called hypocholesterolemic effect, improvement of the mouth flora and caries prevention or prevention or therapy of ischemic heart diseases or amelioration of autoimmune diseases (e.g. arthritis). a prebiotic is  "a selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity in the gastrointestinal microflora that confers benefits upon host well being and health", whereas synergistic combinations of pro- and prebiotics are called synbiotics. today, only bifidogenic, non-digestible oligosaccharides (particularly inulin, its hydrolysis product oligofructose, and (trans)galactooligosaccharides), fulfill all the criteria for  prebiotic classification. they are dietary fibers with a well-established positive impact on the intestinal microflora. other health effects of prebiotics  (prevention of diarrhoea or obstipation, modulation of the metabolism of the intestinal flora, cancer prevention, positive effects on lipid metabolism, stimulation of mineral adsorption and immunomodulatory properties) are indirect,  i.e. mediated by the intestinal microflora, and therefore less-well proven. in the last years, successful attempts have been reported to make infant formula more breast milk-like by the addition of fructo- and (primarily) galactooligosaccharides.

TI  == effects of direct-fed microbial supplementation on digestibility and fermentation end-products in horses fed low- and high-starch concentrates.
AB  == a study was conducted to determine whether direct-fed microbials (dfm) could be used to increase digestibility and minimize the risk of acidosis associated with  feeding an increase in the amount of starch fed to horses. fifteen mature thoroughbred geldings were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments in a 3 x 3 latin square design balanced for carryover effects. within each 26-d period, horses were offered grass hay + low-starch concentrate (ls; 1.2 g of starch x kg  of bw(-1) x meal(-1)) from d 1 to 13 and then were abruptly changed to hay + high-starch concentrate (hs; 2.4 g of starch.kg of bw(-1)x meal(-1)) on d 14 continuing through d 26. the dfm treatments were offered in concentrate pellets at a target dosage of 10(8) cfu/(50 kg of bw x d) as follows: no dfm (con; control), lactobacillus acidophilus (lac1; single-species dfm), or a mixture of l. acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium bifidum, and enterococcus faecium (lac4; multiple-species dfm). total feces were collected over 72 h from d 11 to 13 (ls; low dietary starch collection), from d 15 to 17 (ac; abrupt change  in dietary starch collection), and at the end of each experimental period, from d 24 to 26 (hs; high dietary starch collection). data collected consisted of total  dm intake and fecal output, fecal ph, fecal acetate and propionate concentrations, and viable numbers of dfm in the feed. with the exception of fe digestibility, there were no starch x dfm interactions. there was an effect of starch level (p <or= 0.02) on most nutrient digestibilities, except for mg (p = 0.08) and cp, k, and zn (p > 0.10). horses supplemented with lac4 had increased ether extract (p < 0.05) and a tendency for decreased na (p < 0.10) digestibilities compared with con horses. all dfm-supplemented horses had increased cu (p < 0.05) and fe and numerically increased zn digestibilities compared with con horses. fecal ph decreased (p < 0.05), and fecal propionate concentration increased (p < 0.05) as dietary starch content changed from ls to hs. there was a tendency for elevated fecal ph (p < 0.10) in lac1 horses compared with con horses. these results confirm that increasing starch in the equine diet  can enhance nutrient digestibility of the diet. supplementing equine diets with either a single or mixed strain direct-fed lactic acid bacteria had limited effects on nutrient digestibility or on reducing the risk of acidosis associated  with feeding high-starch concentrates to horses. the potential response of dfm supplementation should be evaluated when a more acute acidotic state is induced in horses than in the current study.

AB  == probiotics have preventive as well as curative effects on several types of diarrhea of different etiologies. prevention and therapy (or alleviation) of diarrhea have been successfully investigated for numerous dietary probiotics to establish probiotic properties and to justify health claims (the medicinal use of probiotic food and the therapy of gastrointestinal diseases itself may not be advertised under current food laws). other probiotic microorganisms (e.g., lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri, certain strains of l. casei, l. acidophilus, escherichia coli strain nissle 1917, and certain bifidobacteria and  enterococci (enterococcus faecium sf68) as well as the probiotic yeast saccharomyces boulardii have been investigated with regard to their medicinal use, either as single strains or in mixed-culture probiotics. however, the effects on humans have been assessed mainly in smaller (n<100) randomized, controlled clinical studies or in open label trials, but large intervention studies and epidemiological investigations of long-term probiotic effects are largely missing. perhaps with the exception of nosocomial diarrhea or antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the results of these studies are not yet sufficient to give specific recommendations for the clinical use of probiotics in the treatment of diarrhea.

AB  == a comparative research of the structure of vaginal and intestinal microflora in norm and at kidney pathologies in women in the prenatal period was carried out. at physiologically normal course of pregnancy microbiocenosis of vagina and intestine does not contain pathogenic and conditional-pathogenic microorganisms.  lactic acid bacteria are fixed within the limits of 10(5)-10(8) cfu/1 ml in the vagina secretion and 10(7)-10(8) cfu/1 g in the intestine content. the spore microorganisms have completely disappeared in vaginal biocenosis of women with pyelonephritis after pharmacotherapy; and colibacterias has disappeared in 62% of women. quantity of lactic acid bacteria has also decreased. quantity of e. coli (10(8)- 10(9)) cfu/g, sporous microorganisms (10(3)-10(4)) cfu/g and yeast (10(4)-10(5)) cfu/g has considerably increased in the content of intestine. lactic acid bacteria in content of the vagina are presented by: lactobacillus acidophilus, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. vaginalis; in content of the intestine--l. plantarum and l. fermentum. all the isolated strains of lactobacilli are resistant to metrogyl and amphotericin, 87%--to cephoxitine, cypropfloxacine. twenty three of 24 strains of lactic acid bacteria--antagonists  of pathogenic microflora have shown adhesion to vaginal epthelium. the degree of  adhesive activity depends on the strain and genus specificity of cultures. the highest index of adhesiveness in indicated in enterococcus faecium (5.82 - 7.62)  and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (2.74 - 6.40) strains. the screening of strains has been performed, which suppress growth of gas-producing microflora. the strain of lactobacillus plantarum 200d proved to be the most active one. a complex of cultures of the lactic bacteria providing normalization  of microbial cenosis of the vagina in women in the prenatal period has been selected as based on the data obtained. the biotechnology of production of vaginal suppositories is developed.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium gm-1 isolated  from an infant.
AB  == aim: to partially characterize the bacteriocin produced by the gm-1 strain of enterococcus faecium, isolated from the faeces of a newborn human infant. methods and results: the bacteriocin produced by e. faecium gm-1 showed a broad spectrum  of activity against indicator strains of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio spp., salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes, lactobacillus acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus. treatment of the gm-1 bacteriocin with proteolytic enzymes reduced its inhibitory activities. the bacteriocin was stable at 100 degrees c for 20 min and displayed inhibitory activity at neutral ph. the optimal production of bacteriocin from e. faecium gm-1 was obtained when  the culture conditions were ph 6.0-6.5 and 35-40 degrees c. the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocin was not substantially changed by the use of different carbon sources in the media, except when galactose was substituted for glucose. the use of a sole nitrogen source caused a decrease in inhibitory activity. a bacteriocin gene similar to enterocin p was identified from the total dna of e. faecium gm-1 by pcr and direct sequencing methods. conclusion: e. faecium gm-1, which was isolated from the faeces of a newborn baby, produces an enterocin p-like bacteriocin with inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. significance and impact of the study: e. faecium gm-1, isolated from infant faeces, produces a new bacteriocin that is similar to enterocin p. this bacteriocin is heat stable and has a broad antibacterial spectrum that includes both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == intestinal microflora in patients with liver cirrhosis.
AB  == objective: patients with liver cirrhosis have varying degrees of imbalance of the intestinal flora and probiotics can improve some of the symptoms of gastrointestinal dysfunction in these patients. in the present study, blood ammonia, fecal ph, fecal ammonia, and plasma endotoxin were measured after administration of two kinds of probiotics in order to detect the changes in intestinal flora. methods: six bacteria and yeast were cultured and the colony forming units were counted. fifty cirrhotic patients were randomized to receive probiotic capsules containing bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus and enterococcus, or probiotic capsules containing bacillus subtilis and enterococcus faecium for 14 days. fecal flora, ph and ammonia, blood ammonia (detected by test paper) and plasma endotoxin (detected by lal test kits) were measured before and  after the treatment. results: patients with liver cirrhosis had varying degrees of imbalance of the intestinal flora as shown by a decrease in the bifidobacterium count (10.04 +/- 0.78 vs 9.48 +/- 1.13, p < 0.05). the severity of the imbalance was matched by that of liver dysfunction, with the most serious  imbalance observed in child-pugh c patients. both types of probiotic increased the bifidobacterium count (9.46 +/- 1.09 vs 10.30 +/- 1.11, 9.81 +/- 0.62 vs 10.44 +/- 1.08, respectively, p < 0.05) and reduced the levels of fecal ph and fecal and blood ammonia (p < 0.05). probiotics containing b. subtilis and e. faecium reduced the level of endotoxin in cirrhotic patients with endotoxemia (0.0876 +/- 0.0117 eu/ml vs 0.0685 +/- 0.0246 eu/ml, p < 0.05). conclusions: patients with liver cirrhosis have an imbalance of intestinal bacteria flora. probiotics effectively increased the bifidobacterium count and reduced the level  of fecal ph and fecal and blood ammonia.

AB  == 2-aminobiphenyl (2-abp), 3-aminobiphenyl (3-abp) and 4-aminobiphenyl (4-abp), but not benzidine (bz) and biphenyl (bp), were found to be inhibitory to the growth of human intestinal bacteria bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, b. bifidium atcc 11863, clostridium perfringens atcc 13124, escherichia coli atcc 25922, e. coli atcc 35218, enterobacter cloacae atcc 13047 and salmonella typhimurium ta98, ta100, yg1041 at 10-200 microg/ml in culture broth. bacteroides distasonis atcc 8503, b. fragilis atcc 25285, b. theataiotaomicron atcc 29741, c. paraputrificum  atcc 26780, c. clostridiiforme atcc 25537, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 and enterococcus faecium atcc 19434 were not inhibited by the above mentioned compounds in concentrations up to 200 microg/ml. the ames salmonella/microsome assay was employed to test the mutagenicity of the above-mentioned compounds using strains ta98 and ta100 in the presence and absence of aroclor 1254-induced  rat s9 mix. it was found that 4-abp was mutagenic to both ta98 and ta100, and bz  was mutagenic to ta98 in the presence of rat s9 mix. 2-aminobiphenyl, 3-abp, and  bp were not mutagenic to both strains tested. 2-aminobiphenyl and 3-abp are chemical isomers of 4-abp and are as strong as 4-abp in inhibiting the growth of  intestinal bacteria but not as mutagenic as 4-abp. evidence suggested that the mechanism of growth inhibition is not involved with the interaction of dna that causes mutations, but rather on the electron transport system of these organisms.

TI  == esterolytic and lipolytic activities of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ewe's  milk and cheese.
AB  == in the present work, we report on the esterase and lipase activities of lactic acid bacteria representing the genera lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, and enterococcus isolated from ewe's milk and cheeses. esterase activity was studied using alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 12 carbon atoms and postelectrophoretic detection. the lactic acid bacteria evaluated had intracellular esterase activities, which preferentially degraded the alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 6 carbon atoms. by studying postelectrophoretic patterns, it was found that some strains presented more than one esterase. lactobacillus plantarum o236 showed four enzymes that hydrolyze carboxyl ester linkages with different specificity. lipase activity was studied in intracellular and extracellular fractions using tributyrin, tricaprylin, triolein, and milk fat as substrates. the intracellular and extracellular fractions of leuconostoc mesenteroides o257, lactobacillus plantarum o236, and lactobacillus acidophilus o177 were able to hydrolyze tributyrin. l. plantarum o186, l. acidophilus o252, enterococcus faecium o174 and o426, and enterococcus faecalis ov409 showed lipase activity associated with the intracellular fraction on tributyrin. lactococcus lactis o233, l. plantarum o155, and lactobacillus casei o190 did not hydrolyze triglycerides. not all strains that showed esterase activity exhibited high activity on triglycerides. esterase and lipase activities were species- and strain-specific. wide variations in activity between strains highlight the need for selecting appropriate starters to produce enzyme-modified cheese as well as accelerated ripened cheese.

TI  == development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == a membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. the 16s rdna sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. digoxigenin (dig)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. hybridization signals were read by nbt/bcip color development. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. fragilis, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, r. bromii, r. callidus, r. albus, bifidobacterium  longum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, eubacterium biforme, e. aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus,escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. the result was also confirmed by  using specific pcr methods for these bacteria.

TI  == probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
AB  == antibiotic-associated diarrhoea is a common event. in some cases, it could represent a life-threatening event. clostridium difficile colitis is a further distinct complication of antibiotic administration. treatment options for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and clostridium difficile colitis include supplementation with several types of probiotics, as overviewed in this paper. three randomised, double-blind, controlled clinical trials show a therapeutic effect of saccharomyces boulardii in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. the efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus and bulgaricus has also been ascertained in two double-blind controlled studies. other studies focusing on lactobacillus as a new preventive agent for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea are not double-blind. among these, a positive effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium longum and enterococcus faecium sf68 has been reported. effectiveness of probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea has, therefore, a consistent scientific rationale, however few studies have performed an assessment of bacterial recovery in stools, and this approach may be helpful in deciding a more rigorous dose standardisation.

TI  == characterization of a cryptic plasmid from lactobacillus fermentum kc5b and its use for constructing a stable lactobacillus cloning vector.
AB  == lactobacillus fermentum kc5b, a strain originally isolated from the human vagina, contains a cryptic plasmid pkc5b. the sequence and genetic organization of the 4392-bp plasmid were determined. it contains two convergently oriented replicons, which are homologous to each other and to the stable replicon of the enterococcus faecium plasmid pmbb1. the two replicons of pkc5b were used either individually or together to construct lactobacillus-escherichia coli shuttle plasmids. only the plasmid psp1 that carried both replicons transformed lactobacilli, suggesting a complementary function between the two replicons. since the replicons had a high homology to those of other plasmids that replicate via a theta-like mechanism and no detectable single-stranded intermediates were found for the plasmid, it is possible that pkc5b may replicate via a theta-like mechanism. the  new shuttle plasmid psp1 has been transformed and stably maintained in several lactobacillus strains. as an initial application, psp1 was used to clone the s-layer protein gene (slpa) of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 into a heterologous vaginal lactobacillus strain and achieved surface-bound expression of the protein.

TI  == characterisation of is153, an is3-family insertion sequence isolated from lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  == an insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis dsm 20451t as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. the sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfa and orfb, from which three putative proteins are produced. orfab is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf a and orf b that is presumed to be the transposase. the large orfab of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the is3 family. in l. sanfranciscensis type strain dsm 20451t multiple truncated is elements were identified. inverse pcr was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly at rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. multiple copies of is153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of l. sanfranciscensis. resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16s rdna. with a pcr based approach is153 or highly similar sequences were detected in l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. malefermentans, l. plantarum, l. hilgardii, l. collinoides l. farciminis l. sakei and l. salivarius, l. reuteri as well as in enterococcus faecium, pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus.

AB  == bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of  ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.

TI  == biotherapeutic agents in the treatment of infectious diarrhea.
AB  == biotherapeutic agents offer unique advantages over traditional treatments for infectious diarrhea, and several have been shown to be effective (table 4). these therapeutic microbial agents are most effective in types of infectious diseases that are associated with a disruption of the normal intestinal microecology (e.g., aad, c. difficile disease). the impact of biotherapeutic agents on rotaviral diarrhea is of special clinical importance because this is the most common cause of pediatric diarrhea, and there is no defined treatment. strong efforts need to be made to limit antibiotic exposure in children. biotherapeutic  agents offer a safe and effective nonantibiotic method of treating this important pathogen, especially after the withdrawal of a rotaviral vaccine from the market  by the fda. however, for many biotherapeutic agents, well-done, placebo-controlled trials still are lacking, and not all types of infectious diarrhea respond to these agents. continued research in this innovative therapeutic area is warranted.

TI  == probiotics: "living drugs".
AB  == the uses, mechanisms of action, and safety of probiotics are discussed. probiotics are live microorganisms or microbial mixtures administered to improve  the patient's microbial balance, particularly the environment of the gastrointestinal tract and the vagina. the yeast saccharomyces boulardii and the  bacterium lactobacillus rhamnosus, strain gg, have shown efficacy in clinical trials for the prevention of antimicrobial-associated diarrhea. other probiotics  that have demonstrated at least some promise as prophylaxis for this type of diarrhea are lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium longum, and enterococcus  faecium. the use of s. boulardii as an adjunctive treatment to therapy with metronidazole or vancomycin has been found in controlled studies to decrease further recurrences of clostridium difficile-associated disease. other gastrointestinal disorders for which probiotics have been studied include traveler's diarrhea, acute infantile diarrhea, and acute diarrhea in adults. several lactobacillus species given in yogurt or in tablet or suppository form have shown clinical efficacy as a treatment for vaginal infections. lactobacillus strains have also been examined as a treatment for urinary-tract infections. putative mechanisms of action of probiotics include production of pathogen-inhibitory substances, inhibition of pathogen attachment, inhibition of  the action of microbial toxins, stimulation of immunoglobulin a, and trophic effects on intestinal mucosa. the available probiotics are considered nonpathogenic, but even benign microorganisms can be infective when a patient is  severely debilitated or immunosuppressed. probiotics have demonstrated an ability to prevent and treat some infections. effective use of probiotics could decrease  patients' exposure to antimicrobials. additional controlled studies are needed to clearly define the safety and efficacy of these agents.

AB  == vitacanis((r)), a probiotic preparation containing a lactobacillus acidophilus, an enterococcus faecium and a saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been developed for the prevention of intestinal disorders in dogs and cats. in the present study, these microorganisms were tested jointly or singly during experimental infection  of gnotobiotic mice with salmonella typhimurium. four experimental groups consisting of animals given probiotics jointly or singly and a control group consisting of germfree mice were used. the groups were treated with one or three  of the microorganisms (experimental) or pbs (control) 10 days before intragastric challenge with a suspension containing about 10(2) cells of the bacterial pathogen. a higher survival (p<0.05) was observed in gnotobiotic mice given e. faecium (82%). all the animals in the other groups died after the challenge but the survival time was longer (p<0.05) for groups given all three of the microorganisms (7.4+/-2.4 days) or given only l. acidophilus (7.2+/-2.9 days) than for the control mice (4.4+/-1.1 days) and the mice that received s. cerevisiae (4.9+/-1.6 days) mice. the survival data agreed with the histopathological findings which showed more severe liver and intestinal lesions  in control mice and in mice given saccharomyces. in vitro antagonistic assays showed inhibition growth of e. faecium and s. typhimurium around the colonies of  l. acidophilus and for s. typhimurium around the colonies of e. faecium. however, in vivo, s. typhimurium became similarly established in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice at levels ranging from 10(8) to 10(10)cfu/g of feces and remained at these high levels until the animals died or were sacrificed. among the three probiotic components of the commercial product vitacanis((r)), e. faecium was the only one that provided protection against challenge with s. typhimurium. protection was not due to the reduction of the intestinal populations of the pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == treatment and prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhea.
AB  == mild or severe episodes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad) are common side effects of antibiotic therapy. the incidence of aad differs with the antibiotic and varies from 5 to 25%. the major form of intestinal disorders is the pseudomembranous colitis associated with clostridium difficile which occurs in 10-20% of all aad. in most cases of aad discontinuation or replacement of the inciting antibiotic by another drug with lower aad risk can be effective. for more severe cases involving c. difficile, the treatment of diarrhea requires an antibiotic treatment, with glycopeptides (vancomycin) or metronidazole. another approach to aad treatment or prevention is based on the use of non-pathogenic living organisms, capable of re-establishing the equilibrium of the intestinal ecosystem. several organisms have been used in treatment or prophylaxis of aad such as selected strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium longum, and enterococcus faecium. another biotherapeutic agent, a non-pathogenic yeast, saccharomyces boulardii has been used. in animal models of  c. difficile colitis initiated by clindamycin, animals treated with s. boulardii  (at end of vancomycin therapy) had a significant decrease in c. difficile colony-forming units, and of toxin b production. in several clinical randomised trials (versus placebo), s. boulardii has demonstrated its effectiveness by decreasing significantly the occurrence of c. difficile colitis and preventing the pathogenic effects of toxins a and b of c. difficile. it has been shown to be a safe and effective therapy in relapses of c. difficile colitis. a good response has been seen in children with aad, treated by s. boulardii only. in icus prevention of aad remains based on limitation of antibiotic overuse and spread of c. difficile or other agents of aad should be prevented by improved hygiene measures (single rooms, private bathrooms for patients, use of gloves and hand washing for personnel). in addition the increasing use of biotherapeutic agents such as s. boulardii should permit the prevention of the major side effect of antibiotics, i.e. aad in at risk patients.

AB  == expanded bed adsorption using a strong cation exchanger allowed the direct isolation of amylovorin l471, a bacteriocin from lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471, from the fermentation medium. the ph of the loading and elution buffer were  optimised in a packed bed with cell-free culture supernatant. bound bacteriocin was eluted with 1.0 m nacl. the highest recovery (30%) was obtained at the lowest ph (3.6). at higher ph values the recovery was lower, namely 12%, 15% and 7% at ph 4.5, 6.5 and 8.0, respectively. in expanded bed mode, direct isolation of the  bacteriocin from the fermentation medium at ph 3.6 (loading and elution) initially resulted in a recovery of 12%. after optimisation of the ph (loading and elution at ph 3.6 and 6.5, respectively), the recovery for amylovorin l471 increased up to 30% and higher. recovery of enterocin a from enterococcus faecium ctc 492 fermentation medium averaged 15% (loading and elution at ph 3.6 and 6.0,  respectively). with pediocin, produced by pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8042, 26% recovery was obtained at a ph of 6.5 during loading and elution. low recoveries can be ascribed to non-optimal operation conditions (ph of loading and elution buffer), inactivation of the bacteriocin on a cationic resin, and the formation of more insoluble and less active, strongly hydrophobic bacteriocin aggregates upon further purification.

TI  == effects of probiotic bacteria on diarrhea, lipid metabolism, and carcinogenesis:  a review of papers published between 1988 and 1998.
AB  == we reviewed the evidence from human intervention studies for the health effects of probiotic bacteria, ie, live bacteria that survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract and have beneficial effects on the host. of the 49 studies reviewed, 26 dealt with the prevention or treatment of diarrheal disease, 9 with  the prevention of cancer or of the formation of carcinogens, 7 with the lowering  of serum cholesterol, and 7 with the stimulation of the immune system. the most widely studied probiotic bacteria were lactobacillus gg (22 studies), lactobacillus acidophilus (16 studies), bifidobacterium bifidum (6 studies), and  enterococcus faecium (7 studies). intake of lactobacillus gg consistently shortened the diarrheal phase of rotavirus infection by 1 d. however, evidence for the prevention by lactobacillus gg and other probiotics of diarrhea due to viral or bacterial infections was less strong. effects of probiotics on the immune system are inconclusive because of the variety of outcome variables reported. cholesterol lowering by l. acidophilus was shown in some but not all studies; cholesterol lowering by e. faecium seems to be transient. two studies of one research group showed a smaller recurrence of bladder tumors in patients after treatment with lactobacillus casei; these results await confirmation. the production of mutagens after a meal might be reduced by the concomitant intake of probiotics, but the relevance of this finding is unclear. in conclusion, consumption of foods containing lactobacillus gg may shorten the course of rotavirus infection. other health effects of probiotic bacteria have not been well established. well-designed placebo-controlled studies with validated outcome variables are needed to determine the health effects of probiotics.

TI  == growth of a human intestinal desulfovibrio desulfuricans in continuous cultures containing defined populations of saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting bacteria.
AB  == ecological and physiological effects of the sulphate-reducing bacterium (srb) desulfovibrio desulfuricans on other intestinal organisms were investigated in anaerobic chemostats (dilution rate approximately 0.2 h-1). reproducible defined  bacterial communities were used in these experiments, comprising 14 different saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting species: bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis, bif. pseudolongum, bif. infantis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bact. vulgatus, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, cl. butyricum, cl. innocuum, cl. bifermentans. lactobacillus and cl. bifermentans populations never rose above minimum detection limits (log10 2.0 and 4.0, respectively) under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. inclusion of des. desulfuricans in bacterial cultures (c. log10 8.4 viable cells ml-1) resulted in marked reductions (i.e. greater than 1 log) in planktonic cell population densities of several species, particularly bif. longum, cl. perfringens and bif. pseudolongum. the two bacteroides species were unaffected by des. desulfuricans, while numbers of cl. butyricum increased. extensive wall growth developed in the srb culture, consisting mainly of des. desulfuricans (log10 9.2 viable cells ml-1), bact. thetaiotaomicron and bact. vulgatus, with lesser numbers of facultative anaerobes, cl. perfringens and bif. longum. wall growth was associated with a reduction in planktonic cell mass and increased acid production by the cultures.  chemotaxonomic study of chemostat microbiotas, on the basis of cellular fatty acid methyl ester (fame) analyses, showed the existence of characteristic bacteroides (c15) and bifidobacterial (c18) markers, but desulfovibrio markers (i-c15:0, c16:0, i-c17:1) could be identified. the metabolic activities of saccharolytic organisms were altered in the srb chemostat, including synthesis of a number of hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown, such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, together with several mucinolytic enzymes. high concentrations of sulphide (8.2 mmol 1-1) were  detected in the srb chemostat, suggesting that this metabolite may have been inhibitory to some species. saccharolytic organisms growing in the srb fermenter  utilized more starch, but less galactose-containing polymers, which correlated with the observed glycosidase activities. profound differences were also recorded with respect to fermentation product formation in the chemostats, where a major switch to acetate production occurred in the srb culture, with concomitant reductions in propionate, butyrate and lactate, which is an important electron donor for desulfovibrios.

TI  == evaluation of an avian-specific probiotic and salmonella typhimurium-specific antibodies on the colonization of salmonella typhimurium in broilers.
AB  == salmonella typhimurium colonizes the intestinal tract of poultry and causes food-borne illness in humans. reduction of s. typhimurium colonization in the intestinal tract of poultry reduces potential carcass contamination during slaughter. the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of an avian-specific probiotic and s. typhimurium-specific antibodies on the colonization of s. typhimurium in broilers and on body weights. broiler chicks were spray-vaccinated at the hatchery with the commercial product. avian pac plus, which contains lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus faecium, ad s. typhimurium-specific antibodies. at placement, these chicks were administered avian pac plus in the water. six hours postplacement, chicks were orally challenged with 1.8 x 10 (7) cfu of s. typhimurium. chicks were administered avian pac plus for two additional days postchallenge. chicks were evaluated for s. typhimurium colonization and shedding every 3 to 4 days for the first 2 weeks  and every 7 days for 6 weeks. the mean cecal and colonic concentration of s. typhimurium from the avian pac plus-treated group was significantly lower at day  31 (p = 0.0001), day 38 (p = 0.0005), and day 43 (p = 0.0001) than the nontreated control group. these results indicated that a combination of lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus faecium, and s typhimurium-specific antibodies have a  beneficial effect in reducing the colonization of s. typhimurium in market-aged broilers.

TI  == taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.

TI  == evaluation of an avian-specific probiotic to reduce the colonization and shedding of campylobacter jejuni in broilers.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni has often been responsible for human gastroenteritis. poultry have often been implicated as a source for these human infections. intestinal colonization of c. jejuni in the chicken plays a role in carcass contamination during slaughter. thus, reducing c. jejuni colonization in chickens can potentially reduce the incidence of c. jejuni infections in humans. the use of probiotics to competitively exclude the colonization of intestinal pathogens has been proposed for poultry. hence, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of an avian-specific probiotic containing lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus faecium for reducing the shedding and colonization of c. jejuni in  the chicken intestinal tract. day-old chicks were randomly allocated into either  a probiotic-treated group or a control group. the treated group was given probiotic from day 1 to day 3, and the control group was not given any probiotic. six hours after the first oral administration of probiotics (treatment) or double distilled water (control), these chicks were challenged with c. jejuni. the frequency of the c. jejuni shedding was monitored until market age. intestinal colonization was determined for the two experimental groups at slaughter. results indicated that chickens given probiotics from day 1 to day 3 had a 70% reduction  in the frequency of c. jejuni shedding in colonized chicks (p = 0.0001) and a 27% reduction in jejunal colonization in colonized chicks (p = 0.0001) at slaughter when compared with the control group. thus, the use of the avian-specific probiotic containing l. acidophilus and s. faecium can reduce the colonization and frequency of fecal shedding of c. jejuni in market-aged broilers.

TI  == a microbiology investigation on probiotic pharmaceutical products used for human  health.
AB  == many and different probiotic pharmaceutical products are presently commercialised in the world. on this regard, a microbiological investigation was carried out to  screen the microorganisms incorporated into these products, commonly used for human health. after determination of the cell number and viability of bacteria, several experiments were performed in vitro in order to characterise the microorganisms and to evaluate their probiotic value. among all the strains identified, best results were obtained with lactobacillus rhamnosus, enterococcus faecium and saccharomyces cerevisiae as far as regards growth rates, ph and bile  salts tolerance. moreover, the identification profiles of microorganisms showed a better reliability for the products containing a single species whereas the ones  composed of different strains were usually not satisfactory. in some cases, the presence of lactobacillus and saccharomyces species was in disagreement with the  claimed composition of the product and some species of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and streptococci were found not viable. in defined mixed cultures  experiments, the antagonism of lactobacillus acidophilus and enterococcus faecium versus yersinia enterocolitica was demonstrated and explained as acid and/or antimicrobials production.

TI  == pharmaceutical probiotics for the treatment of anaerobic and other infections.
AB  == pharmaceutical probiotics have been used as alternative treatments or preventative therapies for a variety of clinical diseases. the overuse of antibiotics and emergence of multiple-antibiotic resistant pathogens has refocused clinical attention on the field of probiotics. anaerobic infections which seem to respond well to probiotics are infections which involve the disruption of normal microbial flora. gastrointestinal infections (travelers' diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea,clostridium difficile disease, rotavirus diarrhea) have been studied using the following pharmaceutical probiotics:saccharomyces boulardii, lactobacillus casei gg, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, bifidobacterium bifidum, streptococcus thermophilus and enterococcus faecium. vaginitis has been experimentally studied  using l. acidophilus and l. casei gg. the efficacy, safety and mechanisms of action of these various probiotics are reviewed. requirements for drug approval are similar for biologic probiotics and new drug entities and these requirements  involve preclinical tolerability studies, pharmacokinetic studies and large, well-controlled blinded clinical trials.

TI  == biotherapeutic agents. a neglected modality for the treatment and prevention of selected intestinal and vaginal infections.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the potential of biotherapeutic agents (microorganisms with therapeutic properties) for the prevention and/or treatment of selected intestinal and vaginal infections. data sources: the medline database was searched for all relevant articles published between 1966 and september 1995. search terms used were biotherapeutic agent, probiotic, lactobacillus, saccharomyces, bifidobacterium, candida, gastrointestinal- system, vaginitis, vaginosis-bacterial, and related terms. the bibliographies of obtained articles were also reviewed. study selection and data extraction: all placebo-controlled human studies on biotherapeutic agents were reviewed. english-language open trials, case series and reports, and animal studies were reviewed only if they were especially relevant to providing information on the potential efficacy, adverse effects, or mechanisms of action of these agents. data synthesis: placebo-controlled studies have shown that biotherapeutic agents have been used successfully to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (lactobacillus caseigg, bifidobacterium longum, b longum with l acidophilus, and saccharomyces boulardii), to prevent acute infantile diarrhea (bifidobacterium bifidum with streptococcus thermophilus), to treat recurrent clostridium difficile disease (s  boulardii), and to treat various other diarrheal illnesses (enterococcus faecium  sf68, l caseigg, and s boulardii). there is also evidence for lactobacillus acidophilus in the prevention of candidal vaginitis. few adverse effects have been reported. however, many of the studies tested only small numbers of patients or volunteers. conclusions: there is now evidence that administration of selected microorganisms is beneficial in the prevention and treatment of certain intestinal and, possibly, treatment of vaginal infections. in an effort to decrease the reliance on antimicrobials, the time has come to carefully explore the therapeutic applications of biotherapeutic agents.

TI  == in vitro fructooligosaccharide utilization and inhibition of salmonella spp. by selected bacteria.
AB  == in vitro experiments were conducted to determine: 1) inhibitory capacities of potential direct-fed microbial bacteria against salmonella serotypes; and 2) the  ability of bifidobacterium bifidum, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus sp., and salmonella spp. to grow in media containing fructooligosaccharides (fos-50 or fos pure formulation) as the only carbohydrate source. thirteen bacteria (two strains of bacillus coagulans, bacillus licheniformis, bacillus subtilis, b. bifidum, e. faecium, two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. casei, pediococcus sp., propionibacterium acidopropionici, p. jensenii, and propionibacterium sp.) were tested for inhibition of six salmonella serotypes (s. california, s. enteritidis, s. heidelberg, s. mission, s. senftenberg, and s. typhimurium) using a spot-the-lawn technique. bifidobacterium bifidum, e. faecium, all lactobacilli, and pediococcus sp. clearly inhibited growth of all salmonella serotypes. in the growth experiments, e. faecium, l. lactis, and pediococcus sp. grew in media with either fos-50 or the pure formulation of fos as the sole carbohydrate source. all tested salmonella serotypes utilized fos-50 for growth; however growth varied among the  serotypes. in contrast, none of the salmonella serotypes grew in media containing the pure formulation of fos as the only carbohydrate source.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of jejunal aspirates and faecal samples after oral administration of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == a double-blind placebo controlled investigation was carried out to study the effect of peroral colonization. human volunteers were given mixtures of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria. measurements were made over a 1 week treatment period and for another week after the end of the treatment. two different bacteriological preparations were used, one consisted of enterococcus faecium and bifidobacterium longum (a total of 6.4 x 10(8) cfu d-1); the other consisted of lactobacillus acidophilus, bif. bifidum, lact. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus (a total of 9 x 10(9) cfu d-1). together with a placebo preparation, they were given to 24 healthy controls (eight in each group). microbiological examinations of jejunal aspirates showed that viable counts of most species were below the detection limit. however, the test preparation containing ent. faecium and bif. longum significantly reduced the anaerobe: aerobe ratio in faeces by a factor of three during treatment (p = 0.03), and increased it by a factor of 30 during the following week (p < 0.02). this study shows that peroral administration of certain bacterial cultures may affect the distal intestinal microflora.

TI  == serum cholesterol levels in axenic mice colonized with enterococcus faecium and lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == hypocholesterolemic effect was shown in axenic, mono, bicolonized and conventional mice: the effect was different depending on probiotic properties of  intestinal microorganisms. contamination by enterococcus faecium cx determined the highest effect: haematic cholesterol level decrease was 16.9% in females and  7.8% in males. in mice contaminated by lactobacillus acidophilus n5 the decrease  of haematic cholesterol levels was less and not relevant in mice contaminated by  conventional microflora. enterococcus faecium cx and lactobacillus acidophilus n5 strains were able to grow in presence of bile salts, to colonize intestinal tract, to survive at gastric conditions and to assimilate cholesterol (e. faecium more than l. acidophilus). the authors consider the possibility to associate probiotic strains with these characteristics for the health of consumers.

TI  == microbiologic characteristics of lactobacillus products used for colonization of  the vagina.
AB  == lactobacilli have long been considered to be the protective flora in the vagina.  women with vaginal infections have used various non-prescription products in an attempt to restore their normal vaginal flora. products that contain lactobacilli include dairy products (yogurt, acidophilus milk) and commercially available lactobacillus powders and tablets. recently, lactobacillus species that produce hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) have been associated with normal vaginal flora. in this  study, we compared 16 non-prescription products containing lactobacilli for h2o2  production, purity, and identifiable contaminants. all 16 products contained lactobacilli, of which ten (62%) produced h2o2. at least one contaminant was detected in 11 of 16 (69%) of the products: enterococcus faecium (ten), clostridium sporogenes (one), streptococcus mitis (one), and pseudomonas species  (one). although all of the products tested contained lactobacilli, only four of the products contained lactobacillus acidophilus. most of the lactobacilli-containing products currently available either do not contain the lactobacillus species advertised and/or contain other bacteria of questionable benefit. we conclude that commercially available products may not be appropriate  for recolonization of the vagina.
