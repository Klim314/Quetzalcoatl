TI  == activity of eravacycline against enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter baumannii,  including multidrug-resistant isolates, from new york city.
AB  == eravacycline demonstrated in vitro activity against a contemporary collection of  more than 4,000 gram-negative pathogens from new york city hospitals, with mic50/mic90 values, respectively, for escherichia coli of 0.12/0.5 mug/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae of 0.25/1 mug/ml, enterobacter aerogenes of 0.25/1 mug/ml,  enterobacter cloacae 0.5/1 mug/ml, and acinetobacter baumannii of 0.5/1 mug/ml. activity was retained against multidrug-resistant isolates, including those expressing kpc and oxa carbapenemases. for a. baumannii, eravacycline mics correlated with increased expression of the adeb gene.
