purification of a secreted lectin from andrias davidianus skin and its antibacterial activity.
a lectin secreted from andrias davidianus skin (adl) was purified by affinity chromatography on porcine stomach mucin (type iii) (psm)-crosslinked albumin, followed by gel filtration on sephadex g-100 and hplc on tsk gel g3000pwxl. the purified lectin was found to be a dimeric protein, as revealed by sds-page and maldi-tof analysis. sds-page showed that the adl protein had a molecular mass of 17 kda. adl produced an 8.5 kda band when examined using sds-page under reducing conditions. adl agglutinated native and trypsinized human b erythrocytes. the hemagglutination activity was inhibited by glycoproteins, such as psm and asialo-psm, but not by any of the monosaccharides tested. the activity was stable between 4 degrees c and 50 degrees c. significant adl activity was observed between ph 4-5. the lectin reaction did not depend on the presence of the divalent cation ca2+ or mg2+. the n-terminal adl sequence was determined to be vgytvgatpm. the lectin exhibited antibacterial activity, involving growth and respiration inhibition in escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and shewanella sp. furthermore, adl showed inhibition activity against the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. these findings suggest that adl plays an important role in the innate immunity of a. davidianus on the body surface.
characterization of rumen bacterial strains isolated from enrichments of rumen content in the presence of propolis.
propolis presents many biological properties, including antibacterial activities, and has been proposed as an additive in ruminant nutrition. twenty bacterial strains, previously isolated from enrichments of brazilian cow rumen contents in the presence of different propolis extracts (llos), were characterized using phenotyping and 16s rrna identification. seven strains were assigned to streptococcus sp., most likely s. bovis, and were all degrading starch. one amylolytic lactate-utilizing strain of selenomonas ruminantium was also found. two strains of clostridium bifermentans were identified and showed proteolytic activity. two strains were assigned to mitsuokella jalaludinii and were saccharolytic. one strain belonged to a bacillus species and seven strains were affiliated with escherichia coli. all of the 20 strains were able to use many sugars, but none of them were able to degrade the polysaccharides carboxymethylcellulose and xylans. the effect of three propolis extracts (llos b1, c1 and c3) was tested on the in vitro growth of four representative isolates of s. bovis, e. coli, m. jalaludinii and c. bifermentans. the growth of s. bovis, e. coli and m. jalaludinii was not affected by the three propolis extracts at 1 mg ml(-1). c. bifermentans growth was completely inhibited at this llos concentration, but this bacterium was partially resistant at lower concentrations. llos c3, with the lower concentration of phenolic compounds, was a little less inhibitory than b1 and c1 on this strain.
inducible factors with antimicrobial activity after immune challenge in the haemolymph of red palm weevil (insecta).
insects are capable of innate immune responses elicited after microbial infection. in this process, the receptor-mediated recognition of foreign bodies and the subsequent activation of immunocompetent cells lead to the synthesis ex novo of a peptide pool with antimicrobial activity. we investigated the inducible immune response of a coleopteran, rhynchophorus ferrugineus, challenged with both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. after immunization, we evaluated the presence of antimicrobial peptides using either biochemical analyses or microbiological techniques. the antimicrobial properties of the newly synthesized protein pool, detectable in haemolymph fractions of low molecular mass, showed strong antibacterial activity against various bacterial strains (escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. ox1, bacillus subtilis and micrococcus luteus). in addition to the preliminary study of the mechanism of action of the pool of antimicrobial peptides, we also investigated its effects on bacterial cell walls by means of fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. the data suggest that the main effects seem to be directed at destabilizing and damaging the bacterial wall. this study provides data that help us to understand some aspects of the inducible innate immunity in a system model that lacks anticipatory responses. however, the weevil has finely tuned its defensive strategies to counteract effectively microbial infection.
ftir spectroscopy offers hints towards widespread molecular changes in cobalt-acclimated freshwater bacteria.
high concentrations of heavy metals can be toxic for bacteria. however, after prolonged exposure, bacteria can become acclimated and begin to be able to grow in the presence of heavy metals. acclimation can involve alterations of metabolism and molecular structures. our aim was to examine these alterations in cobalt-acclimated bacteria via attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared (atr-ftir) spectroscopy on viable samples. bacillus sp. and pseudomonas sp. isolated from a temperate shallow lake and a well-established strain of e. coli were investigated. our results revealed consistent, wide-spread changes in cell membrane and cell wall dynamics of bacillus sp. and e. coli, including a decrease in peptidoglycan content of bacillus sp. and increased lipid ordering of the membrane in both bacteria. furthermore, a decrease in rna and protein concentrations of bacillus sp. was measured. all three bacteria studied showed a decrease in conformational freedom of proteins following cobalt acclimation. interestingly, both bacillus sp. and e. coli showed slight but significant alterations in their dna conformations which might imply a methylation-mediated memory formation leading to epigenetic modulation for cobalt adaptation.
antibacterial activity of murrayaquinone a and 6-methoxy-3,7-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1h-carbazole-1,4(9h)-dione.
the antibacterial activity of murrayaquinone a (10), a naturally occurring carbazoloquinone alkaloid, and 6-methoxy-3,7-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1h-carbazole-1,4(9h)-dione (11), a synthetic carbazoloquinone, both obtained during the development of the synthesis of carbazomycin g, having unique quinone moiety, was studied against gram-positive (bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative (escherichia coli and pseudomonas sp.) bacteria. compound 10 showed antibacterial activities against both of escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus whereas compound 11 indicated the activity against staphylococcus aureus only. both compounds 10 and 11 exhibited minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 50 mu g ml(-1) against staphylococcus aureus.
structure-activity relationships of 3,3'-phenylmethylene-bis-4-hydroxycoumarins:  selective and potent inhibitors of gram-positive bacteria.
dicoumarols and coumarin derivatives have shown a variety of pharmaceutical activities and have been found to be potent inhibitor for the nad(p)h-dependent flavoproteins. in this report, dicoumarol and its derivatives containing the substituted benzene ring at the methylenebis position were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria: staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis, and gram-negative bacteria: escherichia coli and klebsiella sp. the results showed that the synthesized dicoumarols affect cell growth but are selective against gram-positive over gram-negative bacterial cells. however, for most derivatives, the substitution of steric bulky benzene group on the methylenebis position appears to decrease in the efficacy of antibacterial effect. this finding is roughly described by the predicted poorer docked structure of the derivatives to a homology model of s. aureus flavoprotein. 3d-qsar study highlighted structural features around the substituted benzene ring of dicoumarols as the antibacterial activity. comfa and comsia contour maps support the idea that steric repulsion at the para position could diminish the antibacterial activity. the results of this study provide a better understanding of the molecular basis for the antibacterial activity of dicoumarols.
molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene for an alkaline protease from bacillus circulans mtcc 7906.
bacillus circulans mtcc 7906, an extracellular alkaline protease producer was genetically characterized. b. circulans genomic dna was isolated, oligonucleotide primers specific to alkaline protease gene of b. circulans were designed and its pcr amplification was done. the purified pcr product and ptrchisa vector were subjected to restriction digestion with ncoi and hindiii and transformed into escherichia coli dh5-alpha competent cells. the recombinant expression of alkaline protease gene studied by inducible expression and analysis by sds-page, established that the alkaline protease protein had an estimated molecular size of 46 kda. gene sequencing of the insert from selected recombinant clone showed it to be a 1329 bp gene encoding a protein of 442 amino acids. the sequence was blasted and aligned with known alkaline protease genes for comparison with their nucleotide and amino acid sequences. this identified major matches with three closely related subsp. of b. subtilis (b. subtilis subsp. subtilis strain 168, b. subtilis bsn5 and b. subtilis subsp. spizizenii strain w23). the insert also showed a number of substitutions (mutations) with other sp. of bacillus which established that alkaline protease of b. circulans mtcc 7906 is a novel gene. the phylogenetic analysis of alkaline protease gene and its predicted amino acid sequences also validated that alkaline protease gene is a novel gene and the same has been accessioned in genbank with accession number jn645176.1.
bioactive metabolites from an endophytic cryptosporiopsis sp. inhabiting clidemia hirta.
an endophytic cryptosporiopsis sp. was isolated from clidemia hirta and analyzed  for its secondary metabolites that lead to the isolation of three bioactive molecules. the compounds were purified from the culture broth of the fungus and their structures were determined by spectroscopic methods as (r)-5-hydroxy-2-methylchroman-4-one (1), 1-(2,6-dihydroxyphenyl)pentan-1-one (2) and (z)-1-(2-(2-butyryl-3-hydroxyphenoxy)-6-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxybut-2-en-1-one (3). compound 1 exhibited significant cytotoxic activity against the human leukemia cell line, hl-60 with an ic50 of 4 mug/ml. this compound induced g2 arrest of the hl-60 cell cycle significantly. in addition, out of these compounds, 2 and 3 were active against several bacterial pathogens. compound 2 was active against bacillus cereus, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus with ic50 values varying from 18 to 30 mug/ml, and compound 3 displayed activity against pseudomonas fluorescens with an ic50 value of 6 mug/ml. compounds 2 and 3 are novel whereas compound 1 was reported earlier but the stereochemistry of its c-2 methyl is established for the first time.
microalgae mediated synthesis of silver nanoparticles and their antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria.
silver nanoparticles is known to have antimicrobial affects. cyanobacteria isolates from muthupet mangrove includes aphanothece sp, oscillatoria sp, microcoleus sp, aphanocapsa sp, phormidium sp, lyngbya sp, gleocapsa sp, synechococcus sp, spirulina sp with were set in compliance with their cellular mechanism of nano silver creation, and were investigated by uv-vis spectrophotometer, energy-dispersive x-ray (edx) and scanning electron microscopy (sem). silver nanoparticles were spherical shaped well distributed without aggregation in solution with an average size of about 40- 80 nm. synthesised nano silver had antibacterial production on various organisms that provoked various diseases in humans. the cellular metabolites of microcoleus sp. only created nano silver and it enhanced the antibacterial activity against test pathogenic bacteria from mtcc (proteus vulgaris, salmonella typhi, vibrio cholera, streptococcus sp., bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli.) the antimicrobial assay was performed using 0.001 m concentration of nano silver in well diffusion method with positive control of appropriate standard antibiotic discs cephotaxime, ampicillin, tetracyclin, cephalexin etc. synthesised silver nanoparticles acted as an effective antimicrobial agent and proved as an alternative for the development of new antimicrobial agents to combat the problem of resistance.
synergized antimicrobial activity of eugenol incorporated polyhydroxybutyrate films against food spoilage microorganisms in conjunction with pediocin.
biopolymers and biopreservatives produced by microorganisms play an essential role in food technology. polyhydroxyalkanoates and bacteriocins produced by bacteria are promising components to safeguard the environment and for food preservation applications. polyhydroxybutyrate (phb)-based antimicrobial films were prepared incorporating eugenol, from 10 to 200 mug/g of phb. the films were evaluated for antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens, spoilage bacteria, and fungi such as staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, bacillus cereus, aspergillus flavus, aspergillus niger, penicillium sp., and rhizopus sp. the synergistic antimicrobial activity of the films in the presence of crude pediocin was also investigated. the broth system containing pediocin (soluble form) as well as antimicrobial phb film demonstrated an extended lag phase and a significant growth reduction at the end of 24 h against the bacteria. crude pediocin alone could not elicit antifungal activity, while inhibition of growth and sporulation were observed in the presence of antimicrobial phb film containing eugenol (80 mug/g) until 7 days in the case of molds, i.e., a. niger, a. flavus, penicillium sp., and rhizopus sp. in potato dextrose broth. in the present study, we identified that use of pediocin containing broth in conjunction with eugenol incorporated phb film could function in synergized form, providing effective hurdle toward food contaminating microorganisms. furthermore, tensile strength, percent crystallinity, melting point, percent elongation to break, glass transition temperature, and seal strength of the phb film with and without eugenol incorporation were investigated. the migration of eugenol on exposure to different liquid food simulants was also analyzed using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. the study is expected to provide applications for pediocin in conjunction with eugenol containing phb film to enhance the shelf life of foods in the food industry.
identification of anziaic acid, a lichen depside from hypotrachyna sp., as a new  topoisomerase poison inhibitor.
topoisomerase inhibitors are effective for antibacterial and anticancer therapy because they can lead to the accumulation of the intermediate dna cleavage complex formed by the topoisomerase enzymes, which trigger cell death. here we report the application of a novel enzyme-based high-throughput screening assay to identify natural product extracts that can lead to increased accumulation of the dna cleavage complex formed by recombinant yersinia pestis topoisomerase i as part of a larger effort to identify new antibacterial compounds. further characterization and fractionation of the screening positives from the primary assay led to the discovery of a depside, anziaic acid, from the lichen hypotrachyna sp. as an inhibitor for both y. pestis and escherichia coli topoisomerase i. in in vitro assays, anziaic acid exhibits antibacterial activity against bacillus subtilis and a membrane permeable strain of e. coli. anziaic acid was also found to act as an inhibitor of human topoisomerase ii but had little effect on human topoisomerase i. this is the first report of a depside with activity as a topoisomerase poison inhibitor and demonstrates the potential of this class of natural products as a source for new antibacterial and anticancer compounds.

biological activities of selected basidiomycetes from yemen.
in a previous paper we demonstrated the results of biological screening of yemeni basidiomycetes. the present study was aimed to investigate the antimicrobial and the antioxidant activity of further basidiomycetes collected in yemen. dichloromethane, methanol and aqueous extracts of the fruiting bodies of 25 species were screened in vitro for their antibacterial activities against three gram-positive bacteria (staphyloccocus aureus, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus flavus) and two gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa), against six human fungal pathogens (candida albicans, candida krusei, aspergillus fumigatus, mucor sp., microsporum gypseum, trichophyton mentagrophytes) and against one non human pathogenic fungus (candida maltosa). the results indicated that 75 extracts exhibited activity against one or more of the bacteria. the methanol extracts of agaricus cf. bernardii, agrocybe pediades, chlorophyllum molybdites, coriolopsis polyzona, ganoderma xylonoides, pycnoporus sanguineus, trametes lactinea and trametes cingulata showed activity against all tested bacteria. the highest antibacterial activity was exhibited by methanol extracts from chlorophyllum molybdites, ganoderma xylonoides and trametes cingulata and agaricus cf. bernardii, agrocybe pediades, coriolopsis polyzona, pycnoporus sanguineus and trametes lactinea. the methanol extracts of chlorophyllum molybdites, ganoderma xylonoides and pycnoporus sanguineus showed considerable antifungal activities against the tested fungal strains. strong antioxidative effects employing the dpph assay were exhibited by methanol extracts from chlorophyllum molybdites, ganoderma xylonoides, hexagonia velutina, pycnoporus sanguineus, trametes lactinea and trametes cingulata. our previous and presented studies about 48 basidiomycetes collected in yemen provide evidence that basidiomycetes from the arabic region so far should attract more attention as potential source for new biologically active agents.
antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of cichorium intybus root extract using  orthogonal matrix design.
solvent, impregnation time, sonication repetitions, and ultrasonic power were important factors in the process of ultrasound-assisted extraction from chicory (cichorium intybus) root, while there were no studies about optimizing these 4 factors for extract yield, total phenolic content (tpc), antioxidant, antibacterial, and antifungal activity of the extracts using orthogonal matrix design. the present research demonstrated that the solvent composition played a significant role in the improving extract yield, tpc, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities. the other 3 factors had inequable effect on different purposes, ultrasonic power could improve tpc and antioxidant activity, but long time of extraction lowered antioxidant activity. the tpc increased from 22.34 to 27.87 mg gae (gallic acid equivalents)/100 g (dry extracts) with increasing solvent polarity. the half inhibition concentration (ic(50,) mug/ml) of the radical scavenging activity of the chicory extracts ranged from 281.00 to 983.33 mug/ml. the content of caffeoylquinic acids of root extract, which was extracted by the optimal combination was 0.104%. several extracts displayed antibacterial activities against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus thuringiensis, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella typhi, while penicillium sp. and aspergillus sp. resisted against all the extracts. combination of 70% ethanol v/v, 24-h impregnation time, 3 sonication rounds, and 300-w ultrasonic input power was found to be the optimal combination for the chicory extract yield, tpc, antioxidant activity, and antibacterial activity.
antibacterial and antifungal activities of crude plant extracts from colombian biodiversity.
on a global scale, people have used plants to treat diseases and infections, and  this has raised interest on the plant biodiversity potencial in the search of antimicrobial principles. in this work, 75 crude n-hexanes, dichloromethane and methanol extracts from the aerial parts of 25 plants belonging to four botanical families (asteraceae, euphorbiaceae, rubiaceae and solanaceae), collected at the natural regional park ucumari (risaralda, colombia), were evaluated for their antibacterial and antifungal activities by the agar well diffusion method. the antibacterial activities were assayed against two gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis, and three gram-negative ones named, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in addition, the same plant extracts were tested against the yeast candida albicans and the fungi aspergillus fumigatus and fusarium solani. overall, the plant extracts examined displayed better bactericide rather than fungicide activities. in general, the best antibacterial activity was showed by the plant extracts from the rubiaceae family, followed in order by the extracts from the euphorbiaceae and solanaceae ones. it is important to emphasize the great activity displayed by the methanol extract of alchornea coelophylla (euphorbiaceae) that inhibited four out of five bacteria tested (b. subtilis, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and e. coli). furthermore, the best minimal inhibitory concentration for the extracts with antifungal activities were displayed by the dichloromethane extracts from acalypha diversifolia and euphorbia sp (euphorbiaceae). the most susceptible fungus evaluated was f. solani since 60% and 20% of the dichloromethane and methanol extracts evaluated inhibited the growth of this phytopathogenic fungus. the antimicrobial activity of the different plant extracts examined in this work could be related to the secondary metabolites contents and their interaction and susceptibility of pathogenic microorganism evaluated.
actinopyga lecanora hydrolysates as natural antibacterial agents.
actinopyga lecanora, a type of sea cucumber commonly known as stone fish with relatively high protein content, was explored as raw material for bioactive peptides production. six proteolytic enzymes, namely alcalase, papain, pepsin, trypsin, bromelain and flavourzyme were used to hydrolyze a. lecanora at different times and their respective degrees of hydrolysis (dh) were calculated. subsequently, antibacterial activity of the a. lecanora hydrolysates, against some common pathogenic gram positive bacteria (bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus) and gram negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and pseudomonas sp.) were evaluated. papain hydrolysis showed the highest dh value (89.44%), followed by alcalase hydrolysis (83.35%). bromelain hydrolysate after one and seven hours of hydrolysis exhibited the highest antibacterial activities against pseudomonas sp., p. aeruginosa and e. coli at 51.85%, 30.07% and 30.45%, respectively compared to the other hydrolysates. protein hydrolysate generated by papain after 8 h hydrolysis showed maximum antibacterial activity against s. aureus at 20.19%. the potent hydrolysates were further fractionated using rp-hplc and antibacterial activity of the collected fractions from each hydrolysate were evaluated, wherein among them only three fractions from the bromelain hydrolysates exhibited inhibitory activities against pseudomonas sp., p. aeruginosa and e. coli at 24%, 25.5% and 27.1%, respectively and one fraction of papain hydrolysate showed antibacterial activity of 33.1% against s. aureus. the evaluation of the relationship between dh and antibacterial activities of papain and bromelain hydrolysates revealed a meaningful correlation of four and six order functions.
a new large - scale synthesis of magnesium oxide nanowires: structural and antibacterial properties.
large-scale one-dimensional magnesium oxide (mgo) nanowires with diameters of 6 nm and lengths of 10 mum have been successfully synthesized by a new facile and simple reaction. this production was performed via a microwave hydrothermal approach at low temperature growth of 180 degrees c for 30 min. the structure of as synthesized mgo nanowires were investigated by means of x-ray diffraction (x-ray), fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (ftir), field emission scanning electron microscopy (fe-sem), transmission electron microscopy (tem), selected area electron diffraction (saed) and energy dispersive x-ray (eds). the antibacterial behavior of mgo nanowires concentration in solid media against gram negative and gram positive for different bacteria has been tested in details. the results show that the mgo nanowires have bacteriostatic activity against escherichia coli and bacillus sp. the antibacterial activity increases with increasing mgo nanowires concentration. furthermore, the presence of one-dimensional mgo nanowires has high antibacterial efficacy and damages the membrane wall of bacteria. finally, this study offered the prospect of developing ultrafine nanoscale devices utilizing mgo nanowires and implementing their useful potential in biological control.

characterization and antimicrobial activities of two streptomyces isolates from soil in the periphery of universiti putra malaysia.
this study was to assess the identification and antimicrobial activities of two actinomycete isolates. the two isolates designated as b8 and c2, were isolated from a patch of soil in the peripheral area of universiti putra malaysia by streaking on starch casein agar after standard serial dilution procedures. their antimicrobial activities were first evaluated against eight clinical laboratory strains namely bacillus sp., enterococcus sp., escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., pseudomonas sp., salmonella sp., staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis by perpendicular streak method on mueller hinton and tryptic soy agar. in both media, a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity was observed for both isolates, with b8 against all the test bacteria and c2 against five of them (bacillus sp., e. coli, pseudomonas sp., s. aureus and s. epidermidis). re-assessment against e. coli atcc 25922 and s. aureus atcc 25923 strains by similar method showed antibacterial activities by isolate b8 against both attc strains while c2 only against s. aureus atcc 25923. streptomyces griseus atcc 10137 was included in the later experiment and showed antibacterial activity against both atcc strains. subsequently, the two isolates were identified by pcr/sequencing techniques and phylogenetic analysis to be streptomyces species (>93% homology based on 16s rrna and rpob genes). characterization on cultural characteristic and viable count at different temperatures (37 masculinec and 28 masculinec), on different microbiological media (aia, isp-2, mha, na, pda and tsa), were performed. more morphological features were observed on isp-2 for both isolates. a higher growth yield was also observed at 28 masculinec in all media but in comparing that between the two isolates, isolate b8 outnumbered c2 at all experimental conditions. the observed variation in cultural traits and growth yield indicate unique properties between the two antibiotic-producing isolates.

2-[(2,4-diaryl-3-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-ylidene)hydrazono]-4-phenyl-2,3-dihydro thiazoles (3a-3k) have been synthesized by the cyclization of 2-[(2,4-diaryl-3-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-one thiosemicarbazones with phenacyl bromide and characterized by analytical (melting point and elemental analysis) and spectral (ir, (1)h nmr, (13)c nmr, d(2)o exchange, noesy and mass) techniques. the novel hantzsch products (3a-3k) were screened for their in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities against some selected microorganisms. structure activity relationship (sar) for the reported compounds was studied by comparing their mic values with standard drugs (streptomycin and amphotericin b). the results show that 3e against escherichia coli and cryptococcus neoformans3i against bacillus subtilis, 3b against aspergillus flavus, and 3k against rhizopus sp. were found to show significant growth inhibition.
anti-biofilm activity of an exopolysaccharide from a sponge-associated strain of  bacillus licheniformis.
background: secondary metabolites ranging from furanone to exo-polysaccharides have been suggested to have anti-biofilm activity in various recent studies. among these, escherichia coli group ii capsular polysaccharides were shown to inhibit biofilm formation of a wide range of organisms and more recently marine vibrio sp. were found to secrete complex exopolysaccharides having the potential for broad-spectrum biofilm inhibition and disruption. results: in this study we report that a newly identified ca. 1800 kda polysaccharide having simple monomeric units of alpha-d-galactopyranosyl-(1-->2)-glycerol-phosphate exerts an anti-biofilm activity against a number of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains without bactericidal effects. this polysaccharide was extracted from a bacillus licheniformis strain associated with the marine organism spongia officinalis. the mechanism of action of this compound is most likely independent from quorum sensing, as its structure is unrelated to any of the so far known quorum sensing molecules. in our experiments we also found that treatment of abiotic surfaces with our polysaccharide reduced the initial adhesion and biofilm development of strains such as escherichia coli phl628 and pseudomonas fluorescens. conclusion: the polysaccharide isolated from sponge-associated b. licheniformis has several features that provide a tool for better exploration of novel anti-biofilm compounds. inhibiting biofilm formation of a wide range of bacteria without affecting their growth appears to represent a special feature of the polysaccharide described in this report. further research on such surface-active compounds might help developing new classes of anti-biofilm molecules with broad spectrum activity and more in general will allow exploring of new functions for bacterial polysaccharides in the environment.

new 1-[(tetrazol-5-yl)methyl]indole derivatives, their acyclic nucleoside analogs and the corresponding glycoside derivatives were synthesized. furthermore, the [)(1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)methyl])-2h-tetrazole derivative as well as the corresponding thioglucoside were prepared. the synthesized compounds were tested for their antimicrobial activity against aspergillus niger, penicillium sp, candida albican, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus lacti, escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp., and streptomyces sp. compounds 3, 5 and 19b exhibited potent antibacterial activity and compounds 4, 5 and 10 exhibited high activities against the tested fungi compared with fusidic acid.
identification of the genes involved in 1-deoxynojirimycin synthesis in bacillus  subtilis mori 3k-85.
1-deoxynojirimycin (dnj), a d-glucose analogue with a nitrogen atom substituting  for the ring oxygen, is a strong inhibitor of intestinal alpha-glucosidase. dnj has several promising biological activities, including its antidiabetic, antitumor, and antiviral activities. nevertheless, only limited amounts of dnj are available because it can only be extracted from some higher plants, including the mulberry tree, or purified from the culture broth of several types of soil bacteria, such as streptomyces sp. and bacillus sp. in our previous study, a dnj-producing bacterium, bacillus subtilis mori, was isolated from the traditional korean fermented food chungkookjang. in the present study, we report the identification of the dnj biosynthetic genes in b. subtilis mori 3k-85 strain, a dnj-overproducing derivate of the b. subtilis mori strain generated by gamma-irradiation, xhe genomic dna library of b. subtilis mori 3k-85 was constructed in escherichia coli, and clones showing alpha-glucosidase inhibition activity were selected. after dna sequencing and a series of subcloning, we were able to identify a putative operon which consists of gabt1, yktc1, and gutb1 genes predicted to encode putative transaminase, phosphatase, and oxidoreductase, respectively. when a recombinant plasmid containing this operon sequence was transformed into an e. coli strain, the resulting transformant was able to produce dnj into the culture medium. our results indicate that the gabt1, yktc1, and gutb1 genes are involved in the dnj biosynthetic pathway in b. subtilis mori, suggesting the possibility of employing these genes to establish a large-scale microbial dnj overproduction system through genetic engineering and process optimization.
ieodomycins a-d, antimicrobial fatty acids from a marine bacillus sp.
bioassay-guided isolation of the etoac extract of a marine bacillus sp., cultured in modified bennett's broth medium, yielded four new antimicrobial fatty acids, named ieodomycins a-d. the planar structures of these new compounds were determined by extensive 1d and 2d nmr and hresims spectroscopic data analysis. their absolute configurations were elucidated by modified mosher's method and literature data review. all four new compounds demonstrated antimicrobial activities in vitro.
phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts of leaf, stem and root from different varieties of labisa pumila benth.
a local herb, kacip fatimah, is famous amongst malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented. therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of labisia pumila benth. total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems. leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. hplc analyses of phenolics and flavonoids in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin, kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both gram positive (micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis b145, bacillus cereus b43, staphylococcus aureus s1431) and gram negative (enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumonia k36, escherichia coli e256, pseudomonas aeruginosa pi96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all plant parts against fusarium sp., candida sp. and mucor using the agar diffusion disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.
synthesis, stereochemistry, antimicrobial evaluation and qsar studies of 2,6-diaryltetrahydropyran-4-one thiosemicarbazones.
a series of 2,6-diaryltetrahydropyran-4-one thiosemicarbazones (11-27) were synthesized and characterized for evaluation of potential antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, bacillus subtilis and klebsiella pneumonia and antifungal activity against cryptococcus neoformans, candida albicans, rhizopus sp., aspergillus niger and aspergillus flavus were evaluated. compounds 21 and 22 showed maximum inhibition potency at low concentration (6.25 mug/ml) against p. aeruginosa. for antifungal activity, 20 and 21 were effective against c. neoformans and 22-24 against c. albicans at minimum concentration. further, the results of qsar studies of these synthesized compounds indicated the importance of weakly polar component of surface area, hydrophobicity and ionization potential parameters in defining their antimicrobial activity.
defensin of the zebra mussel (dreissena polymorpha): molecular structure, in vitro expression, antimicrobial activity, and potential functions.
a 409 bp full length defensin gene was cloned and sequenced based on an expressed sequence tag (est) obtained from a normalized zebra mussel (dreissena polymorpha) foot cdna library developed in our laboratory. the d. polymorpha defensin (dpd) gene encoded a peptide with 76 amino acid residues. the mature dpd contains 54 amino acids with a fully functional insect defensin a domain. homologue searching against genbank database suggested that this dpd was phylogenetically close to defensins from a group of insects with six conserved cysteine residues. predicted with homology-modeling method, the three-dimensional structure of dpd also demonstrated a significant similarity with insect defensin a. the recombinant dpd was in vitro expressed through an escherichia coli expression system. the antimicrobial activities of the refolded recombinant dpd were found against the growth of morganella sp., plesiomonas shigelloides, edwardsiella tarda, e. coli and staphylococcus aureus aureus (atcc12598) with the minimal inhibition concentration (mic) 0.35, 0.43, 1.16, 6.46, and 30.39 microm, respectively. however, with less than 50 microm no detectable inhibition activities were observed against the other four gram-negative bacteria (aeromonas salmonicida salmonicida, motile aeromonas, flavobacterium sp., pseudomonas fluorescens, shewanella putrifaciens), as well as the other gram-positive bacteria (bacillus megaterium atcc14581, carnobacterium maltaromaticum atcc27865, enterococcus faecalis atcc19433, and micrococcus leteus atcc4698), and the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. the rna fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) of dpd in the zebra mussel suggested that the dpd was expressed in a variety of tissues, such as foot, retractor muscle, ctenidium, mantle, hemocytes, gonad, digestive gland, and intestine. by using the quantitative pcr, the expression level of dpd in the zebra mussel foot was the highest, followed by the muscle. by comparing the amount of dpd transcripts in the zebra mussel foot under two different byssogenesis conditions (byssogenesis and non-byssogenesis) with qpcr, we found that the higher expression levels of dpd were always associated with the byssogenesis status from 2 to 4 days after the start of byssogenesis. findings of this study suggest that the expression of the dpd gene was upregulated in vivo by byssogeneis, and by hemocytes in vitro upon stimulation with microbial antigens.
streptomyces lacticiproducens sp. nov., a lactic acid-producing streptomycete isolated from the rhizosphere of tomato plants.
a novel actinomycete, designated strain gimn4.001(t), was isolated from the rhizosphere of tomato plants grown in guangzhou, china. the strain produced greyish white aerial mycelia, lactic acid and a large quantity of double diamond-shaped crystals on potato dextrose agar and yeast extract-malt extract agar. the colour of the substrate mycelium was not sensitive to ph. microscopic observations revealed that strain gimn4.001(t) produced verticillate chains of cylindrical spores. chemotaxonomic data confirmed that strain gimn4.001(t) belonged to the genus streptomyces. melanin pigments were not produced. no antibacterial activity was observed against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis or candida albicans, but inhibitory activity was observed against penicillium citrinum. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed that strain gimn4.001(t) was related most closely to streptomyces morookaense atcc 19166(t) (98.9 % similarity) and streptomyces lavenduligriseus atcc 13306(t) (98.7 %). levels of dna-dna relatedness between strain gimn4.001(t) and the type strains of these species were low (14-20 %). furthermore, strain gimn4.001(t) could be differentiated from s. morookaense, s. lavenduligriseus and other closely related species of the genus streptomyces based on morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics. on the basis of its physiological and molecular properties, strain gimn4.001(t) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus streptomyces, for which the name streptomyces lacticiproducens sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is gimn4.001(t) (=cctcc m208214(t)=nrrl b-24800(t)).
characterization and identification of a novel marine streptomyces sp. produced antibacterial substance.
strain gb-2 is a marine microbe with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, isolated from soil taken from the coastal city lianyungang in the jiangsu province of china. analysis of its morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics as well as chemical components of the cell wall strongly suggested that the strain gb-2 belonged to the streptomyces sp. analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the 16s rrna gene of streptomyces sp. gb-2 strain showed a strong similarity (98%) with the 16 rrna gene of streptomyces fradiae. application to antibacterial substance of strain streptomyces sp. gb-2 by various separation steps led to isolation of one active molecule having a retention time of 9.495 min, p(9.495 min), which possessed antibacterial activity against bacillus cereus and escherichia coli. through analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and mass/mass spectrometry of the peak, the molecular weight of the antibacterial substance (p(9.495 min) sample) was 447.5 da and it was determined to be sisomicin according to the analysis of ion fragments. nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of the peak also demonstrated that the antibacterial substance was sisomicin. this study is the first to introduce the finding of sisomicin produced from marine streptomyces sp. this work provides a preference for the production of sisomicin in pharmaceutical industries and a probability for studying the biodiversity of marine microbe.
inhibition of growth of shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli by nonpathogenic escherichia coli.
during routine quality control testing of diagnostic methods for shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) using stool samples spiked with stec, it was observed that the shiga toxin could not be detected in 32 out of 82 samples tested. strains of e. coli isolated from such stool samples were shown to be responsible for this inhibition. one particular isolate, named e. coli 1307, was intensively studied because of its highly effective inhibitory effect; this strain significantly reduced growth and shiga toxin levels in coculture of several stec strains regardless of serovar or shiga toxin type. the probiotic e. coli nissle 1917 inhibited growth and reduced shiga toxin levels in stec cultures to an extent similar to e. coli 1307, but commensal e. coli strains and several other known probiotic bacteria (enterococci, bacillus sp., lactobacillus acidophilus) showed no, or only small, inhibitory effects. escherichia coli 1307 lacks obvious fitness factors, such as aerobactin, yersiniabactin, microcins and a polysaccharide capsule, that are considered to promote the growth of pathogenic bacteria. we therefore propose strain e. coli 1307 as a candidate probiotic for use in the prevention and treatment of infections caused by stec.
diversity of root associated microorganisms of selected medicinal plants and influence of rhizomicroorganisms on the antimicrobial property of coriandrum sativum.
the total heterotrophic bacteria, actinomycetes and fungus were enumerated from the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil of 50 selected locally available medicinal plants in and around bharathiar university. in all the plants, population of microorganism were higher in the rhizosphere soil than in the non rhizosphere soil. among the microorganisms, bacterial population was higher in number followed by fungus and actinomycetes. of the medicinal plants, the maximum rhizosphere effect was observed in annona squamosa and the minimum effect was seen in eclipta alba and cassia auriculata. among the bacteria the dominant species was bacillus followed by pseudomonas, enterobacter, corynebacterium, micrococcus and serratia. the streptomyces species was found to be dominant followed by deuteromycetes and frankia among the actinomycetes. among the fungal isolates rhizopus was found to be higher in number followed by aspergillus, penicillium, mucor and fusarium. about 70.96% of the bacterial isolates were found to be nitrate reducers and 90.60% of the bacteria solubilised phosphate. the rhizosphere bacterial isolates were also capable of hydrolyzing starch, cellulose, casein, urea and gelatin. the isolates of bacteria, actinomycetes and fungus were also able to produce phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (iaa). the maximum iaa production was recorded by fusarium sp (5.8 mg/l). the rhizosphere bacterial isolates showed resistance to 14 commercially used antibiotics. in an attempt to check the influence of these plant growth promoting microorganisms on the antimicrobial property of coriandrum sativum against escherichia coli mtcc-443 and aeromonas hydrophila mtcc-646, the results observed was not encouraging since the inoculants did not influence the antibacterial property. however extensive and in depth study is required to find out the influence of rhizomicroorganisms on the antibacterial property of medicinal plants. the other results clearly indicated that the rhizosphere microorganisms could be exploited for its innumerable properties and active metabolites.
three new antimicrobial metabolites of phomopsis sp.
two new 10-membered macrolides, named phomolides a (1) and b (2), and one new derivative of benzofuran (3) were isolated from the culture of phomopsis sp. hzla01-1, and their structures were elucidated based on spectroscopic analyses, particularly 2d nmr experiments. compounds 1, 2 and 3 showed significant antimicrobial activities against escherichia coli cmcc44103, candida albicans as2.538, saccharomyces cerevisiae atcc9763 with mics 5~10 mug/ml. the most significant, compound 3 showed strong activity against bacillus subtilis cmcc63501 with the mic value 1.25 microg/ml. none of the three compounds showed significant cytotoxicity against the hela cell line at 10 microg/ml.
effects of rosa rugosa petals on intestinal bacteria.
the effects of pulverized petal of rosa rugosa on the growth of 10 species of intestinal and pathogenic bacteria were investigated. growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was not affected by the addition of the petal in plate cultivation. however, the growth of bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus was completely inhibited by the addition of 0.1, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.05% (w/v) of the petal respectively. in liquid cultivation, the addition of the petal (0.5%) stimulated the growth of bifidobacterium breve and slightly inhibited the growth of lactobacillus salivarius. but the growth of e. coli, s. aureus, b. cereus, and salmonella sp. was inhibited by nearly 50%. hydrolyzable tannins isolated from r. rugosa, rugosin d, and tellimagradin ii showed antibacterial activities against e. coli, s. aureus, b. cereus, and salmonella sp., but little or no effect against bif. breve and l. salivarius. r. rugosa petal showed selective antibacterial activities against intestinal and pathogenic bacteria, and the selectivity resembled that of prebiotics such as oligosaccharides and dietary fiber. hydrolyzable tannins in r. rugosa, such as rugosin d and tellimagradin ii, must be active constituents.
exploring the use of natural antimicrobial agents and pulsed electric fields to control spoilage bacteria during a beer production process.
different natural antimicrobials affected viability of bacterial contaminants isolated at critical steps during a beer production process. in the presence of 1 mg/ml chitosan and 0.3 mg/ml hops, the viability of escherichia coli in an all malt barley extract wort could be reduced to 0.7 and 0.1% respectively after 2 hour- incubation at 4 degrees c. the addition of 0.0002 mg/ml nisin, 0.1 mg/ml chitosan or 0.3 mg/ml hops, selectively inhibited growth of pediococcus sp. in more than 10,000 times with respect to brewing yeast in a mixed culture. in the presence of 0.1 mg ml chitosan in beer, no viable cells of the thermoresistant strain bacillus megaterium were detected. nisin, chitosan and hops increased microbiological stability during storage of a local commercial beer inoculated with lactobacillus plantarum or pediococcus sp. isolated from wort. pulsed electric field (pef) (8 kv/cm, 3 pulses) application enhanced antibacterial activity of nisin and hops but not that of chitosan. the results herein obtained suggest that the use of these antimicrobial compounds in isolation or in combination with pef would be effective to control bacterial contamination during beer production and storage.
antibacterial activity of a bacteriocin-like substance produced by bacillus sp. p34 that targets the bacterial cell envelope.
the objective of this study was to investigate the mode of action of bls p34, a bacteriocin-like substance (bls) produced by a novel bacillus sp. strain p34 isolated from the amazon basin. the effect of the bls was tested against listeria monocytogenes, showing a bactericidal effect at 200 au (activity units) ml(-1), while no inhibition of spore outgrowth of bacillus cereus was observed with a dose of 1,600 au ml(-1). growth of escherichia coli and salmonella enteritidis was inhibited, but only when the chelating agent edta was co-added with the bls. the effect of bls p34 on l. monocytogenes was also investigated by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. treated cells showed an important frequency increase in 1,452 and 1,397 cm(-1) and decrease in 1,217 and 1,058 cm(-1), corresponding assignments of fatty acids and phospholipids. transmission electron microscopy showed damaged cell envelope and loss of protoplasmic material. bls p34 was bactericidal to gram-positive, and also showed inhibitory effect against gram-negative bacteria. there is evidence that its mode of action corresponds to that of a membrane-active substance. the knowledge about the mode of action of this bls is essential to determine its effective application as an antimicrobial agent.
application of real-time quantitative pcr for the detection of selected bacterial pathogens during municipal wastewater treatment.
bacteria were detected at five stages of municipal wastewater treatment using taqman(r) real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr). thirteen probe and primer sets were tested for diverse pathogens that may be present in wastewater, including aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, helicobacter pylori, klebsiella pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella sp., and staphylococcus aureus. the sensitivity of the assay was 100 fg of genomic dna (=22 gene copies), based on a standard curve generated using a. hydrophila purified dna. samples from five stages of wastewater treatment were collected, including raw wastewater, primary effluents, mixed liquor, waste activated sludge and final effluents. in duplicate samples, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, c. perfringens and e. faecalis were detected throughout the wastewater process, and their numbers decreased by 3.52-3.98, 4.23-4.33, 3.15-3.39, and 3.24 orders of magnitude respectively, between the raw wastewater and final effluent stage. this qpcr method was effective for the detection of pathogens in wastewater and confirmed that the risk of exposure to pathogens in the wastewater discharge was well within the environment canada guidelines.
antibacterial activity of the broad bean extracts on resistant bacteria.
the antimicrobial activities of four different extracts (ethanol, methanol, distilled water and 2-methylbutan-1-01) obtained from different parts of broad bean (vicia faba l.) such as flowers, leaves, seeds and seed hulls and were tested against bacillus subtilis, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella peneumoniua, shigella sp. and micrococcus pyogenes. better antimicrobial activity was observed with the leaves of broad bean sterile distilled water extract with a zone of inhibition in between 13-32 mm. flower and seed hull showed by escherichia coli, shigella sp., bacillus subtilis, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus pyogenes a zone of inhibition in between 15-29 and 14-19 mm, respectively. leaves, seed hulls and flowers of broad bean with ethanol extract showed by escherichia coli a zone of inhibition in between 25-34, 15-17 and 15 mm, respectively. flower with ethanol extract had a zone of inhibition in between 15-16 mm by bacillus subtilis and micrococcus pyogenes, respectively. different parts of broad bean with methanol and 2-methylbutan-l-01 extract did not shown any antimicrobial affects.
antifungal and antibacterial activities of araucaria araucana (mol.) k. koch heartwood lignans.
five lignans (secoisolariciresinol, pinoresinol, eudesmin, lariciresinol, and lariciresinol-4-methyl ether) were isolated from an meoh extract from araucaria araucana (mol.) k. koch wood for the first time in this species and their structures determined with spectroscopic methods. the antimicrobial activities of these compounds were determined for the bacteria citrobacter sp., bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for the white rooting and staining fungi mucor miehei, paecilomyces variotii, ceratocystis pilifera, trametes versicolor, and penicillium notatum, and in addition, the meoh extract was evaluated against aspergillus niger, candida albicans, fusarium moniliforme, f. sporotrichum and trichophyton mentagrophytes. the most sensitive bacteria against pinoresinol were the gram-positive. however, secoisolariciresinol exhibited a significant antifungal activity on fungi of white rooting and wood staining and this compound completely inhibited the mycelial growth of t. versicolor and c. pilifera at 300 and 400 microg per disc, respectively, whereas pinoresinol showed a moderate inhibitory activity. on the other hand, the meoh extract had the highest activity against rooting and staining and pathogenic fungi as well as t. versicolor, fusarium spp. and trichophyton mentagrophytes, inhibiting completely the growth at 400 microg per disc.
antimicrobial, cytotoxic and antioxidant activity of selected basidiomycetes from yemen.
dichloromethane, methanol and aqueous extracts of 23 selected basidiomycetes species fruiting bodies collected in yemen were screened in vitro for their antibacterial activities against three gram-positive bacteria (staphyloccocus aureus, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus flavus), two gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and against one yeast fungus (candida maltosa), as well as for their cytotoxic and antioxidant activity. the highest antibacterial activity was shown by extracts from agaricus sp. (type 1), coriolopsis caperata, ganoderma colossus, ganoderma resinaceum, phellorinia herculea and tulostoma obesum. strong antioxidative effects employing the dpph assay were exhibited by methanol extracts from ganoderma resinaceum, inonotus ochroporus, phellinus rimosus and phellorinia herculea. the results provide evidence that some of the studied fungi might be potential sources for new biologically active agents.
mode of action of the microbial metabolite ge23077, a novel potent and selective  inhibitor of bacterial rna polymerase.
ge23077, a novel microbial metabolite recently isolated from actinomadura sp. culture media, is a potent and selective inhibitor of bacterial rna polymerase (rnap). it inhibits gram-positive (bacillus subtilis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli) rnaps with ic50 values (i.e. the concentration at which the enzyme activity is inhibited by 50%) in the 10(-8) m range, whereas it is not active on e. coli dna polymerase or on eukaryotic (wheat germ) rnap ii (ic50 values > 10(-4) m in both cases). in spite of its potent activity on purified bacterial rnaps, ge23077 shows a narrow spectrum of antimicrobial activity on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. to investigate the molecular basis of this behaviour, the effects of ge23077 on macromolecular biosynthesis were tested in e. coli cells permeabilized under different conditions. the addition of ge23077 to plasmolyzed cells resulted in an immediate and specific inhibition of intracellular rna biosynthesis, in a dose-response manner, strongly suggesting that cell penetration is the main obstacle for effective antimicrobial activity of the antibiotic. biochemical studies were also conducted with purified enzymes to obtain further insights into the mode of action of ge23077. interestingly, the compound displays a behaviour similar to that of rifampicin, an antibiotic structurally unrelated to ge23077: both compounds act at the level of transcription initiation, but not on the sigma subunit and not on the formation of the promoter dna-rnap complex. tests on different rifampicin-resistant e. coli rnaps did not show any cross-resistance between the two compounds, indicating distinct binding sites on the target enzyme. in conclusion, ge23077 is an interesting new molecule for future mechanistic studies on bacterial rnap and for its potential in anti-infective drug discovery.
eudistomins w and x, two new beta-carbolines from the micronesian tunicate eudistoma sp.
chemical investigation of the micronesian ascidian eudistoma sp. afforded two new eudistomin congeners, which were designated eudistomins w (1) and x (2). the structures of the new compounds were unambiguously established on the basis of nmr spectroscopic ((1)h, (13)c, cosy, (1)h detected direct, and long-range (13)c-(1)h correlations) and mass spectrometric (ei and esims) data. compound 2 exhibited antibiotic activity toward bacillus subtilis, staphyloccocus aureus, and escherichia coli and was also found to be fungicidal against candida albicans in an agar diffusion assay. compound 1 was selectively active against c. albicans but showed no antibacterial activity.
antimicrobial properties and phytochemical constituents of the leaves of african  mistletoe (tapinanthus dodoneifolius (dc) danser) (loranthaceae): an ethnomedicinal plant of hausaland, northern nigeria.
african mistletoe (tapinanthus dodoneifolius (dc) danser) called 'kauchi' in hausa is a hemi-plant parasite used ethnomedicinally by the hausa and the fulani tribes of northern nigeria as a remedy for several human and animal ailments that include stomach ache, diarrhoea, dysentery, wound and cancer. screening of the plant, obtained from 14 different hosts, revealed a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activities against certain multiple drug resistant bacterial and fungal isolates of farm animals. interestingly, the inhibition of the growth of agrobacterium tumefaciens, bacillus sp., escherichia coli, salmonella sp., proteus sp. and pseudomonas sp., bacterial sp. known to be associated with either crown gall or gastrointestinal tract and wound infections, by extracts of t. dodoneifolius gives credence to the ethnomedicinal usage of the plant. phytochemical screening showed the common occurrence of anthraquinones, saponins, and tannins, a rare presence of alkaloids and the absence of phlobatannins in the hemi-parasite. moreover, the antimicrobial activity and the presence or distribution of phytochemical substances in t. dodoneifolius appeared to be partly dependent on the host plant species.
evaluation of extracts of the root of landolphia owerrience for antibacterial activity.
ethanolic and aqueous (cold and hot) extracts of landolphia owerrience root parts (whole-root, root-bark and root-wood) were tested for activity against ten bacterial strains using agar-well diffusion and macro-broth dilution methods, respectively. the ethanolic extracts of the whole-root and root-wood were active against 100 and 80% of the test organisms, respectively. ethanolic and aqueous extracts of the root-bark were moderately active while the aqueous (cold and hot) extracts of the root-wood exhibited little or no activity. out of the nine extracts prepared, 66.7% were active against staphylococcus aureus atcc 12600, 55.6% variously against each of pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 10145 and local clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, escherichia coli and salmonella typhi, 44.4% against proteus sp., 33.3% against bacillus subtilis atcc 6051 and 22.2% against e. coli atcc 11775. the agar-well-determined mic values for the ethanolic whole-root extract (0.78-50 mg/ml) were higher (indicating lower activity) than the corresponding macro-broth-determined values (0.39-50 mg/ml) probably because of slow diffusion rates of the active constituents of the extract in agar. on the other hand, the differences could be due to the effects of dmso used to dissolve the ethanolic extracts in the agar-well diffusion tests. similar discrepancies in the mic values detectable with the two test methods were apparent in the root-wood extract and the control drug, gentamycin, except that in the latter the agar-well-determined mic values (0.125-8.0 microg/ml) were lower than the macro-broth-determined values (0.125-64 microg/ml). the strong activity of the ethanolic extracts against known etiologic agents of diseases traditionally treated with l. owerrience root of similar preparations provides scientific justification for the use of the herb in ethnomedical practice in nigeria.
rho is not essential for viability or virulence in staphylococcus aureus.
we have identified the gene for transcription termination factor rho in staphylococcus aureus. deletion of rho in s. aureus reveals that it is not essential for viability or virulence. we also searched the available bacterial genomic sequences for homologs of rho and found that it is broadly distributed and highly conserved. exceptions include streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma pneumoniae, ureaplasma urealyticum, and synechocystis sp. strain pcc6803, all of which appear not to possess a rho homolog. complementation studies indicate that s. aureus rho possesses the same activity as escherichia coli rho and that the rho inhibitor bicyclomycin is active against s. aureus rho. our results explain the lack of activity of bicyclomycin against many gram-positive bacteria and raise the possibility that the essentiality of rho may be the exception rather than the rule.
enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl. tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
secretory production of human leptin in escherichia coli.
human leptin is a 16 kda (146 amino acids) protein secreted from adipocytes and influences body weight homeostasis. in this study, human leptin was produced and secreted efficiently in escherichia coli using a novel bacillus sp. endoxylanase signal peptide. the endoxylanase signal sequence consisted of 28 amino acids (84 bp) was fused to the leptin structural gene. the fused gene was expressed using an inducible promoter (t7 or trc) by adding 1 mm iptg. using t7 promoter in e. coli bl21(de3), most of protein produced was in a premature form. using the trc promoter, which is weaker than t7, leptin was efficiently produced and secreted as a mature form (40% of total proteins) at 37 degrees c. however, most of leptin (about 90%) formed the inclusion bodies in the periplasmic space of e. coli. at 30 degrees c, ca. 90% of leptin was produced in a soluble form, but the total amount of leptin produced was 40% less than that obtained at 37 degrees c. when the periplasmic oxidoreductase of e. coli, dsba, was co-expressed, 69% of the secreted leptin (26% of total proteins) was produced as soluble form at 37 degrees c without the decrease of the amount of leptin produced.
antimicrobial activity of tea as affected by the degree of fermentation and manufacturing season.
bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas fluorescens, salmonella sp. and staphylococcus aureus were used to test the antimicrobial activity of tea flush extract and extracts of various tea products. among the six test organisms, p. fluorescens was the most sensitive to the extracts, while b. subtilis was the least sensitive. in general, antimicrobial activity decreased when the extents of tea fermentation increased. the antimicrobial activities of tea flush extract and extracts of tea products with different extents of fermentation varied with test organisms. tea flush and green tea, the unfermented tea, exerted the strongest antimicrobial activity followed by the partially fermented tea products such as longjing, tieh-kuan-ying, paochung, and oolong teas. on the other hand, black tea, the completely fermented tea, showed the least antimicrobial activity. it was also noted that extracts of oolong tea prepared in summer exhibited the strongest antimicrobial activity, followed by those prepared in spring, winter and fall.
structure and expression of a pyrimidine gene cluster from the extreme thermophile thermus strain zo5.
on a 4.7-kbp hindiii clone of thermus strain zo5 dna, complementing an aspartate  carbamoyltransferase mutation in escherichia coli, we identified a cluster of four potential open reading frames corresponding to genes pyrr, and pyrb, an unidentified open reading frame named bbc, and gene pyrc. the transcription initiation site was mapped at about 115 nucleotides upstream of the pyrr translation start codon. the cognate thermus pyr promoter also functions in heterologous expression of thermus pyr genes in e. coli. in thermus strain zo5, pyrb and pyrc gene expression is repressed three- to fourfold by uracil and increased twofold by arginine. based on the occurrence of several transcription signals in the thermus pyr promoter region and strong amino acid sequence identities (about 60%) between thermus pyrr and the pyrr attenuation proteins of two bacillus sp., we propose a regulatory mechanism involving transcriptional attenuation to control pyr gene expression in thermus. in contrast to pyr attenuation in bacillus spp., however, control of the thermus pyr gene cluster would not involve an antiterminator structure but would involve a translating ribosome for preventing formation of the terminator rna hairpin. the deduced amino acid sequence of thermus strain zo5 aspartate carbamoyltransferase (atcase; encoded by pyrb) exhibits the highest similarities (about 50% identical amino acids) with atcases from pseudomonas sp. for thermus strain zo5 dihydroorotase (dhoase; encoded by pyrc), the highest similarity scores (about 40% identity) were obtained with dhoases from b. caldolyticus and bacillus subtilis. the enzyme properties of atcase expressed from truncated versions of the thermus pyr gene cluster in e. coli suggest that thermus atcase is stabilized by dhoase and that the translation product of bbc plays a role in feedback inhibition of the atcase-dhoase complex.
an aspartate aminotransferase from an extremely thermophilic bacterium, thermus thermophilus hb8.
the aspartate aminotransferase gene (aspat, ec 2.6.1.1) of an extremely thermophilic bacterium, thermus thermophilus hb8, was cloned and sequenced, and its gene product was overproduced. the purified t. thermophilus aspat was stable up to about 80 degrees c at neutral ph. t. thermophilus aspat was strictly specific for acidic amino acid substrates, such as aspartate, glutamate, and the respective keto acids. the gene coding for t. thermophilus aspat showed that it comprised 1,155 bp with a high g+c content (70 mol%), and encoded a 385-residue protein with a molecular weight of 42,050. the amino acid sequence of t. thermophilus aspat deduced from its gene showed about 15, 46, and 29% homology with those from escherichia coli, bacillus sp. ym-2, and sulfolobus solfataricus, respectively. when the amino acid sequence of t. thermophilus aspat was compared with that of e. coli aspat, the number of cys was found to have decreased from 5 to 1, that of asn from 23 to 9, that of gln from 16 to 8, and that of asp from 20 to 13, all of which are known to be relatively labile at high temperatures. conversely, the number of pro was increased from 15 to 25, arg from 22 to 32, and glu 27 to 37. as shown by the e. coli aspat structure, there was a marked tendency for the extra prolyl residues to be located around the surface of the molecule. this was quite different from that in the case of reca protein, which shows an increased number of prolyl residues in the interior of its molecule. different strategies of different proteins as to prolyl contribution to thermostability have been suggested. despite the high degree of conservation of active-site residues, arg292 in e. coli aspat, which interacts with the distal carboxylate of the substrate, was not found in t. thermophilus aspat. arg89 may complement the function of arg292.
effect of organic amendments on bacterial multiplication in lake water.
in cayuga lake water amended with 30 micrograms of glucose or amino acids per ml, an added strain of pseudomonas fluorescens and indigenous bacteria grew extensively, pseudomonas sp. b4 and two rhizobia multiplied at a moderate extent, and introduced escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae multiplied but to only a slight degree. the amendments did not enhance growth of micrococcus flavus and arthrobacter citreus, and an asporogenous strain of bacillus subtilis decreased in numbers. the pseudomonads, rhizobia, e. coli and k. pneumoniae multiplied extensively when inoculated into sterile lake water amended with amino acids, a. citreus grew to a slight extent, but the numbers of m. flavus and b. subtilis did not change appreciably. in nonsterile lake water amended with 30 micrograms of trypticase soy broth per ml, the indigenous bacteria greatly increased in abundance, the pseudomonads, rhizobia, and e. coli developed to a lesser extent, the numbers of k. pneumoniae, a. citreus and m. flavus showed little increase, and b. subtilis decreased in numbers. tests in pure culture containing 2 to 64 micrograms of trypticase soy broth per ml demonstrated good growth of p. fluorescens, pseudomonas sp. b4, and the rhizobia at all concentrations; an initial decline followed by growth of e. coli, k. pneumoniae and r. leguminosarum biovar phaseoli at low concentrations; little or no growth or decline at the low levels but multiplication at the high levels by a. citreus and b. subtilis; and decline of m. flavus. it is proposed that the apparent ks value, mumax value, length of lag phase and resistance to stress can be used to predict behavior of bacteria in lake water receiving low levels of organic nutrients.
toxicity of paraquat to microorganisms.
the biochemical response of the microorganisms lipomyces starkeyi (lod & rij), escherichia coli k-12 w3110, bacillus subtilis 168 (marburg) and pseudomonas sp. strain tto1 to the presence of growth-inhibitory concentrations of paraquat was studied. paraquat was added to each culture at a concentration previously determined to reduce the culture growth rate by up to 50%. the changes in activity of a number of enzymes previously shown to be associated with the defense of the mammalian system against the action of paraquat were studied. while the response of e. coli was in agreement with that found in other studies of this microorganism and supports a commonly accepted mechanism for paraquat toxicity, the results obtained with l. starkeyi, b. subtilis, and pseudomonas sp. strain tto1 suggest that other mechanisms exist for protection against the toxicity of paraquat.
the site of inhibition of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis by azureomycin b, a new antibiotic.
azureomycin b (10 micrograms/ml), a new antibiotic from pseudonocardia azurea nov. sp., caused the accumulation of lipid intermediate and inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis in an invitro system using a particulate fraction from bacillus megaterium km with udp-murnac-[3h]pentapeptide and cold udp-glcnac or cold udp-murnac-pentapeptide and udp-[3h]glcnac as substrates. at higher concentrations of azureomycin b (over 100 microgram/ml), lipid intermediate accumulation was also inhibited. when particulate fraction from escherichia coli y-10 and udp-[14c[glcnac and cold udp-murnac-pentapeptide were used, accumulation of lipid intermediate and inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis were also observed. these results indicate that the primary target of azureomycin b is the transfer of the disaccharide peptide unit (glcnac-murnac-pentapeptide) from lipid-bound precursor to acceptor.
repression of staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria. ii. causes of inhibition.
two food bacteria, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas sp. cs-1, inhibited an enterotoxigenic strain of staphylococcus aureus, apparently by out-competing it for nutrients. five others, bacillus cereus, proteus vulgaris, escherichia coli h-52, aerobacter aerogenes, and achromobacter sp., inhibited by means of antibiotic substances which were seitz-filterable, dialyzable, and stable at 90 c for 10 min. inhibition was not caused by changes in ph, oxidation-reduction potential, or production of peroxide or fatty acids. the concentrated antibiotic material from e. coli h-52 contained amino acids but not peptides and was especially effective against staphylococci and micrococci.
