TI  - Research into acetone removal from air by biofiltration using a biofilter with straight structure plates.
AB  - The biological air treatment method is based on the biological destruction of organic compounds using certain cultures of microorganisms. This method is simple and may be applied in many branches of industry. The main element of biological air treatment devices is a filter charge. Tests were carried out using a new-generation laboratory air purifier with a plate structure. This purifier is called biofilter. The biofilter has a special system for packing material humidification which does not require additional energy inputs. In order to extend the packing material's durability, it was composed of thermally treated birch fibre. Pollutant (acetone) biodegradation occurred on thermally treated wood fibre in this research. According to the performed tests and the received results, the process of biodestruction was highly efficient. When acetone was passed through biofilter's packing material at 0.08 m s-1 rate, the efficiency of the biofiltration process was from 70% up to 90%. The species of bacteria capable of removing acetone vapour from the air, i.e. Bacillus (B. cereus, B. subtilis), Pseudomonas (P. aeruginosa, P. putida), Stapylococcus (S. aureus) and Rhodococcus sp., was identified in this study during the process of biofiltration. Their amount in the biological packing material changed from 1.6 x 107 to 3.7 x 1011 CFU g-1.
TI  - Specific gamma-aminobutyrate chemotaxis in pseudomonads with different lifestyle.
AB  - The PctC chemoreceptor of Pseudomonas aeruginosa mediates chemotaxis with high specificity to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). This compound is present everywhere in nature and has multiple functions, including being a human neurotransmitter or plant signaling compound. Because P. aeruginosa is ubiquitously distributed in nature and able to infect and colonize different hosts, the physiological relevance of GABA taxis is unclear, but it has been suggested that bacterial attraction to neurotransmitters may enhance virulence. We report the identification of McpG as a specific GABA chemoreceptor in non-pathogenic Pseudomonas putida KT2440. As with PctC, GABA was found to bind McpG tightly. The analysis of chimeras comprising the PctC and McpG ligand-binding domains fused to the Tar signaling domain showed very high GABA sensitivities. We also show that PctC inactivation does not alter virulence in Caenorhabditis elegans. Significant amounts of GABA were detected in tomato root exudates, and deletion of mcpG reduced root colonization that requires chemotaxis through agar. The C. elegans data and the detection of a GABA receptor in non-pathogenic species indicate that GABA taxis may not be related to virulence in animal systems but may be of importance in the context of colonization and infection of plant roots by soil-dwelling pseudomonads.
TI  - Engineering mediator-based electroactivity in the obligate aerobic bacterium Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida strains are being developed as microbial production hosts for  production of a range of amphiphilic and hydrophobic biochemicals. P. putida's obligate aerobic growth thereby can be an economical and technical challenge because it requires constant rigorous aeration and often causes reactor foaming. Here, we engineered a strain of P. putida KT2440 that can produce phenazine redox-mediators from Pseudomonas aeruginosa to allow partial redox balancing with an electrode under oxygen-limited conditions. P. aeruginosa is known to employ its phenazine-type redox mediators for electron exchange with an anode in bioelectrochemical systems (BES). We transferred the seven core phenazine biosynthesis genes phzA-G and the two specific genes phzM and phzS required for pyocyanin synthesis from P. aeruginosa on two inducible plasmids into P. putida KT2440. The best clone, P. putida pPhz, produced 45 mg/L pyocyanin over 25 h of growth, which was visible as blue color formation and is comparable to the pyocyanin production of P. aeruginosa. This new strain was then characterized under different oxygen-limited conditions with electrochemical redox control and changes in central energy metabolism were evaluated in comparison to the unmodified P. putida KT2440. In the new strain, phenazine synthesis with supernatant concentrations up to 33 mug/mL correlated linearly with the ability to discharge electrons to an anode, whereby phenazine-1-carboxylic acid served as the dominating redox mediator. P. putida pPhz sustained strongly oxygen-limited metabolism for up to 2 weeks at up to 12 muA/cm(2) anodic current density. Together, this work lays a foundation for future oxygen-limited biocatalysis with P. putida strains.
TI  - Pan-genome dynamics of Pseudomonas gene complements enriched across hexachlorocyclohexane dumpsite.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Phylogenetic heterogeneity across Pseudomonas genus is complemented by its diverse genome architecture enriched by accessory genetic elements (plasmids, transposons, and integrons) conferring resistance across this genus. Here, we sequenced a stress tolerant genotype i.e. Pseudomonas sp. strain RL isolated from a hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) contaminated pond (45 mg of total HCH g(-1) sediment) and further compared its gene repertoire with 17 reference ecotypes belonging to P. stutzeri, P. mendocina, P. aeruginosa, P. psychrotolerans and P. denitrificans, representing metabolically diverse ecosystems (i.e. marine, clinical, and soil/sludge). Metagenomic data from HCH contaminated pond sediment and similar HCH contaminated sites were further used to analyze the pan-genome dynamics of Pseudomonas genotypes enriched across increasing HCH gradient. RESULTS: Although strain RL demonstrated clear species demarcation (ANI </= 80.03%) from the rest of its phylogenetic relatives, it was found to be closest to P. stutzeri clade which was further complemented functionally. Comparative functional analysis elucidated strain specific enrichment of metabolic pathways like alpha-linoleic acid degradation and carbazole degradation in Pseudomonas sp. strain RL and P. stutzeri XLDN-R, respectively. Composition based methods (%codon bias and %G + C difference) further highlighted the significance of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in evolution of nitrogen metabolism, two-component system (TCS) and methionine metabolism across the Pseudomonas genomes used in this study. An intact mobile class-I integron (3,552 bp) with a captured gene cassette encoding for dihydrofolate reductase (dhfra1) was detected in strain RL, distinctly demarcated from other integron harboring species (i.e. P. aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, and P. putida). Mobility of this integron was confirmed by its association with Tnp21-like transposon (95% identity) suggesting stress specific mobilization across HCH contaminated sites. Metagenomics data from pond sediment and recently surveyed HCH adulterated soils revealed the in situ enrichment of integron associated transposase gene (TnpA6100) across increasing HCH contamination (0.7 to 450 mg HCH g(-1) of soil). CONCLUSIONS: Unlocking the potential of comparative genomics supplemented with metagenomics, we have attempted to resolve the environment and strain specific demarcations across 18 Pseudomonas gene complements. Pan-genome analyses of these strains indicate at astoundingly diverse metabolic strategies and provide genetic basis for the cosmopolitan existence of this taxon.
TI  - The c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase BifA regulates biofilm development in Pseudomonas  putida.
AB  - We previously showed the isolation of biofilmpersistent Pseudomonas putida mutants that fail to undergo biofilm dispersal upon entry in stationary phase. Two such mutants were found to bear insertions in PP0914, encoding a GGDEF/EAL domain protein with high similarity to Pseudomon asaeruginosa BifA. Here we show the phenotypic characterization of a DeltabifA mutant in P. putida KT2442.This mutant displayed increased biofilm and pellicle formation, cell aggregation in liquid medium and decreased starvation-induced biofilm dispersal relative to the wild type. Unlike its P. aeruginosa counterpart, P. putida BifA did not affect swarming motility. The hyperadherent phenotype of the DeltabifA mutant correlates with a general increase in cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) levels, Congo Red-binding exopolyaccharide production and transcription of the adhesin-encoding lapA gene. Integrity of the EAL motif and a modified GGDEF motif (altered to GGDQF)were crucial for BifA activity, and c-di-GMP depletion by overexpression of a heterologous c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase in the DeltabifA mutant restored wild-type biofilm dispersal and lapA expression.Our results indicate that BifA is a phosphodiesterase involved in the regulation of the c-di-GMP pool and required for the generation of the low c-di-GMP signal that triggers starvation-induced biofilm dispersal.
TI  - Genetic Lineages and Antimicrobial Resistance in Pseudomonas spp. Isolates Recovered from Food Samples.
AB  - Raw food is a reservoir of Pseudomonas isolates that could be disseminated to consumers. The presence of Pseudomonas spp. was studied in food samples, and the phenotypic and genotypic characterizations of the recovered isolates were analyzed. Two samples of meat (3%, turkey and beef) and 13 of vegetables (22%, 7 green peppers and 6 tomatoes) contained Pseudomonas spp. A total of 20 isolates were identified, and were classified as follows (number of isolates): P. aeruginosa (5), P. putida (5), P. nitroreducens (4), P. fulva (2), P. mosselli (1), P. mendocina (1), P. monteilii (1), and Pseudomonas sp. (1). These 20 Pseudomonas isolates were clonally different by pulsed-field-gel-electrophoresis, and were resistant to the following antibiotics: ticarcillin (85%), aztreonam (30%), cefepime (10%), imipenem (10%), and meropenem (5%), but were susceptible to ceftazidime, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, doripenem, gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and colistin. Only one strain (Ps158) presented a class 1 integron lacking the 3' conserved segment. The five P. aeruginosa strains were typed by multilocus sequence typing in five different sequence-types (ST17, ST270, ST800, ST1455, and ST1456), and different mutations were detected in protein OprD that were classified in three groups. One strain (Ps159) showed a new insertion sequence (ISPa47) truncating the oprD gene, and conferring resistance to imipenem.
TI  - Biosynthesis of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyalkanoates) by recombinant Escherichia coli from glucose.
AB  - The polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) copolymers consisting of short-chain-length (scl)  and medium-chain-length (mcl) monomers have various properties ranging from stiff to flexible depending on the molar fraction of the monomer compositions. It has been reported that PhaG, which is first known as a (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP)-CoA transferase, actually functions as a 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP thioesterase, and the product of PP0763 gene from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 has a (R)-3-hydroxyacyl (3HA)-CoA ligase activity (Appl. Environ. Microbiol., 78, 519-527, 2012). In this study, we found a new (R)-3HA-CoA ligase (the product of PA3924 gene) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO. The PA3924 gene was coexpressed with PHA synthase 1 gene (phaC1Ps) and phaGPs gene from Pseudomonas sp. 61-3, and beta-ketothiolase gene (phbARe) and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase gene (phbBRe) from Ralstonia eutropha in Escherichia coli LS5218 at 25 degrees C. As a result, the copolymer containing 94.6 mol% 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) and 5.4 mol% mcl-3-hydroxyalkanoates (3HA) consisting of C8, C10, C12 and C14 was synthesized by recombinant E. coli LS5218 from glucose as the sole carbon source. The concentration of P(3HB-co-3HA) (scl-co-mcl-PHA) synthesized by the recombinant E. coli LS5218 harboring phaC1Ps, phaGPs, phbABRe and the PA3924 genes was approximately 7-fold higher than that of the recombinant LS5218 harboring phaC1Ps, phaGPs, phbABRe and the PP0763 genes. The number-average molecular weight of the P(3HB-co-5.4% 3HA) copolymer was 233 x 103, which was relatively high molecular weight. In addition, the physical and the mechanical properties of the copolymer were demonstrated to improve the brittleness of P(3HB) homopolymer.
TI  - [Analysis of functionalized arene degradation pathways in model water-organic media].
AB  - The degradation of functionalized arenes exposed to a mixed culture of chemoorganoaeroheterotrophic microorganisms has been shown to predominantly occur through oxidative intradiol decyclization of the aromatic ring. The spatial structure of the catalytic center of intradiol dioxygenase and its complexes with catechol and protocatechuic acid has been characterized using quantum chemical modeling procedures. The dependence of the total energy of the enzyme-substrate complex on the length of the bond between the iron atom and the hydroxyl group of the substrate (Fe-4-OH and Fe-1-OH) before and after the separation of water and a tyrosine residue (Tyr) from the catalytic center has been demonstrated for the first time.
TI  - Type III secretion system and virulence markers highlight similarities and differences between human- and plant-associated pseudomonads related to Pseudomonas fluorescens and P. putida.
AB  - Pseudomonas fluorescens is commonly considered a saprophytic rhizobacterium devoid of pathogenic potential. Nevertheless, the recurrent isolation of strains from clinical human cases could indicate the emergence of novel strains originating from the rhizosphere reservoir, which could be particularly resistant to the immune system and clinical treatment. The importance of type three secretion systems (T3SSs) in the related Pseudomonas aeruginosa nosocomial species and the occurrence of this secretion system in plant-associated P. fluorescens raise the question of whether clinical isolates may also harbor T3SSs. In this study, isolates associated with clinical infections and identified in hospitals as belonging to P. fluorescens were compared with fluorescent pseudomonads harboring T3SSs isolated from plants. Bacterial isolates were tested for (i) their genetic relationships based on their 16S rRNA phylogeny, (ii) the presence of T3SS genes by PCR, and (iii) their infectious potential on animals and plants under environmental or physiological temperature conditions. Two groups of bacteria were delineated among the clinical isolates. The first group encompassed thermotolerant (41 degrees C) isolates from patients suffering from blood infections; these isolates were finally found to not belong to P. fluorescens but were closely related and harbored highly conserved T3SS genes belonging to the Ysc-T3SS family, like the T3SSs from P. aeruginosa. The second group encompassed isolates from patients suffering from cystic fibrosis; these isolates belonged to P. fluorescens and harbored T3SS genes belonging to the Hrp1-T3SS family found commonly in plant-associated P. fluorescens.
TI  - Isolation of VIM-2-producing Pseudomonas monteilii clinical strains disseminated  in a tertiary hospital in northern Spain.
AB  - We describe here the occurrence of blaVIM-2 in 10 carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas monteilii strains isolated from different clinical samples from patients at the University Hospital Marques de Valdecilla in northern Spain. All the blaVIM-2-harboring P. monteilii isolates possessed a class 1 integron, with the cassette array [intI1_blaVIM-2_aac(6')-Ib_qacEDelta1_sul1]. Our results show the emergence of VIM-2-producing multidrug-resistant species other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Pseudomonas putida in a Spanish hospital. P. monteilii, although sporadically isolated, should also be considered an important metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) reservoir.
TI  - Diversity of small RNAs expressed in Pseudomonas species.
AB  - RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has revealed several hundreds of previously undetected small RNAs (sRNAs) in all bacterial species investigated, including strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas syringae. Nonetheless, only little is known about the extent of conservation of expressed sRNAs across strains and species. In this study, we have used RNA-seq to identify sRNAs in P. putida DOT-T1E and Pseudomonas extremaustralis 14-3b. This is the first strain of P. extremaustralis and the second strain of P. putida to have their transcriptomes analysed for sRNAs, and we identify the presence of around 150 novel sRNAs in each strain. Furthermore, we provide a comparison based on sequence conservation of all the sRNAs detected by RNA-seq in the Pseudomonas species investigated so far. Our results show that the extent of sRNA conservation across different species is very limited. In addition, when comparing the sRNAs expressed in different strains of the same species, we observe that numerous sRNAs exhibit a strain-specific expression pattern. These results support the idea that the evolution of most bacterial sRNAs is rapid, which limits the extent of both interspecies and intraspecies conservation.
TI  - The c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase BifA is involved in the virulence of bacteria from the Pseudomonas syringae complex.
AB  - In a recent screen for novel virulence factors involved in the interaction between Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi and the olive tree, a mutant was selected that contained a transposon insertion in a putative cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) phosphodiesterase-encoding gene. This gene displayed high similarity to bifA of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. Here, we examined the role of BifA in free-living and virulence-related phenotypes of two bacterial plant pathogens in the Pseudomonas syringae complex, the tumour-inducing pathogen of woody hosts, P. savastanoi pv. savastanoi NCPPB 3335, and the pathogen of tomato and Arabidopsis, P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000. We showed that deletion of the bifA gene resulted in decreased swimming motility of both bacteria and inhibited swarming motility of DC3000. In contrast, overexpression of BifA in P. savastanoi pv. savastanoi had a positive impact on swimming motility and negatively affected biofilm formation. Deletion of bifA in NCPPB 3335 and DC3000 resulted in reduced fitness and virulence of the microbes in olive (NCPPB 3335) and tomato (DC3000) plants. In addition, real-time monitoring of olive plants infected with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged P. savastanoi cells displayed an altered spatial distribution of mutant DeltabifA cells inside olive knots compared with the wild-type strain. All free-living phenotypes that were altered in both DeltabifA mutants, as well as the virulence of the NCPPB 3335 DeltabifA mutant in olive plants, were fully rescued by complementation with P. aeruginosa BifA, whose phosphodiesterase activity has been demonstrated. Thus, these results suggest that P. syringae and P. savastanoi BifA are also active phosphodiesterases. This first demonstration of the involvement of a putative phosphodiesterase in the virulence of the P. syringae complex provides confirmation of the role of c-di-GMP signalling in the virulence of this group of plant pathogens.
TI  - Draft genome sequence analysis of a Pseudomonas putida W15Oct28 strain with antagonistic activity to Gram-positive and Pseudomonas sp. pathogens.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida is a member of the fluorescent pseudomonads known to produce the yellow-green fluorescent pyoverdine siderophore. P. putida W15Oct28, isolated from a stream in Brussels, was found to produce compound(s) with antimicrobial activity against the opportunistic pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, an unusual characteristic for P. putida. The active compound production only occurred in media with low iron content and without organic nitrogen sources. Transposon mutants which lost their antimicrobial activity had the majority of insertions in genes involved in the biosynthesis of pyoverdine, although purified pyoverdine was not responsible for the antagonism. Separation of compounds present in culture supernatants revealed the presence of two fractions containing highly hydrophobic molecules active against P. aeruginosa. Analysis of the draft genome confirmed the presence of putisolvin biosynthesis genes and the corresponding lipopeptides were found to contribute to the antimicrobial activity. One cluster of ten genes was detected, comprising a NAD-dependent epimerase, an acetylornithine aminotransferase, an acyl CoA dehydrogenase, a short chain dehydrogenase, a fatty acid desaturase and three genes for a RND efflux pump. P. putida W15Oct28 genome also contains 56 genes encoding TonB-dependent receptors, conferring a high capacity to utilize pyoverdines from other pseudomonads. One unique feature of W15Oct28 is also the presence of different secretion systems including a full set of genes for type IV secretion, and several genes for type VI secretion and their VgrG effectors.
TI  - Proteomic characterization of the outer membrane vesicle of Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
AB  - Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are produced by various pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. In this study, we isolated OMVs from a representative soil bacterium, Pseudomonas putida KT2440, which has a biodegradative activity toward various aromatic compounds. Proteomic analysis identified the outer membrane proteins (OMPs) OprC, OprD, OprE, OprF, OprH, OprG, and OprW as major components of the OMV of P. putida KT2440. The production of OMVs was dependent on the nutrient availability in the culture media, and the up- or down-regulation of specific OMPs was observed according to the culture conditions. In particular, porins (e.g., benzoate-specific porin, BenF-like porin) and enzymes (e.g., catechol 1,2-dioxygenase, benzoate dioxygenase) for benzoate degradation were uniquely found in OMVs prepared from P. putida KT2440 that were cultured in media containing benzoate as the energy source. OMVs of P. putida KT2440 showed low pathological activity toward cultured cells that originated from human lung cells, which suggests their potential as adjuvants or OMV vaccine carriers. Our results suggest that the protein composition of the OMVs of P. putida KT2440 reflects the characteristics of the total proteome of P. putida KT2440.
TI  - Human oxygen sensing may have origins in prokaryotic elongation factor Tu prolyl-hydroxylation.
AB  - The roles of 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent prolyl-hydroxylases in eukaryotes include collagen stabilization, hypoxia sensing, and translational regulation. The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) sensing system is conserved in animals, but not in other organisms. However, bioinformatics imply that 2OG-dependent prolyl-hydroxylases (PHDs) homologous to those acting as sensing components for the HIF system in animals occur in prokaryotes. We report cellular, biochemical, and crystallographic analyses revealing that Pseudomonas prolyl-hydroxylase domain containing protein (PPHD) contain a 2OG oxygenase related in structure and function to the animal PHDs. A Pseudomonas aeruginosa PPHD knockout mutant displays impaired growth in the presence of iron chelators and increased production of the virulence factor pyocyanin. We identify elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) as a PPHD substrate, which undergoes prolyl-4-hydroxylation on its switch I loop. A crystal structure of PPHD reveals striking similarity to human PHD2 and a Chlamydomonas reinhardtii prolyl-4-hydroxylase. A crystal structure of PPHD complexed with intact EF-Tu reveals that major conformational changes occur in both PPHD and EF-Tu, including a >20-A movement of the EF-Tu switch I loop. Comparison of the PPHD structures with those of HIF and collagen PHDs reveals conservation in substrate recognition despite diverse biological roles and origins. The observed changes will be useful in designing new types of 2OG oxygenase inhibitors based on various conformational states, rather than active site iron chelators, which make up most reported 2OG oxygenase inhibitors. Structurally informed phylogenetic analyses suggest that the role of prolyl-hydroxylation in human hypoxia sensing has ancient origins.
TI  - The Pseudomonas community in metal-contaminated sediments as revealed by quantitative PCR: a link with metal bioavailability.
AB  - Pseudomonas bacteria are ubiquitous Gram-negative and aerobic microorganisms that are known to harbor metal resistance mechanisms such as efflux pumps and intracellular redox enzymes. Specific Pseudomonas bacteria have been quantified in some metal-contaminated environments, but the entire Pseudomonas population has been poorly investigated under these conditions, and the link with metal bioavailability was not previously examined. In the present study, quantitative PCR and cell cultivation were used to monitor and characterize the Pseudomonas population at 4 different sediment sites contaminated with various levels of metals. At the same time, total metals and metal bioavailability (as estimated using an HCl 1 m extraction) were measured. It was found that the total level of Pseudomonas, as determined by qPCR using two different genes (oprI and the 16S rRNA gene), was positively and significantly correlated with total and HCl-extractable Cu, Co, Ni, Pb and Zn, with high correlation coefficients (>0.8). Metal-contaminated sediments featured isolates of the Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas lutea and Pseudomonas aeruginosa groups, with other bacterial genera such as Mycobacterium, Klebsiella and Methylobacterium. It is concluded that Pseudomonas bacteria do proliferate in metal-contaminated sediments, but are still part of a complex community.
TI  - Production of silver nanoparticles with strong and stable antimicrobial activity  against highly pathogenic and multidrug resistant bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To synthesize, characterize, and analyze antimicrobial activity of AgNPs of Escherichia hermannii (SHE), Citrobacter sedlakii (S11P), and Pseudomonas putida (S5). METHODS: The synthesized AgNPs were examined using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) and, zeta potential, and the size and the morphology obtained from the three different isolates were also confirmed by TEM. RESULTS: Among the three isolates tested, SHE showed the best antimicrobial activity due to the presence of small (4-12 nm) and stable (-22 mV) AgNPs. Stability of AgNPs was also investigated and found to be dependent on the nature of isolates. CONCLUSION: Produced AgNPs showed particle stability and antimicrobial efficacy up to 90 days of production. Our AgNPs exhibited greater antimicrobial activity compared with gentamicin against P. aeruginosa isolates and vancomycin against S. aureus and MRSA isolates at very low concentration (0.0002 mg per Microliters).
TI  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa MdaB and WrbA are water-soluble two-electron quinone oxidoreductases with the potential to defend against oxidative stress.
AB  - Water-soluble quinone oxidoreductases capable of reducing quinone substrates via  a concerted two-electron mechanism have been implicated in bacterial antioxidant defence. Twoelectron transfer avoids formation of dangerously reactive semi-quinone intermediates, moreover previous work in Pseudomonas putida indicated a direct protective effect for the quinols generated by an over-expressed oxidoreductase. Here, the Pseudomonas aeruginosa orthologs of five quinone oxidoreductases--MdaB, ChrR, WrbA, NfsB, and NQO1--were tested for their possible role in defending P. aeruginosa against H2O2 challenge. In in vitro assays, each enzyme was shown to reduce quinone substrates with only minimal semiquinone formation. However, when each was individually over-expressed in P. aeruginosa no overt H2O2-protective phenotype was observed. It was shown that this was due to a masking effect of the P. aeruginosa catalase, KatA; in a katA mutant, H2O2 challenged strains over-expressing the WrbA and MdaB orthologs grew significantly better than the empty plasmid control. A growth advantage was also observed for H2O2 challenged P. putida strains over-expressing P. aeruginosa wrbA, mdaB or katA. Despite not conferring a growth advantage to wild type P. aeruginosa, it is possible that these quinone oxidoreductases defend against H2O2 toxicity at lower concentrations.
TI  - Hierarchical management of carbon sources is regulated similarly by the CbrA/B systems in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The CbrA/B system in pseudomonads is involved in the utilization of carbon sources and carbon catabolite repression (CCR) through the activation of the small RNAs crcZ in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and crcZ and crcY in Pseudomonas putida. Interestingly, previous works reported that the CbrA/B system activity in P. aeruginosa PAO1 and P. putida KT2442 responded differently to the presence of different carbon sources, thus raising the question of the exact nature of the signal(s) detected by CbrA. Here, we demonstrated that the CbrA/B/CrcZ(Y) signal transduction pathway is similarly activated in the two Pseudomonas species. We show that the CbrA sensor kinase is fully interchangeable between the two species and, moreover, responds similarly to the presence of different carbon sources. In addition, a metabolomics analysis supported the hypothesis that CCR responds to the internal energy status of the cell, as the internal carbon/nitrogen ratio seems to determine CCR and non-CCR conditions. The strong difference found in the 2-oxoglutarate/glutamine ratio between CCR and non-CCR conditions points to the close relationship between carbon and nitrogen availability, or the relationship between the CbrA/B and NtrB/C systems, suggesting that both regulatory systems sense the same sort or interrelated signal.
TI  - Investigation of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa  clinical isolates.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance in clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes have been identified in many bacteria within the Enterobactericeae family, they have not been detected in P. aeruginosa isolates. Subjects and Methods : Identification of the isolates and testing of antibiotic susceptibility was performed in Vitek2 Compact (Biomeriux, France) and Phoinex (BD, USA) automated systems. Screening for the qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, qnrC, aac (6')-Ib-cr and qepA genes was carried out by PCR amplification and aac (6')-Ib-cr DNA sequencing. RESULTS: The qnr and the qepA genes were not detected in any of P. aeruginosa isolates. The aac (6')-Ib gene was detected in six of the isolates and positive isolates for aac (6')-Ib were sequenced for detection of the aac (6')-Ib-cr variant but aac (6')-Ib-cr was not detected in any isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes have so far not been identified in P. aeruginosa isolates. However, qnrB have detected in P. florescens and P. putida isolates. This is the first study conducted on the qnrA, qnrB, qnrS and qnrC genes as well as the qepA and aac (6')-Ib-cr genes in P. aeruginosa clinical isolates.
TI  - A model-based approach to detect interspecific interactions during biofilm development.
AB  - A model-based approach was developed to detect interspecific interactions during  biofilm development. This approach relied on the comparison of experimental data with a simple null model of biofilm growth dynamics where individual species grew independently of one another, except that they competed for space. Such a model was directly parameterized with a 4D confocal image series of biofilms and then used as a null model to detect interspecific interactions between pairs of bacterial species. This approach was tested in two bispecific competitive trials. In the first trial, the progressive exclusion of Pseudomonas fluorescens by Pseudomonas putida appeared to be due solely to the different intrinsic growth rates of the two strains. In contrast, modelling results suggested the presence of interference competition between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. putida in mixed biofilms. The authors' approach enables the detection of ecologically relevant interactions which constitute a prerequisite to building a comprehensive view of the dynamics and functioning of spatially structured bacterial communities.
TI  - Identification of water-conditioned Pseudomonas aeruginosa by Raman microspectroscopy on a single cell level.
AB  - The identification of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from samples of bottled natural mineral water by the analysis of subcultures is time consuming and other species of the authentic Pseudomonas group can be a problem. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the influence of different aquatic environmental conditions (pH, mineral content) and growth phases on the cultivation-free differentiation between water-conditioned Pseudomonas spp. by applying Raman microspectroscopy. The final dataset was comprised of over 7500 single-cell Raman spectra, including the species Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens and P. putida, in order to prove the feasibility of the introduced approach. The collection of spectra was standardized by automated measurements of viable stained bacterial cells. The discrimination was influenced by the growth phase at the beginning of the water adaptation period and by the type of mineral water. Different combinations of the parameters were tested and they resulted in accuracies of up to 85% for the identification of P. aeruginosa from independent samples by applying chemometric analysis.
TI  - Structure, interactions and evolutionary implications of a domain-swapped lectin  dimer from Mycobacterium smegmatis.
AB  - Crystal structure determination of the lectin domain of MSMEG_3662 from Mycobacterium smegmatis and its complexes with mannose and methyl-alpha-mannose, the first effort of its kind on a mycobacterial lectin, reveals a structure very similar to beta-prism II fold lectins from plant sources, but with extensive unprecedented domain swapping in dimer formation. The two subunits in a dimer often show small differences in structure, but the two domains, not always related by 2-fold symmetry, have the same structure. Each domain carries three sugar-binding sites, similar to those in plant lectins, one on each Greek key motif. The occurrence of beta-prism II fold lectins in bacteria, with characteristics similar to those from plants, indicates that this family of lectins is of ancient origin and had evolved into a mature system before bacteria and plants diverged. In plants, the number of binding sites per domain varies between one and three, whereas the number is two in the recently reported lectin domains from Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. An analysis of the sequences of the lectins and the lectin domains shows that the level of sequence similarity among the three Greek keys in each domain has a correlation with the number of binding sites in it. Furthermore, sequence conservation among the lectins from different species is the highest for that Greek key which carries a binding site in all of them. Thus, it would appear that carbohydrate binding influences the course of the evolution of the lectin.
TI  - The ColRS signal transduction system responds to the excess of external zinc, iron, manganese, and cadmium.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ColRS two-component system has been shown to contribute to the membrane functionality and stress tolerance of Pseudomonas putida as well as to the virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and plant pathogenic Xanthomonas species. However, the conditions activating the ColRS pathway and the signal(s) sensed by ColS have remained unknown. Here we aimed to analyze the role of the ColRS system in metal tolerance of P. putida and to test whether ColS can respond to metal excess. RESULTS: We show that the ColRS system is necessary for P. putida to tolerate the excess of iron and zinc, and that it also contributes to manganese and cadmium tolerance. Excess of iron, zinc, manganese or cadmium activates ColRS signaling and as a result modifies the expression of ColR-regulated genes. Our data suggest that the genes in the ColR regulon are functionally redundant, as several loci have to be deleted to observe a significant decrease in metal tolerance. Site-directed mutagenesis of ColS revealed that excess of iron and, surprisingly, also zinc are sensed by a conserved ExxE motif in ColS's periplasmic domain. While ColS is able to sense different metals, it still discriminates between the two oxidation states of iron, specifically responding to ferric and not ferrous iron. We propose a signal perception model involving a dimeric ColS, where each monomer donates one ExxE motif for metal binding. CONCLUSIONS: Several transition metals are essential for living organisms in certain amounts, but toxic in excess. We show that ColRS is a sensor system which detects and responds to the excess of physiologically important metals such as zinc, iron and manganese. Thus, the ColRS system is an important factor for metal homeostasis and tolerance in P. putida.
TI  - Fusion protein bilayer fabrication composed of recombinant azurin/cytochrome P450 by the sortase-mediated ligation method.
AB  - Recently, the fabrication of protein bilayer has been required for the development of protein or enzyme complex formation. In the present study, we fabricated a fusion protein bilayer composed of recombinant azurin-cytochrome P450, which was synthesized by a site-specific sortase-mediated ligation method. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin was modified by DNA recombinant technique, for enzymatic ligation and immobilization. The Pseudomonas putida cytochrome P450 was also modified for enzymatic ligation. The recombinant metalloproteins were conjugated via the sortase A. The conjugation was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and UV-vis. Then, the prepared fusion protein was immobilized on Au substrate, by the self-assembly method. The Azu-P450 (recombinant azurin-cytochrome P450) fusion protein layer was confirmed by AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy) and SERS (Surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy), to confirm the fusion protein bilayer orientation. Moreover, the electrochemical property of Azu-P450 was observed by cyclic voltammetry (CV). As a result, the Azu-P450 fusion protein bilayer shows good orientation on the Au substrate. Also, the original redox property of this fusion protein bilayer has been well maintained. The proposed fusion protein bilayer can.
TI  - Continuous-flow extractive desorption electrospray ionization coupled to normal phase separations and for direct lipid analysis from cell extracts.
AB  - Normal phase liquid chromatography is a common mode for chiral separations. Many  chiral amines are used as drugs or are important intermediates for drug synthesis. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry is well known for its high sensitivity. However, when using normal phase liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization is hampered by the poor ionization efficiency of analytes from organic eluents. Continuous-flow extractive desorption electrospray ionization, which introduces the eluents through a hypodermic needle into the electrospray plume is demonstrated here for its success to interface normal phase liquid chromatography to mass spectrometry detection. Such an approach was shown to be as or more sensitive than ultraviolet detection for a selected set of aromatic amine-functionalized enantiomers. Also demonstrated is the direct infusion of cell extracts to monitor phospholipids from three different bacterial cells. Despite their presence in non-electrospray-ionization-friendly extraction solvents, continuous-flow extractive desorption electrospray ionization enabled the sensitive detection of phospholipids and the ability to tune ion forms through incorporation of different spray modifiers.
TI  - Bacterial study of fin rot in brown trout by API20E.
AB  - In order to study caudal fin rot with emphasis on Aeromonas sp. and Pseudomonas sp. in Salmo trutta caspius from the salmonids propagation and breeding center of Shahid Bahonar of kelardasht region, One hundred and eighty brood stocks having fin damage symptoms were chosen. Two bacterial samples from each fish were cultured on Aeromonas and Pseudomonas specific media. To identify isolated bacterial colonies by API20E diagnostic system, samples obtained from bacterial cultures 18 to 24 h were prepared and were inoculated into the cupules of test strips. At the end of incubation, after addition of reagents if they are necessary, the results recorded on the results sheets and were analyzed by Apiwe software. The results of API20E diagnostic systems showed that Aeromonas genus bacteria including Aeromonas hydrophila with 100% frequency while the bacterial genus of Pseudomonas including Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida with 36. 84, 31.57 and 21.05% frequency, respectively. Also 10.25% of Pseudomonas samples were unidentified.
TI  - Modulation of primary cell function of host Pseudomonas bacteria by the conjugative plasmid pCAR1.
AB  - The impacts of plasmid carriage on the host cell were comprehensively analysed using the conjugative plasmid pCAR1 in three different Pseudomonas hosts, P. putida KT2440, P. aeruginosa PAO1 and P. fluorescens Pf0-1. Plasmid carriage reduced host fitness, swimming motility, and resistance to osmotic or pH stress. Plasmid carriage brought about alterations in primary metabolic capacities in the TCA cycle of the hosts. Differentially transcribed genes in the three hosts associated with plasmid carriage were identified by growth phase-dependent transcriptome analyses. Plasmid carriage commonly showed a greater effect on the host transcriptome at the transition and early stationary phases. The transcriptome alterations were similar between KT2440 and PAO1. Transcriptions of numbers of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, F-type ATPase, and RNAP core in both strains were not suppressed enough in the early stationary phase by plasmid carriage. These responses may have been responsible for the reduction in host fitness, motility and stress resistances. Host-specific responses to plasmid carriage were transcriptional changes of genes on putative prophage or foreign DNA regions. The extents of the impacts on host phenotypes and transcriptomes were similarly greatest in KT2440 and lowest in Pf0-1. These findings suggest that host cell function was actively regulated by plasmid carriage.
TI  - ATR-FTIR spectroscopic evidence for biomolecular phosphorus and carboxyl groups facilitating bacterial adhesion to iron oxides.
AB  - Attenuated total reflectance (ATR) Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has been used to probe the binding of bacteria to hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) and goethite (alpha-FeOOH). In situ ATR-FTIR experiments with bacteria (Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli), mixed amino acids, polypeptide extracts, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and a suite of model compounds were conducted. These compounds represent carboxyl, catecholate, amide, and phosphate groups present in siderophores, amino acids, polysaccharides, phospholipids, and DNA. Due in part to the ubiquitous presence of carboxyl groups in biomolecules, numerous IR peaks corresponding to outer-sphere or unbound (1400 cm(-1)) and inner-sphere (1310-1320 cm(-1)) coordinated carboxyl groups are noted following reaction of bacteria and biomolecules with alpha-Fe2O3 and alpha-FeOOH. However, the data also reveal that the presence of low-level amounts (i.e., 0.45-0.79%) of biomolecular phosphorous groups result in strong IR bands at approximately 1043 cm(-1), corresponding to inner-sphere Fe-O-P bonds, underscoring the importance of bacteria associated P-containing groups in biomolecule and cell adhesion. Spectral comparisons also reveal slightly greater P-O-Fe contributions for bacteria (Pseudomonad, E. coli) deposited on alpha-FeOOH, as compared to alpha-Fe2O3. This data demonstrates that slight differences in bacterial adhesion to Fe oxides can be attributed to bacterial species and Fe-oxide minerals. However, more importantly, the strong binding affinity of phosphate in all bacteria samples to both Fe-oxides results in the formation of inner-sphere Fe-O-P bonds, signifying the critical role of biomolecular P in the initiation of bacterial adhesion.
TI  - Novel Phl-producing genotypes of finger millet rhizosphere associated pseudomonads and assessment of their functional and genetic diversity.
AB  - Genetic diversity of phlD gene, an essential gene in the biosynthesis of 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol, was studied by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) in 20 Phl-producing pseudomonads isolated from finger millet rhizosphere. RFLP analysis of phlD gene displayed three patterns with HaeIII and TaqI enzymes. phlD gene sequence closely correlated with RFLP results and revealed the existence of three new genotypes G, H and I. Further, the phylogenetic and concatenated sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA, rpoB, gyrB, rpoD genes supported the hypothesis that these genotypes G, H and I were different from reported genotypes A-F. In all phylogenetic studies, the genotype G formed a distant clade from the groups of Pseudomonas putida and P. aeruginosa (sensu strictu), but the groups H and I were closely related to P. aeruginosa/P. stutzeri group. The Phl-producing pseudomonads exhibited antagonistic activity against Pyricularia grisea (TN508), Gaeumannomyces graminis (DSM1463), Fusarium oxysporum (DSM62297), Xanthomonas campestris (DSM3586) and Erwinia persicina (HMGU155). In addition, these strains exhibited various plant growth-promoting traits. In conclusion, this study displays the existence of novel Phl-producing pseudomonads genotypes G, H and I from finger millet rhizosphere, which formed taxonomically outward phylogenetic lineage from the groups of P. putida and P. aeruginosa (sensu strictu).
TI  - Evaluation of nosocomial blood stream infections caused by Pseudomonas species in newborns.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial blood stream infections (NBSI) are a significant hazard in health care facilities, exacting a tremendous toll and causing increased morbidity, mortality, and increased length of hospital stay and health care costs. METHODS: In this article, we report the results of a retrospective cohort study to describe the epidemiology of pseudomonas NBSI in infants admitted to one Turkish neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) during the 5-year period 2006-2010. In this period, Pseudomonas spp. were isolated from the blood cultures of 28 patients. RESULTS: Pseudomonas putida (n = 12) was a causative microorganism at 42.8% of these infants, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 9) was determined in 32%. Sixty-five percent (n = 18) of the infants were below 32 weeks. The median age at diagnosis was 7 days (4-16). Mechanical ventilation (> 48 hours) rate was 89.2% (n = 25) and umbilical catheterization rate (> 48 hours) was 29.2% (n = 9). Imipenem resistance was detected in 53.5% (n = 15) of all cases. Median length of hospital stay was 15 days (8-29) with a mortality rate of 28%. Five of the infants who died had associated disorders such as Di George syndrome, anal atresia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and respiratory distress syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: We may say that pseudomonas infections are still an important cause of nosocomial sepsis and mortality in NICUs. Low birth weight and invasive procedures may be predisposing factors for pseudomonas infections. Mortality was associated with underlying disorders.
TI  - Analysis of the draft genome of Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC17400 indicates a capacity to take up iron from a wide range of sources, including different exogenous pyoverdines.
AB  - All fluorescent pseudomonads (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. putida, P. fluorescens,  P. syringae and others) are known to produce the high-affinity peptidic yellow-green fluorescent siderophore pyoverdine. These siderophores have peptide chains that are quite diverse and more than 50 pyoverdine structures have been elucidated. In the majority of the cases, a Pseudomonas species is also able to produce a second siderophore of lower affinity for iron. Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 17400 has been shown to produce a unique second siderophore, (thio)quinolobactin, which has an antimicrobial activity against the phytopathogenic Oomycete Pythium debaryanum. We show that this strain has the capacity to utilize 16 different pyoverdines, suggesting the presence of several ferripyoverdine receptors. Analysis of the draft genome of P. fluorescens ATCC 17400 confirmed the presence of 55 TonB-dependent receptors, the largest so far for Pseudomonas, among which 15 are predicted to be ferripyoverdine receptors (Fpv). Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of two different clades containing ferripyoverdine receptors, with sequences similar to the P. aeruginosa type II FpvA forming a separate cluster. Among the other receptors we confirmed the presence of the QbsI (thio)quinolobactin receptor, an ferri-achromobactin and an ornicorrugatin receptor, several catecholate and four putative heme receptors. Twenty five of the receptors genes were found to be associated with genes encoding extracytoplasmic sigma factors (ECF sigma) and transmembrane anti-sigma sensors.
TI  - A role for the regulator PsrA in the polyhydroxyalkanoate metabolism of Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is a Gram-negative bacterium capable of producing medium-chain-length-polyhydroxyalkanoates (mcl-PHA). When fatty acids are used as growth and polymer precursors, the biosynthesis is linked to fatty acid metabolism via ss-oxidation route. In the close-related Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the transcriptional repressor PsrA regulates the ss-oxidation, but little is known about the regulatory system in P. putida. To analyze the effect of the absence of psrA gene on the growth and PHA production in P. putida, a set of different carbon sources were assayed in the wild type strain and in a generated psrA deficient strain (KT40P). The growth rates were in all cases, lower for the mutant. The amount of PHA produced by the mutant strain is lower than the wild type. Moreover, the monomeric composition seems to be different among the strains, as there is enrichment in monomers with shorter carbon length in the mutant strain. To understand the role of the psrA gene on the metabolism of fatty acids, we have determined the expression profile of several genes related to fatty acid metabolism in the wild type and in the mutant strain. The results indicated that PsrA mostly negatively regulate genes related to fatty acid metabolism.
TI  - Function of bacterial cells and their exuded extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in virus removal by red soils.
AB  - The potential influence of autochthonous microorganisms on virus fate in soil is  usually determined through extreme conditions of sterilization vs. nonsterilization; however, the relative importance of microbial cells and their exudates remains unclear. In this study, bacterial cells (cell) were harvested, and their exuded extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were extracted from three strains of bacteria, namely, Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. This study aimed to evaluate virus removal in solutions in the presence of cell, EPS, and their combination (cell/EPS), as well as to investigate how their presence affects virus removal efficiencies by four red soils based on batch experiments. Results showed that virus removal percentage in solutions ranged from 11 to 23 in the presence of cells only and from 12 to 15 in the presence of EPS only. The removal percentage in the combined cell/EPS treatment can be estimated by summing the results achieved by the cell and EPS treatments, separately. Meanwhile, cell presence had a negligible effect on virus removal by red soils. EPS and combined cell/EPS significantly reduced virus removal by 20 to 69% and 16 to 50%, respectively, which indicated that EPS served a dominant function in reducing virus removal. This study clearly demonstrated that the prediction of virus removal by red soils must consider the effect of bacteria, especially those producing large quantities of EPS, which can be responsible for the underestimation of viral load in certain studies.
TI  - Modeling the differences in biochemical capabilities of pseudomonas species by flux balance analysis: how good are genome-scale metabolic networks at predicting the differences?
AB  - To date, several genome-scale metabolic networks have been reconstructed. These models cover a wide range of organisms, from bacteria to human. Such models have provided us with a framework for systematic analysis of metabolism. However, little effort has been put towards comparing biochemical capabilities of closely related species using their metabolic models. The accuracy of a model is highly dependent on the reconstruction process, as some errors may be included in the model during reconstruction. In this study, we investigated the ability of three Pseudomonas metabolic models to predict the biochemical differences, namely, iMO1086, iJP962, and iSB1139, which are related to P. aeruginosa PAO1, P. putida KT2440, and P. fluorescens SBW25, respectively. We did a comprehensive literature search for previous works containing biochemically distinguishable traits over these species. Amongst more than 1700 articles, we chose a subset of them which included experimental results suitable for in silico simulation. By simulating the conditions provided in the actual biological experiment, we performed case-dependent tests to compare the in silico results to the biological ones. We found out that iMO1086 and iJP962 were able to predict the experimental data and were much more accurate than iSB1139.
TI  - A novel Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophage, Ab31, a chimera formed from temperate phage PAJU2 and P. putida lytic phage AF: characteristics and mechanism of bacterial resistance.
AB  - A novel temperate bacteriophage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, phage vB_PaeP_Tr60_Ab31 (alias Ab31) is described. Its genome is composed of structural genes related to those of lytic P. putida phage AF, and regulatory genes similar to those of temperate phage PAJU2. The virion structure resembles that of phage AF and other lytic Podoviridae (S. enterica Epsilon 15 and E. coli phiv10) with similar tail spikes. Ab31 was able to infect P. aeruginosa strain PA14 and two genetically related strains called Tr60 and Tr162, out of 35 diverse strains from cystic fibrosis patients. Analysis of resistant host variants revealed different phenotypes, including induction of pigment and alginate overproduction. Whole genome sequencing of resistant variants highlighted the existence of a large deletion of 234 kbp in two strains, encompassing a cluster of genes required for the production of CupA fimbriae. Stable lysogens formed by Ab31 in strain Tr60, permitted the identification of the insertion site. During colonization of the lung in cystic fibrosis patients, P. aeruginosa adapts by modifying its genome. We suggest that bacteriophages such as Ab31 may play an important role in this adaptation by selecting for bacterial characteristics that favor persistence of bacteria in the lung.
TI  - Regulation of biofilm formation in Pseudomonas and Burkholderia species.
AB  - In the present review, we describe and compare the molecular mechanisms that are  involved in the regulation of biofilm formation by Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia. Our current knowledge suggests that biofilm formation is regulated by cyclic diguanosine-5'-monophosphate (c-di-GMP), small RNAs (sRNA) and quorum sensing (QS) in all these bacterial species. The systems that employ c-di-GMP as a second messenger regulate the production of exopolysaccharides and surface proteins which function as extracellular matrix components in the biofilms formed by the bacteria. The systems that make use of sRNAs appear to regulate the production of exopolysaccharide biofilm matrix material in all these species. In the pseudomonads, QS regulates the production of extracellular DNA, lectins and biosurfactants which all play a role in biofilm formation. In B.cenocepacia QS regulates the expression of a large surface protein, lectins and extracellular DNA that all function as biofilm matrix components. Although the three regulatory systems all regulate the production of factors used for biofilm formation, the molecular mechanisms involved in transducing the signals into expression of the biofilm matrix components differ between the species. Under the conditions tested, exopolysaccharides appears to be the most important biofilm matrix components for P.aeruginosa, whereas large surface proteins appear to be the most important biofilm matrix components for P.putida, P.fluorescens, and B.cenocepacia.
TI  - Selective reactivity of monochloramine with extracellular matrix components affects the disinfection of biofilm and detached clusters.
AB  - The efficiency of monochloramine disinfection was dependent on the quantity and composition of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in biofilms, as monochloramine has a selective reactivity with proteins over polysaccharides. Biofilms with protein-based (Pseudomonas putida) and polysaccharide based EPS (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), as well as biofilms with varied amount of polysaccharide EPS (wild-type and mutant P. aeruginosa), were compared. The different reactivity of EPS components with monochloramine influenced disinfectant penetration, biofilm inactivation, as well as the viability of detached clusters. Monochloramine transport profiling measured by a chloramine-sensitive microelectrode revealed a broader diffusion boundary layer between bulk and biofilm surface in the P. putida biofilm compared to those of P. aeruginosa biofilms. The reaction with proteins in P. putida EPS multiplied both the time and the monochloramine mass required to achieve a full biofilm penetration. Cell viability in biofilms was also spatially influenced by monochloramine diffusion and reaction within biofilms, showing a lower survival in the surface section and a higher persistence in the middle section of the P. putida biofilm compared to the P. aeruginosa biofilms. While polysaccharide EPS promoted biofilm cell viability by obstructing monochloramine reactive sites on bacterial cells, protein EPS hindered monochloramine penetration by reacting with monochloramine and reduced its concentration within biofilms. Furthermore, the persistence of bacterial cells detached from biofilm (over 70% for P. putida and approximately 40% for polysaccharide producing P. aeruginosa) suggested that currently recommended monochloramine residual levels may underestimate the risk of water quality deterioration caused by biofilm detachment.
TI  - Biotransformation of trinitrotoluene (TNT) by Pseudomonas spp. isolated from a TNT-contaminated environment.
AB  - The compound 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) is a secondary explosive widely used worldwide for both military and civil purposes. As a result, residual TNT has been detected as an environmental pollutant in both soil and groundwater. The authors have isolated several microbial strains from soil contaminated with TNT by enrichment culture techniques using TNT as a carbon, nitrogen, and energy source. The contaminated soil contained approximately 1860 ppm TNT measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The initial identification of these isolates was determined by 16S rRNA gene comparison. The isolates mainly included species belonging to the genus Pseudomonas. Two strains (Pseudomonas putida strain TP1 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain TP6) were selected for further examination. Both strains demonstrated the ability to grow on the medium containing TNT as a carbon, energy, and nitrogen source and also clearly demonstrated the ability to degrade TNT. More than 90% of the TNT in the growth medium was degraded by both strains after 22 d incubation, as determined by HPLC. Additionally, the resting cells of P. putida TP1 and P. aeruginosa TP6 both significantly displayed the ability to transform (metabolize) TNT.
TI  - Microorganisms hydrolyse amide bonds; knowledge enabling read-across of biodegradability of fatty acid amides.
AB  - To get insight in the biodegradation and potential read-across of fatty acid amides, N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl] cocoamide and N-(1-ethylpiperazine) tall oil amide were used as model compounds. Two bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PK1 and Pseudomonas putida PK2 were isolated with N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl] cocoamide and its hydrolysis product N,N-dimethyl-1,3-propanediamine, respectively. In mixed culture, both strains accomplished complete mineralization of N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl] cocoamide. Aeromonas hydrophila PK3 was enriched with N-(1-ethylpiperazine) tall oil amide and subsequently isolated using agar plates containing dodecanoate. N-(2-Aminoethyl)piperazine, the hydrolysis product of N-(1-ethylpiperazine) tall oil amide, was not degraded. The aerobic biodegradation pathway for primary and secondary fatty acid amides of P. aeruginosa and A. hydrophila involved initial hydrolysis of the amide bond producing ammonium, or amines, where the fatty acids formed were immediately metabolized. Complete mineralization of secondary fatty acid amides depended on the biodegradability of the released amine. Tertiary fatty acid amides were not transformed by P. aeruginosa or A. hydrophila. These strains were able to utilize all tested primary and secondary fatty acid amides independent of the amine structure and fatty acid. Read-across of previous reported ready biodegradability results of primary and secondary fatty acid amides is justified based on the broad substrate specificity and the initial hydrolytic attack of the two isolates PK1 and PK3.
TI  - Development of Genomic Tools for the Identification of Certain Pseudomonas up to  Species Level.
AB  - Pseudomonas is a highly versatile bacterium at the species level with great ecological significance. These genetically and metabolically diverse species have undergone repeated taxonomic revisions. We propose a strategy to identify Pseudomonas up to species level, based on the unique features of their 16S rDNA (rrs) gene sequence, such as the frame work of sequences, sequence motifs and restriction endonuclease (RE) digestion patterns. A species specific phylogenetic framework composed of 31 different rrs sequences, allowed us to segregate 1,367 out of 2,985 rrs sequences of this genus, which have been classified at present only up to genus (Pseudomonas) level, as follows: P. aeruginosa (219 sequences), P. fluorescens (463 sequences), P. putida (347 sequences), P. stutzeri (197 sequences), and P. syringae (141 sequences). These segregations were validated by unique 30-50 nucleotide long motifs and RE digestion patterns in their rrs. A single gene thus provides multiple makers for identification and surveillance of Pseudomonas.
TI  - [Comparison of phenotypic methods for the detection of beta-lactamases MBL in strains from the Enterobacteriaceae family and non-fermentative bacilli isolated from clinical specimens].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacterial resistance is growing because of treatment a broad spectrum antibio- tics. Gram-negative pathogens which producing carbapenemase are a one of major problem in many hospitals. Rapid detection those strains provide an early inhibition of infection and control the expansion of microorganisms. The aim of work was to characterize the frequency of appearance MBLs in specific groups of Gram-negative bacilli which are resistant or intermediate to at least one of carbapenems. METHODS: Bacterial isolates were collected from Baby Jesus Clinical Hospital from 2003 to 2009. Pathogens were isolated from urine, blood, fluids, swab of the wound, pharyngeal swab. They were identified by the ID 32 E (bioMerieux, France) and Vitek2. Antimicrobial resistance was marked by the ATB G-5 and ATB UR (bioMerieux, France). Detection of metalo-beta-lactamases was tested by disk diffusion test recommended by the EUCAST. The DDS test using imipenem, ceftazidime, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 2-mercaptopropionic acid (2-MPA). Positive test was reading as enlargement of inhibition zone about imipenem- or ceftazidime-impregnated disk. RESULTS: Of the 88 isolates, 32 come fromEnterobacteriaceae and 56 from non-fermentative bacilli. All strains were tested of production of MBL by disk diffusion test. This method used two inhibitors: ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 2-mercaptopropionic acid. As a result of EDTA there was 45 MBL positive strains. In apply 2-MPA there was 55 MBL positive strains. Both the EDTA and 2-MPA disk test showing the highest percentage of positive result in Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance to carbapenems in the non-fermentative bacilli occurs more often than in the Enterobacteriaceae. Method with 2-mercaptopropionic acid was more effective to detect metallo-beta-lactamases than EDTA. Concerns especially bacilli from Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Expression, purification, and characterization of formaldehyde dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - As a member of zinc-containing medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenase family, formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FDH) can oxidize toxic formaldehyde to less active formate with NAD(+) as a cofactor and exists in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Most FDHs are well known to be glutathione-dependent in the catalysis of formaldehyde oxidation, but the enzyme from Pseudomonas putida is an exception, which is independent of glutathione. To identify novel glutathione-independent FDHs from other bacterial strains and facilitate the corresponding structural and enzymatic studies, high-level soluble expression and efficient purification of these enzymes need to be achieved. Here, we present molecular cloning, expression, and purification of the FDH from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a Gram-negative pathogenic bacterium causing opportunistic human infection. The FDH of P. aeruginosa shows high sequence identity (87.97%) with that of P. putida. Our results indicated that coexpression with molecular chaperones GroES, GroEL, and Tig has significantly attenuated inclusion body formation and improved the solubility of the recombinant FDH in Escherichiacoli cells. A purification protocol including three chromatographic steps was also established to isolate the recombinant FDH to homogeneity with a yield of approximately 3.2 mg from 1L of cell culture. The recombinant P. aeruginosa FDH was properly folded and biologically functional, as demonstrated by the mass spectrometric, crystallographic, and enzymatic characterizations of the purified proteins.
TI  - [Isolation, identification of two aerobic denitrifiers and bioaugmentation for enhancing denitrificaition of biofilm under oligotrophic conditions].
AB  - Two aerobic denitrifying bacteria were isolated from the sludge of municipal wastewater treatment plant by enrichment, preliminary screening with BTB culture medium and the denitrification potential test and identified through 16S rDNA sequence analysis. Then they were bioaugmented to oligotrophic biofilm system respectively, aiming to enhance the denitrification capacity. The two strains were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida respectively. They could remove 78% or 82% of the total nitrogen in the simulate wastewater when existed alone. And the total nitrogen removal efficiency of the biofilm system reached 68% and 64% after bioaugmentation with two trains, increased by 47% and 43% compared to the control, respectively. Meanwhile, the ammonia nitrogen was nearly 100% removed. It can be concluded that two aerobic denitrifiers can enhance the denitrification of biofilm system significantly under oligotrophic conditions and will not inhibit the nitrification process, therefore can help biofilm system achieve simultaneous nitrification and denitrification.
TI  - Biodegradation of Low Density Polythene (LDPE) by Pseudomonas Species.
AB  - Low density polythene (LDPE) is the most widely used packaging material primarily because of its excellent mechanical properties, barrier properties against water, light weight, low cost and high energy effectiveness. However, due to its ubiquitous nature, and resistance to biodegradability, the disposal strategies are crucial and need attention. Recently, microorganisms have become the focus of interest for environmental friendly disposal of plastic and polymer-based waste. This manuscript aims to investigate the extent of biodegradability of LDPE by four different strains of Pseudomonas bacteria-Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 (ATCC 15729), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 15692), Pseudomonas putida (KT2440 ATCC 47054) and Pseudomonas syringae (DC3000 ATCC 10862). Degradation of LDPE was determined by weight loss of the sample, morphological changes, mechanical and spectroscopic variations. The eluted compounds after degradation were analysed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy. Our results show that Pseudomonas spp. can degrade LDPE films.
TI  - Structure of formaldehyde dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa: the binary complex with the cofactor NAD+.
AB  - Formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FDH) is a member of the zinc-containing medium-chain  alcohol dehydrogenase family which oxidizes toxic formaldehyde to formate using NAD(+) as an electron carrier. Three-dimensional structures have been reported for FDHs from several different species. Most FDHs are dependent on glutathione for catalysis, but the enzyme from Pseudomonas putida is an exception. In this structural communication, the recombinant production, crystallization and X-ray structure determination at 2.7 A resolution of FDH from P. aeruginosa are described. Both the tetrameric assembly and the NAD(+)-binding mode of P. aeruginosa FDH are similar to those of P. putida FDH, which is in good agreement with the high sequence identity (87.97%) between these two proteins. Preliminary enzymatic kinetics studies of P. aeruginosa FDH also revealed a conserved glutathione-independent `ping-pong' mechanism of formaldehyde oxidization.
TI  - Statistical screening of medium components for recombinant production of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027 rhamnolipids by nonpathogenic cell factory Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
AB  - Rhamnolipids (RLs) produced by the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa are considered as potential candidates for the next generation of surfactants. Large-scale production of RLs depends on progress in strain engineering, medium design, operating strategies, and purification procedures. In this work, the rhlAB genes extracted from a mono_RLs_producing strain of P. aeruginosa (ATCC 9027) were introduced to an appropriate safety host Pseudomonas putida KT2440. The capability of the recombinant strain was evaluated in various media. As a prerequisite for optimal medium design, a set of 32 experiments was performed in two steps for screening a number of macro-nutritional compounds. In the experiments, a two-level fractional factorial design resolution IV was followed by a two-level full factorial one. By means of this approach, it was observed that glycerol, yeast extract, and peptone have significant positive influence on recombinant RLs production while the yeast extract/peptone two-factor and glycerol/yeast extract/peptone three-factor interactions have considerable negative effects. A wide range of variation from 0 to 570 mg/l was obtained for RLs production during the screening experiments indicating the importance of medium optimization. The results point out the opportunity for possible higher yields of RLs through further screening, mixture/combined mixture designs, and high-cell-density cultivations.
TI  - Relative contribution of biomolecules in bacterial extracellular polymeric substances to disinfection byproduct formation.
AB  - In this study, detailed chemical compositions of the biomolecules in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from both pure cultures of bacteria and mixed species biofilm isolated from a water utility were analyzed. Then, based on detailed EPS analysis results, the DBP yield experiments were conducted with both extracted EPS and surrogate chemicals to indirectly identify the influence of biomolecules and their structures on DBP formation and speciation. DBP yield results of both extracted EPS and EPS surrogates indicated that proteins in EPS have a greater influence on DBP formation, especially on the formation of nitrogenous DBPs (N-DBPs), where amino acids containing unsaturated organic carbon or conjugated bonds in R-group produced higher amount of DBPs. For regulated DBPs, HAA yields were higher than THM yields, while haloacetonitriles were the dominant DBP species formed among unregulated DBPs. However, DBP yields of polysaccharide monomers were lower than those of tested amino acids groups and the DBP yields of polysaccharide monomers were not significantly influenced by their structures. Considering the results obtained in this study, biofilm needs to be considered an important precursor to DBP formation and biofilm eradication methods for water distribution systems need to be carefully selected to minimize subsequent DBP formation.
TI  - [The experience of applying techniques of molecular genetics in identification of clinical strains Pseudomonas aeruginosa].
AB  - The article presents comparative analysis of application of common bacteriologic  and molecular techniques to identify P. aerugenosa. The genetic detection was applied using polymerase chain reaction with genus-specific and species-specific primers and amplification of conservative sites of gens 16S pRNA with successive identification of bacteria by sequenation. It is established that 95% (151) of strains correspond to species of P. aerugenosa detected in primary bacteriologic laboratories and only 8 strains were not blue pus bacillus. Most of strains were closely congenial species: 2 isolates belonged to Pseudomonas aeruginosa group, 3 isolates to Pseudomonas putida group, 2 strains to Comamonas species and 1 isolate to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia species. The effectiveness of cultural technique of laboratory diagnostic was demonstrated concerning infections conditioned by P. aerugenosa. This conclusion does not eliminate application of molecular genetic trechnologies in complicated arbitral cases of bacteriologic analysis during monitoring of nosocomial infections.
TI  - Role for ferredoxin:NAD(P)H oxidoreductase (FprA) in sulfate assimilation and siderophore biosynthesis in Pseudomonads.
AB  - Pyridine-2,6-bis(thiocarboxylate) (PDTC), produced by certain pseudomonads, is a  sulfur-containing siderophore that binds iron, as well as a wide range of transition metals, and it affects the net hydrolysis of the environmental contaminant carbon tetrachloride. The pathway of PDTC biosynthesis has not been defined. Here, we performed a transposon screen of Pseudomonas putida DSM 3601 to identify genes necessary for PDTC production (Pdt phenotype). Transposon insertions within genes for sulfate assimilation (cysD, cysNC, and cysG [cobA2]) dominated the collection of Pdt mutations. In addition, two insertions were within the gene for the LysR-type transcriptional activator FinR (PP1637). Phenotypic characterization indicated that finR mutants were cysteine bradytrophs. The Pdt phenotype of finR mutants could be complemented by the known target of FinR regulation, fprA (encoding ferredoxin:NADP(+) oxidoreductase), or by Escherichia coli cysJI (encoding sulfite reductase). These data indicate that fprA is necessary for effective sulfate assimilation by P. putida and that the effect of finR mutation on PDTC production was due to deficient expression of fprA and sulfite reduction. fprA expression in both P. putida and P. aeruginosa was found to be regulated by FinR, but in a manner dependent upon reduced sulfur sources, implicating FinR in sulfur regulatory physiology. The genes and phenotypes identified in this study indicated a strong dependence upon intracellular reduced sulfur/cysteine for PDTC biosynthesis and that pseudomonads utilize sulfite reduction enzymology distinct from that of E. coli and possibly similar to that of chloroplasts and other proteobacteria.
TI  - Fatty acid-mediated signalling between two Pseudomonas species.
AB  - We report the identification of fatty acids as mediators of intercellular signalling in Pseudomonas putida, and between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. putida. Tetradecanoic acid and fatty acids of similar chain length are present in supernatants of these strains and activate population density-dependent expression of ddcA, a gene involved in corn seed and root colonization by P. putida KT2440. Consistently, significant amounts of these compounds were also found in corn root exudates. The signalling pathway involves the two-component regulatory system formed by RoxS and RoxR, which had been previously shown to control expression of ddcA and of a set of genes related to the redox balance of P. putida cells. Production of the fatty acid signal in P. aeruginosa is under the control of the LasI/LasR and RhlI/RhlR quorum sensing systems. Our data indicate that in terms of cell-cell communication, P. putida KT2440 employs mechanisms closer to those of plant pathogens such as Xanthomonas spp. and fungi like Candida, which also rely on fatty acid derivatives.
TI  - Short ROSE-like RNA thermometers control IbpA synthesis in Pseudomonas species.
AB  - The bacterial small heat shock protein IbpA protects client proteins from aggregation. Due to redundancy in the cellular chaperone network, deletion of the ibpA gene often leads to only a mild or no phenotypic defect. In this study, we show that a Pseudomonas putida ibpA deletion mutant has a severe growth defect under heat stress conditions and reduced survival during recovery revealing a critical role of IbpA in heat tolerance. Transcription of the ibpA gene depends on the alternative heat shock sigma factor sigma(32). Production of IbpA protein only at heat shock temperatures suggested additional translational control. We conducted a comprehensive structural and functional analysis of the 5' untranslated regions of the ibpA genes from P. putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both contain a ROSE-type RNA thermometer that is substantially shorter and simpler than previously reported ROSE elements. Comprised of two hairpin structures only, they inhibit translation at low temperature and permit translation initiation after a temperature upshift. Both elements regulate reporter gene expression in Escherichia coli and ribosome binding in vitro in a temperature-dependent manner. Structure probing revealed local melting of the second hairpin whereas the first hairpin remained unaffected. High sequence and structure conservation of pseudomonal ibpA untranslated regions and their ability to confer thermoregulation in vivo suggest that short ROSE-like thermometers are commonly used to control IbpA synthesis in Pseudomonas species.
TI  - Particle-cell contact enhances antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is generally accepted that antibacterial properties of Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) are dictated by their dissolved fraction. However, dissolution-based concept alone does not fully explain the toxic potency of nanoparticulate silver compared to silver ions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Herein, we demonstrated that the direct contact between bacterial cell and AgNPs' surface enhanced the toxicity of nanosilver. More specifically, cell-NP contact increased the cellular uptake of particle-associated Ag ions - the single and ultimate cause of toxicity. To prove that, we evaluated the toxicity of three different AgNPs (uncoated, PVP-coated and protein-coated) to six bacterial strains: Gram-negative Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. putida and P. aeruginosa and Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. While the toxicity of AgNO3 to these bacteria varied only slightly (the 4-h EC50 ranged from 0.3 to 1.2 mg Ag/l), the 4-h EC50 values of protein-coated AgNPs for various bacterial strains differed remarkably, from 0.35 to 46 mg Ag/l. By systematically comparing the intracellular and extracellular free Ag(+) liberated from AgNPs, we demonstrated that not only extracellular dissolution in the bacterial test environment but also additional dissolution taking place at the particle-cell interface played an essential role in antibacterial action of AgNPs. The role of the NP-cell contact in dictating the antibacterial activity of Ag-NPs was additionally proven by the following observations: (i) separation of bacterial cells from AgNPs by particle-impermeable membrane (cut-off 20 kDa, approximately 4 nm) significantly reduced the toxicity of AgNPs and (ii) P. aeruginosa cells which tended to attach onto AgNPs, exhibited the highest sensitivity to all forms of nanoparticulate Ag. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings provide new insights into the mode of antibacterial action of nanosilver and explain some discrepancies in this field, showing that "Ag-ion" and "particle-specific" mechanisms are not controversial but, rather, are two faces of the same coin.
TI  - Bacterial tethering analysis reveals a "run-reverse-turn" mechanism for Pseudomonas species motility.
AB  - We have developed a program that can accurately analyze the dynamic properties of tethered bacterial cells. The program works especially well with cells that tend to give rise to unstable rotations, such as polar-flagellated bacteria. The program has two novel components. The first dynamically adjusts the center of the cell's rotational trajectories. The second applies piecewise linear approximation to the accumulated rotation curve to reduce noise and separate the motion of bacteria into phases. Thus, it can separate counterclockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW) rotations distinctly and measure rotational speed accurately. Using this program, we analyzed the properties of tethered Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida cells for the first time. We found that the Pseudomonas flagellar motor spends equal time in both CCW and CW phases and that it rotates with the same speed in both phases. In addition, we discovered that the cell body can remain stationary for short periods of time, leading to the existence of a third phase of the flagellar motor which we call "pause." In addition, P. aeruginosa cells adopt longer run lengths, fewer pause frequencies, and shorter pause durations as part of their chemotactic response. We propose that one purpose of the pause phase is to allow the cells to turn at a large angle, where we show that pause durations in free-swimming cells positively correlate with turn angle sizes. Taken together, our results suggest a new "run-reverse-turn" paradigm for polar-flagellated Pseudomonas motility that is different from the "run-and-tumble" paradigm established for peritrichous Escherichia coli.
TI  - Cytotoxicity and inflammatory potential of two Pseudomonas mosselii strains isolated from clinical samples of hospitalized patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genus Pseudomonas includes a heterogeneous set of microorganisms  that can be isolated from many different niches and nearly 100 different strains have been described. The best characterized bacterium is Pseudomonas aeruginosa which is the primary agent of opportunistic infection in humans, causing both acute and chronic infections. Other species like fluorescens, putida or mosselii have been sporadically isolated from hospitalized patients but their association with the pathology often remains unclear. RESULTS: This study focuses on the cytotoxicity and inflammatory potential of two strains of Pseudomonas mosselii (ATCC BAA-99 and MFY161) that were recently isolated from clinical samples of hospitalized patients. The behavior of these bacteria was compared to that of the well-known opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa PAO1. We found that P. mosselii ATCC BAA-99 and MFY161 are cytotoxic towards Caco-2/TC7 cells, have low invasive capacity, induce secretion of human beta-defensin 2 (HBD-2), alter the epithelial permeability of differentiated cells and damage the F-actin cytoskeleton. CONCLUSIONS: These data bring new insights into P. mosselii virulence, since this bacterium has often been neglected due to its rare occurrence in hospital.
TI  - First detection in Europe of the metallo-beta-lactamase IMP-15 in clinical strains of Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - In a prospective study (2009-2011) in healthcare institutions from the Canary Islands (Spain), 6 out of 298 carbapenem non-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates produced a metallo-beta-lactamase: four IMP-15, two VIM-2 (including one IMP-15-positive isolate) and one VIM-1. Multilocus sequence typing identified the single VIM-1-producing isolate as clone ST111 and two IMP-15-producing isolates as ST606, but, strikingly, bacterial re-identification revealed that the other three isolates (producing IMP-15 and/or VIM-2) were actually Pseudomonas putida. Further retrospective analysis revealed a very high prevalence (close to 50%) of carbapenem resistance in this environmental species. Hence, we report the simultaneous emergence in hospitals on the Canary Islands of P. putida and P. aeruginosa strains producing IMP-15, a metallo-beta-lactamase not previously detected in Europe, and suggest an underestimated role of P. putida as a nosocomial reservoir of worrying transferable resistance determinants.
TI  - [Investigation of the presence of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) by PCR in carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates].
AB  - Bacteria producing New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) exhibit high level  resistance to beta-lactams including carbapenems. This broad-spectrum resistance limits treatment options for infections caused by NDM-1 producers. NDM-1 was first isolated from an Indian patient in Sweden; since then, NDM-1 producing isolates have been identified in many countries including Turkey. In this study, we investigated the presence of NDM-1 by PCR method in various gram-negative isolates recovered from clinical specimens in tertiary care hospitals in Samsun, Turkey. A total of 210 carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates (132 Acinetobacter baumannii, 54 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 Pseudomonas putida, 8 Enterobacter cloacae, 3 Enterobacter aerogenes, 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 Providencia rettgeri, 2 Escherichia coli and 1 Citrobacter freundii) were included in the study. Identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates were performed by using Vitek-2 Compact (bioMerieux, France) and BD Phoenix (BD Diagnostic Systems, MD) automated systems. The results of antibiotic susceptibility testing were interpreted according to the CLSI recommendations. In our study, NDM-1 gene was not detected in any of the clinical isolates by PCR. There was only one case study that reported the presence of NDM-1 in clinical isolates from Turkey [Poirel L et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2012;56:2784]. Our data, together with the others, indicated that the existence of NDM-1 in clinical isolates is not common in Turkey. However, since NDM-1 is a plasmid-encoded enzyme, there is always a risk of spread of this resistance through the bacterial strains in our country. Therefore, continuous surveillance and investigation of carbapenem-resistant isolates with resistance patterns suggestive of NDM-1 may enable to identify NDM-1 producing isolates. Meanwhile special care should be given on rational antibiotic use and establishment of appropriate infection control policies to prevent the spread of NDM-1 producers and other potential resistant strains.
TI  - Effects of shear on initial bacterial attachment in slow flowing systems.
AB  - Initial bacterial attachment, likely affected by local shear, could influence biofilm formation. However, there are contradictory reports for the shear effects on attachment of different bacteria onto different surfaces. In this study, four bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, and Escherichia coli, were examined for their attachment to glass and octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) modified glass under different shears. Polystyrene particles were used to verify that their shear dependent attachment on glass and OTS could be interpreted using an analysis based on the extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (XDLVO) theory. In particular, the critical shear force (F(c-shear)) could correlate with the maximum attractive force (F(MAX)(XDLVO)) toward the secondary energy minimum as F(c-shear)=cF(MAX)(XDLVO). For these particles, c of ~1 was obtained, the value was within the coefficient range (0.1-1) of substances sliding over glass. For S. epidermidis, E. coli and P. aeruginosa on glass, c was 0.3, <0.6 and 0.2, respectively. When considering potential protein adsorption on OTS during bacterial attachment, c of these species on OTS was slightly above 1. A greatly enhanced attachment of P. aeruginosa on OTS was also observed, probably due to the presence of flagella. For P. putida, the attachment first decreased slightly or maintained with shear and then increased. Such behaviors were probably caused by the increased secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) at higher shears by P. putida. The results from this study suggested that, without complications from surface features/EPS, the analysis based on the XDLVO theory could provide a basis for understanding shear effect on initial bacterial attachment.
TI  - The type II secretion system (Xcp) of Pseudomonas putida is active and involved in the secretion of phosphatases.
AB  - The genome of the Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas putida harbours a complete  set of xcp genes for a type II protein secretion system (T2SS). This study shows that expression of these genes is induced under inorganic phosphate (Pi ) limitation and that the system enables the utilization of various organic phosphate sources. A phosphatase of the PhoX family, previously designated UxpB, was identified, which was produced under low Pi conditions and transported across the cell envelope in an Xcp-dependent manner demonstrating that the xcp genes encode an active T2SS. The signal sequence of UxpB contains a twin-arginine translocation (Tat) motif as well as a lipobox, and both processing by leader peptidase II and Tat dependency were experimentally confirmed. Two different tat gene clusters were detected in the P. putida genome, of which one, named tat-1, is located adjacent to the uxpB and xcp genes. Both Tat systems appeared to be capable of transporting the UxpB protein. However, expression of the tat-1 genes was strongly induced by low Pi levels, indicating a function of this system in survival during Pi starvation.
TI  - Expression of Fap amyloids in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, and P. putida results in aggregation and increased biofilm formation.
AB  - The fap operon, encoding functional amyloids in Pseudomonas (Fap), is present in  most pseudomonads, but so far the expression and importance for biofilm formation has only been investigated for P. fluorescens strain UK4. In this study, we demonstrate the capacity of P. aeruginosa PAO1, P. fluorescens Pf-5, and P. putida F1 to express Fap fibrils, and investigated the effect of Fap expression on aggregation and biofilm formation. The fap operon in all three Pseudomonas species conferred the ability to express Fap fibrils as shown using a recombinant approach. This Fap overexpression consistently resulted in highly aggregative phenotypes and in increased biofilm formation. Detailed biophysical investigations of purified fibrils confirmed FapC as the main fibril monomer and supported the role of FapB as a minor, nucleating constituent as also indicated by bioinformatic analysis. Bioinformatics analysis suggested FapF and FapD as a potential beta-barrel membrane pore and protease, respectively. Manipulation of the fap operon showed that FapA affects monomer composition of the final amyloid fibril, and that FapB is an amyloid protein, probably a nucleator for FapC polymerization. Our study highlights the fap operon as a molecular machine for functional amyloid formation.
TI  - Isolation and Identification of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria from Ennore creek.
AB  - The widespread problem caused due to petroleum products, is their discharge and accidental spillage in marine environment proving to be hazardous to the surroundings as well as life forms. Thus remediation of these hydrocarbons by natural decontamination process is of utmost importance. Bioremediation is a non-invasive and cost effective technique for the clean-up of these petroleum hydrocarbons. In this study we have investigated the ability of microorganisms present in the sediment sample to degrade these hydrocarbons, crude oil in particular, so that contaminated soils and water can be treated using microbes. Sediments samples were collected once in a month for a period of twelve months from area surrounding Ennore creek and screened for hydrocarbon degrading bacteria. Of the 113 crude oil degrading isolates 15 isolates were selected and cultivated in BH media with 1% crude oil as a sole carbon and energy source. 3 efficient crude oil bacterial isolates Bacillus subtilis I1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa I5 and Pseudomonas putida I8 were identified both biochemically and phylogenetically. The quantitative analysis of biodegradation is carried out gravimetrically and highest degradation rate, 55% was recorded by Pseudomonas aeruginosa I5 isolate.
TI  - CrcZ and CrcX regulate carbon source utilization in Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato strain DC3000.
AB  - Small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are important components of many regulatory pathways in bacteria and play key roles in regulating factors important for virulence. Carbon catabolite repression control is modulated by small RNAs (crcZ or crcZ and crcY) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. In this study, we demonstrate that expression of crcZ and crcX (formerly designated psr1 and psr2, respectively) is dependent upon RpoN together with the two-component system CbrAB, and is influenced by the carbon source present in the medium in the model plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000. The distribution of the members of the Crc ncRNA family was also determined by screening available genomic sequences of the Pseudomonads. Interestingly, variable numbers of the Crc family members exist in Pseudomonas genomes. The ncRNAs are comprised of three main subfamilies, named CrcZ, CrcX and CrcY. Most importantly the CrcX subfamily appears to be unique to all P. syringae strains sequenced to date.
TI  - The biology of habitat dominance; can microbes behave as weeds?
AB  - Competition between microbial species is a product of, yet can lead to a reduction in, the microbial diversity of specific habitats. Microbial habitats can resemble ecological battlefields where microbial cells struggle to dominate and/or annihilate each other and we explore the hypothesis that (like plant weeds) some microbes are genetically hard-wired to behave in a vigorous and ecologically aggressive manner. These 'microbial weeds' are able to dominate the communities that develop in fertile but uncolonized--or at least partially vacant--habitats via traits enabling them to out-grow competitors; robust tolerances to habitat-relevant stress parameters and highly efficient energy-generation systems; avoidance of or resistance to viral infection, predation and grazers; potent antimicrobial systems; and exceptional abilities to sequester and store resources. In addition, those associated with nutritionally complex habitats are extraordinarily versatile in their utilization of diverse substrates. Weed species typically deploy multiple types of antimicrobial including toxins; volatile organic compounds that act as either hydrophobic or highly chaotropic stressors; biosurfactants; organic acids; and moderately chaotropic solutes that are produced in bulk quantities (e.g. acetone, ethanol). Whereas ability to dominate communities is habitat-specific we suggest that some microbial species are archetypal weeds including generalists such as: Pichia anomala, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas putida; specialists such as Dunaliella salina, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Lactobacillus spp. and other lactic acid bacteria; freshwater autotrophs Gonyostomum semen and Microcystis aeruginosa; obligate anaerobes such as Clostridium acetobutylicum; facultative pathogens such as Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Pantoea ananatis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and other extremotolerant and extremophilic microbes such as Aspergillus spp., Salinibacter ruber and Haloquadratum walsbyi. Some microbes, such as Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium smegmatis and Pseudoxylaria spp., exhibit characteristics of both weed and non-weed species. We propose that the concept of nonweeds represents a 'dustbin' group that includes species such as Synodropsis spp., Polypaecilum pisce, Metschnikowia orientalis, Salmonella spp., and Caulobacter crescentus. We show that microbial weeds are conceptually distinct from plant weeds, microbial copiotrophs, r-strategists, and other ecophysiological groups of microorganism. Microbial weed species are unlikely to emerge from stationary-phase or other types of closed communities; it is open habitats that select for weed phenotypes. Specific characteristics that are common to diverse types of open habitat are identified, and implications of weed biology and open-habitat ecology are discussed in the context of further studies needed in the fields of environmental and applied microbiology.
TI  - Genomic analysis of Pseudomonas putida phage tf with localized single-strand DNA  interruptions.
AB  - The complete sequence of the 46,267 bp genome of the lytic bacteriophage tf specific to Pseudomonas putida PpG1 has been determined. The phage genome has two sets of convergently transcribed genes and 186 bp long direct terminal repeats. The overall genomic architecture of the tf phage is similar to that of the previously described Pseudomonas aeruginosa phages PaP3, LUZ24 and phiMR299-2, and 39 out of the 72 products of predicted tf open reading frames have orthologs in these phages. Accordingly, tf was classified as belonging to the LUZ24-like bacteriophage group. However, taking into account very low homology levels between tf DNA and that of the other phages, tf should be considered as an evolutionary divergent member of the group. Two distinguishing features not reported for other members of the group were found in the tf genome. Firstly, a unique end structure--a blunt right end and a 4-nucleotide 3'-protruding left end--was observed. Secondly, 14 single-chain interruptions (nicks) were found in the top strand of the tf DNA. All nicks were mapped within a consensus sequence 5'-TACT/RTGMC-3'. Two nicks were analyzed in detail and were shown to be present in more than 90% of the phage population. Although localized nicks were previously found only in the DNA of T5-like and phiKMV-like phages, it seems increasingly likely that this enigmatic structural feature is common to various other bacteriophages.
TI  - Effect of rhamnolipids on initial attachment of bacteria on glass and octadecyltrichlorosilane-modified glass.
AB  - Bacterial attachment on solid surfaces has various implications in environmental, industrial and medical applications. In this study, the effects of rhamnolipid biosurfactants on initial attachment of bacteria on hydrophilic glass and hydrophobic octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) modified glass were evaluated under continuous-flow conditions. The bacteria investigated were three Gram-negative species Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, and Escherichia coli, and two Gram-positive species Staphylcoccus epidermidis and Bacillus subtilis. Rhamnolipids, at 10 and 200 mg/l, significantly reduced the attachment of all but S. epidermidis on both glass and OTS-modified glass. For S. epidermidis rhamnolipids reduced the attachment on OTS-modified glass but not on glass. Studies were further done to identify the mechanism(s) by which rhamnolipids reduced the cell attachment. The following potential properties of rhamnolipids were investigated: inhibition of microbial growth, change of cell surface hydrophobicity, easier detachment of cells already attached to substratum, and modification of substratum surface properties. Results showed that rhamnolipids were ineffective for the latter two effects. Rhamnolipids, up to 200mg/l, inhibited the growth of B. subtilis, S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa PAO1 but not the growth of E. coli, P. putida and P. aeruginosa E0340. Also, rhamnolipids tended to increase the hydrophobicity of P. aeruginosa PAO1 and E. coli, decrease the hydrophobicity of P. putida and S. epidermidis, and have no clear effect on the hydrophobicity of B. subtillis. These trends however did not correlate with the observed trend of cell attachment reduction. The responsible mechanism(s) remained unknown.
TI  - Characterization of molecular mechanisms controlling fabAB transcription in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The FabAB pathway is one of the unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) synthesis pathways for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It was previously noted that this operon was upregulated in biofilms and repressed by exogenous UFAs. Deletion of a 30 nt fabA upstream sequence, which is conserved in P. aeruginosa, P. putida, and P. syringae, led to a significant decrease in fabA transcription, suggesting positive regulation by an unknown positive regulatory mechanism. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, genetic and biochemical approaches were employed to identify a potential fabAB activator. Deletion of candidate genes such as PA1611 or PA1627 was performed to determine if any of these gene products act as a fabAB activator. However, none of these genes were involved in the regulation of fabAB transcription. Use of mariner-based random mutagenesis to screen for fabA activator(s) showed that several genes encoding unknown functions, rpoN and DesA may be involved in fabA regulation, but probably via indirect mechanisms. Biochemical attempts performed did fail to isolate an activator of fabAB operon. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The data suggest that fabA expression might not be regulated by protein-binding, but by a distinct mechanism such as a regulatory RNA-based mechanism.
TI  - Construction and characterization of nitrate and nitrite respiring Pseudomonas putida KT2440 strains for anoxic biotechnical applications.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is frequently used in biotechnical research and applications due to its metabolic versatility and organic solvent resistance. A major drawback for a broad application is the inability of the bacterium to survive and grow under anoxic conditions, which prohibits the production of oxygen-sensitive proteins and metabolites. To develop a P. putida strain, which is able to survive under anoxic conditions, the enzymatic systems of anaerobic nitrate and nitrite respiration were introduced into KT2440. For this purpose, two cosmids encoding all structural, maturation and regulatory genes for P. aeruginosa nitrate reductase (pNAR) and nitrite- and nitric oxide reductase (pNIR-NOR) were stably maintained in P. putida KT2440. Transcriptome analyses revealed expression of the encoded nar, nir and nor operons and accessory genes under anoxic conditions. The produced enzyme systems efficiently reduced nitrate or nitrite, respectively, sustaining anaerobic life of recombinant KT2440. Interestingly, anaerobic life of P. putida induced genes involved in arginine-fermentation and genes encoding a putative copper stress resistance operon.
TI  - Perceiving the chemical language of Gram-negative bacteria: listening by high-resolution mass spectrometry.
AB  - Gram-negative bacteria use N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) as their command language to coordinate population behavior during invasion and colonization of higher organisms. Although many different bacterial bioreporters are available for AHLs monitoring, in which a phenotypic response, e.g. bioluminescence, violacin production, and beta-galactosidase activity, is exploited, mass spectrometry (MS) is the most versatile detector for rapid analysis of AHLs in complex microbial samples, with or without prior separation steps. In this paper we critically review recent advances in the application of high-resolution MS to analysis of the quorum sensing (QS) signaling molecules used by Gram-negative bacteria, with much emphasis on AHLs. A critical review of the use of bioreporters in the study of AHLs is followed by a short methodological survey of the capabilities of high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), including Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) MS and quadrupole time-of-flight (qTOF) MS. Use of infusion electrospray ultrahigh-resolution FTICR MS (12 Tesla) enables accurate mass measurements for determination of the elemental formulas of AHLs in Acidovorax sp. N35 and Burkholderia ubonensis AB030584. Results obtained by coupling liquid chromatography with a hybrid quadrupole linear ion trap-FTICR mass spectrometer (LC-LTQ-FTICRMS, 7-T) for characterization of acylated homoserine lactones in the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa are presented. UPLC-ESI-qTOF MS has also proved to be suitable for identification of 3O-C(10)HSL in Pseudomonas putida IsoF cell culture supernatant. Aspects of sample preparation and the avoidance of analytical pitfalls are also emphasized.
TI  - Influence of bacterial extracellular polymeric substances on the formation of carbonaceous and nitrogenous disinfection byproducts.
AB  - Considering the regulatory presence of residual chlorine in water distribution systems, untreated organic matter may not be the sole contributor to disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation, given the presence of microbial biofilm with extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). This study investigated the influence of bacterial EPS on the formation of carbonaceous DBPs (C-DBPs) and nitrogenous DBPs (N-DBPs), reacting chlorine with Pseudomonas strains that produce different quantities and composition of EPS. When biomass is reacted in excess to chlorine, both C-DBPs and N-DBPs were produced without preference for speciation. However, under an excess of chlorine compared to biomass, increased EPS content led to enhanced formation of DBPs. The DBP yield of haloacetic acids (HAAs) was higher than that of trihalomethanes where dichloroacetic acid was dominant in HAA species. Additionally, chemical composition of EPS influenced the yields of DBPs. The N-DBP yield from P. putida EPS was two times higher than that of P. aeruginosa EPS, which suggested that higher organic nitrogen content in EPS contributes to higher N-DBP yield. Moreover, time-based experiments revealed that DBP formation from biomass occurs rapidly, reaching a maximum in less than four hours. Combined results suggest that bacterial EPS have significant roles in both the formation and fate of DBPs.
TI  - Commensal Pseudomonas species isolated from wastewater and freshwater milieus in  the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, as reservoir of antibiotic resistant determinants.
AB  - Pseudomonas species are opportunistic pathogens with implications in a wide range of diseases including cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anaemia. Because of their status as multidrug resistant (MDR) and extremely drug resistant (XDR) bacteria Pseudomonas species represent a threat to public health. Prevalence, antibiogram and associated antibiotic resistant genes of Pseudomonas species isolated from freshwater and mixed liquor environments in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa were assessed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based technique was used to identify the isolates and screen for antibiotic resistant genes. The result shows occurrence of Pseudomonas spp. in freshwater and mixed liquor as follows: 71.42% and 37.5% (P. putida), 14.28% and 31.25% (P. fluorescens), 7.14% and 6.25% (P. aeruginosa) and 7.14% and 25% for other Pseudomonas species respectively. Disk diffusion antibiogram of the Pseudomonas isolates from the two locations showed 100% resistance to penicillin, oxacillin, clindamycin, rifampicin and 100% susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin with varied percentage resistances to cephalothin, nalidixic acid, tetracycline, and ampicillin. The bla(TEM) antibiotic resistant gene was detected in 12.5% of P. putida, 57.14% of P. fluorescens, 100% P. aeruginosa and 40% in other Pseudomonas species. Similarly, Integrons conserved segment were detected in 12.5% of P. putida, 57.14% of P. fluorescens, 100% of P. aeruginosa and 40% of other Pseudomonas species. The presence of bla(TEM) gene and integrons conserved segment in some of the isolates is worrisome and suggest Pseudomonas species as important reservoirs of multidrug resistance genes in the Eastern Cape Province environment.
TI  - Identification and characterization of D-hydroxyproline dehydrogenase and Delta1-pyrroline-4-hydroxy-2-carboxylate deaminase involved in novel L-hydroxyproline metabolism of bacteria: metabolic convergent evolution.
AB  - L-hydroxyproline (4-hydroxyproline) mainly exists in collagen, and most bacteria  cannot metabolize this hydroxyamino acid. Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa convert L-hydroxyproline to alpha-ketoglutarate via four hypothetical enzymatic steps different from known mammalian pathways, but the molecular background is rather unclear. Here, we identified and characterized for the first time two novel enzymes, D-hydroxyproline dehydrogenase and Delta(1)-pyrroline-4-hydroxy-2-carboxylate (Pyr4H2C) deaminase, involved in this hypothetical pathway. These genes were clustered together with genes encoding other catalytic enzymes on the bacterial genomes. D-hydroxyproline dehydrogenases from P. putida and P. aeruginosa were completely different from known bacterial proline dehydrogenases and showed similar high specificity for substrate (D-hydroxyproline) and some artificial electron acceptor(s). On the other hand, the former is a homomeric enzyme only containing FAD as a prosthetic group, whereas the latter is a novel heterododecameric structure consisting of three different subunits (alpha(4)beta(4)gamma(4)), and two FADs, FMN, and [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur cluster were contained in alphabetagamma of the heterotrimeric unit. These results suggested that the L-hydroxyproline pathway clearly evolved convergently in P. putida and P. aeruginosa. Pyr4H2C deaminase is a unique member of the dihydrodipicolinate synthase/N-acetylneuraminate lyase protein family, and its activity was competitively inhibited by pyruvate, a common substrate for other dihydrodipicolinate synthase/N-acetylneuraminate lyase proteins. Furthermore, disruption of Pyr4H2C deaminase genes led to loss of growth on L-hydroxyproline (as well as D-hydroxyproline) but not L- and D-proline, indicating that this pathway is related only to L-hydroxyproline degradation, which is not linked to proline metabolism.
TI  - Expression, purification, and characterization of alanine racemase from Pseudomonas putida YZ-26.
AB  - Alanine racemase catalyzes the interconversion of D: - and L: -alanine and plays  an important role in supplying D: -alanine, a component of peptidoglycan biosynthesis, to most bacteria. Alanine racemase exists mostly in prokaryotes and is generally absent in higher eukaryotes; this makes it an attractive target for the design of new antibacterial drugs. Here, we present the cloning and characterization of a new gene-encoding alanine racemase from Pseudomonas putida YZ-26. An open reading frame (ORF) of 1,230 bp, encoding a protein of 410 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 44,217.3 Da, was cloned into modified vector pET32M to form the recombinant plasmid pET-alr. After introduction into E.coli BL21, the strain pET-alr/E.coli BL21 expressed His(6)-tagged alanine racemase. The recombinant alanine racemase was efficiently purified to homogeneity using Ni(2+)-NTA and a gel filtration column, with 82.5% activity recovery. The amino acid sequence deduced from the alanine racemase gene revealed identity similarities of 97.0, 93, 23, and 22.0% with from P. putida F1, P. putida200, P. aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium, respectively. The recombinant alanine racemase is a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of 43 kDa. The enzyme exhibited activity with L: -alanine and L: -isoleucine, and showed higher specificity for the former compared with the latter. The enzyme was stable from pH 7.0-11.0; its optimum pH was at 9.0. The optimum temperature for the enzyme was 37 degrees C, and its activity was rapidly lost at temperatures above 40 degrees C. Divalent metals, including Sr(2+), Mn(2+), Co(2+), and Ni(2+) obviously enhanced enzymatic activity, while the Cu(2+) ion showed inhibitory effects.
TI  - Construction of a stable genetically engineered rhamnolipid-producing microorganism for remediation of pyrene-contaminated soil.
AB  - One rhamnolipid-producing bacterial strain named Pseudomonas aeruginosa BSFD5 was isolated and characterized. Its rhlABRI cassette including necessary genes for rhamnolipid synthesis was cloned and transformed into the chromosome of P. putida KT2440 by a new random transposon vector without introducing antibiotic-resistance marker, generating a genetically engineered microorganism named P. putida KT2440-rhlABRI, which could stably express the rhlABRI cassette and produce rhamnolipid at a yield of 1.68 g l(-1). In experiments using natural soil, it was shown that P. putida KT2440-rhlABRI could increase the dissolution of pyrene and thus promote its degradation by indigenous microorganisms. P. putida KT2440-rhlABRI thus demonstrated potential for enhancing the remediation of soils contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
TI  - Biodegradation of chlorpyrifos by bacterial consortium isolated from agriculture  soil.
AB  - Organophosphorous pesticides are widely used in agriculture to control major insect pests. Chlorpyrifos is one of the major organophosphorous pesticides which is used to control insects including termites, beetles. The widespread use of these pesticides is hazardous to the environment and also toxic to mammals, thus it is essential to remove the same from the environment. From the chlorpyrifos contaminated soil nine morphologically different bacterial strains, one actinomycete and two fungal strains were isolated. Among those isolates four bacterial strains which were more efficient were developed as consortium. The four bacterial isolates namely Pseudomonas putida (NII 1117), Klebsiella sp., (NII 1118), Pseudomonas stutzeri (NII 1119), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (NII 1120) present in the consortia were identified on the basis of 16S rDNA analysis. The intracellular fractions of the consortium exhibited more organophosphorus hydrolase activity (0.171 +/- 0.003 U/mL/min). The degradation studies were carried out at neutral pH and temperature 37 degrees C with chlorpyrifos concentration 500 mg L(-1). LC-mass spectral analysis showed the presence of metabolites chlopyrifos-oxon and Diethylphosphorothioate. These results highlight an important potential use of this consortium for the cleanup of chlorpyrifos contaminated pesticide waste in the environment.
TI  - Effects of 14-alpha-lipoyl andrographolide on quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the quorum-sensing (QS) system is closely related to biofilm formation. We previously demonstrated that 14-alpha-lipoyl andrographolide (AL-1) has synergistic effects on antibiofilm and antivirulence factors (pyocyanin and exopolysaccharide) of P. aeruginosa when combined with conventional antibiotics, while it has little inhibitory effect on its growth. However, its molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here we investigated the effect of AL-1 on QS systems, especially the Las and Rhl systems. This investigation showed that AL-1 can inhibit LasR-3-oxo-C(12)-homoserine lactone (HSL) interactions and repress the transcriptional level of QS-regulated genes. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR data showed that AL-1 significantly reduced the expression levels of lasR, lasI, rhlR, and rhlI in a dose-dependent manner. AL-1 not only decreased the expression level of Psl, which is positively regulated by the Las system, but also increased the level of secretion of ExoS, which is negatively regulated by the Rhl system, indicating that AL-1 has multiple effects on both the Las and Rhl systems. It is no wonder that AL-1 showed synergistic effects with other antimicrobial agents in the treatment of P. aeruginosa infections.
TI  - Membrane vesicle formation as a multiple-stress response mechanism enhances Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E cell surface hydrophobicity and biofilm formation.
AB  - Among the adaptive responses of bacteria to rapid changes in environmental conditions, those of the cell envelope are known to be the most crucial. Therefore, several mechanisms with which bacteria change their cell surface and membranes in the presence of different environmental stresses have been elucidated. Among these mechanisms, the release of outer membrane vesicles (MV) in Gram-negative bacteria has attracted particular research interest because of its involvement in pathogenic processes, such as that of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation in cystic fibrosis lungs. In this study, we investigated the role of MV formation as an adaptive response of Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E to several environmental stress factors and correlated it to the formation of biofilms. In the presence of toxic concentrations of long-chain alcohols, under osmotic stress caused by NaCl, in the presence of EDTA, and after heat shock, cells of this strain released MV within 10 min in the presence of a stressor. The MV formed showed similar size and charge properties, as well as comparable compositions of proteins and fatty acids. MV release caused a significant increase in cell surface hydrophobicity, and an enhanced tendency to form biofilms was demonstrated in this study. Therefore, the release of MV as a stress response could be put in a physiological context.
TI  - A Pseudomonas putida bioreporter for the detection of enzymes active on 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolone signalling molecules.
AB  - The quorum sensing signalling molecules 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone, termed the "Pseudomonas quinolone signal" (PQS), and 2-heptyl-4(1H)-quinolone (HHQ) play an important role in the control of virulence gene expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To construct a bioreporter for the specific and sensitive detection of these compounds, a plasmid with the pqsR gene encoding the PQS- and HHQ-responsive transcriptional regulator PqsR, and with the PqsR-controlled pqsA promoter fused to the lacZ gene, was established in Pseudomonas putida KT2440. The bioreporter responds to HHQ and PQS at concentrations in the range of 0.1-10 and 0.01-5 muM, respectively, with EC(50) values of 1.50 +/- 0.25 muM for HHQ and 0.15 +/- 0.02 muM for PQS. 2,4-Dihydroxyquinoline, a metabolite produced abundantly by P. aeruginosa, did not elicit an increase in reporter enzyme activity. To test whether the bioreporter can be used for the detection of enzymes active on AQ signalling molecules, the hodC gene coding for 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone 2,4-dioxygenase was expressed in the reporter strain. This dioxygenase catalyses the cleavage of PQS, albeit with very low activity. The response of the bioreporter to PQS was significantly quenched by co-expression of the hodC gene, and HPLC analysis of culture extracts verified that the PQS levels decreased during cultivation. The bioreporter can be applied to screen for AQ-converting enzymes, which will be useful tools to interfere with quorum sensing and thus virulence in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - ATP-dependent RecG helicase is required for the transcriptional regulator OxyR function in Pseudomonas species.
AB  - The oxyR gene appears to reside in an operon with the recG helicase gene in many  bacteria, including pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. Analysis of P. putida transcriptomes shows that many OxyR-controlled genes are regulated by the ATP-dependent RecG helicase and that RecG alone modulates the expression of many genes. We found that purified RecG binds to the promoters of many OxyR-controlled genes and that expression of these genes was not induced under conditions of oxidative stress in recG mutants of P. aeruginosa, P. putida, and Escherichia coli. In vitro data revealed that promoters containing palindromic sequences are essential for RecG binding and that single-strand binding proteins and ATP are also needed for RecG to promote transcription, whereas a magnesium ion has the opposite effect. The OxyR tetramer preferentially binds to promoters after RecG has generated linear DNA in the presence of ATP; otherwise, the OxyR dimer has higher affinity. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of bacterial transcription by demonstrating that RecG might be required for the induction of the OxyR regulon by unwinding palindromic DNA for transcription. This work describes a novel bacterial transcriptional function by RecG helicase with OxyR and may provide new targets for controlling Pseudomonas species pathogen.
TI  - Selected antimicrobial essential oils eradicate Pseudomonas spp. and Staphylococcus aureus biofilms.
AB  - Biofilms are difficult to eliminate with standard antimicrobial treatments due to their high antibiotic resistance relative to free-living cells. Here, we show that selected antimicrobial essential oils can eradicate bacteria within biofilms with higher efficiency than certain important antibiotics, making them interesting candidates for the treatment of biofilms.
TI  - Identification of reciprocal adhesion genes in pathogenic and non-pathogenic Pseudomonas.
AB  - We used a combination of in silico and large-scale mutagenesis approaches to expand our current knowledge of the genetic determinants used by Pseudomonas putida KT2440 to attach to surfaces. We first identified in silico orthologues that have been annotated in Pseudomonas aeruginosa as potentially involved in attachment. In this search 67 paired-related genes of P. putida KT2440 and P. aeruginosa were identified as associated to adhesion. To test the potential role of the corresponding gene products in adhesion, 37 knockout mutants of KT2440, available in the Pseudomonas Reference Culture Collection, were analysed with regard to their ability to form biofilms in polystyrene microtitre plates; of these, six mutants were deficient in adhesion. Since mutants in all potential adhesion genes were not available, we generated a genome-wide collection of mutants made of 7684 independent mini-Tn5 insertions and tested them for the formation of biofilm on polystyrene microtitre plates. Eighteen clones that exhibited a reduction of at least twofold in biofilm biomass formation were considered candidate mutants in adhesion determinants. DNA sequencing of the insertion site identified five other new genes involved in adhesion. Phenotypic characterization of the mutants showed that 11 of the inactivated proteins were required for attachment to biotic surfaces too. This combined approach allowed us to identify new proteins with a role in P. putida adhesion, including the global regulator RpoN and GacS, PstS that corresponds to one of the paired-related genes for which a mutant was not available in the mutant collection, and a protein of unknown function (PP1633). The remaining mutants corresponded to functions known or predicted to participate in adhesion based on previous evidence, such as the large adhesion proteins LapA, LapF and flagellar proteins. In silico analysis showed this set of genes to be well conserved in all sequenced P. putida strains, and that at least eight reciprocal genes involved in attachment are shared by P. putida and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Increased IgA and IgM responses against gut commensals in chronic depression: further evidence for increased bacterial translocation or leaky gut.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, we discovered that depression is accompanied by increased IgM and IgA responses directed against gram negative gut commensals. The aim of this study was to replicate these findings in a larger study group of depressed patients and to examine the associations between the IgA and IgM responses to gut commensals and staging of depression as well as the fatigue and somatic (F&S) symptoms of depression. METHODS: We measured serum concentrations of IgM and IgA against the LPS of gram-negative enterobacteria, i.e. Hafnia alvei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas putida, Citrobacter koseri, and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 112 depressed patients and 28 normal controls. The severity of F&S symptoms was measured using the Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Rating Scale. RESULTS: The prevalences and median values of serum IgM and IgA against LPS of these commensals were significantly higher in depressed patients than in controls. The IgM levels directed against the LPS of these commensal bacteria were significantly higher in patients with chronic depression than in those without. The immune responses directed against LPS were not associated with melancholia or recurrent depression. There was a significant correlation between the IgA response directed against LPS and gastro-intestinal symptoms. DISCUSSION: The results indicate that increased bacterial translocation with immune responses to the LPS of commensal bacteria may play a role in the pathophysiology of depression, particularly chronic depression. Bacterial translocation may a) occur secondary to systemic inflammation in depression and intensify and perpetuate the primary inflammatory response once the commensals are translocated; or b) be a primary trigger factor associated with the onset of depression in some vulnerable individuals. The findings suggest that "translocated" gut commensal bacteria activate immune cells to elicit IgA and IgM responses and that this phenomenon may play a role in the pathophysiology of (chronic) depression by causing progressive amplifications of immune pathways.
TI  - Caveat emptor: the role of suboptimal bronchoscope repair practices by a third-party vendor in a pseudo-outbreak of pseudomonas in bronchoalveolar lavage specimens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a pseudo-outbreak associated with loose bronchoscope biopsy ports caused by inadequate bronchoscope repair practices by third-party vendors and to alert healthcare personnel to assess bronchoscope repair practices. DESIGN: Outbreak investigation. SETTING: A 925-bed tertiary care hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. PATIENTS: Patients who underwent bronchoscopy with certain bronchoscopes after they had been repaired by a third-party vendor. METHODS: An epidemiologic investigation was conducted to determine the cause of Pseudomonas putida growth in 4 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens within a 3-day period in May 2008. All bronchoscopes were inspected, and cultures were obtained from bronchoscopes and the environment. Bronchoscope cleaning and maintenance practices were reviewed. Microbiologic results from BAL specimens and medical records were reviewed to find additional cases. RESULTS: All 4 case patients had undergone bronchoscopy with one of 2 bronchoscopes, both of which had loose biopsy ports. Bronchoscope cultures grew P. putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas. The P. putida strains from the bronchoscopes matched those from the patients. Specimens from 12 additional patients who underwent bronchoscopy with these bronchoscopes grew P. putida, P. aeruginosa, or Stenotrophomonas. No patients developed clinical signs or symptoms of infection, but 7 were treated with antibiotics. Investigation revealed that the implicated bronchoscopes had been sent to an external vendor for repair; examination by the manufacturer revealed irregularities in repairs and nonstandard part replacements. CONCLUSIONS: Third-party vendors without access to proprietary information may contribute to mechanical malfunction of medical devices, which can lead to contamination and incomplete disinfection.
TI  - Roles of long and short replication initiation proteins in the fate of IncP-1 plasmids.
AB  - Broad-host-range IncP-1 plasmids generally encode two replication initiation proteins, TrfA1 and TrfA2. TrfA2 is produced from an internal translational start site within trfA1. While TrfA1 was previously shown to be essential for replication in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, its role in other bacteria within its broad host range has not been established. To address the role of TrfA1 and TrfA2 in other hosts, efficiency of transformation, plasmid copy number (PCN), and plasmid stability were first compared between a mini-IncP-1beta plasmid and its trfA1 frameshift variant in four phylogenetically distant hosts: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, Sphingobium japonicum, and Cupriavidus necator. TrfA2 was sufficient for replication in these hosts, but the presence of TrfA1 enhanced transformation efficiency and PCN. However, TrfA1 did not contribute to, and even negatively affected, long-term plasmid persistence. When trfA genes were cloned under a constitutive promoter in the chromosomes of the four hosts, strains expressing either both TrfA1 and TrfA2 or TrfA1 alone, again, generally elicited a higher PCN of an IncP1-beta replicon than strains expressing TrfA2 alone. When a single species of TrfA was produced at different concentrations in E. coli cells, TrfA1 maintained a 3- to 4-fold higher PCN than TrfA2 at the same TrfA concentrations, indicating that replication mediated by TrfA1 is more efficient than that by TrfA2. These results suggest that the broad-host-range properties of IncP-1 plasmids are essentially conferred by TrfA2 and the intact replication origin alone but that TrfA1 is nonetheless important to efficiently establish plasmid replication upon transfer into a broad range of hosts.
TI  - Simultaneous removal of phosphorus and nitrogen in a sequencing batch biofilm reactor with transgenic bacteria expressing polyphosphate kinase.
AB  - To improve phosphorus removal from wastewater, we constructed a high-phosphate-accumulating microorganism, KTPPK, using Pseudomonas putida KT2440 as a host. The expression plasmid was constructed by inserting and expressing polyphosphate kinase gene (ppk) from Microcystis aeruginosa NIES-843 into broad-host-range plasmid, pBBR1MCS-2. KTPPK was then added to a sequencing batch biofilm reactor (SBBFR) using lava as a biological carrier. The results showed that SBBFR with KTPPK not only efficiently removed COD, NH(3)-N, and NO(3)(-)-N but also had a high removal capacity for PO(4)(3-)-P, resulting in a low phosphorus concentration remaining in the outflow of the SBBFR. The biofilm increased by 30-53% on the lava in the SBBFR that contained KTPPK after 11 days when compared with the reactor that contained P. putida KT2440. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction confirmed that the copy of ppk was maintained at about 3.5 x 10(10) copies per muL general DNA in the biofilm after 20 days. Thus, the transgenic bacteria KTPPK could maintain a high density and promote phosphorus removal in the SBBFR. In summary, this study indicates that the use of SBBFR with transgenic bacteria has the potential to remove phosphorus and nitrogen from wastewater.
TI  - The role of extracellular polymeric substances on the sorption of natural organic matter.
AB  - In this study, the influence of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) composition and quantity was explored for biosorption of natural organic matter (NOM), using variants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. Model EPS (sodium alginate beads) were tested and sorption capacity for NOM was also elucidated. In the absence of divalent ions, minimal NOM biosorption was observed and differences among strains were negligible. Under presence of divalent ions, biosorption of NOM was proportional to the amount of EPS secreted by P. aeruginosa variants. For sorption tests with model EPS, divalent ions also promoted biosorption of tested NOM, and total biosorption was also proportional to alginate quantity. Carboxyl group content in both alginate EPS and NOM appeared to be linked to increased biosorption via bridging with divalent ions. The alginate overproducing strain possessed more potential NOM biosorption sites, while the wild-type and alginate deficient strains possessed fewer potential binding sites. In comparison, P. putida, secreting protein-based EPS, behaved differently for NOM biosorption, due to its hydrophobicity and the structural characteristics of proteins. Hydrophobic interactions appeared to enhance the biosorption of more hydrophobic Suwannee River humic acid by P. putida, whose biosorption of more hydrophilic NOM variants was similar to the alginate deficient strain. Mechanistically, the presence of a diffuse electrical double layer will present potential energy barriers limiting biosorption; however, divalent ion concentrations in the aquatic environment will promote biosorption processes, permitting functional group interactions between EPS and NOM. Bridging between hydrophilic carboxyl groups on alginate EPS and NOM appeared to be the dominant form of biosorption, while hydrophobic interactions enhanced biosorption for protein-based EPS.
TI  - Functional characterization of the quorum sensing regulator RsaL in the plant-beneficial strain Pseudomonas putida WCS358.
AB  - In many bacteria, quorum sensing (QS) systems rely on a signal receptor and a synthase producing N-acyl-homoserine lactone(s) as the signal molecule(s). In some species, the rsaL gene, located between the signal receptor and synthase genes, encodes a repressor limiting signal synthase expression and hence signal molecule production. Here we investigate the molecular mechanism of action of the RsaL protein in the plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium Pseudomonas putida WCS358 (RsaL(WCS)). In P. putida WCS358, RsaL(WCS) displayed a strong repressive effect on the promoter of the QS signal synthase gene, ppuI, while it did not repress the same promoter in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. DNase I protection assays showed that purified RsaL(WCS) specifically binds to ppuI on a DNA region overlapping the predicted sigma(70)-binding site, but such protection was observed only at high protein concentrations. Accordingly, electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the RsaL(WCS) protein was not able to form stable complexes efficiently with a probe encompassing the ppuI promoter, while it formed stable complexes with the promoter of lasI, the gene orthologous to ppuI in P. aeruginosa. This difference seems to be dictated by the lower dyad symmetry of the RsaL(WCS)-binding sequence on the ppuI promoter relative to that on the lasI promoter. Comparison of the results obtained in vivo and in vitro suggests that RsaL(WCS) needs a molecular interactor/cofactor specific for P. putida WCS358 to repress ppuI transcription. We also demonstrate that RsaL(WCS) regulates siderophore-mediated growth limitation of plant pathogens and biofilm formation, two processes relevant for plant growth-promoting activity.
TI  - First report of a bifunctional chitinase/lysozyme produced by Bacillus pumilus SG2.
AB  - Bacillus pumilus SG2 isolated from high salinity ecosystem in Iran produces two chitinases (ChiS and ChiL) and secretes them into the medium. In this study, chiS and chiL genes were cloned in pQE-30 expression vector and were expressed in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli strain M15. The recombinant proteins were purified using Ni-NTA column. The optimum pH and optimum temperature for enzyme activity of ChiS were pH 6, 50 degrees C; those of ChiL were pH 6.5, 40 degrees C. The purified chitinases showed antifungal activity against Fusarium graminearum, Rhizoctonia solani, Magnaporthe grisea, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Trichoderma reesei, Botrytis cinerea and Bipolaris sp. Moreover, purified ChiS was identified as chitinase/lysozyme, which are capable of degrading the chitin component of fungal cell walls and the peptidoglycan component of cell walls with many kinds of bacteria (Xanthomonas translucens pv. hordei, Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri, Bacillus licheniformis, E. coli C600, E. coli TOP10, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida). Strong homology was found between the three-dimensional structures of ChiS and a chitinase/lysozyme from Bacillus circulans WL-12. This is the first report of a bifunctional chitinase/lysozyme from B. pumilus.
TI  - Two small RNAs, CrcY and CrcZ, act in concert to sequester the Crc global regulator in Pseudomonas putida, modulating catabolite repression.
AB  - The Crc protein is a translational repressor that recognizes a specific target at some mRNAs, controlling catabolite repression and co-ordinating carbon metabolism in pseudomonads. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the levels of free Crc protein are controlled by CrcZ, a sRNA that sequesters Crc, acting as an antagonist. We show that, in Pseudomonas putida, the levels of free Crc are controlled by CrcZ and by a novel 368 nt sRNA named CrcY. CrcZ and CrcY, which contain six potential targets for Crc, were able to bind Crc specifically in vitro. The levels of CrcZ and CrcY were low under conditions generating a strong catabolite repression, and increased strongly when catabolite repression was absent. Deletion of either crcZ or crcY had no effect on catabolite repression, but the simultaneous absence of both sRNAs led to constitutive catabolite repression that compromised growth on some carbon sources. Overproduction of CrcZ or CrcY significantly reduced repression. We propose that CrcZ and CrcY act in concert, sequestering and modulating the levels of free Crc according to metabolic conditions. The CbrA/CbrB two-component system activated crcZ transcription, but had little effect on crcY. CrcY was detected in P. putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas syringae, but not in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Promysalin, a salicylate-containing Pseudomonas putida antibiotic, promotes surface colonization and selectively targets other Pseudomonas.
AB  - Under control of the Gac regulatory system, Pseudomonas putida RW10S1 produces promysalin to promote its own swarming and biofilm formation, and to selectively inhibit many other pseudomonads, including the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This amphipathic antibiotic is composed of salicylic acid and 2,8-dihydroxymyristamide bridged by a unique 2-pyrroline-5-carboxyl moiety. In addition to enzymes for salicylic acid synthesis and activation, the biosynthetic gene cluster encodes divergent type II fatty acid biosynthesis components, unusual fatty acid-tailoring enzymes (two Rieske-type oxygenases and an amidotransferase), an enzyme resembling a proline-loading module of nonribosomal peptide synthetases, and the first prokaryotic member of the BAHD family of plant acyltransferases. Identification of biosynthetic intermediates enabled to propose a pathway for synthesis of this bacterial colonization factor.
TI  - Growth independent rhamnolipid production from glucose using the non-pathogenic Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rhamnolipids are potent biosurfactants with high potential for industrial applications. However, rhamnolipids are currently produced with the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa during growth on hydrophobic substrates such as plant oils. The heterologous production of rhamnolipids entails two essential advantages: Disconnecting the rhamnolipid biosynthesis from the complex quorum sensing regulation and the opportunity of avoiding pathogenic production strains, in particular P. aeruginosa. In addition, separation of rhamnolipids from fatty acids is difficult and hence costly. RESULTS: Here, the metabolic engineering of a rhamnolipid producing Pseudomonas putida KT2440, a strain certified as safety strain using glucose as carbon source to avoid cumbersome product purification, is reported. Notably, P. putida KT2440 features almost no changes in growth rate and lag-phase in the presence of high concentrations of rhamnolipids (> 90 g/L) in contrast to the industrially important bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium glutamicum, and Escherichia coli. P. putida KT2440 expressing the rhlAB-genes from P. aeruginosa PAO1 produces mono-rhamnolipids of P. aeruginosa PAO1 type (mainly C(10):C(10)). The metabolic network was optimized in silico for rhamnolipid synthesis from glucose. In addition, a first genetic optimization, the removal of polyhydroxyalkanoate formation as competing pathway, was implemented. The final strain had production rates in the range of P. aeruginosa PAO1 at yields of about 0.15 g/g(glucose) corresponding to 32% of the theoretical optimum. What's more, rhamnolipid production was independent from biomass formation, a trait that can be exploited for high rhamnolipid production without high biomass formation. CONCLUSIONS: A functional alternative to the pathogenic rhamnolipid producer P. aeruginosa was constructed and characterized. P. putida KT24C1 pVLT31_rhlAB featured the highest yield and titer reported from heterologous rhamnolipid producers with glucose as carbon source. Notably, rhamnolipid production was uncoupled from biomass formation, which allows optimal distribution of resources towards rhamnolipid synthesis. The results are discussed in the context of rational strain engineering by using the concepts of synthetic biology like chassis cells and orthogonality, thereby avoiding the complex regulatory programs of rhamnolipid production existing in the natural producer P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Development of an immunochromatographic assay for diagnosing the production of IMP-type metallo-beta-lactamases that mediate carbapenem resistance in Pseudomonas.
AB  - Rapid and reliable detection of carbapenem-resistant bacteria is an important infection-control measure and a crucial aspect of antimicrobial chemotherapy. IMP-type metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) is an emzyme that mediate carbapenem resistance in bacteria. Here, an immunochromatographic assay was newly developed using novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing IMP-type MBL. Epitope mapping of mAbs and mutational analysis of the epitope region in IMP antigen suggested that the mAbs could react to all known subtypes of IMP-type MBL. Evaluation of the assay using Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (n=248) showed that the results of the immunochromatographic detection of the IMP-type MBLs were fully consistent with those of the PCR analysis for bla(IMP) genes, showing false positives and negatives. All positive strains were resistant to carbapenem (MIC >/= 16 mug/ml). The assay also accurately distinguished the production of IMP-type MBLs in Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. The detection limit of the assay was 5.7x10(4)cfu per test. Taken together, these data suggest that the developed assay can be used for rapid and reliable diagnosis of the production of IMP-type MBLs in Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of the chipsi subcomplex of Pseudomonas aeruginosa DNA polymerase III.
AB  - BACKGROUND: DNA polymerase III, the main enzyme responsible for bacterial DNA replication, is composed of three sub-assemblies: the polymerase core, the beta-sliding clamp, and the clamp loader. During replication, single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) coats and protects single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and also interacts with the chipsi heterodimer, a sub-complex of the clamp loader. Whereas the chi subunits of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are about 40% homologous, P. aeruginosa psi is twice as large as its E. coli counterpart, and contains additional sequences. It was shown that P. aeruginosa chipsi together with SSB increases the activity of its cognate clamp loader 25-fold at low salt. The E. coli clamp loader, however, is insensitive to the addition of its cognate chipsi under similar conditions. In order to find out distinguishing properties within P. aeruginosa chipsi which account for this higher stimulatory effect, we characterized P. aeruginosa chipsi by a detailed structural and functional comparison with its E. coli counterpart. RESULTS: Using small-angle X-ray scattering, analytical ultracentrifugation, and homology-based modeling, we found the N-terminus of P. aeruginosa psi to be unstructured. Under high salt conditions, the affinity of the chipsi complexes from both organisms to their cognate SSB was similar. Under low salt conditions, P. aeruginosa chipsi, contrary to E. coli chipsi, binds to ssDNA via the N-terminus of psi. Whereas it is also able to bind to double-stranded DNA, the affinity is somewhat reduced. CONCLUSIONS: The binding to DNA, otherwise never reported for any other psi protein, enhances the affinity of P. aeruginosa chipsi towards the SSB/ssDNA complex and very likely contributes to the higher stimulatory effect of P. aeruginosa chipsi on the clamp loader. We also observed DNA-binding activity for P. putida chipsi, making this activity most probably a characteristic of the psi proteins from the Pseudomonadaceae.
TI  - Phosphorylcholine Phosphatase: A Peculiar Enzyme of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa synthesizes phosphorylcholine phosphatase (PchP) when grown on choline, betaine, dimethylglycine or carnitine. In the presence of Mg(2+) or Zn(2+), PchP catalyzes the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenylphosphate (p-NPP) or phosphorylcholine (Pcho). The regulation of pchP gene expression is under the control of GbdR and NtrC; dimethylglycine is likely the metabolite directly involved in the induction of PchP. Therefore, the regulation of choline metabolism and consequently PchP synthesis may reflect an adaptive response of P. aeruginosa to environmental conditions. Bioinformatic and biochemistry studies shown that PchP contains two sites for alkylammonium compounds (AACs): one in the catalytic site near the metal ion-phosphoester pocket, and another in an inhibitory site responsible for the binding of the alkylammonium moiety. Both sites could be close to each other and interact through the residues (42)E, (43)E and (82)YYY(84). Zn(2+) is better activator than Mg(2+) at pH 5.0 and it is more effective at alleviating the inhibition produced by the entry of Pcho or different AACs in the inhibitory site. We postulate that Zn(2+) induces at pH 5.0 a conformational change in the active center that is communicated to the inhibitory site, producing a compact or closed structure. However, at pH 7.4, this effect is not observed because to the hydrolysis of the [Zn(2+)L(2) (-1)L(2) (0)(H(2)O)(2)] complex, which causes a change from octahedral to tetrahedral in the metal coordination geometry. This enzyme is also present in P. fluorescens, P. putida, P. syringae, and other organisms. We have recently crystallized PchP and solved its structure.
TI  - The potential for reductive mobilization of arsenic [As(V) to As(III)] by OSBH(2) (Pseudomonas stutzeri) and OSBH(5) (Bacillus cereus) in an oil-contaminated site.
AB  - Microbial reduction of arsenate [As(V)] plays an important role in arsenic (As) mobilization in aqueous environments. In this study, we investigated reduction of arsenate by different bacterial isolates such as OSBH(1) (GU329913), OSBH(2) (GU329914), OSBH(3) (GU329915), OSBH(4) (GU329916) and OSBH(5) (GU329917), isolated from the oil sludge of a sewage treatment plant operated by the China Petroleum Refinery Company in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan. Bacterial strains of pure culture were identified by 16S rRNA analysis (>/=99 % nucleotide similarity). Morphological and 16S rRNA analysis show that the isolate OSBH(1) is similar to E. coli, OSBH(2) is similar to P. stutzeri, OSBH(3) is similar to P. putida, OSBH(4) is similar to P. aeruginosa, and OSBH(5) is similar to B. Cereus. The As(V) was transformed to As(III) in the presence of isolates OSBH(2) and OSBH(5) by a detoxification process. The potential reduction rates of As(V) were higher in the presence of isolate OSBH(5) compared to the isolate OSBH(2). The microbial growth (cell/mL) of isolate OSBH(5) was significantly higher in culture medium compared to OSBH(2). The bacterial isolates such as OSBH(1), OSBH(3) and OSBH(4) were found to be incapable of transforming the As(V). It is concluded that the activity of the oil-degrading bacterial isolates described in this work contributes to the mobilization of As in the more toxic As(III) form that affects biotic life.
TI  - Type VI secretion delivers bacteriolytic effectors to target cells.
AB  - Peptidoglycan is the major structural constituent of the bacterial cell wall, forming a meshwork outside the cytoplasmic membrane that maintains cell shape and prevents lysis. In Gram-negative bacteria, peptidoglycan is located in the periplasm, where it is protected from exogenous lytic enzymes by the outer membrane. Here we show that the type VI secretion system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa breaches this barrier to deliver two effector proteins, Tse1 and Tse3, to the periplasm of recipient cells. In this compartment, the effectors hydrolyse peptidoglycan, thereby providing a fitness advantage for P. aeruginosa cells in competition with other bacteria. To protect itself from lysis by Tse1 and Tse3, P. aeruginosa uses specific periplasmically localized immunity proteins. The requirement for these immunity proteins depends on intercellular self-intoxication through an active type VI secretion system, indicating a mechanism for export whereby effectors do not access donor cell periplasm in transit.
TI  - The Pseudomonas aeruginosa quinolone quorum sensing signal alters the multicellular behaviour of Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
AB  - The molecule 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone (referred to as the Pseudomonas quinolone signal, or PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa as part of its quorum sensing circuit, and has been shown to influence a variety of processes in this bacterium, including the production of siderophores and secondary metabolites, virulence determinants and biofilm development. In this report we present evidence of the effect of PQS as an interspecies signal with a negative impact on the multicellular behaviour of Pseudomonas putida KT2440. PQS reduces biofilm formation and swarming motility, and interferes with iron uptake by this bacterium. Addition of PQS also causes changes in the transcription of several P. putida genes, indicating a specific response to the signal molecule, which is not produced by strain KT2440. Among the genes with increased expression in response to PQS is PP1563, which forms part of a large prophage cluster (PP1532-PP1584); consistently, phage-mediated lysis of some cells in the population was observed in the presence of PQS. Overall, these data indicate that PQS may be used by P. aeruginosa as a chemical weapon against potential competitors.
TI  - Initial bacterial attachment in slow flowing systems: effects of cell and substrate surface properties.
AB  - Bacterial biofilm can have significant effects on the behaviors and/or performance of natural and man-made systems. Understanding the factors governing initial bacterial attachment is critical to biofilm management. In this study, the initial attachment of three bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida, on two substrates, glass and octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) modified glass, was examined in flow chambers. The flow chambers were designed and operated to mimic slow moving water bodies and minimize the gravitational settlement of cells. The hydrophobicity of bacterial surface was evaluated by partitioning of cells to the water-hexadecane interface and the liquid contact angles on cell layers collected on filter papers. On the more hydrophilic glass surface, the attachment trend was found to be E. coli>P. putida>P. aeruginosa, while the opposite trend was observed on the hydrophobic, OTS modified surface. The attachment trend on glass could be explained by the magnitude of the negative interaction energy at secondary minima, as predicted by the extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (XDLVO) theory. The much higher attachments of P. aeruginosa and P. putida on the OTS-modified substrate, on the other hand, suggested that these cells could overcome the energy barrier between the primary and secondary minima of interaction energy to become attached to the primary minimum. The extent of primary-minimum attachment appeared to correlate with the scale of the energy barrier, with higher attachments in the bacteria-substrate combinations of lower energy barriers. The study generated important insights into the effects of cell and substrate surface properties on initial bacterial attachment.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from vegetables with regards to the marketing stage (farm vs. supermarket).
AB  - The aim of this study was to elucidate whether and to what extent fresh produce from Germany plays a role as a carrier and reservoir of antibiotic resistant bacteria. For this purpose, 1001 vegetables (fruit, root, bulbous vegetables, salads and cereals) were collected from 13 farms and 11 supermarkets in Germany and examined bacteriologically. Phenotypic resistance of Enterobacter cloacae (n=172); Enterobacter gergoviae (n=92); Pantoea agglomerans (n=96); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=295); Pseudomonas putida (n=106) and Enterococcus faecalis (n=100) against up to 30 antibiotics was determined by using the microdilution method. Resistance to ss-lactams was most frequently expressed by P. agglomerans and E. gergoviae against cefaclor (41% and 29%). Relatively high resistance rates were also observed for doxycycline (23%), erythromycin (21%) and rifampicin (65%) in E. faecalis, for spectinomycin (28%) and mezlocillin (12%) in E. cloacae, as well as for streptomycin (19%) in P. putida. In P. aeruginosa, relatively low resistance rates were observed for the aminoglycosides amikacin, apramicin, gentamicin, neomycin, netilmicin and tobramycin (<4%); 11% was resistant to streptomycin. No glycopeptide-resistant enterococci were observed. Resistance rates of bacteria isolated from farm samples were higher than those of the retail markets whenever significant differences were observed. This suggests that expressing resistance is at the expense of bacterial viability, since vegetables purchased directly at the farm are probably fresher than at the supermarket, and they have not been exposed to stress factors. However, this should not keep the customer from buying directly at the farm, since the overall resistance rates were not higher than observed in bacteria from human or animal origin. Instead, peeling or washing vegetables before eating them raw is highly recommended, since it reduces not only the risk of contact with pathogens, but also that of ingesting and spreading antibiotic resistant bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis and biotransformation of 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolones by recombinant Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
AB  - 2-Alkyl-4(1H)-quinolones (AQs) and related derivatives, which exhibit a variety of biological properties, are secondary metabolites produced by, e.g., Pseudomonas and Burkholderia spp. Due to their main role as signaling molecules in the quorum sensing system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2-heptyl-4(1H)-quinolone (HHQ) and its 3-hydroxy derivative, termed the "Pseudomonas quinolone signal" (PQS), have received considerable attention. Since chemical synthesis of different AQs is complex, we assessed the applicability of recombinant P. putida KT2440 strains for the biosynthetic production of AQs. In mineral salts medium supplemented with octanoate and anthranilate, batch cultures of P. putida KT2440 [pBBR-pqsABCD] produced about 45 muM HHQ, 30% and 70% of which were localized in the culture supernatant and methanolic cell extract, respectively. 2,4-Dihydroxyquinoline and minor amounts of C(3)- to C(1)(3)-saturated and C(7):(1) to C(1)(3):(1) monounsaturated AQs were formed as by-products. Mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses spectroscopy indicated that unsaturated AQs having the same molecular mass are cis and trans isomers rather than position isomers, with the double bond located between the alpha and beta carbon of the alkyl chain. Supplementing the cultures with hexanoate instead of octanoate shifted the AQ profile towards increased formation of C(5)-AQ. Individual AQs can be prepared from concentrated methanolic extracts by preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Regioselective hydroxylation of HHQ to PQS can be achieved in > 90% yield by biotransformation with P. putida KT2440 [pBBR-pqsH]. PQS can be isolated from methanolic cell extracts by HPLC, or be precipitated as Fe(III)-PQS complex. Preparation of a library of AQs will facilitate studies on the biological functions of these compounds.
TI  - Biotransformation of myrcene by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dihydrolinalool and terpineol are sources of fragrances that provide  a unique volatile terpenoid alcohol of low toxicity and thus are widely used in the perfumery industry, in folk medicine, and in aromatherapy. They are important chemical constituents of the essential oil of many plants. Previous studies have concerned the biotransformation of limonene by Pseudomonas putida. The objective of this research was to study biotransformation of myrcene by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The culture preparation was done using such variables as different microbial methods and incubation periods to obtain maximum cells of P. aeruginosa for myrcene biotransformation. RESULTS: It was found that myrcene was converted to dihydrolinalool and 2,6-dimethyloctane in high percentages. The biotransformation products were identified by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), ultraviolet (UV) analysis, gas chromatography (GC), and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Comparison of the different incubation times showed that 3 days was more effective, the major products being 2,6-dimethyloctane (90.0%) and alpha-terpineol (7.7%) and comprising 97.7%. In contrast, the main compounds derived for an incubation time of 1.5 days were dihydrolinalool (79.5%) and 2,6-dimethyloctane (9.3%), with a total yield of 88.8%.
TI  - Small-molecule inhibition of choline catabolism in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other aerobic choline-catabolizing bacteria.
AB  - Choline is abundant in association with eukaryotes and plays roles in osmoprotection, thermoprotection, and membrane biosynthesis in many bacteria. Aerobic catabolism of choline is widespread among soil proteobacteria, particularly those associated with eukaryotes. Catabolism of choline as a carbon, nitrogen, and/or energy source may play important roles in association with eukaryotes, including pathogenesis, symbioses, and nutrient cycling. We sought to generate choline analogues to study bacterial choline catabolism in vitro and in situ. Here we report the characterization of a choline analogue, propargylcholine, which inhibits choline catabolism at the level of Dgc enzyme-catalyzed dimethylglycine demethylation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We used genetic analyses and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance to demonstrate that propargylcholine is catabolized to its inhibitory form, propargylmethylglycine. Chemically synthesized propargylmethylglycine was also an inhibitor of growth on choline. Bioinformatic analysis suggests that there are genes encoding DgcA homologues in a variety of proteobacteria. We examined the broader utility of propargylcholine and propargylmethylglycine by assessing growth of other members of the proteobacteria that are known to grow on choline and possess putative DgcA homologues. Propargylcholine showed utility as a growth inhibitor in P. aeruginosa but did not inhibit growth in other proteobacteria tested. In contrast, propargylmethylglycine was able to inhibit choline-dependent growth in all tested proteobacteria, including Pseudomonas mendocina, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Burkholderia cepacia, Burkholderia ambifaria, and Sinorhizobium meliloti. We predict that chemical inhibitors of choline catabolism will be useful for studying this pathway in clinical and environmental isolates and could be a useful tool to study proteobacterial choline catabolism in situ.
TI  - Energy-dependent stability of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 biofilms.
AB  - Stability and resistance to dissolution are key features of microbial biofilms. How these macroscopic properties are determined by the physiological state of individual biofilm cells in their local physical-chemical and cellular environment is largely unknown. In order to obtain molecular and energetic insight into biofilm stability, we investigated whether maintenance of biofilm stability is an energy-dependent process and whether transcription and/or translation is required for biofilm dissolution. We found that in 12-hour-old Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 biofilms, a reduction in cellular ATP concentration, induced either by oxygen deprivation or by addition of the inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), dinitrophenol (DNP), or CN(-), resulted in massive dissolution. In 60-hour-old biofilms, the extent of uncoupler-induced cell loss was strongly attenuated, indicating that the integrity of older biofilms is maintained by means other than those operating in younger biofilms. In experiments with 12-hour-old biofilms, the transcriptional and translational inhibitors rifampin, tetracycline, and erythromycin were found to be ineffective in preventing energy starvation-induced detachment, suggesting that neither transcription nor translation is required for this process. Biofilms of Vibrio cholerae were also induced to dissolve upon CCCP addition to an extent similar to that in S. oneidensis. However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. putida biofilms remained insensitive to CCCP addition. Collectively, our data show that metabolic energy is directly or indirectly required for maintaining cell attachment, and this may represent a common but not ubiquitous mechanism for stability of microbial biofilms.
TI  - Multiplex PCR assay for detection of four major bacterial pathogens causing rainbow trout disease.
AB  - A multiplex PCR (mPCR) method was designed for the simultaneous detection of 4 major fish pathogens, Flavobacterium psychrophilum, Lactococcus garvieae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and P. putida. Each of the 4 pairs of oligonucleotide primers exclusively amplified the 16S rDNA gene of their targeted microorganism. The average detection limits for each organism amplified by mPCR were 2 colony-forming units (CFU) of F. psychrophilum, 3 CFU of L. garvieae, 3 CFU of P. aeruginosa, and 5 CFU of P. putida in mixed cultures. Multiplex PCR did not produce any nonspecific amplification products when tested against 28 related species of bacteria. High amounts of DNA from 1 bacterial species had a significant effect on the amplification sensitivity of the other bacterial species when these were present in lower concentrations in the multiplex reaction. The mPCR assay proved useful for the detection of the bacteria in naturally infected fish. The assay is a sensitive, specific, and reproducible diagnostic tool for the simultaneous detection of 4 pathogenic bacteria that cause disease in fish and offers a potentially useful alternative to the conventional culture-based method.
TI  - Oligomerization and DNA-binding capacity of Pmr, a histone-like protein H1 (H-NS) family protein encoded on IncP-7 carbazole-degradative plasmid pCAR1.
AB  - Pmr, a histone-like protein H1 (H-NS) family protein encoded on plasmid pCAR1, is a key factor in optimizing gene transcription on both pCAR1 and the host chromosome. To clarify the mode of function of Pmr, we performed gel filtration chromatography analysis and protein-protein cross-linking, and found that Pmr forms homo-oligomers, consisting of its homodimers. We also found, by atomic force microscopy, that Pmr has DNA-bridging capacity. From these results, Pmr was deduced to have features common to H-NS family proteins. Additionally, evaluating protein-DNA affinity is important to clarify the mode of function of Pmr, and hence we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Though Pmr formed high-order protein-DNA complexes and did not show preference for nucleic acid sequences, the C-terminal region of Pmr did, suggesting that the DNA-binding affinity of Pmr can be evaluated by using its C-terminal region.
TI  - Revisited distribution of nonfermenting Gram-negative bacilli clinical isolates.
AB  - Nonfermenting Gram-negative bacilli (NF-GNB) are ubiquitous environmental opportunistic bacteria frequently misidentified by conventional phenotypic methods. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of NF-GNB species by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing (used as reference method) and to compare performances of biochemical tests and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). From nine French hospitals, 188 NF-GNB isolates (except P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii) were prospectively collected from 187 clinical samples between December 2008 and May 2009. By using the genotypic approach, 173 (92%) and 188 (100%) isolates were identified to the species and genus level, respectively. They covered 35 species and 20 genera, with a predominance of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, and Pseudomonas putida group bacteria. Of the 173 species-level identified strains, concordant identification to the species-level was obtained for 75.1%, 83% and 88.9% of isolates with API 20 NE strip, the VITEK-2 (ID-GN card) system and MALDI-TOF-MS, respectively. By excluding S. maltophilia isolates accurately identified by the three methods, genus-level identification was much higher for MALDI-TOF-MS (92.9%), compared with API 20 NE and VITEK-2 (76.2% and 80.8%, respectively). In conclusion, MALDI-TOF-MS represents a rapid, inexpensive, and accurate tool for routine identification of NF-GNB in human clinical samples.
TI  - Differential habitat use and niche partitioning by Pseudomonas species in human homes.
AB  - Many species of Pseudomonas have the ability to use a variety of resources and habitats, and as a result Pseudomonas are often characterized as having broad fundamental niches. We questioned whether actual habitat use by Pseudomonas species is equally broad. To do this, we sampled extensively to describe the biogeography of Pseudomonas within the human home, which presents a wide variety of habitats for microbes that live in close proximity to humans but are not part of the human flora, and for microbes that are opportunistic pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. From 960 samples taken in 20 homes, we obtained 163 Pseudomonas isolates. The most prevalent based on identification using the SepsiTest BLAST analysis of 16S rRNA (http://www.sepsitest-blast.de) were Pseudomonas monteilii (42 isolates), Pseudomonas plecoglossicida, Pseudomonas fulva, and P. aeruginosa (approximately 25 each). Of these, all but P. fulva differed in recovery rates among evaluated habitat types (drains, soils, water, internal vertebrate sites, vertebrate skin, inanimate surfaces, and garbage/compost) and all four species also differed in recovery rates among subcategories of habitat types (e.g., types of soils or drains). We also found that at both levels of habitat resolution, each of these six most common species (the four above plus Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas oryzihabitans) were over- or under-represented in some habitats relative to their contributions to the total Pseudomonas collected across all habitats. This pattern is consistent with niche partitioning. These results suggest that, whereas Pseudomonas are often characterized as generalists with broad fundamental niches, these species in fact have more restricted realized niches. Furthermore, niche partitioning driven by competition among Pseudomonas species may be contributing to the observed variability in habitat use by Pseudomonas in this system.
TI  - Biodegradation of sulfamethoxazole by individual and mixed bacteria.
AB  - Antibiotic compounds, like sulfamethoxazole (SMX), have become a concern in the aquatic environment due to the potential development of antibacterial resistances. Due to excretion and disposal, SMX has been frequently detected in wastewaters and surface waters. SMX removal in conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) ranges from 0% to 90%, and there are opposing results regarding its biodegradability at lab scale. The objective of this research was to determine the ability of pure cultures of individual and mixed consortia of bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Rhodococcus equi, Rhodococcus erythropolis, Rhodococcus rhodocrous, and Rhodococcus zopfii) known to exist in WWTP activated sludge to remove SMX. Results showed that R. equi alone had the greatest ability to remove SMX leading to 29% removal (with glucose) and the formation of a metabolite. Degradation pathways and metabolite structures have been proposed based on the potential enzymes produced by R. equi. When R. equi was mixed with other microorganisms, a positive synergistic effect was not observed and the maximum SMX removal achieved was 5%. This indicates that pure culture results cannot be extrapolated to mixed culture conditions, and the methodology developed here to study the biodegradability of compounds under controlled mixed culture conditions offers an alternative to conventional studies using pure bacterial cultures or inocula from activated sludge sources consisting of unknown and variable microbial populations.
TI  - Reconciliation of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions for comparative systems  analysis.
AB  - In the past decade, over 50 genome-scale metabolic reconstructions have been built for a variety of single- and multi- cellular organisms. These reconstructions have enabled a host of computational methods to be leveraged for systems-analysis of metabolism, leading to greater understanding of observed phenotypes. These methods have been sparsely applied to comparisons between multiple organisms, however, due mainly to the existence of differences between reconstructions that are inherited from the respective reconstruction processes of the organisms to be compared. To circumvent this obstacle, we developed a novel process, termed metabolic network reconciliation, whereby non-biological differences are removed from genome-scale reconstructions while keeping the reconstructions as true as possible to the underlying biological data on which they are based. This process was applied to two organisms of great importance to disease and biotechnological applications, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida, respectively. The result is a pair of revised genome-scale reconstructions for these organisms that can be analyzed at a systems level with confidence that differences are indicative of true biological differences (to the degree that is currently known), rather than artifacts of the reconstruction process. The reconstructions were re-validated with various experimental data after reconciliation. With the reconciled and validated reconstructions, we performed a genome-wide comparison of metabolic flexibility between P. aeruginosa and P. putida that generated significant new insight into the underlying biology of these important organisms. Through this work, we provide a novel methodology for reconciling models, present new genome-scale reconstructions of P. aeruginosa and P. putida that can be directly compared at a network level, and perform a network-wide comparison of the two species. These reconstructions provide fresh insights into the metabolic similarities and differences between these important Pseudomonads, and pave the way towards full comparative analysis of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of multiple species.
TI  - Rapid and flexible biochemical assays for evaluating 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase activity.
AB  - PPTases (phosphopantetheinyl transferases) are of great interest owing to their essential roles in activating fatty acid, polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase enzymes for both primary and secondary metabolism, as well as an increasing number of biotechnological applications. However, existing techniques for PPTase characterization and development are cumbersome and technically challenging. To address this, we have developed the indigoidine-synthesizing non-ribosomal peptide synthetase BpsA as a reporter for PPTase activity. Simple co-transformation allows rapid assessment of the ability of a PPTase candidate to activate BpsA in vivo. Kinetic parameters with respect to either CoA or BpsA as variable substrate can then be derived in vitro by continuously measuring the rate of indigoidine synthesis as the PPTase progressively converts BpsA from its apo into holo form. Subsequently, a competition assay, in which BpsA and purified carrier proteins compete for a limited pool of CoA, enables elucidation of kinetic parameters for a PPTase with those carrier proteins. We used this system to conduct a rapid characterization of three different PPTase enzymes: Sfp of Bacillus subtilis A.T.C.C.6633, PcpS of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, and the putative PPTase PP1183 of Ps. putida KT2440. We also demonstrate the utility of this system for discovery and characterization of PPTase inhibitors.
TI  - Pseudomonas
AB  - The genus Pseudomonas contains more than 140 species, most of which are saprophytic. More than 25 species are associated with humans. Most pseudomonads known to cause disease in humans are associated with opportunistic infections. These include P aeruginosa, P fluorescens, P putida, P cepacia, P stutzeri, P maltophilia, and P putrefaciens. Only two species, P mallei and P pseudomallei, produce specific human diseases: glanders and melioidosis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P maltophilia account for approximately 80 percent of pseudomonads recovered from clinical specimens. Because of the frequency with which it is involved in human disease, P aeruginosa has received the most attention. It is a ubiquitous free-living bacterium and is found in most moist environments. Although it seldom causes disease in healthy individuals, it is a major threat to hospitalized patients, particularly those with serious underlying diseases such as cancer and burns. The high mortality associated with these infections is due to a combination of weakened host defenses, bacterial resistance to antibiotics, and the production of extracellular bacterial enzymes and toxins.
TI  - Isolation of a selected microbial consortium capable of degrading methyl parathion and p-nitrophenol from a contaminated soil site.
AB  - A bacterial consortium with the ability to degrade methyl parathion and p-nitrophenol, using these compounds as the only carbon source, was obtained by selective enrichment in a medium with methyl parathion. Samples were taken from Moravia, Medellin; an area that is highly contaminated, owing to the fact that it was used as a garbage dump from 1974 to 1982. Acinetobacter sp, Pseudomonas putida, Bacillus sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa Citrobacter freundii, Stenotrophomonas sp, Flavobacterium sp, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas sp, Acinetobacter sp, Klebsiella sp and Proteus sp were the microorganisms identified within the consortium. In culture, the consortium was able to degrade 150 mg L(-)(1) of methyl-parathion and p-nitrophenol in 120 h, but after adding glucose or peptone to the culture, the time of degradation decreased to 24 h. In soil, the consortium was also able to degrade 150 mg L(-)(1) of methyl parathion in 120 h at different depths and also managed to decrease the toxicity.
TI  - Expression and characterization of (R)-specific enoyl coenzyme A hydratases making a channeling route to polyhydroxyalkanoate biosynthesis in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - We investigated the expression of (R)-specific enoyl coenzyme A hydratase (PhaJ)  in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 accumulating polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) from sodium octanoate in order to identify biosynthesis pathways of PHAs from fatty acids in pseudomonads. From a database search through the P. putida KT2440 genome, an additional phaJ gene homologous to phaJ4(Pa) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, termed phaJ4(Pp), was identified. The gene products of phaJ1(Pp), which was identified previously, and phaJ4(Pp) were confirmed to be functional in recombinant Escherichia coli on PHA synthesis from sodium dodecanoate. Cytosolic proteins from P. putida grown on sodium octanoate were subjected to anion exchange chromatography and one of the eluted fractions with hydratase activity included PhaJ4(Pp), as revealed by western blot analysis. These results strongly suggest that PhaJ4(Pp) forms a channeling route from beta-oxidation to PHA biosynthesis in P. putida. Moreover, the substrate specificity of PhaJ1(Pp) was suggested to be different from that of PhaJ1(Pa) from P. aeruginosa although these two proteins share 67% amino acid sequence identity.
TI  - Role of microbial exopolymeric substances (EPS) on chromium sorption and transport in heterogeneous subsurface soils: I. Cr(III) complexation with EPS in aqueous solution.
AB  - Chromium (III) binding by exopolymeric substances (EPS) isolated from Pseudomonas putida P18, Pseudomonas aeruginosa P16 and Pseudomonas stutzeri P40 strains were investigated by the determination of conditional stability constants and the concentration of functional groups using the ion-exchange experiments and potentiometric titrations. Spectroscopic (EXAFS) analysis was also used to obtain information on the nature of Cr(III) binding with EPS functional groups. The data from ion-exchange experiments and potentiometric titrations were evaluated using a non-electrostatic discrete ligand approach. The modeling results show that the acid/base properties of EPSs can be best characterized by invoking four different types of acid functional groups with arbitrarily assigned pK(a) values of 4, 6, 8 and 10. The analysis of ion-exchange data using the discrete ligand approach suggests that while the Cr binding by EPS from P. aeruginosa can be successfully described based on a reaction stoichiometry of 1:2 between Cr(III) and HL(2) monoprotic ligands, the accurate description of Cr binding by EPSs extracted from P. putida and P. stutzeri requires postulation of 1:1 Cr(III)-ligand complexes with HL(2) and HL(3) monoprotic ligands, respectively. These results indicate that the carboxyl and/or phosphoric acid sites contribute to Cr(III) binding by microbial EPS, as also confirmed by EXAFS analysis performed in the current study. Overall, this study highlights the need for incorporation of Cr-EPS interactions into transport and speciation models to more accurately assess microbial Cr(VI) reduction and chromium transport in subsurface systems, including microbial reactive treatment barriers.
TI  - Mining bacterial genomes for novel arylesterase activity.
AB  - One hundred and seventy-one genes encoding potential esterases from 11 bacterial  genomes were cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli; 74 of the clones produced soluble proteins. All 74 soluble proteins were purified and screened for esterase activity; 36 proteins showed carboxyl esterase activity on short-chain esters, 17 demonstrated arylesterase activity, while 38 proteins did not exhibit any activity towards the test substrates. Esterases from Rhodopseudomonas palustris (RpEST-1, RpEST-2 and RpEST-3), Pseudomonas putida (PpEST-1, PpEST-2 and PpEST-3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaEST-1) and Streptomyces avermitilis (SavEST-1) were selected for detailed biochemical characterization. All of the enzymes showed optimal activity at neutral or alkaline pH, and the half-life of each enzyme at 50 degrees C ranged from < 5 min to over 5 h. PpEST-3, RpEST-1 and RpEST-2 demonstrated the highest specific activity with pNP-esters; these enzymes were also among the most stable at 50 degrees C and in the presence of detergents, polar and non-polar organic solvents, and imidazolium ionic liquids. Accordingly, these enzymes are particularly interesting targets for subsequent application trials. Finally, biochemical and bioinformatic analyses were compared to reveal sequence features that could be correlated to enzymes with arylesterase activity, facilitating subsequent searches for new esterases in microbial genome sequences.
TI  - Tailor-made type II Pseudomonas PHA synthases and their use for the biosynthesis  of polylactic acid and its copolymer in recombinant Escherichia coli.
AB  - Previously, we have developed metabolically engineered Escherichia coli strains capable of producing polylactic acid (PLA) and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate) [P(3HB-co-LA)] by employing evolved Clostridium propionicum propionate CoA transferase (Pct(Cp)) and Pseudomonas sp. MBEL 6-19 polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase 1 (PhaC1(Ps6-19)). Introduction of mutations four sites (E130, S325, S477, and Q481) of PhaC1( Ps6-19) have been found to affect the polymer content, lactate mole fraction, and molecular weight of P(3HB-co-LA). In this study, we have further engineered type II Pseudomonas PHA synthases 1 (PhaC1s) from Pseudomonas chlororaphis, Pseudomonas sp. 61-3, Pseudomonas putida KT2440, Pseudomonas resinovorans, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to accept short-chain-length hydroxyacyl-CoAs including lactyl-CoA and 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA as substrates by site-directed mutagenesis of four sites (E130, S325, S477, and Q481). All PhaC1s having mutations in these four sites were able to accept lactyl-CoA as a substrate and supported the synthesis of P(3HB-co-LA) in recombinant E. coli, whereas the wild-type PhaC1s could not accumulate polymers in detectable levels. The contents, lactate mole fractions, and the molecular weights of P(3HB-co-LA) synthesized by recombinant E. coli varied depending upon the source of the PHA synthase and the mutants used. PLA homopolymer could also be produced at ca. 7 wt.% by employing the several PhaC1 variants containing E130D/S325T/S477G/Q481K quadruple mutations in wild-type E. coli XL1-Blue.
TI  - Utility of multiplex PCR in detecting the causative pathogens for pediatric febrile neutropenia.
AB  - Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a life-threatening complication, and the primary cause of FN is considered to be microbial infection. Therefore, prompt and appropriate antimicrobial therapy is crucial. Clinicians usually prescribe antimicrobial therapy on the basis of presumptive and empirical data. This is because the causative pathogen for FN in blood culture (BC) analysis is detected several days after sampling. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis has been used for detecting the causative bacteria of infections. Here, we examined whether multiplex PCR is useful for detecting the causative pathogens for FN patients. We extracted DNA from the patients' whole blood and performed multiplex PCR. In total, 128 samples of 40 patients clinically diagnosed with FN were used in this study. Multiplex PCR analysis revealed the causative pathogen in 3 patients with FN; the DNA fragments amplified were those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 cases and Psedomonas putida in 1 case. These patients could be started on appropriate antimicrobial therapy a few hours after sampling. However, the DNA fragment of the causative pathogen could not be amplified by PCR in 2 patients, although BC analysis did detect the causative bacteria. Thus, we conclude that multiplex PCR is serviceable in case of FN because of its rapidness. However, BC is also indispensable to treating FN owing to its high sensitivity.
TI  - Characterization of a phosphotriesterase-like lactonase from Sulfolobus solfataricus and its immobilization for disruption of quorum sensing.
AB  - SsoPox, a bifunctional enzyme with organophosphate hydrolase and N-acyl homoserine lactonase activities from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus, was overexpressed and purified from recombinant Pseudomonas putida KT2440 with a yield of 9.4 mg of protein per liter of culture. The enzyme has a preference for N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) with acyl chain lengths of at least 8 carbon atoms, mainly due to lower K(m) values for these substrates. The highest specificity constant obtained was for N-3-oxo-decanoyl homoserine lactone (k(cat)/K(m) = 5.5 x 10(3) M(-1).s(-1)), but SsoPox can also degrade N-butyryl homoserine lactone (C(4)-HSL) and N-oxo-dodecanoyl homoserine lactone (oxo-C(12)-HSL), which are important for quorum sensing in our Pseudomonas aeruginosa model system. When P. aeruginosa PAO1 cultures were grown in the presence of SsoPox-immobilized membranes, the production of C(4)-HSL- and oxo-C(12)-HSL-regulated virulence factors, elastase, protease, and pyocyanin were significantly reduced. This is the first demonstration that immobilized quorum-quenching enzymes can be used to attenuate the production of virulence factors controlled by quorum-sensing signals.
TI  - Metallo beta-lactamase producing pseudomonas species--a major cause of concern among hospital associated urinary tract infection.
AB  - Multidrug resistant pseudomonas strains are isolated in high frequency from urinary samples in hospitalised patients. With the occurrence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and metallo beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa being increasingly reported worldwide, this study evaluated the resistance pattern of pseudomonad strains to carbapenam and other antipseudomonal antibiotics isolated from patients with hospital associated urinary tract infections along with clinical usefulness of various MBL screening methods (combined disc diffusion test, E-test and modified Hodge test). Presence of ESBL and AmpC beta-lactamases in the isolates was also determined. Of the 87 isolates, 81 (93.1%) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 (4.6%) were Pseudomonas putida, 2 (2.3%) were Burkholderia cepacia. Thirty-one isolates (35.6%) were resistant to imipenem and 61% of these 31 isolates, were MBL producers by combined disc diffusion test, while 48% were detected by E-test method. Overall, in 30% and 54% strains, production of AmpC and ESBL respectively was observed.
TI  - Role of microbial exopolymeric substances (EPS) on chromium sorption and transport in heterogeneous subsurface soils: II. Binding of Cr(III) in EPS/soil system.
AB  - Laboratory batch sorption and column experiments were performed to investigate the effects of microbial EPSs isolated from Pseudomonas putida P18, Pseudomonas aeruginosa P16 and Pseudomonas stutzeri P40 on Cr(III) mobility in heterogeneous subsurface soils. Our batch and column results indicate that microbial EPS may have a pronounced effect on Cr(III) sorption and transport behavior depending on system conditions (e.g., pH, type of EPS). While EPS had no effect on Cr(III) sorption at pH<5, it led to a significant decrease in Cr(III) sorption under slightly acidic to alkaline pH range. Column experiments performed at pH 7.9 suggest that, in the presence of EPS, chromium(III) was significantly mobilized relative to non-EPS containing system due to the formation less sorbing and highly soluble Cr-EPS complexes and competition of EPS against Cr for surface sites. A two-site non-electrostatic surface chemical model incorporating a discrete ligand approach for the description of Cr-EPS interactions accurately predicted Cr(III) sorption and transport behavior in the presence of EPS under variable chemical conditions. Our simulations show that an accurate description of Cr(III) transport in the presence of EPS requires incorporation of proton and Cr(III) binding by EPS, EPS binding by soil minerals, Cr(III) binding by soil minerals, and ternary Cr(III)-EPS surface complexes into the transport equations. Although this approach may not accurately describe the actual mechanisms at the molecular level, it can improve our ability to accurately describe the effects of EPS on Cr(III) mobility in subsurface environment relative to the use of distribution coefficients (K(d)).
TI  - Long-term influence of the presence of a non-aqueous phase on the cell surface hydrophobicity of Pseudomonas in two-phase partitioning bioreactors.
AB  - The long-term influence of silicone oil 200 cSt (SO200) and 2, 2, 4, 4, 6, 8, 8-heptamethylnonane (HMN) on the cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) of a hexane-degrading Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain and a toluene-degrading Pseudomonas putida strain was assessed in two-phase partitioning bioreactors under batch and continuous operation. CSH was evaluated using a modified BATH method based on optical density (CSH(OD)) and colony-forming unit (CSH(CFU)) measurements. In the presence of HMN, P. aeruginosa turned hydrophobic over the time course as shown by the gradual increase in CSH(OD) (61 +/- 1%) and CSH(CFU) (53 +/- 3%) under batch degradation and in CSH(OD) (49 +/- 0%) under continuous operation. However, P. putida turned hydrophobic only under continuous operation ([Formula: see text]). On the other hand, no significant CSH enhancement was observed in both Pseudomonas strains in the presence of SO200. These results suggested that CSH is species, non-aqueous phase, and cultivation mode dependant, and an inducible property of bacteria. Maximum hexane elimination capacities increased by 2 and 3 in the presence of SO200 and HMN, respectively. Based on the absence of CSH in P. aeruginosa in the presence of SO200, the higher elimination capacities recorded were likely due to an improved hexane mass transfer (physical effect). However, in the presence of HMN, a direct hexane uptake from the non-aqueous phase (biological effect) might have also contributed to this enhancement.
TI  - Exploring novel non-Leloir beta-glucosyltransferases from proteobacteria for modifying linear (beta1->3)-linked gluco-oligosaccharide chains.
AB  - Over the years several beta-glucan transferases from yeast and fungi have been reported, but enzymes with such an activity from bacteria have not been characterized so far. In this work, we describe the cloning and expression of genes encoding beta-glucosyltransferase domains of glycosyl hydrolase family GH17 from three species of proteobacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, P. putida KT2440 and Azotobacter vinelandii ATCC BAA-1303. The encoded enzymes of these GH17 domains turned out to have a non-Leloir trans-beta-glucosylation activity, as they do not use activated nucleotide sugar as donor, but transfer a glycosyl group from a beta-glucan donor to a beta-glucan acceptor. More particularly, the activity of the three recombinant enzymes on linear (beta1 --> 3)-linked gluco-oligosaccharides (Lam-Glc(4-9)) and their corresponding alditols (Lam-Glc(4-9)-ol) was studied. Detailed structural analysis, based on thin-layer chromatography, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and 1D/2D (1)H and (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance data, revealed diverse product spectra. Depending on the enzyme used, besides (beta1 --> 3)-elongation activity, (beta1 --> 4)- or (beta1 --> 6)-elongation, or (beta1 --> 6)-branching activities were also detected.
TI  - Correlation between catalytic activity and monomer-dimer equilibrium of bacterial alanine racemases.
AB  - From the reaction mechanism and crystal structure analysis, a bacterial alanine racemase is believed to work as a homodimer with a substrate, l-alanine or d-alanine. We analysed oligomerization states of seven alanine racemases, biosynthetic and catabolic, from Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. putida and P. fluorescens, with three different methods, gel filtration chromatography, native PAGE and analytical ultracentrifugation. All alanine racemases were proved to be in a dynamic equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric form with every methods used in this study. In both biosynthetic and catabolic alanine racemases, association constants for dimerization were high for the enzymes with high V(max) values. The enzymes with low V(max) values gave the low association constants. We proposed that alanine racemases are classified into two types; the enzymes with low and high-equilibrium association constants for dimerization.
TI  - Identification of synthetic inducers and inhibitors of the quorum-sensing regulator LasR in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by high-throughput screening.
AB  - We report the screening of 16,000 synthetic compounds for induction and inhibition of quorum sensing in a Pseudomonas putida N-acylated l-homoserine lactone (AHL) sensor strain engineered with the LasR transcriptional activator. LasR controls virulence gene expression in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and is of significant interest as a therapeutic target. Nine compounds that inhibit and 14 compounds that induce LasR activity were identified in our high-throughput screen.
TI  - Probing enzyme promiscuity of SGNH hydrolases.
AB  - Several hydrolases of the SGNH superfamily, including the lipase SrLip from Streptomyces rimosus (Q93MW7), the acyl-CoA thioesterase I TesA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Q9HZY8) and the two lipolytic enzymes EstA (from P. aeruginosa, O33407) and EstP (from Pseudomonas putida, Q88QS0), were examined for promiscuity. These enzymes were tested against four chemically different classes of a total of 34 substrates known to be hydrolysed by esterases, thioesterases, lipases, phospholipases, Tweenases and proteases. Furthermore, they were also analysed with respect to their amino acid sequences and structural homology, and their phylogenetic relationship was determined. The Pseudomonas esterases EstA and EstP each have an N-terminal domain with catalytic activity together with a C-terminal autotransporter domain, and so the hybrid enzymes EstA(N)-EstP(C) and EstP(N)-EstA(C) were constructed by swapping the corresponding N- and C-terminal domains, and their hydrolytic activities were compared. Interestingly, substrate specificity and kinetic measurements indicated a significant influence of the autotransporter domains on the catalytic activities of these enzymes in solution. TesA, EstA and EstP were shown to function as esterases with different affinities and catalytic efficacies towards p-nitrophenyl butyrate. Of all the enzymes tested, only SrLip revealed lipase, phospholipase, esterase, thioesterase and Tweenase activities.
TI  - A putative ABC transporter, hatABCDE, is among molecular determinants of pyomelanin production in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Pyomelanin overproduction is a common phenotype among Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates recovered from cystic fibrosis and urinary tract infections. Its prevalence suggests that it contributes to the persistence of the producing microbial community, yet little is known about the mechanisms of its production. Using transposon mutagenesis, we identified factors that contribute to melanogenesis in a clinical isolate of P. aeruginosa. In addition to two enzymes already known to be involved in its biosynthesis (homogentisate dioxygenase and hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase), we identified 26 genes that encode regulatory, metabolic, transport, and hypothetical proteins that contribute to the production of homogentisic acid (HGA), the monomeric precursor of pyomelanin. One of these, PA14_57880, was independently identified four times and is predicted to encode the ATP-binding cassette of an ABC transporter homologous to proteins in Pseudomonas putida responsible for the extrusion of organic solvents from the cytosol. Quantification of HGA production by P. aeruginosa PA14 strains missing the predicted subcomponents of this transporter confirmed its role in HGA production: mutants unable to produce the ATP-binding cassette (PA14_57880) or the permease (PA14_57870) produced substantially less extracellular HGA after growth for 20 h than the parental strain. In these mutants, concurrent accumulation of intracellular HGA was observed. In addition, quantitative real-time PCR revealed that intracellular accumulation of HGA elicits upregulation of these transport genes. Based on their involvement in homogentisic acid transport, we rename the genes of this operon hatABCDE.
TI  - In silico genome-scale metabolic analysis of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 for polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis, degradation of aromatics and anaerobic survival.
AB  - Genome-scale metabolic models have been appearing with increasing frequency and have been employed in a wide range of biotechnological applications as well as in biological studies. With the metabolic model as a platform, engineering strategies have become more systematic and focused, unlike the random shotgun approach used in the past. Here we present the genome-scale metabolic model of the versatile Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas putida, which has gained widespread interest for various biotechnological applications. With the construction of the genome-scale metabolic model of P. putida KT2440, PpuMBEL1071, we investigated various characteristics of P. putida, such as its capacity for synthesizing polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) and degrading aromatics. Although P. putida has been characterized as a strict aerobic bacterium, the physiological characteristics required to achieve anaerobic survival were investigated. Through analysis of PpuMBEL1071, extended survival of P. putida under anaerobic stress was achieved by introducing the ackA gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli.
TI  - The acylase PvdQ has a conserved function among fluorescent Pseudomonas spp.
AB  - Pyoverdine biosynthesis in fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. and especially in the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been extensively studied. The acylase PvdQ is required for a maturation step in pyoverdine biosynthesis but also has been proven to be effective in degrading long-chain N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs). These molecules are used as quorum-sensing molecules by Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonads themselves. Interestingly, the pvdQ gene is part of a pyoverdine cluster in P. aeruginosa and P. syringae but not in other fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. In this study we have compared the activities of PvdQ orthologues from various species and provide evidence for conserved functions in Pseudomonas fluorescens PfO-1, P. putida KT2440 and P. aeruginosa PA14. Despite large differences in genomic organization, expression of each of these pvdQ orthologues is regulated by iron availability. Moreover, PvdQ and its orthologues have conserved substrate specificity for AHLs and play a role in pyoverdine production in all tested Pseudomonas species. These data strongly suggest that the role of PvdQ in pyoverdine biosynthesis is conserved among Pseudomonas spp., while the control that PvdQ exerts in P. aeruginosa over its own quorum-sensing signals seems to be unique to this bacterium.
TI  - IMP-16 in Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas stutzeri: potential reservoirs of multidrug resistance.
AB  
TI  - Iron homeostasis affects antibiotic-mediated cell death in Pseudomonas species.
AB  - Antibiotics can induce cell death via a variety of action modes, including the inhibition of transcription, ribosomal function, and cell wall biosynthesis. In this study, we demonstrated directly that iron availability is important to the action of antibiotics, and the ferric reductases of Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa could accelerate antibiotic-mediated cell death by promoting the Fenton reaction. The modulation of reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NADH) levels and iron chelation affected the actions of antibiotics. Interestingly, the deletion of the ferric reductase gene confers more antibiotic resistance upon cells, and its overexpression accelerates antibiotic-mediated cell death. The results of transcriptome analysis showed that both Pseudomonas species induce many oxidative stress genes under antibiotic conditions, which could not be observed in ferric reductase mutants. Our results indicate that iron homeostasis is crucial for bacterial cell survival under antibiotics and should constitute a significant target for boosting the action of antibiotics.
TI  - Bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbons: role of asphaltenes and resins.
AB  - The influence of asphaltenes and resins on bacterial adhesion to model crude oils was examined using a modified microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons assay. Well-controlled bacterial adhesion experiments were conducted at three solution pHs (4, 6 and 7) using Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida and four model crude oil systems containing up to four representative hydrocarbon compounds found in crude oils. The model crude oils were designed to independently evaluate the influence of asphaltenes and resins on hydrocarbon surface charge (i.e., electrophoretic mobility) and on bacterial adhesion to the liquid hydrocarbon phase. Asphaltenes and resins were found to make the hydrocarbon droplet surface charge less negative (or more positive) and to generally decrease microbial adhesion to the hydrocarbon. The experimental results were not in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions of bacteria-hydrocarbon interactions based on the classical or extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek interaction energy profiles calculated from measured physicochemical properties of the microorganisms and hydrocarbons. Model calculations considering the role of steric repulsion in bacteria-hydrocarbon interactions suggest that the decreased adhesion behavior in the presence of asphaltenes and resins may be linked to a mechanism of steric hindrance.
TI  - Preliminary characterization of biosurfactants produced by microorganisms isolated from refinery wastewaters.
AB  - Some bacterial strains isolated from refinery wastewaters were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa RWI, Pseudomonas putida RWII, Pseudomonas fluorescens RWIII and Burkholderia cepacia RWIV, and the biosurfactants produced by these strains were coded as BS-I, BS-II, BS-III and BS-IV, respectively. The bacterial strains were characterized by the following biochemical methods: Gram stain, oxidase activity, indol, lactose and growth at 42 degrees C. Biosurfactant production was evaluated by: emulsification activity, surface tension measurement and critical micelle concentration. Chemical characterization of the biosurfactants was done by: FTIR and analysis of carbohydrate, protein and lipid content. The biosurfactants showed good emulsification activity against different hydrocarbon sources. The initial surface tension of culture broth was determined as 67.3 mN/m, and production of BS-I, BS-II, BS-III and BS-IV lowered this value to 35.9, 49.2, 51.6 and 45.7 mN/m, respectively. The critical micelle concentration of the biosurfactants was found to be in the range 10-50 mg/L. From the results of this study it was observed that the refinery wastewaters are a suitable source for isolation of biosurfactant-producing bacteria, but are not a substrate for biosurfactant production.
TI  - Iron uptake and metabolism in pseudomonads.
AB  - Pseudomonads are ubiquitous Gram-negative gamma proteobacteria known for their extreme versatility and adaptability. Some are plant pathogens (Pseudomonas syringae) which have to survive on the surface of leaves while others can colonize the rhizosphere or survive in soil (Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida), and one species, Pseudomonas entomophila, is an insect pathogen. The most investigated species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is known to be an opportunistic pathogen able to infect plants, nematodes, insects, and mammals, including humans. Like for other bacteria, iron is a key nutrient for pseudomonads. The fluorescent pseudomonads produce siderophores, the best known being the fluorescent high-affinity peptidic pyoverdines. Often diverse secondary siderophores of lower affinity are produced as well (pyochelin, pseudomonin, corrugatins and ornicorrugatins, yersiniabactin, and thioquinolobactin). Reflecting their large capacity of adaptation to changing environment and niche colonization, pseudomonads are able to obtain their iron from heme or from siderophores produced by other microorganisms (xenosiderophores) via the expression of outer membrane TonB-dependent receptors. As expected, iron uptake is exquisitely and hierarchically regulated in these bacteria. In this short review, the diversity of siderophores produced, receptors, and finally the way iron homeostasis is regulated in P. aeruginosa, P. syringae, P. putida, and P. fluorescens, will be presented and, when possible, put in relation with the lifestyle and the ecological niche.
TI  - Characterization of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa transcriptional response to phenylalanine and tyrosine.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen often associated with chronic infections in the lungs of individuals with the heritable disease cystic fibrosis (CF). Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that aromatic amino acids within CF lung secretions (sputum) not only serve as carbon and energy sources but also enhance synthesis of the cell signaling molecule Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS). The present study investigates the role of the aromatic amino acid-responsive regulator PhhR in mediating these phenotypes. Transcriptome analysis revealed that PhhR controls four putative transcriptional units (phhA, hpd, hmgA, and dhcA) involved in aromatic amino acid catabolism; however, genes involved in PQS biosynthesis were unaffected. The phhA, hpd, hmgA, and dhcA promoters were mapped by primer extension, and purified His(6)-PhhR was shown to bind the phhA, hpd, and dhcA promoters in vitro by use of electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Our work characterizes a transcriptional regulator of catabolic genes induced during P. aeruginosa growth in CF sputum.
TI  - DNA sequence-based analysis of the Pseudomonas species.
AB  - Partial sequences of four core 'housekeeping' genes (16S rRNA, gyrB, rpoB and rpoD) of the type strains of 107 Pseudomonas species were analysed in order to obtain a comprehensive view regarding the phylogenetic relationships within the Pseudomonas genus. Gene trees allowed the discrimination of two lineages or intrageneric groups (IG), called IG P. aeruginosa and IG P. fluorescens. The first IG P. aeruginosa, was divided into three main groups, represented by the species P. aeruginosa, P. stutzeri and P. oleovorans. The second IG was divided into six groups, represented by the species P. fluorescens, P. syringae, P. lutea, P. putida, P. anguilliseptica and P. straminea. The P. fluorescens group was the most complex and included nine subgroups, represented by the species P. fluorescens, P. gessardi, P. fragi, P. mandelii, P. jesseni, P. koreensis, P. corrugata, P. chlororaphis and P. asplenii. Pseudomonas rhizospherae was affiliated with the P. fluorescens IG in the phylogenetic analysis but was independent of any group. Some species were located on phylogenetic branches that were distant from defined clusters, such as those represented by the P. oryzihabitans group and the type strains P. pachastrellae, P. pertucinogena and P. luteola. Additionally, 17 strains of P. aeruginosa, 'P. entomophila', P. fluorescens, P. putida, P. syringae and P. stutzeri, for which genome sequences have been determined, have been included to compare the results obtained in the analysis of four housekeeping genes with those obtained from whole genome analyses.
TI  - Functional display of Pseudomonas and Burkholderia lipases using a translocator domain of EstA autotransporter on the cell surface of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Functional expression of the industrially important Pseudomonas and Burkholderia  lipases, such as those from P. aeruginosa, B. cepacia and P. fluorescens, was achieved on the cell surface of Escherichia coli using the C-terminal translocator moiety (EstATu) of autotransporter protein (EstA) from P. putida. In particular, lipases which required a lipase-specific foldase (Lif) for their proper folding were for the first time displayed in the active form by coexpression of the Lif protein.
TI  - A modified microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons assay to account for the presence of hydrocarbon droplets.
AB  - The microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons (MATH) assay has been used widely to characterize microbial cell hydrophobicity and/or the extent of cell adhesion to hydrophobic liquids. The classical MATH assay involves spectrophotometric absorbance measurements of the initial and final cell concentrations in an aqueous cell suspension that has been contacted with a hydrocarbon liquid. In this study, microscopic examination of the aqueous cell suspension after contact with hexadecane or a hexadecane/toluene mixture revealed the presence of hydrocarbon droplets. The hydrocarbon droplets contributed to the absorbance values during spectrophotometric measurements and caused erroneous estimates of cell concentrations and extents of microbial adhesion. A modified MATH assay that avoids such artefacts is proposed here. In this modified assay, microscopic examination of the aqueous suspension and direct cell counts provides cell concentrations that are free of interference from hydrocarbon droplets. The presence of hydrocarbon droplets was noted in MATH assays performed with three bacterial strains, and two different hydrocarbons, at ionic strengths of 0.2 mM and 20 mM and pH 6. In these experiments, the formation of quasi-stable hydrocarbon droplets cannot be attributed to the presence of biosurfactants, or stabilization by biocolloids. The presence of surface potential at the hydrocarbon-water interface that was characterized by electrophoretic mobility of up to -1 and -2 microm cm/Vs, likely caused the formation of the quasi-stable hydrocarbon droplets that provided erroneous results using the classical MATH assay.
TI  - Monitoring the effects of chiral pharmaceuticals on aquatic microorganisms by metabolic fingerprinting.
AB  - The effects of the chiral pharmaceuticals atenolol and propranolol on Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Micrococcus luteus, and Blastomonas natatoria were investigated. The growth dynamics of exposed cultures were monitored using a Bioscreen instrument. In addition, Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy with appropriate chemometrics and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were employed in order to investigate the phenotypic changes and possible degradation of the drugs in exposed cultures. For the majority of the bacteria studied there was not a statistically significant difference in the organism's phenotype when it was exposed to the different enantiomers or mixtures of enantiomers. In contrast, the pseudomonads appeared to respond differently to propranolol, and the two enantiomers had different effects on the cellular phenotype. This implies that there were different metabolic responses in the organisms when they were exposed to the different enantiomers. We suggest that our findings may indicate that there are widespread effects on aquatic communities in which active pharmaceutical ingredients are present.
TI  - Metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Pseudomonas putida as a reservoir of multidrug resistance elements that can be transferred to successful Pseudomonas aeruginosa clones.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the prevalence, nature, involved genetic elements and epidemiology of metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida isolated in a Spanish hospital between 2005 and 2008. METHODS: Etests were used for susceptibility testing and screening for MBLs, confirmed through bla(VIM) PCRs and sequencing. Clonal relatedness was evaluated by PFGE and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). MBL-carrying plasmids were characterized by restriction fragment length polymorphism, Southern blot and electroporation. MBL genetic elements were studied by cloning and sequencing. RESULTS: MBL-producing P. putida was detected in eight patients (one clone each; two harbouring bla(VIM-1) and six harbouring bla(VIM-2)), representing 14% of all the infections by the P. putida/fluorescens group. MBLs were detected in only 0.3% of P. aeruginosa infections (11 patients) during the same period. PFGE revealed four P. aeruginosa clones: one producing bla(VIM-13) (two patients); and three producing bla(VIM-2) (two patients, six patients and one patient, respectively). MLST indicated that the VIM-13 clone was the internationally spread sequence type (ST)235, while the major VIM-2 lineage corresponded to ST179, which is associated with chronic respiratory infections. The VIM-1 integron was shown to have both plasmid and chromosomal location, while the VIM-13 integron was only chromosomal. The VIM-2 integron was located in the same transposon (Tn402/Tn5053-like) in all P. aeruginosa and P. putida isolates, suggesting its crucial role in the dissemination of VIM-2. CONCLUSIONS: The high diversity and proportion of MBL-positive P. putida suggests an environmental reservoir of these resistance determinants. Dissemination of these multidrug resistance elements to successful P. aeruginosa clones presents a major epidemiological and clinical threat.
TI  - High prevalence of Pseudomonas species in soil samples from Ternate Island-Indonesia.
AB  - In the present study, Ten soil samples were examined and the pH of the soil was recorded. For bacterial isolation, a sterile nutrient and blood agars were used. Gram stain and biochemical tests were done for identification. A total of 384 genus were isolated, 314 (81.8%) were identified as Pseudomonas species of which 245 (78.0%) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 42 (13.4%) were Pseudomonas fluorescens, 13 (4.2%) were Pseudomonas mallei, 10 (3.1%) were Pseudomonas putida and 4 (1.3%) were Pseudomonas syringe and are regarded as pathogenic and harmful to man, animal and plants. This study shows that Pseudomonas aeruginosa had a high adaptation capability to grow in soil samples from Ternate, Indonesia. The rest of the bacterial isolates (18.2%) were identified as follows: 24 samples (6.2%) were Micrococcus, 23 samples (6.0%) were E. coli, 12 samples (3.1%) were Pasteurella and 11 samples (2.9%) were Staphylococcus. Pencillium was also isolated.
TI  - The enhancement of biodesulfurization activity in a novel indigenous engineered Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The combustion of sulfur-rich fossil fuels leads to release of sulfur oxide pollution in the environment. In biodesulfurization process, an organism is able to remove sulfur from fossil fuels without decreasing the caloric value of those substrates. The main aim of this research was to design a recombinant microorganism to remove the highest amount of sulfur compounds in fossil fuels. METHODS: Three genes (dszA,B,C) from dsz operon are responsible for the 4S pathway (biodesulfurization pathway) in Rhodococcus erythropolis IGTS8 were inserted into the chromosome of a novel indigenous Pseudomonas putida. The reaction catalyzed by products of dszA,B,C genes require FMNH2 supplied by dszD enzyme. Thus, pVLT31 vector harboring dszD gene was transferred into this recombinant strain. RESULTS: The results demonstrated a higher biodesulfurization activity when the flavin reductase gene was transferred into recombinant P. putida harboring dszA,B,C. These results were approved by the Gibbs test and HPLC analysis. CONCLUSION: These analyses showed that this novel indigenous engineered P. putida could be a promising candidate for an industrial and environmental application for Biodesulfurization process.
TI  - Cloning and Characterisation of (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-acyl Carrier Protein-coenzyme A Transferase Gene (phaG) from Pseudomonas sp. USM 4-55.
AB  - The (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-ACP-CoA transferase catalyses the conversion of (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-ACP to (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA derivatives, which serves as the ultimate precursor for polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) polymerisation from unrelated substrates in pseudomonads. PhaG was found to be responsible for channelling precursors for polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase from a de novo fatty acid biosynthesis pathway when cultured on carbohydrates, such as glucose or gluconate. The phaG gene was cloned from Pseudomonas sp. USM 4-55 using a homologous probe. The gene was located in a 3660 bp Sal I fragment (GenBank accession number EU305558). The open reading frame (ORF) was 885 bp long and encoded a 295 amino acid protein. The predicted molecular weight was 33251 Da, and it showed a 62% identity to the PhaG of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The function of the cloned phaG of Pseudomonas sp. USM 4-55 was confirmed by complementation studies. Plasmid pBCS39, which harboured the 3660 bp Sal I fragment, was found to complement the PhaG-mutant heterologous host cell, Pseudomonas putida PhaGN-21. P. putida PhaGN-21, which harboured pBCS39, accumulated PHA that accounted for up to 18% of its cellular dry weight (CDW). P. putida PhaGN-21, which harboured the vector alone (PBBR1MCS-2), accumulated only 0.6% CDW of PHA.
TI  - Response of the Pseudomonas host chromosomal transcriptome to carriage of the IncP-7 plasmid pCAR1.
AB  - Plasmid carriage requires appropriate expression of the genes on the plasmid or host chromosome through cooperative transcriptional regulation. To clarify the impact of plasmid carriage on the host chromosome, we compared the chromosomal RNA maps of plasmid-free and plasmid-containing host strains using the incompatibility group P-7 archetype plasmid pCAR1, which is involved in carbazole degradation, and three distinct Pseudomonas strains. The possession of pCAR1 altered gene expression related to the iron acquisition systems in each host. Expression of the major siderophore pyoverdine was greater in plasmid-containing P. putida KT2440 and P. aeruginosa PAO1 than in the plasmid-free host strains, in part due to the expression of carbazole-degradative genes on pCAR1. The mexEFoprN operon encoding an efflux pump of the resistance-nodulation-cell division family was specifically upregulated by the carriage of pCAR1 in P. putida KT2440, whereas the expression of orthologous genes in the other species remained unaltered. Induction of the mexEFoprN genes increased the resistance of pCAR1-containing KT2440 to chloramphenicol compared with pCAR1-free KT2440. Our findings indicate that the possession of pCAR1 altered the growth rate of the host via the expression of genes on pCAR1 and the host chromosomes.
TI  - Phosphoproteomic analysis reveals the multiple roles of phosphorylation in pathogenic bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Recent phosphoproteomic characterizations of Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have suggested that protein phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues is a major regulatory post-translational modification in bacteria. In this study, we carried out a global and site-specific phosphoproteomic analysis on the Gram-positive pathogenic bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae. One hundred and two unique phosphopeptides and 163 phosphorylation sites with distributions of 47%/44%/9% for Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylations from 84 S. pneumoniae proteins were identified through the combined use of TiO(2) enrichment and LC-MS/MS determination. The identified phosphoproteins were found to be involved in various biological processes including carbon/protein/nucleotide metabolisms, cell cycle and division regulation. A striking characteristic of S. pneumoniae phosphoproteome is the large number of multiple species-specific phosphorylated sites, indicating that high level of protein phosphorylation may play important roles in regulating many metabolic pathways and bacterial virulence.
TI  - Molecular characterization of Rif(r) mutations in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The rpoB gene encoding for beta subunit of RNA polymerase is a target of mutations leading to rifampicin resistant (Rif(r)) phenotype of bacteria. Here we have characterized rpoB/Rif(r) system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida as a test system for studying mutational processes. We found that in addition to the appearance of large colonies which were clearly visible on Rif selective plates already after 24h of plating, small colonies grew up on these plates for 48 h. The time-dependent appearance of the mutant colonies onto selective plates was caused by different levels of Rif resistance of the mutants. The Rif(r) clusters of the rpoB gene were sequenced and analyzed for 360 mutants of P. aeruginosa and for 167 mutants of P. putida. The spectrum of Rif(r) mutations characterized for P. aeruginosa grown at 37 degrees C and that characterized for P. putida grown at 30 degrees C were dissimilar but the differences almost disappeared when the mutants of both strain were isolated at the same temperature, at 30 degrees C. The strong Rif(r) phenotype of P. aeruginosa and P. putida was accompanied only with substitutions of these residues which belong to the putative Rif-binding pocket. Approximately 70% of P. aeruginosa mutants, which were isolated at 37 degrees C and expressed weak Rif(r) phenotype, contained base substitutions in the N-terminal cluster of the rpoB gene. The differences in the spectra of mutations at 30 degrees C and 37 degrees C can be explained by temperature-sensitive growth of several mutants in the presence of rifampicin. Thus, our results imply that both the temperature for the growth of bacteria and the time for isolation of Rif(r) mutants from selective plates are critical when the rpoB/Rif(r) test system is employed for comparative studies of mutagenic processes in Pseudomonas species which are conventionally cultivated at different temperatures.
TI  - Intraspecific variation and interspecific differences in the bacterial and fungal assemblages of blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) and great tit (Parus major) nests.
AB  - Although interest in the relationship between birds and microorganisms is increasing, few studies have compared nest microbial assemblages in wild passerines to determine variation within and between species. Culturing microorganisms from blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) and great tit (Parus major) nests from the same study site demonstrated diverse microbial communities with 32 bacterial and 13 fungal species being isolated. Dominant bacteria were Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, and Staphylococcus hyicus. Also common in the nests were the keratinolytic bacteria Pseudomonas stutzeri and Bacillus subtilis. Dominant fungi were Cladosporium herbarum and Epicoccum purpurascens. Aspergillus flavous, Microsporum gallinae, and Candida albicans (causative agents of avian aspergillosis, favus, and candidiasis, respectively) were present in 30%, 25%, and 10% of nests, respectively. Although there were no differences in nest mass or materials, bacterial (but not fungal) loads were significantly higher in blue tit nests. Microbial species also differed interspecifically. As regards potential pathogens, the prevalence of Enterobacter cloacae was higher in blue tit nests, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa-present in 30% of blue tit nests-was absent from great tit nests. The allergenic fungus Cladosporium cladosporioides was both more prevalent and abundant in great tit nests. Using discriminant function analysis (DFA), nests were classified to avian species with 100% accuracy using the complete microbial community. Partial DFA models were created using a reduced number of variables and compared using Akaike's information criterion on the basis of model fit and parsimony. The best models classified unknown nests with 72.5-95% accuracy using a small subset of microbes (n = 1-8), which always included Pseudomonas agarici. This suggests that despite substantial intraspecific variation in nest microflora, there are significant interspecific differences-both in terms of individual microbes and the overall microbial community-even when host species are closely related, ecologically similar, sympatric, and construct very similar nests.
TI  - Pseudomonas spp.-induced systemic resistance to Botrytis cinerea is associated with induction and priming of defence responses in grapevine.
AB  - Non-pathogenic rhizobacteria Pseudomonas spp. can reduce disease in plant tissues through induction of a defence state known as induced systemic resistance (ISR). This resistance is based on multiple bacterial determinants, but nothing is known about the mechanisms underlying rhizobacteria-induced resistance in grapevine. In this study, the ability of Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 7NSK2 to induce resistance in grapevine against Botrytis cinerea is demonstrated. Both strains also triggered an oxidative burst and phytoalexin (i.e. resveratrol and viniferin) accumulation in grape cells and primed leaves for accelerated phytoalexin production upon challenge with B. cinerea. Treatment of cell cultures with crude cell extracts of bacteria strongly enhanced oxidative burst, but resulted in comparable amounts of phytoalexins and resistance to B. cinerea to those induced by living bacteria. This suggests the production of bacterial compounds serving as inducers of disease resistance. Using other strains with different characteristics, it is shown that P. fluorescens WCS417 (Pch-deficient), P. putida WCS358 (Pch- and SA-deficient) and P. fluorescens Q2-87 (a DAPG producer) were all capable of inducing resistance to an extent similar to that induced by CHA0. However, in response to WCS417 (Pch-negative) the amount of H2O2 induced is less than for the CHA0. WCS417 induced low phytoalexin levels in cells and lost the capacity to prime for phytoalexins in the leaves. This suggests that, depending on the strain, SA, pyochelin, and DAPG are potentially effective in inducing or priming defence responses. The 7NSK2 mutants, KMPCH (Pch- and Pvd-negative) and KMPCH-567 (Pch-, Pvd-, and SA-negative) induced only partial resistance to B. cinerea. However, the amount of H2O2 triggered by KMPCH and KMPCH-567 was similar to that induced by 7NSK2. Both mutants also led to a low level of phytoalexins in grapevine cells, while KMPCH slightly primed grapevine leaves for enhanced phytoalexins. This highlights the importance of SA, pyochelin, and/or pyoverdin in priming phytoalexin responses and induced grapevine resistance by 7NSK2 against B. cinerea.
TI  - Bacterial attraction and quorum sensing inhibition in Caenorhabditis elegans exudates.
AB  - Caenorhabditis elegans, a bacterivorous nematode, lives in complex rotting fruit, soil, and compost environments, and chemical interactions are required for mating, monitoring population density, recognition of food, avoidance of pathogenic microbes, and other essential ecological functions. Despite being one of the best-studied model organisms in biology, relatively little is known about the signals that C. elegans uses to interact chemically with its environment or as defense. C. elegans exudates were analyzed by using several analytical methods and found to contain 36 common metabolites that include organic acids, amino acids, and sugars, all in relatively high abundance. Furthermore, the concentrations of amino acids in the exudates were dependent on developmental stage. The C. elegans exudates were tested for bacterial chemotaxis using Pseudomonas putida (KT2440), a plant growth promoting rhizobacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1), a soil bacterium pathogenic to C. elegans, and Escherichia coli (OP50), a non-motile bacterium tested as a control. The C. elegans exudates attracted the two Pseudomonas species, but had no detectable antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa. To our surprise, the exudates of young adult and adult life stages of C. elegans exudates inhibited quorum sensing in the reporter system based on the LuxR bacterial quorum sensing (QS) system, which regulates bacterial virulence and other factors in Vibrio fischeri. We were able to fractionate the QS inhibition and bacterial chemotaxis activities, thus demonstrating that these activities are chemically distinct. Our results demonstrate that C. elegans can attract its bacterial food and has the potential of partially regulating the virulence of bacterial pathogens by inhibiting specific QS systems.
TI  - A survey of TonB-dependent receptors in fluorescent pseudomonads.
AB  - For bacteria with an aerobic lifestyle, iron is in the oxidized Fe(3+) form, hence poorly soluble. The solution is the synthesis and excretion of siderophores with a high affinity for iron. These ferrisiderophores are recognized by TonB-dependent outer membrane receptors in Gram-negative bacteria. Haem is also a source of iron and is captured via TonB-dependent receptors as well. In many cases bacterial genomes encode genes for receptors for siderophores produced by other microorganisms (xenosiderophores). Pseudomonads are known for their high adaptive capacity and it is therefore not surprising to find a relatively large number of genes encoding these receptors. In this study we analysed the genomes of three fluorescent pseudomonads available in the Pseudomonas genome database (http://www.pseudomonas.com; P. aeruginosa, P. putida, P. syringae) in order to extract the genes coding for TonB-dependent receptors. As expected we observed differences between species for the number of receptors. We also report differences within species, suggesting the acquisition of some genes via horizontal gene transfer, including those coding for the ferripyoverdine receptors. We also report cases where duplications of receptor genes are observed and the presence of 'receptor islands'. Our study strongly supports the notion of 'core' and 'accessory' TonB-dependent receptors within each species, with the ferripyoverdine receptors belonging to the last category.
TI  - Zwitterionic carboxybetaine polymer surfaces and their resistance to long-term biofilm formation.
AB  - In this work, we report a systematic study of zwitterionic poly(carboxybetaine methacrylate) (pCBMA) grafted from glass surfaces via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) for their resistance to long-term bacterial biofilm formation. Results show that pCBMA-grafted surfaces are highly resistant to non-specific protein adsorption (fibrinogen and undiluted blood plasma) at 25, 30 and 37 degrees C. Long-term (over 24 h) colonization of two bacterial strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and Pseudomonas putida strain 239) on pCBMA surface was studied using a parallel flow cell at 25, 30 and 37 degrees C. Uncoated glass cover slips were chosen as the positive reference. Results show that pCBMA coatings reduced long-term biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa up to 240 h by 95% at 25 degrees C and for 64 h by 93% at 37 degrees C, and suppressed P. putida biofilm accumulation up to 192 h by 95% at 30 degrees C, with respect to the glass reference. The ability of pCBMA coatings to resist non-specific protein adsorption and significantly retard bacterial biofilm formation makes it a very promising material for biomedical and industrial applications.
TI  - Metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Pseudomonas spp. in Korea: high prevalence of isolates with VIM-2 type and emergence of isolates with IMP-1 type.
AB  - PURPOSE: Two Korean nationwide studies showed that metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs)-producing-Pseudomonas spp. are not rare. The aim of this study was to assess the trends of MBL-producing isolates among imipenem-resistant isolates of Pseudomonas spp. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Imipenem-resistant clinical isolates were collected from 23 hospitals and one commercial laboratory participating in the KONSAR program in 2005. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect MBL genes. RESULTS: Alleles of MBL genes were detected in 10.8% of 415 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 66.7% of 12 P. putida isolates from 18 of 24 hospitals/laboratory. Among the 14 IMP-1-like and 39 VIM-2-like MBLs, emergence of IMP-6 was detected for the first time. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of MBL-producing P. aeruginosa has not significantly increased, but IMP-6 emerged in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Competition triggers plasmid-mediated enhancement of substrate utilisation in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Competition between species plays a central role in the activity and structure of communities. Stable co-existence of diverse organisms in communities is thought to be fostered by individual tradeoffs and optimization of competitive strategies along resource gradients. Outside the laboratory, microbes exist as multispecies consortia, continuously interacting with one another and the environment. Survival and proliferation of a particular species is governed by its competitive fitness. Therefore, bacteria must be able to continuously sense their immediate environs for presence of competitors and prevailing conditions. Here we present results of our investigations on a novel competition sensing mechanism in the rhizosphere-inhabiting Pseudomonas putida KT2440, harbouring gfpmut3b-modified Kan(R) TOL plasmid. We monitored benzyl alcohol (BA) degradation rate, along with GFP expression profiling in mono species and dual species cultures. Interestingly, enhanced plasmid expression (monitored using GFP expression) and consequent BA degradation were observed in dual species consortia, irrespective of whether the competitor was a BA degrader (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) or a non-degrader (E. coli). Attempts at elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of induction indicated the role of physical interaction, but not of any diffusible compounds emanating from the competitors. This contention is supported by the observation that greater induction took place in presence of increasing number of competitors. Inert microspheres mimicking competitor cell size and concentration did not elicit any significant induction, further suggesting the role of physical cell-cell interaction. Furthermore, it was also established that cell wall compromised competitor had minimal induction capability. We conclude that P. putida harbouring pWW0 experience a competitive stress when grown as dual-species consortium, irrespective of the counterpart being BA degrader or not. The immediate effect of this stress is a marked increase in expression of TOL, leading to rapid utilization of the available carbon source and massive increase in its population density. The plausible mechanisms behind the phenomenon are hypothesised and practical implications are indicated and discussed.
TI  - PHA(MCL) biosynthesis systems in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida strains show differences on monomer specificities.
AB  - The production of PHA from plant oils by Pseudomonas species soil isolated from a sugarcane crop was evaluated. Out of 22 bacterial strains three were able to use efficiently plant oils to grow and to accumulate PHA. Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains produced PHA presenting differences on monomer composition compatible with variability on monomer specificity of their PHA biosynthesis system. The molar fraction of 3-hydroxydodecanoate detected in the PHA was linearly correlated to the oleic acid supplied. A non-linear relationship between the molar fractions of 3-hydroxy-6-dodecenoate (3HDdDelta(6)) detected in PHA and the linoleic acid supplied was observed, compatible with saturation in the biosynthesis system capability to channel intermediate of beta-oxidation to PHA synthesis. Although P. putida showed a higher 3HDdDelta(6) yield from linoleic acid when compared to P. aeruginosa, in both species it was less than 10% of the maximum theoretical value. These results contribute to the knowledge about the biosynthesis of PHA with a controlled composition from plant oils allowing in the future establishing the production of these polyesters as tailor-made polymers.
TI  - Siccanin rediscovered as a species-selective succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor.
AB  - To identify antibiotics targeting to respiratory enzymes, we carried out matrix screening of a structurally varied natural compound library with Pseudomonas aeruginosa membrane-bound respiratory enzymes. We identified a succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor, siccanin (IC(50), 0.9 microM), which is a potent antibiotic against some pathogenic fungi like Trichophyton mentagrophytes and inhibits their mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase. We found that siccanin was effective against enzymes from P. aeruginosa, P. putida, rat and mouse mitochondria but ineffective or less effective against Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium glutamicum, and porcine mitochondria enzyme. Action mode was mixed-type for quinone-dependent activity and noncompetitive for succinate-dependent activity, indicating the proximity of the inhibitor-binding site to the quinone-binding site. Species-selective inhibition by siccanin is unique among succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors, and thus siccanin is a potential lead compound for new chemotherapeutics.
TI  - Intracellular excision and reintegration dynamics of the ICEclc genomic island of Pseudomonas knackmussii sp. strain B13.
AB  - Genomic islands are DNA elements acquired by horizontal gene transfer that are common to a large number of bacterial genomes, which can contribute specific adaptive functions, e.g. virulence, metabolic capacities or antibiotic resistances. Some genomic islands are still self-transferable and display an intricate life-style, reminiscent of both bacteriophages and conjugative plasmids. Here we studied the dynamical process of genomic island excision and intracellular reintegration using the integrative and conjugative element ICEclc from Pseudomonas knackmussii B13 as model. By using self-transfer of ICEclc from strain B13 to Pseudomonas putida and Cupriavidus necator as recipients, we show that ICEclc can target a number of different tRNA(Gly) genes in a bacterial genome, but only those which carry the GCC anticodon. Two conditional traps were designed for ICEclc based on the attR sequence, and we could show that ICEclc will insert with different frequencies in such traps producing brightly fluorescent cells. Starting from clonal primary transconjugants we demonstrate that ICEclc is excising and reintegrating at detectable frequencies, even in the absence of recipient. Recombination site analysis provided evidence to explain the characteristics of a larger number of genomic island insertions observed in a variety of strains, including Bordetella petri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia.
TI  - A facile one-pot green synthesis and antibacterial activity of 2-amino-4H-pyrans  and 2-amino-5-oxo-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4H-chromenes.
AB  - A facile one-pot expeditious synthesis of 2-amino-4H-pyrans and 2-amino-5-oxo-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4H-chromenes has been described under solvent-free conditions using magnesium oxide as a catalyst in very good yields. The reaction catalyst, magnesium oxide was reused and recycled without any loss of activity and product yield. All the synthesized compounds were screened for in vitro antibacterial activity, and compounds 3a, 3b, 3f, 4b, 4c, 4d, 4e and 4g showed complete inhibition of bacterial growth at 128 microg/mL or less and the rest of the compounds exhibited incomplete inhibition.
TI  - Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphoproteome analysis of pathogenic and non-pathogenic Pseudomonas species.
AB  - Protein phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine is well established as a crucial regulatory posttranslational modification in eukaryotes. With the recent whole-genome sequencing projects reporting the presence of serine/threonine kinases and two-component proteins both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the importance of protein phosphorylation in archaea and bacteria is gaining acceptance. While conventional biochemical methods failed to obtain a snapshot of the bacterial phosphoproteomes, advances in MS methods have paved the way for in-depth mapping of phosphorylation sites. Here, we present phosphoproteomes of two ecologically diverse non-enteric Gram-negative bacteria captured by a nanoLC-MS-based approach combined with a novel phosphoenrichment method. While the phosphoproteome data from the two species are not very similar, the results reflect high similarity to the previously published dataset in terms of the pathways the phosphoproteins belong to. This study additionally provides evidence to prior observations that protein phosphorylation is common in bacteria. Notably, phosphoproteins identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa belong to motility, transport, and pathogenicity pathways that are critical for survival and virulence. We report, for the first time, that motility regulator A, probably acting via the novel secondary messenger cyclic diguanylate monophosphate, significantly affects protein phosphorylation in Pseudomonas putida.
TI  - Differential degradation of crude oil (Bonny Light) by four Pseudomonas strains.
AB  - Four hydrocarbon degraders isolated from enriched oil- and asphalt-contaminated soils in Lagos, Nigeria, were tested for their petroleum degradation potentials. All the isolates were identified as species of Pseudomonas. Pseudomonas putida P11 demonstrated a strong ability to degrade kerosene, gasoline, diesel, engine oil and crude oil while P. aeruginosa BB3 exhibited fair degradative ability on crude oil, gasoline, engine oil, anthracene and pyrene but weak on kerosene, diesel and dibenzothiophene. Pseudomonas putida WL2 and P. aeruginosa MVL1 grew on crude oil and all its cuts tested with the latter possessing similar polycyclic aromatic potentials as P11. All the strains grew logarithmically with 1-2 orders of magnitude and with generation time ranging significantly between 3.07 and 8.55 d at 0.05 level of confidence. Strains WL2 and MVL1 utilized the oil substrate best with more than 70% in 6 d experimental period, whereas the same feat was achieved by P11 in 12 d period. BB3 on the other hand degraded only 46% within 6 d. Interestingly, data obtained from gas chromatographic analysis of oil recovered from the culture fluids of MVL1 confirmed near-disappearance of major peaks (including aliphatics and aromatics) in the hydrocarbon mixture.
TI  - Carbazole-degradative IncP-7 plasmid pCAR1.2 is structurally unstable in Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1, which accumulates catechol, the intermediate of the carbazole degradation pathway.
AB  - We determined the effect of the host on the function and structure of the nearly  identical IncP-7 carbazole-degradative plasmids pCAR1.1 and pCAR1.2. We constructed Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1(pCAR1.2) and P. fluorescens Pf0-1Km(pCAR1.2) and compared their growth on carbazole- and succinate-containing media with that of P. putida KT2440(pCAR1.1). We also assessed the stability of the genetic structures of the plasmids in each of the three hosts. Pf0-1Km(pCAR1.2) showed dramatically delayed growth when carbazole was supplied as the sole carbon source, while the three strains grew at nearly the same rate on succinate. Among the carbazole-grown Pf0-1Km(pCAR1.2) cells, two types of deficient strains appeared and dominated the population; such dominance was not observed in the other two strains or for succinate-grown Pf0-1Km(pCAR1.2). Genetic analysis showed that the two deficient strains possessed pCAR1.2 derivatives in which the carbazole-degradative car operon was deleted or its regulatory gene, antR, was deleted by homologous recombination between insertion sequences. From genomic information and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analyses of the genes involved in carbazole mineralization by Pf0-1Km(pCAR1.2), we found that the cat genes on the chromosome of Pf0-1Km, which are necessary for the degradation of catechol (a toxic intermediate in the carbazole catabolic pathway), were not induced in the presence of carbazole. The resulting accumulation of catechol may have enabled the strain that lost its carbazole-degrading ability to have overall higher fitness than the wild-type strain. These results suggest that the functions of the chromosomal genes contributed to the selection of plasmid derivatives with altered structures.
TI  - Rhamnolipid biosurfactants decrease the toxicity of chlorinated phenols to Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effect of a mixture of rhamnolipid R1 and R2 biosurfactants produced by a Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain on the toxicity of phenol and chlorophenols to Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E. METHODS AND RESULTS: Toxicity was quantified by the effective concentration 50% (EC50), that is the concentration that causes a 50% inhibition of bacterial growth. The presence of 300 mg l(-1) rhamnolipids, that is at about twice their critical micelle concentration (CMC), increased the EC50 of phenol, 4-chlorophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol and 2,4,5-trichlorophenol by about 12, 19, 32 and 40%, respectively, and consequently reduced the bioavailability and the freely dissolved concentration of the toxic phenolic compounds. The reduction was related to the phenols' octanol-water partition coefficients (K(ow)). CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in toxicity of the phenols can be explained by a combination of toxin accumulation in biosurfactant micelles and hydrophobic interactions of the phenols with rhamnolipid-based dissolved organic carbon. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Results provide evidence that next to the effect of the micelle formation also hydrophobic interactions with rhamnolipid-based dissolved organic carbon affects the bioavailability of the phenols. Quantifying the effect of biosurfactants on the toxicity of hydrophobic compounds such as phenols thus appears to be a useful approach to assess their bioavailable equilibrium concentration.
TI  - Effects of some organic pollutants on the exopolysaccharides (EPSs) produced by some Pseudomonas spp. strains.
AB  - In this study, isolation and characterization of exopolysaccharides produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa B1, P. fluorescens B5, P. stutzeri B11 and P. putida B15 which had been seen to produce exopolymers of potential interest in biotechnological applications were examined. To initiate the observation of the organic pollutants-polymer interactions, the yield and properties of their extracellular polysaccharide were researched. The exopolysaccharide production by these strains during growth in nutrient broth medium (control) was 41-75 mg L(-1). Also, P. aeruginosa B1, P. fluorescens B5, P. stutzeri B11 and P. putida B15 had exhibited high production of EPSs in presence of various organic pollutants (2,4-D, benzene, BTX and gasoline, respectively) in mineral salt medium (MSM) as a sole carbon source. EPS production by the 4 strains ranged from 40 mg L(-1) to 8 mg L(-1). Monosaccharide composition of EPS produced by these cultures were analyzed by HPLC. Results indicated that EPSs of strains contained neutral sugars and acetylated amino sugars. The neutral sugars in the EPS were mainly composed of glucose, arabinose, glycerol, ribose. The presence of galactronic acid, N-acetyl-D-galactosamin and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine indicated the acidic nature of the polysaccharide. Glycerol was the basic structural unit of EPS produced by the strains except P. stutzeri B11 (MSM with 1% BTX). Strain B1 (in NB medium) was found to be composed of neutral sugars (100%) while strain B1 [in MSM medium with 0.2% (v/v) 2.4-D] contained neutral sugars (70.0%), acetylated amino sugars (30.0%). Also, EPS content of strain B5 (in the NB medium) was neutral sugars (99.8%), acetylated amino sugars (0.2%) while the strain B5 [in MSM medium containing the 1% (v/v) benzene] was found to contain neutral sugars (99.9%), acetylated amino sugars (0.1%). However, EPS monomer composition by strain B11 was detected as neutral sugars (99.77%), acetylated amino sugars (0.23%) in NB medium while the strain B11 [in MSM medium with 1% (v/v) BTX] contained neutral sugars (98.2%) and acetylated amino sugars (1.8%). Lastly, in NB medium by strain B15 was found to contain neutral sugars (99.9%) and acetylated amino sugars (0.1%) while in MSM medium in the presence of 1% (v/v) gasoline it was found to contain neutral sugars (83.6%), acetylated amino sugars (16.4%). Monomer composition of control EPSs changed to different structures in the presence of various organic pollutants. Diversities of organic compounds as carbon source affected the monomer composition of EPS produced by some Pseudomonas spp. cultures.
TI  - Effects of organoclays on soil eubacterial community assessed by molecular approaches.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the commercial organoclays,  CLOISITE 30B, NANOFIL 804 and DELLITE 26C on soil eubacterial community. An enrichment test was carried out on Nutrient Broth containing the organoclay and the microorganisms previously isolated from soil. Four transfers were made, each after 7 days incubation. The molecular analyses on the eubacterial community were performed before treatment and 7 days after each transfer. DNA was extracted, amplified with eubacterial primers, finally analysed by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The profiles of the samples treated with each organoclay showed the absence, the appearance and an increase in the intensity of some bands. These bands were excised from the gels, and the related microorganisms were identified by DNA sequencing, as Pseudomonas putida, Alcaligenes xylosoxidans, Pseudomonas monteilii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. NAN804 treatment did not have any influence on soil eubacterial community, CLO30B had a slight toxic effect only on P. putida, instead the DEL26C treatment had a stronger toxic effect on P. putida and a slight toxic effect on P. monteilii. Finally, all the tested organoclays stimulated the growth of both A. xylosoxidans and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Enhanced crude oil biodegradation and rhamnolipid production by Pseudomonas stutzeri strain G11 in the presence of Tween-80 and Triton X-100.
AB  - In this study, the growth of sixty-one bacterial strains in crude oil were determined spectrophotometrically at 620 nm. Pseudomonas aeruginosa G1, Pseudomonas fluorescens G6, Pseudomonas stutzeri G11 and Pseudomonas putida G15 were chosen for the study based on the efficiency of crude oil utilisation. At 1% (v/v) crude oil concentration, P. stutzeri G11 strain degraded a maximum of 69%. The percentage of degradation by the P. stutzeri G11 strain decreased from 69% to 59% as the concentration of crude oil was increased from 1% (v/v) to 2.5% (v/v). Strain G11 was selected to determine the effects of surfactants (Tween-80 and TritonX-100) on the biodegradation of crude oil. While strain G11 showed 76% degradation at mineral salts medium (MSM) containing 1% (v/v) crude oil + 1% (v/v) TritonX-100, it showed 61% degradation at MSM containing 2.5% (v/v) crude oil + 2.5% (v/v) TritonX-100. Also, degradation rate of this strain was 96% in the presence of 1% (v/v) crude oil + 1% (v/v) Tween-80, while degradation rate was 48% in the presence of 25% (v/v) crude oil+ 2.5% (v/v) Tween-80. Additionally, we investigated the rhamnolipid production of P. stutzeri G11 strain both in crude oil and in crude oil + two different surfactants (TritonX-100 and Tween-80, separately). These results suggest that surfactants have improved both crude oil degradation and rhamnolipid production and the degradation rates have depended very much on the chemical structure of surfactants.
TI  - Expression of arginine deiminase from Pseudomonas plecoglossicida CGMCC2039 in Escherichia coli and its anti-tumor activity.
AB  - Arginine deiminase (ADI), an arginine-degrading enzyme, has been studied as a potential anti-cancer agent in clinical trials for the treatment of arginine-auxotrophic tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and melanomas. The arcA gene encoding ADI was cloned from a recently isolated strain Pseudomonas plecoglossicida CGMCC2039. The nucleotide sequence of ADI comprises an ORF of 1,254 bp encoding 417 amino acids. The deduced ADI protein sequence has a calculated molecular weight of 46.5 kDa and shows 97% and 85% identity to ADIs from P. putida and P. aeruginosa, respectively. The arcA from P. plecoglossicida CGMCC2039 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 with a N-terminal His6-tag, and purified to homogeneity. A molecular mass of approximate 49 kDa was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis and specific activity was determined to be 4.76 U/mg (pH 6.0 and 37 degrees C). In vivo activity study showed that the rADI could effectively inhibit H22 tumor growth at a total dose of 5 U/mouse over a 2-week dosing period.
TI  - Comparative effectiveness of Pseudomonas and Serratia sp. containing ACC-deaminase for improving growth and yield of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under salt-stressed conditions.
AB  - Ethylene synthesis is accelerated in response to various environmental stresses like salinity. Ten rhizobacterial strains isolated from wheat rhizosphere taken from different salt affected areas were screened for growth promotion of wheat under axenic conditions at 1, 5, 10 and 15 dS m(-1). Three strains, i.e., Pseudomonas putida (N21), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (N39) and Serratia proteamaculans (M35) showing promising performance under axenic conditions were selected for a pot trial at 1.63 (original), 5, 10 and 15 dS m(-1). Results showed that inoculation was effective even in the presence of higher salinity levels. P. putida was the most efficient strain compared to the other strains and significantly increased the plant height, root length, grain yield, 100-grain weight and straw yield up to 52, 60, 76, 19 and 67%, respectively, over uninoculated control at 15 dS m(-1). Similarly, chlorophyll content and K(+)/Na(+) of leaves also increased by P. putida over control. It is highly likely that under salinity stress, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid-deaminase activity of these microbial strains might have caused reduction in the synthesis of stress (salt)-induced inhibitory levels of ethylene. The results suggested that these strains could be employed for salinity tolerance in wheat; however, P. putida may have better prospects in stress alleviation/reduction.
TI  - Chemotaxis to pyrimidines and identification of a cytosine chemoreceptor in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - We developed a high-throughput quantitative capillary assay and demonstrated that Pseudomonas putida strains F1 and PRS2000 were attracted to cytosine, but not thymine or uracil. In contrast, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 was not chemotactic to any pyrimidines. Chemotaxis assays with a mutant strain of F1 in which the putative methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein-encoding gene Pput_0623 was deleted revealed that this gene (designated mcpC) encodes a chemoreceptor for positive chemotaxis to cytosine. P. putida F1 also responded weakly to cytidine, uridine, and thymidine, but these responses were not mediated by mcpC. Complementation of the F1 DeltamcpC mutant XLF004 with the wild-type gene restored chemotaxis to cytosine. In addition, introduction of this gene into P. aeruginosa PAO1 conferred the ability to respond to cytosine. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a chemoreceptor for cytosine.
TI  - A Comparative Study of Metabolic Network Topology between a Pathogenic and a Non-Pathogenic Bacterium for Potential Drug Target Identification.
AB  - Metabolic network provides a unified platform to integrate all the biological information on genes, proteins, metabolites, drugs and drug targets for a comprehensive system level study of the relationship between metabolism and disease. In recent times, drug-target identification by in silico methods has emerged causing a phenomenal achievement in the field of drug discovery. This paper focuses on describing how microbial drug target identification can be carried out using bioinformatic tools. Specifically, it highlights the use of metabolic 'choke point' and 'load point' analyses to understand the local and global properties of metabolic networks in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and allow us to identify potential drug targets. We also list out top 10 choke point enzymes based on the load point values and the number of shortest paths. A non-pathogenic bacterial strain Pseudomonas putida KT2440 and a related pathogenic bacteria P.aeruginosa PA01 was selected for the network anlaysis. A comparative study of the metabolic networks of these two microbes highlights the analogies and differences between their respective pathways. System analysis of metabolic networks will help us in identifying new drug targets which in turn will generate more in-depth understanding of the mechanism of diseases and thus provide better guidance for drug discovery.
TI  - Normalization of leaky gut in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is accompanied by a  clinical improvement: effects of age, duration of illness and the translocation of LPS from gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is now evidence that an increased translocation of LPS from gram negative bacteria with subsequent gut-derived inflammation, i.e. induction of systemic inflammation and oxidative & nitrosative stress (IO&NS), is a new pathway in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). METHODS: The present study examines the serum concentrations of IgA and IgM to LPS of gram-negative enterobacteria, i.e. Hafnia Alvei; Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, Morganella Morganii, Pseudomonas Putida, Citrobacter Koseri, and Klebsielle Pneumoniae in CFS patients both before and after intake of natural anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative substances (NAIOSs), such as glutamine, N-acetyl cysteine and zinc, in conjunction with a leaky gut diet during 10-14 months. We measured the above immune variables as well as the Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Rating Scale in 41 patients with CFS before and 10-14 months after intake of NAIOSs. RESULTS: Subchronic intake of those NAIOSs significantly attenuates the initially increased IgA and IgM responses to LPS of gram negative bacteria. Up to 24 patients showed a significant clinical improvement or remission 10-14 months after intake of NAIOSs. A good clinical response is significantly predicted by attenuated IgA and IgM responses to LPS, the younger age of the patients, and a shorter duration of illness (< 5 years). DISCUSSION: The results show that normalization of the IgA and IgM responses to translocated LPS may predict clinical outcome in CFS. The results support the view that a weakened tight junction barrier with subsequent gut-derived inflammation is a novel pathway in CFS and that it is a new target for drug development in CFS. Meanwhile, CFS patients with leaky gut can be treated with specific NAIOSs and a leaky gut diet.
TI  - Pathogen prevalence and influence of composted dairy manure application on antimicrobial resistance profiles of commensal soil bacteria.
AB  - Composting manure, if done properly, should kill pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella and Escherichia coli O157:H7, providing for an environmentally safe product. Over a 3-year period, samples of composted dairy manure, representing 11 composting operations (two to six samples per producer; 100 total samples), were screened for Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 and were all culture negative. Nonpathogenic bacteria were cultured from these compost samples that could theoretically facilitate the spread of antimicrobial resistance from the dairy to compost application sites. Therefore, we collected soil samples (three samples per plot; 10 plots/treatment; 90 total samples) from rangeland that received either composted dairy manure (CP), commercial fertilizer (F), or no treatment (control, CON). Two collections were made appoximately 2 and 7 months following treatment application. Soil samples were cultured for Pseudomonas and Enterobacter and confirmed isolates subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Three species of Enterobacter (cloacae, 27 isolates; aeroginosa, two isolates; sakazakii, one isolate) and two species of Pseudomonas (aeruginosa, 11 isolates; putida, seven isolates) were identified. Five Enterobacter isolates were resistant to ampicillin and one isolate was resistant to spectinomycin. All Pseudomonas isolates were resistant to ampicillin, ceftiofur, florfenicol, sulphachloropyridazine, sulphadimethoxine, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and most isolates were resistant to chlortetracycline and spectinomycin. Pseudomonas isolates were resistant to an average of 8.6, 7.9, and 8 antibiotics for CON, CP, and F treatments, respectively. No treatment differences were observed in antimicrobial resistance patterns in any of the soil isolates examined. Results reported herein support the use of composted dairy manure as an environmentally friendly soil amendment.
TI  - Assessment of genetic and functional diversity of phosphate solubilizing fluorescent pseudomonads isolated from rhizospheric soil.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Phosphorus is an essential macronutrient for the growth of plants. However, in most soils a large portion of phosphorus becomes insoluble and therefore, unavailable to plants. Knowledge on biodiversity of phosphate-solubilizing fluorescent pseudomonads is essential to understand their ecological role and their utilization in sustainable agriculture. RESULTS: Of 443 fluorescent pseudomonad strains tested, 80 strains (18%) showed positive for the solubilization of tri-calcium phosphate (Ca3(PO4)2) by the formation of visible dissolution halos on Pikovskaya's agar. These phosphate solubilizing strains showed high variability in utilizing various carbon sources. Numerical taxonomy of the phosphate solubilizing strains based on their carbon source utilization profiles resulted into three major phenons at a 0.76 similarity coefficient level. Genotypic analyses of strains by BOX (bacterial repetitive BOX element)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) resulted into three distinct genomic clusters and 26 distinct BOX profiles at a 80% similarity level. On the basis of phenotypic characterization and 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic analyses strains were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. mosselii, P. monteilii, P. plecoglossicida, P. putida, P. fulva and P. fluorescens. These phosphate solubilizing strains also showed the production of plant growth promoting enzymes, hormones and exhibited antagonism against phytopathogenic fungi that attack on various crops. Gene specific primers have identified the putative antibiotic producing strains. These putative strains were grown in fermentation media and production of antibiotics was confirmed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). CONCLUSION: Present study revealed a high degree of functional and genetic diversity among the phosphate solubilizing fluorescent pseudomonad bacteria. Due to their innate potential of producing an array of plant growth promoting enzymes, hormones and antifungal metabolites these phosphate solubilizing strains are considered to play a vital role in plant growth promotion, disease suppression and subsequent enhancement of yield.
TI  - Emergence and persistence of integron structures harbouring VIM genes in the Children's Memorial Health Institute, Warsaw, Poland, 1998-2006.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim was to perform a genetically detailed study of the emergence  of metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) genes in Pseudomonas spp. in the Children's Memorial Health Institute over a 9 year period. METHODS: Carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas spp. isolates were collected from 1998 to 2006 and screened for MBL production. MBL-positive isolates were further investigated by a combination of genetic techniques including PCR, genomic location experiments using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of I-Ceu1, S1 and SpeI digests, and sequencing. RESULTS: Of the 20 MBL-containing Pseudomonas isolates collected from 1998 to 2006, 16 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates contained an identical class 1 integron structure. Two P. aeruginosa isolates contained the bla(VIM-2) gene, and two Pseudomonas putida isolates harboured the bla(VIM-4) gene cassette in different integron structures. PFGE analysis indicated that all bla(VIM-4)-containing P. aeruginosa isolates were closely related, whereas the P. putida isolates were not. All MBL genes in this study were chromosomally encoded, and all isolates harboured only one class 1 integron. The bla(VIM-2) isolates were clonal, and the genetic structure supporting the bla(VIM-2) gene was found in an identical chromosomal position. CONCLUSIONS: MBL gene emergence in this hospital has paralleled a 6-fold increase in carbapenem usage. We have found an increase in MBL gene diversity, MBL host organisms and MBL genetic support structures in the hospital over the 9 year study period. There is also compelling evidence of the persistence of individual strains in the hospital throughout the study period. This suggests that once MBL genes have emerged in a hospital environment, they are difficult to remove.
TI  - Endophytic bacterial flora in root and stem tissues of black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) genotype: isolation, identification and evaluation against Phytophthora capsici.
AB  - AIM: To isolate and identify black pepper (Piper nigrum L) associated endophytic  bacteria antagonistic to Phytophthora capsici causing foot rot disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Endophytic bacteria (74) were isolated, characterized and evaluated against P. capsici. Six genera belong to Pseudomonas spp (20 strains), Serratia (1 strain), Bacillus spp. (22 strains), Arthrobacter spp. (15 strains), Micrococcus spp. (7 strains), Curtobacterium sp. (1 strain) and eight unidentified strains were isolated from internal tissues of root and stem. Three isolates, IISRBP 35, IISRBP 25 and IISRBP 17 were found effective for Phytophthora suppression in multilevel screening assays which recorded over 70% disease suppression in greenhouse trials. A species closest match (99% similarity) of IISRBP 35 was established as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pseudomonas EF568931), IISRBP 25 as P. putida (Pseudomonas EF568932), and IISRBP 17 as Bacillus megaterium (B. megaterium EU071712) based on 16S rDNA sequencing. CONCLUSION: Black pepper associated P. aeruginosa, P. putida and B. megaterium were identified as effective antagonistic endophytes for biological control of Phytophthora foot rot in black pepper. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This work provides the first evidence for endophytic bacterial diversity in black pepper stem and roots, with biocontrol potential against P. capsici infection.
TI  - A two-component regulatory system integrates redox state and population density sensing in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - A two-component system formed by a sensor histidine kinase and a response regulator has been identified as an element participating in cell density signal transduction in Pseudomonas putida KT2440. It is a homolog of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa RoxS/RoxR system, which in turn belongs to the RegA/RegB family, described in photosynthetic bacteria as a key regulatory element. In KT2440, the two components are encoded by PP_0887 (roxS) and PP_0888 (roxR), which are transcribed in a single unit. Characterization of this two-component system has revealed its implication in redox signaling and cytochrome oxidase activity, as well as in expression of the cell density-dependent gene ddcA, involved in bacterial colonization of plant surfaces. Whole-genome transcriptional analysis has been performed to define the P. putida RoxS/RoxR regulon. It includes genes involved in sugar and amino acid metabolism and the sulfur starvation response and elements of the respiratory chain (a cbb3 cytochrome oxidase, Fe-S clusters, and cytochrome c-related proteins) or genes participating in the maintenance of the redox balance. A putative RoxR recognition element containing a conserved hexamer (TGCCAG) has also been identified in promoters of genes regulated by this two-component system.
TI  - A comparative analysis of metal transportomes from metabolically versatile Pseudomonas.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The availability of complete genome sequences of versatile Pseudomonas occupying remarkably diverse ecological niches enabled to gain insights into their adaptative assets. The objective of this study was to analyze the complete genetic repertoires of metal transporters (metal transportomes) from four representative Pseudomonas species and to identify metal transporters with "Genomic Island" associated features. METHODS: A comparative metal transporter inventory was built for the following four Pseudomonas species: P.putida (Ppu) KT2440, P.aeruginosa (Pae) PA01, P.fluorescens (Pfl) Pf-5 and P.syringae (Psy)pv.tomato DC3000 using TIGR-CMR and Transport DB. Genomic analysis of essential and toxic metal ion transporters was accomplished from the above inventory. Metal transporters with "Genomic Island" associated features were identified using Islandpath analysis. RESULTS: Dataset cataloguing has been executed for 262 metal transporters from the four spp. Additional metal ion transporters belonging to NiCoT, Ca P-type ATPase, Cu P-type ATPases, ZIP and MgtC families were identified. In Psy DC3000, 48% of metal transporters showed strong GI features while it was 45% in Ppu KT2440. In Pfl Pf-5 and Pae PA01 only 26% of their metal transporters exhibited GI features. CONCLUSION: Our comparative inventory of 262 metal transporters from four versatile Pseudomonas spp is the complete suite of metal transportomes analysed till date in a prokaryotic genus. This study identified differences in the basic composition of metal transportomes from Pseudomonas occupying diverse ecological niches and also elucidated their novel features. Based on this inventory we analysed the role of horizontal gene transfer in expansion and variability of metal transporter families.
TI  - First countrywide survey of acquired metallo-beta-lactamases in gram-negative pathogens in Italy.
AB  - Metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) can confer resistance to most beta-lactams, including carbapenems. Their emergence in gram-negative pathogens is a matter of major concern. Italy was the first European country to report the presence of acquired MBLs in gram-negative pathogens and is one of the countries where MBL producers have been detected repeatedly. Here, we present the results of the first Italian nationwide survey of acquired MBLs in gram-negative pathogens. Of 14,812 consecutive nonreplicate clinical isolates (12,245 Enterobacteriaceae isolates and 2,567 gram-negative nonfermenters) screened for reduced carbapenem susceptibility during a 4-month period (September to December 2004), 30 isolates (28 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 1 Pseudomonas putida isolate, and 1 Enterobacter cloacae isolate) carried acquired MBL determinants. MBL producers were detected in 10 of 12 cities, with a predominance of VIM-type enzymes over IMP-type enzymes (4:1). Although having an overall low prevalence (1.3%) and significant geographical differences, MBL-producing P. aeruginosa strains appeared to be widespread in Italy, with a notable diversity of clones, enzymes, and integrons carrying MBL gene cassettes.

TI  - Effect of bacterial interference on biofilm development by Legionella pneumophila.
AB  - In the ecology of Legionella pneumophila a crucial role may be played by its relationship with the natural flora; thus we investigated the interactions between Legionella and other aquatic bacteria, particularly within biofilms. Among 80 aquatic bacteria screened for the production of bacteriocin-like substances (BLSs), 66.2% of them were active against L. pneumophila. The possible effect of some of these aquatic bacteria on the development and stability of L. pneumophila biofilms was studied. Pseudomonas fluorescens, the best BLS producer, showed the greatest negative effect on biofilm formation and strongly enhanced the detachment of Legionella. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas putida, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, although producing BLSs at different levels, were less active in the biofilm experiments. Acinetobacter lwoffii did not produce any antagonistic compound and was the only one able to strongly enhance L. pneumophila biofilm. Our results highlight that BLS production may contribute to determining the fate of L. pneumophila within ecological niches. The interactions observed in this study are important features of L. pneumophila ecology, which knowledge may lead to more effective measures to control the persistence of the germ in the environment.
TI  - Characterisation of the metallo-beta-lactamase VIM-6 and its genetic support.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to characterise the metallo-beta-lactamase VIM-6 and the genetic environment of the bla(VIM-6) gene. The bla(VIM-6) gene was cloned into an Escherichia coli expression system and the purified VIM-6 enzyme was obtained. VIM-6 has an isoelectric point of 4.9 and a molecular weight of 28.368 Da. VIM-6 hydrolysed all tested penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems with the exception of aztreonam. In Pseudomonas putida, the bla(VIM-6) gene is the first in a class 1 integron also containing bla(OXA-10), aacA4, an open reading frame of unknown function, aadA and qacEDelta1.
TI  - [Detection methods and changes in metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative  rod isolates at Nagasaki University Hospital from 1991 to 2005].
AB  - Since plasmid-mediated metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing Pseudimonas aeruginosa was reported in Japan, MBL-producing Gram-negative rods (GNRs) have emerged worldwide. We developed a way to detect MBL-producing GNRs in routine examination using broth microdilution with the MBL inhibitor sodium mercaptoacetate (SMA) in frozen plates. Between 1996 and 2005, we evaluated this and other methods, including broth microdilution with another MBL inhibitor dipicolinic acid (DPA) in dry plates, conventional PCR, and a combined simple DNA preparation and enzymatic PCR product detection. The combined method is suitable for detecting IMP-type MBL-producing GNRs from numerous isolates. Broth microdilution with SMA at a concentration of 400 microg/mL had high performance and detected most PCR-positive MBL-producing GNRs in routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing. DPA in dry plates at 400 microg/mL yielded false positive results in 11.4% of isolates but worked satisfactorily at 175 microg/mL and 400 microg/mL of SMA in frozen plates. Until 1996, MBL had been detected from only 6 bacterial species, i.e., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Serratia marcescens, and Citrobacter freundii, MBL-producing GNRs were later found in other glucose nonfermenting GNRs such as Acinetobacter baumanii, Acinetobacter lwoffii, and Burkholderia cepacia complex and Enterobacteriaceae. Most MBL-producing bacteria were multidrug resistant and no antimicrobial agents exist that are active against such isolates in monotherapy, making their rapid detection very important in controlling infection control.
TI  - Genetic and functional characterization of the gene cluster directing the biosynthesis of putisolvin I and II in Pseudomonas putida strain PCL1445.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida PCL1445 secretes two cyclic lipopeptides, putisolvin I and putisolvin II, which possess a surface-tension-reducing ability, and are able to inhibit biofilm formation and to break down biofilms of Pseudomonas species including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The putisolvin synthetase gene cluster (pso) and its surrounding region were isolated, sequenced and characterized. Three genes, termed psoA, psoB and psoC, were identified and shown to be involved in putisolvin biosynthesis. The gene products encode the 12 modules responsible for the binding of the 12 amino acids of the putisolvin peptide moiety. Sequence data indicate that the adenylation domain of the 11th module prioritizes the recognition of Val instead of Leu or Ile and consequently favours putisolvin I production over putisolvin II. Detailed analysis of the thiolation domains suggests that the first nine modules recognize the d form of the amino acid residues while the two following modules recognize the l form and the last module the l or d form, indifferently. The psoR gene, which is located upstream of psoA, shows high similarity to luxR-type regulatory genes and is required for the expression of the pso cluster. In addition, two genes, macA and macB, located downstream of psoC were identified and shown to be involved in putisolvin production or export.
TI  - The coordinate regulation of multiple terminal oxidases by the Pseudomonas putida ANR global regulator.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida KT2440 contains a branched aerobic respiratory chain with multiple terminal oxidases. Their relative proportion varies according to environmental conditions. The role of the oxygen-responsive ANR global regulator on expression of these terminal oxidases was analysed. During exponential growth in a highly aerated complete medium, ANR activated expression of the Cbb3-1 terminal oxidase (equivalent to Pseudomonas aeruginosa Cbb3-2), but had little role on expression of other terminal oxidases. In early stationary phase, or under oxygen limitation, inactivation of the anr gene led to increased expression of the bo(3)-type cytochrome (Cyo) and cyanide-insensitive (CIO) terminal oxidases, and to a much lower expression of Cbb3-1. DNase I footprints identified ANR binding sites at the promoters for these oxidases. Their location suggests that ANR is a transcriptional activator of Cbb3-1 genes and a repressor of CIO genes, consistent with expression data. ANR binding sites at the promoter for Cyo genes suggests a complex regulation in combination with other factors. Therefore, ANR coordinates expression of Cyo, CIO and Cbb3-1, but does not influence cytochrome aa3 and Cbb3-2 terminal oxidases under the conditions analysed. Functional assays showed that Cyo has a leading role during aerobic exponential growth, while Cbb3-1 becomes very important in stationary phase.
TI  - Metallo-beta-lactamase detection: comparative evaluation of double-disk synergy versus combined disk tests for IMP-, GIM-, SIM-, SPM-, or VIM-producing isolates.
AB  - The emergence of metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing isolates is a challenge to routine microbiology laboratories, since there are no standardized methods for detecting such isolates. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of different phenotypic methods to detect MBL production among Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., and enterobacterial isolates, including GIM, IMP, SIM, SPM, and VIM variants. A total of 46 genetically unrelated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter sp., and enterobacterial strains producing distinct MBLs were tested. Nineteen strains were included as negative controls. The inhibition of bacterial growth and beta-lactam hydrolysis caused by MBL inhibitors (IMBL) also were evaluated. The isolates were tested for MBL production by both a double-disk synergy test (DDST) and a combined disk assay (CD) using imipenem and ceftazidime as substrates in combination with distinct IMBL. One hundred percent sensitivity and specificity were achieved by DDST using 2-mercaptopropionic acid in combination with ceftazidime and imipenem for the detection of MBL production among P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species isolates, respectively. The CD test showed the same results for detecting MBL-producing enterobacteria by combining imipenem and EDTA, with a 5.0-mm-breakpoint increase in the size of the inhibition zone. Our results indicate that both phenotypic methods to detect MBL-producing isolates should be based on the genera to be tested, regardless of the enzyme produced by such isolates, as well as on the local prevalence of MBL producers.
TI  - The gut-brain barrier in major depression: intestinal mucosal dysfunction with an increased translocation of LPS from gram negative enterobacteria (leaky gut) plays a role in the inflammatory pathophysiology of depression.
AB  - There is now evidence that major depression (MDD) is accompanied by an activation of the inflammatory response system (IRS) and that pro-inflammatory cytokines and lipopolysacharide (LPS) may induce depressive symptoms. The aim of the present study was to examine whether an increased gastrointestinal permeability with an increased translocation of LPS from gram negative bacteria may play a role in the pathophysiology of MDD. Toward this end, the present study examines the serum concentrations of IgM and IgA against LPS of the gram-negative enterobacteria, Hafnia Alvei, Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, Morganella Morganii, Pseudomonas Putida, Citrobacter Koseri, and Klebsielle Pneumoniae in MDD patients and normal controls. We found that the prevalences and median values for serum IgM and IgA against LPS of enterobacteria are significantly greater in patients with MDD than in normal volunteers. These differences are significant to the extent that a significant diagnostic performance is obtained, i.e. the area under the ROC curve is 90.1%. The symptom profiles of increased IgM and IgA levels are fatigue, autonomic and gastro-intestinal symptoms and a subjective feeling of infection. The results show that intestinal mucosal dysfunction characterized by an increased translocation of gram-negative bacteria (leaky gut) plays a role in the inflammatory pathophysiology of depression. It is suggested that the increased LPS translocation may mount an immune response and thus IRS activation in some patients with MDD and may induce specific "sickness behaviour" symptoms. It is suggested that patients with MDD should be checked for leaky gut by means of the IgM and IgA panel used in the present study and accordingly should be treated for leaky gut.

TI  - Discovery of a bacterial gene cluster for catabolism of the plant hormone indole  3-acetic acid.
AB  - The isolation and annotation of an 8994-bp DNA fragment from Pseudomonas putida 1290, which conferred upon P. putida KT2440 the ability to utilize the plant hormone indole 3-acetic acid (IAA) as a sole source of carbon and energy, is described. This iac locus (for indole 3-acetic acid catabolism) was identified through analysis of a plasposon mutant of P. putida 1290 that was no longer able to grow on IAA or indole 3-acetaldehyde and was unable to protect radish roots from stunting by exogenously added IAA. The iac locus consisted of 10 genes with coding similarity to enzymes acting on indole or amidated aromatics and to proteins with regulatory or unknown function. Highly similar iac gene clusters were identified in the genomes of 22 bacterial species. Five of these, i.e. P. putida GB-1, Marinomonas sp. MWYL1, Burkholderia sp. 383, Sphingomonas wittichii RW1 and Rhodococcus sp. RHA1, were tested to confirm that bacteria with IAA-degrading ability have representatives in the Alpha-, Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria and in the Actinobacteria. In P. putida 1290, cat and pca genes were found to be essential to IAA-degradation, suggesting that IAA is channeled via catechol into the beta-ketoadipate pathway. Also contributing to the IAA degrading phenotype were genes involved in tricarboxylate cycling, gluconeogenesis, and carbon/nitrogen sensing.
TI  - Pseudomonas syringae BetT is a low-affinity choline transporter that is responsible for superior osmoprotection by choline over glycine betaine.
AB  - The plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae derives better osmoprotection from choline than from glycine betaine, unlike most bacteria that have been characterized. In this report, we identified a betaine/carnitine/choline family transporter (BCCT) in P. syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000 that mediates the transport of choline and acetylcholine. This transporter has a particularly low affinity (K(m) of 876 microM) and high capacity (V(max) of 80 nmol/min/mg of protein) for choline transport relative to other known BCCTs. Although BetT activity increased in response to hyperosmolarity, BetT mediated significant uptake under low-osmolarity conditions, suggesting a role in transport for both osmoprotection and catabolism. Growth studies with mutants deficient in BetT and other choline transporters demonstrated that BetT was responsible for the superior osmoprotection conferred to P. syringae by choline over glycine betaine when these compounds were provided at high concentrations (>100 microM). These results suggest that P. syringae has evolved to survive in relatively choline-rich habitats, a prediction that is supported by the common association of P. syringae with plants and the widespread production of choline, but genus- and species-specific production of glycine betaine, by plants. Among the three putative BCCT family transporters in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and six in Pseudomonas putida, different transporters were predicted to function based on similarity to Escherichia coli BetT than to P. syringae BetT. Functional P. putida and P. aeruginosa transporters were identified, and their possession of a long C-terminal tail suggested an osmoregulatory function for this tail; this function was confirmed for P. syringae BetT using deletion derivatives.
TI  - Global features of the Alcanivorax borkumensis SK2 genome.
AB  - The global feature of the completely sequenced Alcanivorax borkumensis SK2 type strain chromosome is its symmetry and homogeneity. The origin and terminus of replication are located opposite to each other in the chromosome and are discerned with high signal to noise ratios by maximal oligonucleotide usage biases on the leading and lagging strand. Genomic DNA structure is rather uniform throughout the chromosome with respect to intrinsic curvature, position preference or base stacking energy. The orthologs and paralogs of A. borkumensis genes with the highest sequence homology were found in most cases among gamma-Proteobacteria, with Acinetobacter and P. aeruginosa as closest relatives. A. borkumensis shares a similar oligonucleotide usage and promoter structure with the Pseudomonadales. A comparatively low number of only 18 genome islands with atypical oligonucleotide usage was detected in the A. borkumensis chromosome. The gene clusters that confer the assimilation of aliphatic hydrocarbons, are localized in two genome islands which were probably acquired from an ancestor of the Yersinia lineage, whereas the alk genes of Pseudomonas putida still exhibit the typical Alcanivorax oligonucleotide signature indicating a complex evolution of this major hydrocarbonoclastic trait.
TI  - Soj (ParA) DNA binding is mediated by conserved arginines and is essential for plasmid segregation.
AB  - Soj is a member of the ParA family of ATPases involved in plasmid and chromosomal segregation. It binds nonspecifically and cooperatively to DNA although the function of this binding is unknown. Here, we show that mutation of conserved arginine residues that map to the surface of Bacillus subtilis Soj caused only minimal effects on nucleotide-dependent dimerization but had dramatic effects on DNA binding. Using a model plasmid partitioning system in Escherichia coli, we find that Soj DNA-binding mutants are deficient in plasmid segregation. The location of the arginines on the Soj structure explains why DNA binding depends on dimerization and was used to orient the Soj dimer on the DNA, revealing the axis of Soj polymerization. The arginine residues are conserved among other chromosomal homologues, including the ParAs from Caulobacter crescentus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Streptomyces coelicolor, and chromosome I of Vibrio cholerae indicating that DNA binding is a common feature of members of this family.
TI  - Functional characterization of antagonistic fluorescent pseudomonads associated with rhizospheric soil of rice (Oryza sativa L.).
AB  - Antagonistic fluorescent pseudomonads isolated from rhizospheric soil of rice were characterized by 16S rRNA amplicon and fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analyses. Antagonistic isolates were grown in the fermentation media, and production of antibiotics was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Production of fungal cell-wall-degrading enzymes such as protease, cellulase, pectinase, and chitinase was determined. Dendrogram based on the major and differentiating fatty acids resulted into 5 clusters, viz., cluster I (P. pseudoalcaligenes group), cluster II (P. plecoglossicida group), cluster III (P. fluorescens group), cluster IV (P. aeruginosa group), and cluster V (P. putida group). Characteristic presence of high relative proportions of cyclopropane (17:0 CYCLO w7c) was observed in antagonistic bacteria. Data revealed biodiversity among antagonistic fluorescent pseudomonads associated with the rice rhizosphere. Results presented in this study will help to identify the antagonistic isolates and to determine their mechanisms that mediate antagonism against fungal pathogens of rice.
TI  - Screening of delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase from Pseudomonas strains as biosensor for lead and some other metals contamination.
AB  - delta-Aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD; E.C. 4.2.1.24) is a metalloprotein and plays a crucial role in heme synthesis. Its sensitivity to toxic metals depends on the metallic co-factors. In this study the effects of some heavy metals on ALADs activity of five Pseudomonas isolates from Akarcay stream (Afyonkarahisar) have been studied in order to determine whether their ALADs could be used as biosensor for lead and other heavy metals contamination. The data obtained from the study were analysed statistically by using SPSS 10.0 software for Windows. According to the results, Ni(II) increased the ALAD activity of Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes and Pseudomonas aureginosa ATTC 27853. Mn(II) also increased the enzymic activity in all strains examined except P. pseudoalcaligenes. These were found not to be statistically meaningful. P. aeruginosa 2's enzymic activity was inhibited by Mg(II) and Zn(II), significantly (p < 0.05). There was a statistically meaningful relation between enzymic activity of both P. pseudoalcaligenes, P. putida and increasing Pb(II) concentration (p < 0.05). In addition, a formula was also deviced in order to determine the doses of metals in the environment of the organisms. As a result of the study, we can suggest that Pseudomonas ALADs can be used as a biosensor for lead and some other heavy metal exposure in aquatic environments.
TI  - Biodegradation of sodium benzoate by a Gram-negative consortium in a laboratory-scale fluidized bed bioreactor.
AB  - Gram-negative bacteria with the potential to metabolize n-alkanes and cyclic hydrocarbons were isolated from local soils and identified using 16S rDNA sequence analysis. Three isolates (CS1CO, GL1CO, GCI1CO) were identified as strains of Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa and a further strain (DSS2) as P. putida. Isolates were co-cultured in a laboratory-scale fluidized bed biofilm bioreactor (FBBR) utilizing sodium benzoate as the sole carbon source, under two batch and/or one continuous growth conditions. Biofilm and planktonic bacterial growth dynamics were monitored by plate counts, and optical density measurements (230 nm) determined benzoate biodegradation. Overall higher attached and planktonic bacterial counts, and benzoate depletion, were determined under batch compared to continuous conditions, and the bioreactor performed better during the second batch phase when compared to the first batch phase. It thus appeared that both the planktonic and biofilm components of the system were necessary for the most successful sodium benzoate degradation in this system.
TI  - Genetic analysis of the histidine utilization (hut) genes in Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25.
AB  - The histidine utilization (hut) locus of Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 confers the ability to utilize histidine as a sole carbon and nitrogen source. Genetic analysis using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and chromosomally integrated lacZ fusions showed the hut locus to be composed of 13 genes organized in 3 transcriptional units: hutF, hutCD, and 10 genes from hutU to hutG (which includes 2 copies of hutH, 1 of which is nonfunctional). Inactivation of hutF eliminated the ability to grow on histidine, indicating that SBW25 degrades histidine by the five-step enzymatic pathway. The 3 hut operons are negatively regulated by the HutC repressor with urocanate (the first intermediate of the histidine degradation pathway) as the physiological inducer. 5'-RACE analysis of transcriptional start sites revealed involvement of both sigma(54) (for the hutU-G operon) and sigma(70) (for hutF); the involvement of sigma(54) was experimentally demonstrated. CbrB (an enhancer binding protein for sigma(54) recruitment) was required for bacterial growth on histidine, indicating positive control of hut gene expression by CbrB. Recognition that a gene (named hutD) encoding a widely distributed conserved hypothetical protein is transcribed along with hutC led to analysis of its role. Mutational and gene fusion studies showed that HutD functions independently of HutC. Growth and fitness assays in laboratory media and on sugar beet seedlings suggest that HutD acts as a governor that sets an upper bound to the level of hut activity.
TI  - The Pseudomonas putida Lon protease is involved in N-acyl homoserine lactone quorum sensing regulation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Pseudomonas putida and Pseduomonas aeruginosa, the similar PpuR/RsaL/PpuI and LasR/RsaL/LasI acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) quorum sensing (QS) systems have been shown to be under considerable regulation by other global regulators. A major regulator is the RsaL protein which strongly directly represses the transcription of the P. putida ppuI and P. aeruginosa lasI AHL synthases. In this study we screened a transposon mutant bank of P. putida in order to identify if any other regulators were involved in negative regulation of AHL QS. RESULTS: In our screen we identified three Tn5 mutants which displayed overproduction of AHLs in P. putida strain WCS358. Two of the mutants had a Tn5 located in the rsaL gene, whereas in one mutant the transposon was located in the lon protease gene. Lon proteases play important roles in protein quality control via degradation of misfolded proteins. It was determined that in the P. putida lon mutant, AHL levels, PpuR levels and ppuI promoter activity all increased significantly; we therefore postulated that PpuR is a target for Lon. The Lon protease had no effect on AHL production in P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: The Lon protease is a negative regulator of AHL production in P. putida WCS358. The Lon protease has also been shown by others to influence AHL QS in Vibrio fischeri and Agrobacterium tumefaciens and can thus become an important regulator of AHL QS timing and regulation in bacteria.
TI  - Heterologous production of Pseudomonas aeruginosa EMS1 biosurfactant in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - A new bacterial strain isolated from activated sludge, identified as Pseudomonas  aeruginosa EMS1, produced a biosurfactant when grown on acidified soybean oil as the sole carbon source. An optimum biosurfactant production of 5 g/L was obtained with the following medium composition: 2% acidified soybean oil, 0.3% NH4NO3, 0.03% KH2PO4, 0.03% K2HPO4, 0.02% MgSO4.7H2O and 0.025% CaCl2.2H2O, with shaking at 200 rpm for an incubation period of 100 h at 30 degrees C. The production of the biosurfactant was found to be a function of cell growth, with maximum production occurring during the exponential phase. Hemolysis of erythrocytes and thin-layer chromatography studies revealed that the secreted biosurfactant was rhamnolipid. To overcome the complex environmental regulation with respect to rhamnolipid biosynthesis, and to replace the opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa with a safe industrial strain, attempts were made to achieve rhamnolipid production in a heterologous host, Pseudomonas putida, using molecular cloning of rhlAB rhamnosyltransferase genes with the rhlRI quorum sensing system, assuming that a functional rhamnosyltransferase would catalyze the formation of rhamnosyl-6-hydroxydecanoyl-6-hydroxydecanoate (mono-rhamnolipid) in P. putida. It was shown that rhamnolipid can be produced in the heterologous strain, P. putida, when provided with the rhamnosyltransferase genes.
TI  - Alginate production by Pseudomonas putida creates a hydrated microenvironment and contributes to biofilm architecture and stress tolerance under water-limiting conditions.
AB  - Biofilms exist in a variety of habitats that are routinely or periodically not saturated with water, and residents must integrate cues on water abundance (matric stress) or osmolarity (solute stress) into lifestyle strategies. Here we examine this hypothesis by assessing the extent to which alginate production by Pseudomonas putida strain mt-2 and by other fluorescent pseudomonads occurs in response to water limitations and how the presence of alginate in turn influences biofilm development and stress tolerance. Total exopolysaccharide (EPS) and alginate production increased with increasing matric, but not solute, stress severity, and alginate was a significant component, but not the major component, of EPS. Alginate influenced biofilm architecture, resulting in biofilms that were taller, covered less surface area, and had a thicker EPS layer at the air interface than those formed by an mt-2 algD mutant under water-limiting conditions, properties that could contribute to less evaporative water loss. We examined this possibility and show that alginate reduces the extent of water loss from biofilm residents by using a biosensor to quantify the water potential of individual cells and by measuring the extent of dehydration-mediated changes in fatty acid composition following a matric or solute stress shock. Alginate deficiency decreased survival of desiccation not only by P. putida but also by Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae B728a. Our findings suggest that in response to water-limiting conditions, pseudomonads produce alginate, which influences biofilm development and EPS physiochemical properties. Collectively these responses may facilitate the maintenance of a hydrated microenvironment, protecting residents from desiccation stress and increasing survival.
TI  - Deletion of the parA (soj) homologue in Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes ParB instability and affects growth rate, chromosome segregation, and motility.
AB  - The parA and parB genes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are located approximately 8 kb  anticlockwise from oriC. ParA is a cytosolic protein present at a level of around 600 molecules per cell in exponential phase, but the level drops about fivefold in stationary phase. Overproduction of full-length ParA or the N-terminal 85 amino acids severely inhibits growth of P. aeruginosa and P. putida. Both inactivation of parA and overexpression of parA in trans in P. aeruginosa also lead to accumulation of anucleate cells and changes in motility. Inactivation of parA also increases the turnover rate (degradation) of ParB. This may provide a mechanism for controlling the level of ParB in response to the growth rate and expression of the parAB operon.
TI  - Dehalogenation of 4 - Chlorobenzoic Acid by Pseudomonas isolates.
AB  - Twenty three bacterial isolates either pure or consortium were initially screened on the basis of their ability to degrade as well as dechlorinate 4 - chlorobenzoic acid (4-CBA). Based on comparative growth response, three pure isolates Pseudomonas putida GVS-4, Pseudomonas aeruginosa GVS-18 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa GWS-19 and a consortium SW-2 was finally selected for further studies. The enzyme studies performed with cell free extracts revealed that dehalogenase activity was substrate specific with maximum activity at 300 mugml(-1) substrate concentration. Catechol 1,2 dioxygenase activity was found to be present in cell free extracts suggesting that 4 - chlorobenzoic acid (4-CBA) is catabolized by ortho-ring cleavage pathway. The dehalogenase enzyme profile showed single enzyme band in case of GVS-4 (Rm 0.76), GVS-18 (Rm 0.84), GWS -19 (Rm 0.85) and two bands in SW-2 (Rm 0.71 & 0.10).
TI  - The ttgGHI solvent efflux pump operon of Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E is located on a large self-transmissible plasmid.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E is a solvent-tolerant strain able to grow in the presence of > 1% (v/v) toluene in the culture medium. A set of multidrug efflux pumps have been found to play a major role in the tolerance of this bacterium to organic solvents (Rojas et al., J Bacteriol 183: 3967-3973). In the course of studies of the mechanisms underlying solvent tolerance in DOT-T1E, we isolated a spontaneous solvent-sensitive mutant derivative which had lost the genes encoding the TtgGHI efflux pump, the most important extrusion element in quantitative terms. Genomic comparisons between the mutant and its parental strain by microarray analysis revealed that in addition to the ttgVW-ttgGHI gene cluster, another group of genes, highly similar to those found in the Tn4653A and ISPpu12 transposable elements of the TOL plasmid pWW0 from P. putida mt-2, were also absent from this strain. Further analysis demonstrated that strain DOT-T1E harboured a large plasmid (named pGRT1) that was lost from the solvent-sensitive mutant. Mapping analysis revealed that the ttgVW-ttgGHI genes and the Tn4653A-like transposon are borne by the pGRT1 plasmid. Plasmid pGRT1 is highly stable and its frequency of loss is below 10(-8) per cell per generation under a variety of growth conditions, including nutritional and physical stresses. The pGRT1 plasmid is self-transmissible, and its acquisition by the toluene-sensitive P. putida KT2440 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 increased the recipient's tolerance to toluene up to levels similar to those exhibited by P. putida DOT-T1E. We discuss the importance and potential benefits of this plasmid for the development of bacteria with enhanced solvent tolerance, and its potential impact for bioremediation and whole-cell biotransformations.
TI  - Interaction domains in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa type II secretory apparatus component XcpS (GspF).
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen, which secretes a wide variety of enzymes and toxins into the extracellular medium. Most exoproteins are exported by the type II secretion machinery, the Xcp system, which encompasses 12 different proteins. One of the core components of the Xcp system is the inner-membrane protein XcpS (GspF), homologues of which can be identified in type II secretion machineries as well as in type IV piliation systems. In this study, XcpS was shown to be stabilized by co-expression of the XcpR (GspE) and XcpY (GspL) components of the machinery, demonstrating an interaction between these three proteins. By replacing segments of P. aeruginosa XcpS with the corresponding parts of its Pseudomonas putida counterpart, XcpS domains were identified that are important for species-specific functioning and thus represent putative interaction domains. The cytoplasmic loop of XcpS was found to be involved in the stabilization by XcpR and XcpY.
TI  - Corneal virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase B and alkaline protease produced by Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - PURPOSE: To measure the specific virulence contributions of two Pseudomonas aeruginosa proteases, elastase B and alkaline protease, when expressed separately by Pseudomonas putida in a rabbit model of bacterial keratitis. METHODS: P. putida KT2440 was transformed with plasmids that enabled the extracellular production of either elastase or alkaline protease. Protease expression was confirmed by zymography and immunoblotting. P. putida expressing elastase, alkaline protease, or vector alone was injected intrastromally (10(3) colony forming units [CFU]) into rabbit corneas (n=6). Infected eyes were graded by slit-lamp examination (SLE) at 20, 24, 28, and 32 hr postinfection (PI). Rabbits were sacrificed at 33 hr PI, and the log CFU (+/-SEM) per cornea was determined. RESULTS: SLE scores for eyes infected with P. putida producing elastase were significantly higher than those infected with vector alone at all time points (p<or=0.008). SLE scores for eyes infected with P. putida producing alkaline protease were not significantly higher than the control (p>or=0.1), but small erosions formed in 33% of corneas. At both 24 and 28 hr PI, the SLE scores for corneas infected with P. putida producing elastase were significantly higher than those infected with P. putida producing alkaline protease (p<or=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Elastase production by P. putida caused significant increases in SLE scores whereas expression of alkaline protease caused limited corneal erosions. This suggests that the production of elastase during P. aeruginosa keratitis enhances ocular pathology, whereas alkaline protease production contributes to limited corneal erosion.
TI  - A marine Mesorhizobium sp. produces structurally novel long-chain N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones.
AB  - Our study focused on a Mesorhizobium sp. that is phylogenetically affiliated by 16S rRNA gene sequence to other marine and saline bacteria of this genus. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry investigations of the extract obtained from solid-phase extraction of cultures of this bacterium indicated the presence of several N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), with chain lengths of C(10) to C(16). Chromatographic separation of the active bacterial extract yielded extraordinarily large amounts of two unprecedented acylated homoserine lactones, 5-cis-3-oxo-C(12)-homoserine lactone (5-cis-3-oxo-C(12)-HSL) (compound 1) and 5-cis-C(12)-HSL (compound 2). Quorum-sensing activity of compounds 1 and 2 was shown in two different biosensor systems [Escherichia coli MT102(pSB403) and Pseudomonas putida F117(pKR-C12)]. Furthermore, it was shown that both compounds can restore protease and pyoverdin production of an AHL-deficient Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 lasI rhlI double mutant, suggesting that these signal molecules maybe used for intergenus signaling. In conclusion, these data indicate that the quorum-sensing activity of compounds 1 and 2 is modulated by the chain length and functional groups of the acyl moiety. Additionally, compound 1 showed antibacterial and cytotoxic activities.
TI  - Sequence diversity of the OprD protein of environmental Pseudomonas strains.
AB  - OprD has been widely described for Pseudomonas aeruginosa at both structural and  functional levels. Here, we describe the sequence diversity of the OprD proteins from other fluorescent Pseudomonads. We analysed the sequence of the oprD gene in each of the 49 Pseudomonas isolates, mostly putida and fluorescens species, obtained from various environmental sources, including soil, rhizosphere and hospitals. Phylogeny based on OprD sequences distinguished three well-separated clusters in the P. fluorescens species whereas P. putida isolates formed only one cluster. The OprD sequences were generally well conserved within each cluster whereas on the opposite, they were highly variable from one cluster to another and particularly with regards to the cluster of P. aeruginosa. Predicted secondary structures, based on the topological model elaborated for P. aeruginosa, suggest signatures in the large extracellular loops of OprD, which are linked to the OprD-based clusters. Correlations between these OprD-based clusters and ecological niches, growth on various carbon sources and antibiotic sensitivity were investigated.
TI  - Bloodstream infections after median sternotomy at a children's hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Postoperative bloodstream infections are a major source of morbidity  and increased health care costs. In adults, mediastinitis has been described as a risk factor for bloodstream infections. The objectives of this retrospective cohort study were to determine the incidence and to identify risk factors for postoperative bloodstream infections among children after median sternotomy in an urban tertiary care children's hospital. METHODS: For this study, 192 patients were randomly selected from among all patients undergoing median sternotomy between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2003. RESULTS: Ninety-eight (51%) of the 192 eligible patients were male. The median patient age was 5.4 months (interquartile range: 1 day-41.5 years). Bloodstream infections occurred in 12 (6.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.3%-10.7%) patients within the first 30 days after median sternotomy. Bloodstream infections developed a median of 11 days (range: 3-29 days) after median sternotomy. Gram-negative bacilli caused 6 (50%) of the 12 bloodstream infections. Specific causes of bloodstream infections included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 3), Pseudomonas fluorescens-putida (n = 2), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), Serratia marcescens (n = 1), and Candida albicans (n = 1). Multivariable analysis revealed that the development of mediastinitis (odds ratio [OR], 28.16; 95% CI, 3.37-235.22) and the requirement for postoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OR, 12.52; 95% CI, 2.99-52.41) were associated with bloodstream infections after median sternotomy. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative bloodstream infections occurred in 6.3% of children undergoing median sternotomy. Postoperative mediastinitis and the requirement for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were risk factors for bloodstream infections after median sternotomy. These findings warrant exploration in a larger, multicenter study.
TI  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida outbreak associated with contaminated water outlets in an oncohaematology paediatric unit.
AB  - This paper describes an outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida that occurred in an oncohaematology paediatric unit between January and April 2005. Eight children had nosocomial infections due to P. aeruginosa (N=5) or P. putida (N=3), which were recovered from central venous catheter blood cultures (N=4), the catheter exit site alone (N=2), or the catheter exit site and the catheter tip (N=2). Subsequent investigation showed that contaminated water outlets represented the possible source of spread. Studies of nursing and environmental cleaning practices revealed two modes of catheter contamination. A reduction in the size of the catheter dressing at the exit site gave less protective cover during showers, and a detergent-disinfectant diluted with tap water had contaminated perfusion bottles. Repetitive intergenic consensus polymerase chain reaction indicated two discrete patterns for P. aeruginosa and one for P. putida. The water network was chlorinated, and disposable seven-day filters were fitted on all taps and showers. Due to the deleterious effects of chlorination on the water network and the cost of the weekly filter change, a water loop producing microbiologically controlled water was installed. In addition, the concentration of the detergent-disinfectant was increased and refillable sprayers were replaced with ready-to-use detergent-disinfectant solution for high-risk areas. Following these measures, no Pseudomonas spp. have since been isolated in clinical or environmental samples from the ward.
TI  - OxyR regulated the expression of two major catalases, KatA and KatB, along with peroxiredoxin, AhpC in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - OxyR is known to activate/repress the expression of the oxyR regulon, which consists of several genes, which play important antioxidant role in Escherichia coli. To elucidate the role of OxyR in Pseudomonas putida KT2442, the oxyR1 mutation that caused the upregulation of ahpC in a toluene-resistant variant strain was introduced, because no null mutants in oxyR were isolated. This mutation was shown to cause the accumulation of a catalase (KatA) along with AhpC throughout the growth, and of a RpoS-dependent catalase/peroxidase (KatB) in the stationary phase. Following the identification of the transcription start site of two catalase genes, sequences similar to those involved in the proposed OxyR binding for E. coli were found upstream from each of the promoter regions of katA and katB, as well as ahpC. Purified OxyR was shown to bind to these sequences, under both reduced and oxidized states. Moreover, the oxyR1 mutation increased the transcription levels of these genes. These results are consistent with the conclusion, distinct from those observed in an opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, that OxyR controlled expression of all the principal peroxide-degrading enzymes in P. putida. The mutation did not cause any notable changes in the transcriptional levels of several antioxidant genes, including those of glutathione reductase, glutaredoxins and thioredoxins, which would involve maintenance of the cellular thiol-disulfide balance, suggesting that the transcriptional regulation of these antioxidant genes should be different from that of katA, katB and ahpC in P. putida.
TI  - [Nah-plasmids of IncP-9 group from natural strains of Pseudomonas].
AB  - Use of polymerase chain reaction helped to establish that the most frequent among naphthalene utilizing bacteria, isolated on the territory of Belarus, are Nah-plasmids of IncP-9 incompatibility group and those with indefinite systematic belonging. With the help of classical test of incompatibility, restriction and sequence analyses three new subgroups within the IncP-9 group were discovered (zeta, eta and IncP-9-like replicons). Conducting of restriction analysis for amplification products of nahG and nahAc genes allowed us to reveal, in addition to known sequences of stated determinants, two new types of nahG gene. Restriction analysis performed on amplification products of 16S RNA genes (ARDRA method) showed that native hosts of Nah-plasmids of IncP-9 group are not only fluorescent bacteria from genus Pseudomonas (P. fluorescens, P. putida, P. aeruginosa, P. species), but also non-fluorescent bacteria with indefinite specific belonging.
TI  - nalD encodes a second repressor of the mexAB-oprM multidrug efflux operon of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The Pseudomonas aeruginosa nalD gene encodes a TetR family repressor with homology to the SmeT and TtgR repressors of the smeDEF and ttgABC multidrug efflux systems of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Pseudomonas putida, respectively. A sequence upstream of mexAB-oprM and overlapping a second promoter for this efflux system was very similar to the SmeT and TtgR operator sequences, and NalD binding to this region was, in fact, demonstrated. Moreover, increased expression from this promoter was seen in a nalD mutant, consistent with NalD directly controlling mexAB-oprM expression from a second promoter.
TI  - [Comparison of new giant bacteriophages OBP and Lu11 of soil pseudomonads with bacteriophages of phiKZ-supergroup of Pseudomonas aeruginosa].
AB  - Study of two recently isolated giant bacteriophages Lu11 and OBP that are active  on Pseudomonas putida var. Manila and Pseudomonas fluorescens, respectively, demonstrated their similarity in morphology, genome size, and size of phage particles, with giant bacteriophages of Pseudomonas aeruginosa assigned to the supergroup of phiKZ-like phages of the family Myoviridae designated in this manner according to the best studied phage phiKZ that belongs to the species of this group widely distributed in nature. Comparison of major polypeptide sizes of mature particles suggests the similarity of certain proteins in the phages examined. In OBP particles visualized with an electron microscope, an "inner body" was detected, which points to the specific DNA package intrinsic to phages of phiKZ group. In the meantime, phages Lul11 and OBP do not exhibit resemblance among themselves or with any of earlier described phiKZ-like phages in respect to other traits; particularly, they have no detectable DNA homology. Note that phage Lu11 of P. putida var. Manila exhibits very slight homology with phage Lin68 of the family of P. aeruginosa phiKZ-like phages detected only in blot hybridization. This suggests the possible involvement of these phages in interspecies recombination ("gene shuffling") between phages of various bacterial species. Results of partial sequencing of phage genomes confirmed the phylogenetic relatedness of phage OBP to phages of the phiKZ-supergroup, whereas phage Lu11 most probably belongs to a novel species that is not a member of supergroup phiKZ composition. The results of the study are discussed in terms of the evolution of these phages.
TI  - Mineralization of paraoxon and its use as a sole C and P source by a rationally designed catabolic pathway in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Organophosphate compounds, which are widely used as pesticides and chemical warfare agents, are cholinesterase inhibitors. These synthetic compounds are resistant to natural degradation and threaten the environment. We constructed a strain of Pseudomonas putida that can efficiently degrade a model organophosphate, paraoxon, and use it as a carbon, energy, and phosphorus source. This strain was engineered with the pnp operon from Pseudomonas sp. strain ENV2030, which encodes enzymes that transform p-nitrophenol into beta-ketoadipate, and with a synthetic operon encoding an organophosphate hydrolase (encoded by opd) from Flavobacterium sp. strain ATCC 27551, a phosphodiesterase (encoded by pde) from Delftia acidovorans, and an alkaline phosphatase (encoded by phoA) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa HN854 under control of a constitutive promoter. The engineered strain can efficiently mineralize up to 1 mM (275 mg/liter) paraoxon within 48 h, using paraoxon as the sole carbon and phosphorus source and an inoculum optical density at 600 nm of 0.03. Because the organism can utilize paraoxon as a sole carbon, energy, and phosphorus source and because one of the intermediates in the pathway (p-nitrophenol) is toxic at high concentrations, there is no need for selection pressure to maintain the heterologous pathway.
TI  - Biofilm formation and cellulose expression among diverse environmental Pseudomonas isolates.
AB  - The ability to form biofilms is seen as an increasingly important colonization strategy among both pathogenic and environmental bacteria. A survey of 185 plant-associated, phytopathogenic, soil and river Pseudomonas isolates resulted in 76% producing biofilms at the air-liquid (A-L) interface after selection in static microcosms. Considerable variation in biofilm phenotype was observed, including waxy aggregations, viscous and floccular masses, and physically cohesive biofilms with continuously varying strengths over 1500-fold. Calcofluor epifluorescent microscopy identified cellulose as the matrix component in biofilms produced by Pseudomonas asplenii, Pseudomonas corrugata, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas marginalis, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas savastanoi and Pseudomonas syringae isolates. Cellulose expression and biofilm formation could be induced by the constitutively active WspR19 mutant of the cyclic-di-GMP-associated, GGDEF domain-containing response regulator involved in the P. fluorescens SBW25 wrinkly spreader phenotype and cellular aggregation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01. WspR19 could also induce P. putida KT2440, which otherwise did not produce a biofilm or express cellulose, as well as Escherichia coli K12 and Salmonella typhimurium LT2, both of which express cellulose yet lack WspR homologues. Statistical analysis of biofilm parameters suggest that biofilm development is a more complex process than that simply described by the production of attachment and matrix components and bacterial growth. This complexity was also seen in multivariate analysis as a species-ecological habitat effect, underscoring the fact that in vitro biofilms are abstractions of those surface and volume colonization processes used by bacteria in their natural environments.
TI  - Identification of novel benzoylformate decarboxylases by growth selection.
AB  - A growth selection system was established using Pseudomonas putida, which can grow on benzaldehyde as the sole carbon source. These bacteria presumably metabolize benzaldehyde via the beta-ketoadipate pathway and were unable to grow in benzoylformate-containing selective medium, but the growth deficiency could be restored by expression in trans of genes encoding benzoylformate decarboxylases. The selection system was used to identify three novel benzoylformate decarboxylases, two of them originating from a chromosomal library of P. putida ATCC 12633 and the third from an environmental-DNA library. The novel P. putida enzymes BfdB and BfdC exhibited 83% homology to the benzoylformate decarboxylase from P. aeruginosa and 63% to the enzyme MdlC from P. putida ATCC 12633, whereas the metagenomic BfdM exhibited 72% homology to a putative benzoylformate decarboxylase from Polaromonas naphthalenivorans. BfdC was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the enzymatic activity was determined to be 22 U/ml using benzoylformate as the substrate. Our results clearly demonstrate that P. putida KT2440 is an appropriate selection host strain suitable to identify novel benzoylformate decarboxylase-encoding genes. In principle, this system is also applicable to identify a broad range of different industrially important enzymes, such as benzaldehyde lyases, benzoylformate decarboxylases, and hydroxynitrile lyases, which all catalyze the formation of benzaldehyde.
TI  - Increased serum IgA and IgM against LPS of enterobacteria in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS): indication for the involvement of gram-negative enterobacteria in the etiology of CFS and for the presence of an increased gut-intestinal permeability.
AB  - There is now evidence that chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is accompanied by immune disorders and by increased oxidative stress. The present study has been designed in order to examine the serum concentrations of IgA and IgM to LPS of gram-negative enterobacteria, i.e. Hafnia alvei; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas putida, Citrobacter koseri, and Klebsiella pneumoniae in CFS patients, patients with partial CFS and normal controls. We found that the prevalences and median values for serum IgA against the LPS of enterobacteria are significantly greater in patients with CFS than in normal volunteers and patients with partial CFS. Serum IgA levels were significantly correlated to the severity of illness, as measured by the FibroFatigue scale and to symptoms, such as irritable bowel, muscular tension, fatigue, concentration difficulties, and failing memory. The results show that enterobacteria are involved in the etiology of CFS and that an increased gut-intestinal permeability has caused an immune response to the LPS of gram-negative enterobacteria. It is suggested that all patients with CFS should be checked by means of the IgA panel used in the present study and accordingly should be treated for increased gut permeability.
TI  - Microbiological study of cosmetic products during their use by consumers: health  risk and efficacy of preservative systems.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the microbial contamination of 91 cosmetics (23 o/w emulsions, 47 tensiolytes, 21 aqueous pastes) in three different states of use (intact, in-use, ending product) and the protection efficacy of the preservative systems most frequently used in the analysed cosmetic formulations. METHODS AND RESULTS: Total bacterial count, isolation and identification of pathogenic isolates were performed on the collected cosmetics. About 10.6% of tensiolytes (13.5% bath foam, 6.7% shampoo, 10% liquid soaps) were contaminated by Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas putida. The efficacy of the preservative systems of two cosmetic products, tested against standard micro-organisms (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 4338 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027) and two isolates from cosmetics in this study (S. epidermidis and P. putida), satisfied the Cosmetics, Toiletries, and Fragrance Association and Official Italian Pharmacopeia criteria, while only one tested cosmetic respected the Rapid Challenge Test criterion. CONCLUSIONS: Contaminated cosmetic products are relatively uncommon, but some products, unable to suppress the growth of several micro-organisms, represent a potential health hazard. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The challenge test may be performed not only during the preparation of the preservative system in the intact cosmetics, but also be used to evaluate the protection efficacy during their use.
TI  - Functional genetic analysis reveals a 2-Alkyl-4-quinolone signaling system in the human pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei and related bacteria.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa synthesizes diverse 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolones (AHQs), including the signaling molecule 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone (PQS), via the pqsABCDE locus. By examining the genome databases, homologs of the pqs genes were identified in other bacteria. However, apart from P. aeruginosa, only Burkholderia pseudomallei and B. thailandensis contained a complete pqsA-E operon (termed hhqA-E). By introducing the B. pseudomallei hhqA and hhqE genes into P. aeruginosa pqsA and pqsE mutants, we show that they are functionally conserved and restore virulence factor and PQS production. B. pseudomallei, B. thailandensis, B. cenocepacia, and P. putida each produced 2-heptyl-4(1H)-quinolone (HHQ), but not PQS. Mutation of hhqA in B. pseudomallei resulted in the loss of AHQ production, altered colony morphology, and enhanced elastase production, which was reduced to parental levels by exogenous HHQ. These data reveal a role for AHQs in bacterial cell-to-cell communication beyond that seen in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative rods isolated from inpatients and outpatients, detected using Etest MBL].
AB  - The aim of presented study was to detect MBL-positive strains in a group of clinical carbapenem-resistant strains isolated from inpatients and outpatients during last four years. From the beginning of November 2001 to the end of October 2005, one hundred and four strains resistant to carbapenem antibiotics--imipenem and meropenem were cultured from clinical samples obtained from patients of the Infant Jesus Clinical Hospital Centre for Trauma Treatment in Warsaw and from patients of outpatient clinics. Strains were identified and their susceptibility to antibacterial agents was determined in the automatic ATB Expression system (bioMerieux). Resistance to imipenem and meropenem was confirmed with a disc diffusion method. Production of metallo-beta-lactamases (MBL) was examined with the use of Etest MBL (AB Biodisk, Sweden), and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) by means of following procedures: DDST and / or DD (four variants) (Oxoid Ltd., England). MBL-positive strains (36) were cultured in cases of infections in adult patients (35 strains) and in a child (1 strain). Majority of strains belonged to the species P. aeruginosa (27), several strains - to the species P. putida (6) and remaining strains--to P. stutzeri, A. xylosoxidans, and E. cloacae (1 strain of each species). Four strains were producers of MBL-type and ESBL-type beta-lactamases. According to our knowledge and accessible literature described strains (except one paediatric strain) are the first MBL-positive strains isolated from adult hospitalized patients and adult ambulatory patients in Poland. Additionally, MBL-positive E. cloacae strain is probably the first MBL producer isolated in Poland, which belongs to the group of enteric rods. MBL-producing strains of Gram-negative rods, detected by phenotypic Etest MBL method, will be verified with genetic procedures.
TI  - Dynamics of development and dispersal in sessile microbial communities: examples  from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida model biofilms.
AB  - Surface-associated microbial communities in many cases display dynamic developmental patterns. Model biofilms formed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida in laboratory flow-chamber setups represent examples of such behaviour. Dependent on the experimental conditions the bacteria in these model biofilms develop characteristic multicellular structures through a series of distinct steps where cellular migration plays an important role. Despite the appearance of these characteristic developmental patterns in the model biofilms the available evidence suggest that the biofilm forming organisms do not possess comprehensive genetic programs for biofilm development. Instead the bacteria appear to have evolved a number of different mechanisms to optimize surface colonization, of which they express a subset in response to the prevailing environmental conditions. These mechanisms include the ability to regulate cellular adhesiveness and migration in response to micro-environmental signals including those secreted by the bacteria themselves.
TI  - IncP-9 replication initiator protein binds to multiple DNA sequences in oriV and  recruits host DnaA protein.
AB  - The minimal replicon from IncP-9 plasmid pM3, consisting of oriV and rep, is able to replicate in Pseudomonas putida but not in Escherichia coli, unless production of Rep protein is increased. The Rep protein, at 20kDa, is the smallest replication protein so far identified for a theta replicating plasmid. Rep was purified and shown to bind in three blocks across the oriV region that do not correlate with a single unique binding sequence. The block closest to rep is not necessary for oriV function. Rep forms at least two types of complex--one rendering the DNA entirely resistant to cleavage, the other occupying one side of the helix. No short segment of oriV showed the same affinity for Rep as the whole of oriV. The oriV region did not bind purified DnaA from E. coli, P. putida or P. aeruginosa but when Rep was present also, super-shifts were found with DnaA in a sequence-specific manner. Scrambling of the primary candidate DnaA box did not inactivate oriV but did increase the level of Rep required to activate oriV. The general pattern of Rep-DNA recognition sequences in oriV indicates that the IncP-9 system falls outside of the paradigms of model plasmids that have been well-studied to date.
TI  - Evaluation of pyrrolidonyl arylamidase for the identification of nonfermenting Gram-negative rods.
AB  - To evaluate the activity of pyrrolidonyl arylamidase (PYR) for the differentiation and identification of nonfermenting gram negative rods (NFGNR), 293 isolates were tested. A 24 h culture of each test organism was prepared. From this a 108-109 cfu/mL suspension was added to 0.25 mL of sterile physiologic solution. A PYR disk was then added and the test was incubated for 30 minutes at 35-37 degrees C, at environmental atmosphere. Reading was done by adding 1 drop of cinnamaldehyde reagent. Strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter haemolyticus, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bergeyella zoohelcum, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Bordetella hinzii, Brevundimonas diminuta, Brevundimonas vesicularis, Brucella ovis, Brucella spp., Brucella suis, Burkholderia cepacia complex, Moraxella catarrhalis, Moraxella lacunata, Moraxella nonliquefaciens, Moraxella osloensis, Oligella ureolytica, Pseudomonas alcaligenes, Pseudomonas mendocina, Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Pseudomonas Vb3, Psychrobacter phenylpyruvicus, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were PYR negative. On the other hand Achromobacter piechaudii, Achromobacter denitrificans, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Burkholderia gladioli, Chryseobacterium gleum-indologenes, Comamonas testosroni, Cupriavidus pauculus, Delftia acidovorans, Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, Myroides spp., Ochrobactrum anthropi, Pseudomonas oryzihabitans, Ralstonia pickettii, Rhizobium radiobacter, Shewanella spp., Sphingobacterium multivorum, Sphingobacterium spiritivorum, and Weeksella virosa were PYR positive. Finally, Acinetobacter lwoffii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Roseomonas spp., and Sphingomonas paucimobilis-parapaucimobilis were PYR variable. PYR testing should be considered as a useful tool to facilitate the identification of NFGNR.
TI  - Identification of genes and proteins necessary for catabolism of acyclic terpenes and leucine/isovalerate in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Geranyl-coenzyme A (CoA)-carboxylase (GCase; AtuC/AtuF) and methylcrotonyl-CoA-carboxylase (MCase; LiuB/LiuD) are characteristic enzymes of the catabolic pathway of acyclic terpenes (citronellol and geraniol) and of saturated methyl-branched compounds, such as leucine or isovalerate, respectively. Proteins encoded by two gene clusters (atuABCDEFGH and liuRABCDE) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 were essential for acyclic terpene utilization (Atu) and for leucine and isovalerate utilization (Liu), respectively, as revealed by phenotype analysis of 10 insertion mutants, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, determination of GCase and MCase activities, and Western blot analysis of wild-type and mutant strains. Analysis of the genome sequences of other pseudomonads (P. putida KT2440 and P. fluorescens Pf-5) revealed candidate genes for Liu proteins for both species and candidate genes for Atu proteins in P. fluorescens. This result concurred with the finding that P. fluorescens, but not P. putida, could grow on acyclic terpenes (citronellol and citronellate), while both species were able to utilize leucine and isovalerate. A regulatory gene, atuR, was identified upstream of atuABCDEFGH and negatively regulated expression of the atu gene cluster.
TI  - Susceptibility of pseudomonads to Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil and components.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Thirty isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 15 isolates of Pseudomonas putida and 11 isolates of Pseudomonas fluorescens were tested for susceptibility to tea tree oil (TTO), the essential oil of Melaleuca alternifolia, and the components terpinen-4-ol, alpha-terpineol, cineole, gamma-terpinene and rho-cymene. METHODS: MICs were determined by broth microdilution in Mueller-Hinton medium supplemented with 0.002% (v/v) Tween 80. RESULTS: The MIC90 of TTO for all isolates tested was 4% (v/v) or less. Susceptibility to components tested varied between species. CONCLUSIONS: Pseudomonas spp. are susceptible to TTO and some of its components although they are less susceptible than many other bacteria tested previously.
TI  - Oxidative stress by biphenyl metabolites induces inhibition of bacterial cell separation.
AB  - Cell-cell separation of a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-degrading bacterium Comamonas testosteroni TK102 was monitored by flow cytometry. When monohydroxy metabolites of biphenyl (BP) (2-hydroxybiphenyl and 3-hydroxybiphenyl) were added to the culture, cell-cell separation of strain TK102 was inhibited at stationary phase. This inhibition was reproduced on non-PCB degrading bacteria such as Pseudomonas putida PpY101 and Escherichia coli MV1184, but was not observed on Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. An opportunistic pathogen, P. aeruginosa PAO1, produces exopolysaccharide, which is known to scavenge damaging chemicals such as reactive oxygen species (ROS). The higher level of ROS and lipid peroxidants were detected in the cells treated by monohydroxybiphenyls. Fat-soluble vitamin E, which is a lipid radical scavenger, maintained bacterial cell separation during monohydroxybiphenyls treatment. Our results demonstrated that intracellular oxidative stress played an important role in the inhibition of bacterial cell separation during BP metabolism. This study shows that metabolites of environmental pollutants, such as monohydroxylated BP, inhibit bacterial cell separation by oxidative stress.
TI  - The ppuI-rsaL-ppuR quorum-sensing system regulates biofilm formation of Pseudomonas putida PCL1445 by controlling biosynthesis of the cyclic lipopeptides putisolvins I and II.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida strain PCL1445 produces two cyclic lipopeptides, putisolvin I  and putisolvin II, which possess surface tension-reducing abilities and are able to inhibit biofilm formation and to break down existing biofilms of several Pseudomonas spp., including P. aeruginosa. Putisolvins are secreted in the culture medium during growth at late exponential phase, indicating that production is possibly regulated by quorum sensing. In the present study, we identified a quorum-sensing system in PCL1445 that is composed of ppuI, rsaL, and ppuR and shows very high similarity with gene clusters of P. putida strains IsoF and WCS358. Strains with mutations in ppuI and ppuR showed a severe reduction of putisolvin production. Expression analysis of the putisolvin biosynthetic gene in a ppuI background showed decreased expression, which could be complemented by the addition of synthetic 3-oxo-C(10)-N-acyl homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C(10)-AHL) or 3-oxo-C(12)-AHL to the medium. An rsaL mutant overproduces AHLs, and production of putisolvins is induced early during growth. Analysis of biofilm formation on polyvinylchloride showed that ppuI and ppuR mutants produce a denser biofilm than PCL1445, which correlates with decreased production of putisolvins, whereas an rsaL mutant shows a delay in biofilm production, which correlates with early production of putisolvins. The results demonstrate that quorum-sensing signals induce the production of cyclic lipopeptides putisolvin I and II and consequently control biofilm formation by Pseudomonas putida.
TI  - [Cloning, sequence analysis and expression of alanine racemase gene in Pseudomonas putida].
AB  - Two distinct alanine racemase genes from Pseudomonas putida 200 were cloned and sequenced. DadX encodes a peptide of 357 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 38.82kDa. The putative product of alr gene is a peptide of 409 amino acids with molecular weight of 44.182kDa. A homology comparison revealed identities of 96.64%, 71.99%, 44.88% and 47.37% of the DadX alanine racemase to those from P. putida KT2440, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, respectively. The amino acids sequence deduced from alr gene showed the homologies of 94.38%, 22.89%, 25.72% and 26.44% to those from the microorganisms above, respectively. Two motifs believed essential to the enzyme activity are found both in DadX and Alr, such as pyridoxal-5'-phosphate binding site. Both dadX and alr were expressed in E. coli TG1. Neither alanine racemase activity or serine racemase activity was detected in the host strain. Only alanine racemase activity was found in E. coli TG1/pCTD. But both E. coli TG1/pCTA and TG1/pCBA exhibit activity toward L-alanine and L-serine. Transcription of alr gene in E. coli is independent from extraneous promoter, a result confirmed by the significant enzyme activity observed in the E. coli TG1/pCBA, which indicates the presence of a possible promoter upstream the structure gene.
TI  - Bacterial repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences are DNA targets for Insertion Sequence elements.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile elements are involved in genomic rearrangements and virulence  acquisition, and hence, are important elements in bacterial genome evolution. The insertion of some specific Insertion Sequences had been associated with repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) elements. Considering that there are a sufficient number of available genomes with described REPs, and exploiting the advantage of the traceability of transposition events in genomes, we decided to exhaustively analyze the relationship between REP sequences and mobile elements. RESULTS: This global multigenome study highlights the importance of repetitive extragenic palindromic elements as target sequences for transposases. The study is based on the analysis of the DNA regions surrounding the 981 instances of Insertion Sequence elements with respect to the positioning of REP sequences in the 19 available annotated microbial genomes corresponding to species of bacteria with reported REP sequences. This analysis has allowed the detection of the specific insertion into REP sequences for ISPsy8 in Pseudomonas syringae DC3000, ISPa11 in P. aeruginosa PA01, ISPpu9 and ISPpu10 in P. putida KT2440, and ISRm22 and ISRm19 in Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021 genome. Preference for insertion in extragenic spaces with REP sequences has also been detected for ISPsy7 in P. syringae DC3000, ISRm5 in S. meliloti and ISNm1106 in Neisseria meningitidis MC58 and Z2491 genomes. Probably, the association with REP elements that we have detected analyzing genomes is only the tip of the iceberg, and this association could be even more frequent in natural isolates. CONCLUSION: Our findings characterize REP elements as hot spots for transposition and reinforce the relationship between REP sequences and genomic plasticity mediated by mobile elements. In addition, this study defines a subset of REP-recognizer transposases with high target selectivity that can be useful in the development of new tools for genome manipulation.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of acquired-metallo-beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in Poland.
AB  - We have analyzed 40 metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 38), Pseudomonas putida (n = 1), and Acinetobacter genospecies 3 (n = 1) from 17 hospitals in 12 cities in Poland that were identified in 2000 to 2004. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis typing classified the P. aeruginosa isolates into eight types, with two types differentiated further into subtypes. Each of the types was specific either to a given center or to several hospitals of the same or neighboring geographic area. Almost all of the organisms produced beta-lactamase VIM-2; the only exceptions were several P. aeruginosa isolates from two centers which expressed VIM-4. The bla(VIM) genes resided exclusively within class 1 integrons, and these were located in either chromosomal or plasmid DNA. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism study of the variable regions of the integrons, followed by DNA sequencing, revealed the presence of eight different, mostly novel gene cassette arrays, six of which contained bla(VIM-2) and two of which contained bla(VIM-4). The occurrence of the integron variants correlated well with the geographic distribution of the MBL-producing organisms, and this suggested that their emergence in particular parts of the country had been likely due to a number of independent events. The following regional dissemination of MBL producers could be attributed to various phenomena, including their clonal spread, horizontal transmission of resistance determinants, or both. All of the data collected in this study revealed that even at this early stage of detection, the epidemiological situation concerning MBL producers in Poland has already been complex and very dynamic.
TI  - Molecular classification of IncP-9 naphthalene degradation plasmids.
AB  - A large collection of naphthalene-degrading fluorescent Pseudomonas strains isolated from sites contaminated with coal tar and crude oil was screened for the presence of IncP-9 plasmids. Seventeen strains were found to carry naphthalene catabolic plasmids ranging in size from 83 to 120 kb and were selected for further study. Results of molecular genotyping revealed that 15 strains were closely related to P. putida, one to P. fluorescens, and one to P. aeruginosa. All catabolic plasmids found in these strains, with the exception of pBS216, pSN11, and p8909N-1, turned out to belong to IncP-9 beta-subgroup. Plasmids pBS216, pSN11, and p8909N-1 were identified as members of IncP-9 delta-subgroup. One plasmid, pBS2, contains fused replicons of IncP-9beta and IncP-7 groups. RFLP analyses of the naphthalene catabolic plasmids revealed that organisation of the replicon correlates well with the overall plasmid structure. Comparative PCR studies with conserved oligonucleotide primers indicated that genes for key enzymes of naphthalene catabolism are highly conserved among all studied plasmids. Three bacterial strains, P. putida BS202, P. putida BS3701, and P. putida BS3790, were found to have two different salicylate hydroxylase genes one of which has no similarity to the "classic" enzyme encoded by nahG gene. Discovery of a large group of plasmid with unique nahR suggested that the regulatory loop may also represent a variable part of the pathway for catabolism of naphthalene in fluorescent Pseudomonas spp.
TI  - Daytime orthokeratology associated with infectious keratitis by multiple gram-negative bacilli: Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - PURPOSE: To report a case of a corneal ulcer in a patient who wore orthokeratology contact lenses during the day. METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: A 16-year-old girl who underwent orthokeratology treatment developed a corneal ulcer in her right eye. The refractive status of the affected eye was -5.75 -1.75 x 180, and the best-corrected visual acuity was 20/40. Corneal topography showed the temporal upper dislocation of a central flattened zone in the right eye. The patient had worn orthokeratology contact lenses during the day for more than 4 years. Her ulcer became worse after treatment with tobramycin and gentamicin for 1 day. After treatment with ciprofloxacin, the ulcer healed, and visual acuity returned to 20/20 with spectacle correction. Cultures of the cornea, contact lens, and lens solution all grew Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: Improper fitting of lenses and contamination of lenses or solutions in orthokeratology therapy are risk factors for a corneal ulcer, even when patients wear orthokeratology lenses only during the day.
TI  - Role of the novel OprD family of porins in nutrient uptake in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - To circumvent the permeability barrier of its outer membrane, Pseudomonas aeruginosa has evolved a series of specific porins. These channels have binding sites for related classes of molecules that facilitate uptake under nutrient-limited conditions. Here, we report on the identification of a 19-member family of porins similar to the basic-amino-acid-specific porin OprD. The members of this family fell into one of two phylogenetically distinct clusters, one bearing high similarity to OprD and the other bearing most similarity to the putative phenylacetic acid uptake porin PhaK of Pseudomonas putida. Analysis of the genome context, operon arrangement, and regulation of the PhaK-like porin OpdK indicated that it might be involved in vanillate uptake. This result was confirmed by demonstrating that an opdK mutant had a deficiency in the ability to grow on vanillate as a carbon source. To extrapolate these data to other paralogues within this family, the substrate specificities of 6 of the 17 remaining OprD homologues were inferred using an approach similar to that used with opdK. The specificities determined were as follows: OpdP, glycine-glutamate; OpdC, histidine; OpdB, proline; OpdT, tyrosine; OpdH, cis-aconitate; and OpdO, pyroglutamate. Thus, members of the OprD subfamily took up amino acids and related molecules, and those characterized members most similar to PhaK were responsible for the uptake of a diverse array of organic acids. These results imply that there is a functional basis for the phylogenetic clustering of these proteins and provide a framework for studying OprD homologues in other organisms.
TI  - Cell surface display of lipase in Pseudomonas putida KT2442 using OprF as an anchoring motif and its biocatalytic applications.
AB  - We developed a new cell surface display system in Pseudomonas putida KT2442 using OprF, an outer membrane protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as an anchoring motif in a C-terminal deletion-fusion strategy. The Pseudomonas fluorescens SIK W1 lipase gene was fused to two different C-terminal truncated OprF genes, and the fusion genes were cloned into the broad-host-range plasmid pBBR1MCS2 to make pMO164PL and pMO188PL. Plasmid pMO188PL allowed better display of lipase and thus was chosen for further study. The display of lipase on the surface of P. putida KT2442 was confirmed by Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence microscopy, and measurement of whole-cell lipase activity. The whole-cell lipase activity of recombinant P. putida KT2442 harboring pMO188PL was more than fivefold higher than that of recombinant Escherichia coli displaying lipase in the same manner. Cell surface-displayed lipase exhibited the highest activity at 47 degrees C and pH 9.0, and the whole-cell lipase activity was greater than 90% of the initial activity in organic solvents at 47 degrees C for 1 week. In a biocatalytic application, enantioselective resolution of 1-phenyl ethanol was carried out in an organic solvent. (R)-Phenyl ethyl acetate was successfully produced with 41.9% conversion and an enantiomeric excess of more than 99% in a 36-h reaction. These results suggest that the OprF anchor can be used for efficient display of proteins in P. putida KT2442 and consequently for various biocatalytic applications.
TI  - Significance and characterisation of pseudomonads from urinary tract specimens.
AB  - Pseudomonads are commonly encountered in clinical samples. Usually ignored as contaminants, these organisms are known to cause nosocomial opportunistic infections like urinary tract infections (UTI). One hundred and two pseudomonads obtained in pure culture and significant numbers from 8400 consecutive urinary tract (UT) specimens were biochemically characterised upto species level by a battery of biochemical tests. Modified Stoke's disk diffusion method was followed for testing antibiotic susceptibility. Beta-lactamase production was checked by nitrocefin disk method. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration for some of these strains against imipenem was done by agar dilution method of NCCLS. Etiological significance of isolating these organisms from UT specimens was also assessed. P. aeruginosa was the commonest (76) followed by B. pickettii (10), P. putida (6), P.fluorescence (2), P. stutzeri (20) P. vesicularis (2), S. putrefaciens (2) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (2). Seventy six per cent of P. aeruginosa produced beta-lactamases as compared to 45% of other pseudomonads. The frequency of antibiotic resistance was gentamicin and ciprofloxacin (68.6%) followed by netilmicin (60.7%), ceftazidime (58.8%), amikacin (43.1%) and piperacillin (39.2%). In 42 patients (51.2%) the etiological significance of isolating a pseudomonad could be confirmed. Risk factors for development of UTI were present in 62(75%). Obstructive uropathy (20) followed by post operative period and surgery on urinary tract were the commonest risk factors involved. A high level of resistance was observed for imipenem (P. aeruginosa 43.7% and other pseudomonads 25%).
TI  - Microbial surface thermodynamics and interactions in aqueous media.
AB  - Microbial surface thermodynamics and interactions in aqueous media were investigated for seven typical rod-shaped bacterial strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceas, and Bacillaceae, which included Escherichia coli HB101, Escherichia coli JM109, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas sp., and Bacillus subtilis. All the microorganisms studied exhibited a monopolar and predominant hydrophilic surface and a negative Delta G132tot, total free energy of interactions between microbes (1) and silica gel or Canadian River Alluvium (CRA) (2) immersed in water (3) at the equilibrium distance, which accounted for their attachment on the medium surface. The microbial attachment was proportional to the corresponding Delta G132tot values. Among the microorganisms studied, B. subtilis had the most attachment on both silica gel and CRA because it had the smallest Delta G132tot values (-17.14kT for silica gel and -21.84kT for CRA). The origins of Lifshitz-van der Waals, Lewis acid/base, and electrostatic interactions were discussed and related to experimental observations.
TI  - Effect of carbon source on pyrimidine formation in Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 13525.
AB  - The effect of carbon source on the regulation of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic enzymes in the type strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens was investigated. The de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic enzyme activities were measured in P. fluorescens ATCC 13525 cells and in cells from an auxotroph deficient for orotate phosphoribosyltransferase activity where glucose or succinate served as the carbon source. Pyrimidine supplementation to the culture medium affected the biosynthetic enzyme activities in ATCC 13525 cells. Pyrimidine Limitation of the mutant strain indicated transcriptional regulation of the biosynthetic pathway by pyrimidines that was influenced by carbon source. Transcriptional regulation of pyrimidine synthesis in P. fluorescens appeared to be more highly regulated than was observed for the taxonomically related species Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Pseudomonas putida.
TI  - Nucleotide sequences and characterization of genes encoding naphthalene upper pathway of pseudomonas aeruginosa PaK1 and Pseudomonas putida OUS82.
AB  - A 12,808-nucleotide containing DNA fragment cloned from naphthalene-utilizing (Nah+) Pseudomonas aeruginosa PaK1 was analyzed and compared with the genes (pah(OUS)) of a 14,462-nucleotide DNA fragment from Pseudomonas putida OUS82. The DNA sequence analyses demonstrated that the naphthalene upper-pathway genes and their deduced enzymes were very similar between the two bacteria: nucleotide similarities, 83-93%; amino acid similarities, 79-95%. These genes were also similar to those of the nah operon of plasmid NAH7; in particular, the OUS82 genes were similar to the nah genes, whereas the PaK1 genes were almost identical to the dox genes of Pseudomonas sp. C18. A region homologous with the 84-bp repeated sequence that Eaton (J. Bacteriol., 176, 7757-7762, 1994) has found at a site upstream of he nah operon was found only in a region downstream of the pah(PaK) gene cluster in PaK1 and on both sides of the pah(OUS) gene cluster in OUS82. A PaK1 gene, corresponding to an unknown gene (nahQ) in the nah operon, is located between the 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase gene and the trans-o-hydroxybenzylindenepyruvate (tHBP A) hydratase-aldolase gene (nahE), and was suggested to be involved in the conversion of naphthalene to salicylate. Just downstream of the pah(PaK) gene cluster, a portion of a region was identical to one-third of the transposase gene (tnpA) in a phenol-catabolic plasmid pEST1226.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of Pseudomonas putida genes encoding the phosphate-specific transport system.
AB  - The pstSCAB genes of Pseudomonas putida PRS2000, encoding the phosphate (Pi)-specific transport (Pst) system, were cloned. The pstS gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, of which the pstCAB genes had been cloned previously, was also cloned (Nikata, T. et al., Mol. Gen. Genet., 250, 692-698, 1996). The predicted translation products of the P. putida pstSCAB genes showed 83, 75, 78 and 88% amino acid identity with their P. aeruginosa counterparts. Two well-conserved Pho box sequences were found in the region upstream of the pstS gene (15/18 base identity with the consensus Pho box sequence) and in the intercistronic region between the pstS and pstC genes (11/18 base identity) of P. putida PRS2000. To investigate the functions of PstSCAB, the pstSC genes were inactivated by inserting a kanamycin resistance gene cassette into the chromosome of P. putida PRS2000. The resultant mutant, designated PNT1, failed to take up 32Pi even under conditions of Pi limitation. Strain PNT1 was also constitutive for alkaline phosphatase synthesis, as well as chemotaxis toward Pi, indicating that the Pst system is involved in the negative regulation of the pho regulon in P. putida. Although overexpression of the pstSCAB genes in P. putida PRS2000 resulted in decreased cell growth, this recombinant strain could remove Pi at a rate similar to that seen with the control strain.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of bulbophyllum neilgherrense wt. (Orchidaceae). An in vitro study.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of Bulbophyllum neilgherrense was tested against five  species of bacteria, viz., Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus pumilus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida Aqueous, ethanolic and chloroform soluble extracts of leaf and pseudobulb (5.50 w/v) were screened for their antibacterial potential. The zone of inhibition was seen to be largest when alcoholic extract was used.
TI  - Effect of dissolved oxygen regime on growth dynamics of Pseudomonas spp during benzene degradation.
AB  - We investigated the effect of different oxygen regimes on growth patterns of Pseudomonas spp. during benzene degradation in microcosm batch studies. Benzene degradation was induced by limiting oxygen available for microbial activity, which consists of three initial-dissolved oxygen (DO) levels of oxic, hypoxic, and anoxic conditions. Batch experiments were performed for cell growth and benzene degradation by inoculating three strains of Pseudomonas spp. (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida) in mineral salt medium containing aqueous benzene. Results showed that all strains were capable to grow and degrade benzene under all oxygen regimes but in a different manner. The highest cell growth of P. aeruginosa and P. fluorescens was achieved under oxic and anoxic condition, respectively, but there was no substantial difference on benzene degradation between the oxygen treatments with about 25% reduction for both strains. P. putida showed a facultative process for both cell growth and benzene degradation. This reveals that care should be taken in selection of microorganisms with regard to environmental studies since they exhibit different responses for given environmental conditions such as DO levels.
TI  - Extracellular DNA in single- and multiple-species unsaturated biofilms.
AB  - The extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of bacterial biofilms form a hydrated barrier between cells and their external environment. Better characterization of EPS could be useful in understanding biofilm physiology. The EPS are chemically complex, changing with both bacterial strain and culture conditions. Previously, we reported that Pseudomonas aeruginosa unsaturated biofilm EPS contains large amounts of extracellular DNA (eDNA) (R. E. Steinberger, A. R. Allen, H. G. Hansma, and P. A. Holden, Microb. Ecol. 43:416-423, 2002). Here, we investigated the compositional similarity of eDNA to cellular DNA, the relative quantity of eDNA, and the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) community profile of eDNA in multiple-species biofilms. By randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis, cellular DNA and eDNA appear identical for P. aeruginosa biofilms. Significantly more eDNA was produced in P. aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida biofilms than in Rhodococcus erythropolis or Variovorax paradoxus biofilms. While the amount of eDNA in dual-species biofilms was of the same order of magnitude as that of of single-species biofilms, the amounts were not predictable from single-strain measurements. By the Shannon diversity index and principle components analysis of TRFLP profiles generated from 16S rRNA genes, eDNA of four-species biofilms differed significantly from either cellular or total DNA of the same biofilm. However, total DNA- and cellular DNA-based TRFLP analyses of this biofilm community yielded identical results. We conclude that extracellular DNA production in unsaturated biofilms is species dependent and that the phylogenetic information contained in this DNA pool is quantifiable and distinct from either total or cellular DNA.
TI  - Mutations in the cueA gene encoding a copper homeostasis P-type ATPase reduce the pathogenicity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice.
AB  - A sequencing project identified a putative copper homeostasis gene, cueA, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO1. Strains with mutations of the cueA gene, encoding a P-type ATPase linked to copper homeostasis in P. putida, displayed greater sensitivity to copper compared to wild-type bacteria using MIC determinations and in vitro passage in growth media with different concentrations of copper added. An LD50 assay showed a cueA deletion mutant was 50-fold more attenuated than wild-type strain PAO1 bacteria. Complementation of the cueA mutation restored in vitro tolerance to copper and virulence in a systemic model of infection to near wild-type levels. Competition assays between cueA mutants and wild-type P. aeruginosa strains demonstrated 20-fold attenuation by the cueA mutants within spleens of mice. This data suggests the P. aeruginosa CueA protein may be important in maintaining copper homeostasis both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Transmembrane transcriptional control (surface signalling) of the Escherichia coli Fec type.
AB  - The ferric citrate transport system of Escherichia coli is the first example of a transcription initiation mechanism that starts at the cell surface. The inducer, ferric citrate, binds to an outer membrane transport protein, and without further transport elicits a signal that is transmitted across the outer membrane, the periplasm, and the cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm. Signal transfer across the three subcellular compartments is mediated by the outer membrane transport protein that interacts in the periplasm with a cytoplasmic transmembrane protein. The latter is required for activation of a sigma factor which belongs to the extracytoplasmic function sigma factor family. A similar kind of transcription regulation has been demonstrated in Pseudomonas putida, P. aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Aerobacter aerogenes, Bordetella pertussis, B. bronchseptica, B. avium, and Ralstonia solanacearum. The genomes of P. putida, P. aeruginosa, Nitrosomonas europaea, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Caulobacter crescentus predict the existence of many more such transcriptional regulatory devices.
TI  - [Characteristics of natural strains of naphthalene-utilizing bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas].
AB  - Sixty-three strains of bacteria capable of utilizing naphthalene as the sole source of carbon and energy were isolated from 137 samples of soil taken in different sites in Belarus. All isolated bacteria contained extrachromosomal genetic elements of 45 to 150 kb in length. It was found that bacteria of 31 strains contained the IncP-9 incompatibility group plasmids, bacteria of one strain carried a plasmid containing replicons IncP-9 and IncP-7, and bacteria of 31 strains contained unidentified plasmids. Primary identification showed that the hosts of plasmids of naphthalene biodegradation are fluorescent bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas (P. putida and P. aeruginosa; a total of 47 strains) and unidentified nonfluorescent microorganisms (a total of 16 strains). In addition to the ability to utilize naphthalene, some strains exhibited the ability to stimulate the growth and development of the root system of Secale cereale.
TI  - The IncP-6 plasmid Rms149 consists of a small mobilizable backbone with multiple  large insertions.
AB  - Plasmid Rms149, the archetype of Pseudomonas plasmid incompatibility group IncP-6, was identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa as an agent conferring resistance to streptomycin, sulfanilamide, gentamicin, and carbenicillin in 1975. It has been classed as a broad-host-range plasmid due to its ability to replicate in both Escherichia coli (where it is designated IncG) and Pseudomonas species, although both species are gamma-proteobacteria. To provide reference information on this Inc group, we have determined the complete sequence of Rms149 and found that, although the genome comprises 57,121 bp, it is essentially a small mobilizable plasmid carrying multiple mobile elements, which make up 79% (>45 kb) of its genome. A replicon has been identified which encodes a single polypeptide with moderate identity to other replication proteins. The region encoding this protein can replicate in Pseudomonas putida and E. coli. This sequence is directly downstream of a putative partitioning region highly similar to that of pRA2. A functional IncQ-type mobilization region is also present. Thus, the backbone appears to be a novel combination of modules already identified in other plasmid systems. Analysis of the segments that fall outside this core of stable inheritance and transfer functions show that this plasmid has been subject to multiple insertion events and that the plasmid appears to carry a considerable load of DNA that no longer should be phenotypically advantageous. The plasmid therefore functions not just as a vehicle for spread of selective traits but also as a store for DNA that is not currently under selection.
TI  - Bacteraemia due to Pseudomonas putida and other Pseudomonas non-aeruginosa in children.

TI  - [Comparative analysis of total cell protein electrophoregram of pathogenic Burkholderia].
AB  - Whole-cell proteins of 22 strain of Burkhoderia pseudomallei, including 13 B. mallei, 5 B. cepacia strains and 14 strains of opportunistically pathogenic Pseudomonas defined by 1D SDC-PAAG electrophoresis. Electrophoregrams contained 35 to 45 protein fractions sized 19 to 130 kDa, which were highly reproductive. On the basis of computer-aided comparative analysis of protein patterns the interspecies and intraspecies grouping of studied microorganisms was made. The cluster analysis of the similarity matrix of protein spectra made it possible to allocate two groups of strains at the level of similarity of 78%. Group I was formed by Burkholderia species that previously belonged to the II RNA-DNA homology group of Pseudomonas: B. pseudomallei, B. mallei, B. cepacia. All Pseudomonas species were added to the 2nd Group: P. aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, P. testosterone, P. fluorescens, P. putida, P. mendocina. Four phenons were isolated among the strains of B. pseudomallei and 2 phenons--among the strains of B. mallei at the threshold similarity level (89%). The authors conclude that the comparative analysis of electrophoregrams of whole-cell proteins can be useful in the identification and typing of pathogenic Burkholderia.
TI  - Elucidation of dominant effect on initial bacterial adhesion onto polymer surfaces prepared by radiation-induced graft polymerization.
AB  - Surface-modified polyethylene (PE) membrane sheets were prepared by the radiation-induced graft polymerization (RIGP) of an epoxy-group-containing monomer, glycidyl methacrylate (GMA). The epoxy ring of GMA was opened by introducing diethylamine (DEA) or sodium sulfite (SS). We examined the properties of these sheets by measuring the amount of grafting polymer, surface roughness and membrane potential, and also investigated the adhesion of five Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Paracoccus denitrificans, onto the prepared sheet surfaces. A linear relationship between the degree of grafting (dg) and surface roughness was observed. Moreover, membrane potential was dependent on the amount of DEA or SS as the ionizable group. These results indicate that RIGP enables the control of the physicochemical properties of such a sheet surface by adjusting dg and the subsequent conversion of functional groups. A batch test on bacterial adhesion onto the sheets clarified that the DEA-containing sheet (DEA sheet) exhibited an adhesion rate constant, k, significantly greater than those of other types of sheet. Clearly, the adhesion rate constant of the DEA sheet increased with dg, indicating that electrostatic interaction is the most decisive factor for bacterial adhesion when it works as an attractive force. Furthermore, the densities of bacteria adhering onto the GMA-containing sheet (GMA sheet) and the SS-containing sheet (SS sheet) were almost the same as that onto a PE sheet, whereas that onto a DEA sheet significantly increased. Thus, the introduction of the GMA- and SS-containing graft chain did not have much influence on bacterial adhesion onto the surfaces, supporting the conclusion that the promotion of bacterial adhesion onto the GMA and SS sheets was due to an increase in surface area resulting from RIGP. Moreover, the scanning electron microscopy images of the sheet surfaces indicate that the conditions and morphologies of initial bacterial adhesion are dependent on surface properties, particularly membrane potential.
TI  - A Tn7-based broad-range bacterial cloning and expression system.
AB  - For many bacteria, cloning and expression systems are either scarce or nonexistent. We constructed several mini-Tn7 vectors and evaluated their potential as broad-range cloning and expression systems. In bacteria with a single chromosome, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida and Yersinia pestis, and in the presence of a helper plasmid encoding the site-specific transposition pathway, site- and orientation-specific Tn7 insertions occurred at a single attTn7 site downstream of the glmS gene. Burkholderia thailandensis contains two chromosomes, each containing a glmS gene and an attTn7 site. The Tn7 system allows engineering of diverse genetic traits into bacteria, as demonstrated by complementing a biofilm-growth defect of P. aeruginosa, establishing expression systems in P. aeruginosa and P. putida, and 'GFP-tagging' Y. pestis. This system will thus have widespread biomedical and environmental applications, especially in environments where plasmids and antibiotic selection are not feasible, namely in plant and animal models or biofilms.
TI  - Plasmid host-range: restrictions to F replication in Pseudomonas.
AB  - Host-range, a fundamental property of a bacterial plasmid, is primarily determined by the plasmid replication system. To investigate the basis of the restricted host-range of the well-studied F-plasmid of Escherichia coli, we characterized in vitro the interactions of the host DnaA initiation protein and DnaB helicase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida with the replication origin, oriS, and initiation protein, RepE, of the RepFIA replicon. The results presented here show that a pre-priming complex can form at the F-origin with the replication proteins from the non-native hosts in the presence of RepE. However, RepE cannot form a stable complex with DnaB of P. aeruginosa or P. putida but does stably interact with E. coli DnaB. This unstable association may affect the ability of F to replicate in Pseudomonas. In addition, replication studies in vivo suggest that inefficient expression of the RepE initiation protein from its native promoter in Pseudomonas is a factor in restricting its host-range. This, however, is not the only barrier to F replication, as mini-F derivatives with an alternative promoter for RepE expression do not replicate in P. putida and are not stably maintained in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Levels and activity of the Pseudomonas putida global regulatory protein Crc vary  according to growth conditions.
AB  - The global regulatory protein Crc is involved in the repression of several catabolic pathways for sugars, hydrocarbons, and nitrogenated and aromatic compounds in Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa when other preferred carbon sources are present in the culture medium (catabolite repression), therefore modulating carbon metabolism. We have analyzed whether the levels or the activity of Crc is regulated. Crc activity was followed by its ability to inhibit the induction by alkanes of the P. putida OCT plasmid alkane degradation pathway when cells grow in a complete medium, where the effect of Crc is very strong. The abundance of crc transcripts and the amounts of Crc protein were higher under repressing conditions than under nonrepressing conditions. The presence of crc on a high-copy-number plasmid considerably increased Crc levels, but this impaired its ability to inhibit the alkane degradation pathway. Crc shows similarity to a family of nucleases that have highly conserved residues at their catalytic sites. Mutation of the corresponding residues in Crc (Asp220 and His246) led to proteins that can inhibit induction of the alkane degradation pathway when present at normal or elevated levels in the cell. Repression by these mutant proteins occurred only under repressing conditions. These results suggest that both the amounts and the activity of Crc are modulated and support previous proposals that Crc may form part of a signal transduction pathway. Furthermore, the activity of the mutant proteins suggests that Crc is not a nuclease.
TI  - Modeling of growth kinetics for Pseudomonas spp. during benzene degradation.
AB  - A modeling study was conducted on growth kinetics of three different strains of Pseudomonas spp. (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida) during benzene degradation to determine optimum substrate concentrations for most efficient biodegradation. Batch tests were performed for eight different initial substrate concentrations to observe cell growth and associated substrate degradation using benzene-adapted cells. Kinetic parameters of both inhibitory (Haldane-Andrews, Aiba-Edwards) and noninhibitory (Monod) models were fitted to the relationship between specific growth rate and substrate concentration obtained from the growth curves. Results showed that half-saturation constant of P. fluorescens was the highest among the three strains, indicating that this strain could grow well at high concentration, while P. putida could grow best at low concentration. The inhibition constant of P. aeruginosa was the highest, implying that it could tolerate high benzene concentration and therefore could grow at a wider concentration range. Estimated specific growth rate of P. putida was lower, but half-saturation constant was higher than those from literature study due to high substrate concentration range used in this study. These two kinetic parameters resulted in substantial difference between Monod- and Haldane-type models, indicating that distinction should be made in applying those models.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a bio-agent antagonistic to diatom, Stephanodiscus hantzschii.
AB  - AIMS: Identification of bacterium HYK0203-SK02 and its lysis of Stephanodiscus hantzschii. METHODS AND RESULTS: In an effort to identify a bio-agent capable of controlling S. hantzschii blooms, we used the algal lawn method to identify 76 bacteria in relevant water samples. Of these, the seven isolate showed algicidal activity against S. hantzschii; isolate HYK0203-SK02 exhibited the strongest algicidal activity, and was used for further analysis. 16S rDNA sequencing of this isolate allowed us to identify HYK0203-SK02 as a strain of Pseudomonas putida (99.2%). Growth of S. hantzschii was strongly suppressed by bacteria in all growth phases, with the strongest algicidal activity noted against diatoms in the exponential stage (5-18 days). Host range assays revealed that isolate HYK0203-SK02 also strongly inhibited the growth of Microcystis aeruginosa, but stimulated growth of the diatom Cyclotella sp., which has a similar structure to that of S. hantzschii. Biochemical assays revealed that the algicidal substance seemed to be localized in the cytoplasmic membrane of this newly identified algicidal bacterium. CONCLUSION: The algicidal bacteria P. putida HYK0203-SK02 caused cell lysis and death of not only diatom S. hantzschii but also cyanobacteria M. aeruginosa, dramatically. Algicidal substance might be located at the compartment of cytoplasmic membrane. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Taken together, our results indicate that P. putida HYK0203-SK02 may be a potential bio-agent for future use in controlling freshwater diatomic blooms.
TI  - Nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli in cancer patients: increasing frequency of infection and antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates to fluoroquinolones.
AB  - Despite a decline in the frequency of gram-negative infections in cancer patients, there has been an increase in the proportion of such infections caused by nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB). We tested the in vitro activity of several quinolones against NFGNB isolated from cancer patients between February 2000 and February 2003, using a broth microdilution method. Ciprofloxacin was the most potent agent tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although only 80% of isolates were susceptible to it. The newer quinolones (gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, and garenoxacin) had better activity than ofloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin, against many other nonfermenters (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, P. fluorescens, and P. putida).
TI  - Bacterial contamination of dental chair units in a modern dental hospital caused  by leakage from suction system hoses containing extensive biofilm.
AB  - Within six months of opening of the new Dublin Dental Hospital in September 1998, areas of corrosion were observed on many of the baseplates of the hospital's 103 dental chair units (DCUs) at the site of attachment of the suction hoses. The corroded areas were heavily contaminated with Pseudomonas spp. and related genera posing a risk of cross-infection, particularly for immunocompromised patients. These species were used as marker organisms to investigate the source of the contamination. P. aeruginosa was the predominant species recovered from 41 selected DCU baseplates (61% prevalence), whereas P. putida (46% prevalence) and P. aeruginosa (43% prevalence) were predominant at the attachment ends of 37 selected high-volume suction hoses. Forty-one selected isolates of P. aeruginosa from 13 DCU baseplates, 16 high-volume suction hoses and 12 coarse filter housings (another suction system site) from 19 separate DCUs were serotyped to determine the similarity of isolates at each site. The majority of isolates (68.3%) belonged to serotype O:10, while the remainder belonged to serotypes O:6 (7.3%), O:11 (7.3%), O:14 (9.8%) and O:5/O:16 (7.3%). Of the isolates from DCU baseplates, additional isolates with the same serotype were recovered from other suction system sites in 10/13 (77%) cases. Isolates of only one serotype were recovered from each of the 19 DCUs investigated. Forty-one serotyped isolates were also subject to computer-assisted analysis of SpeI-generated DNA fingerprint profiles, and similarity coefficient (S(AB)s) values were calculated for each pairwise combination of isolate profiles. The data obtained showed that the isolates consisted of two distinct main populations, each containing separate clades corresponding to specific serotypes. Serotype O:6 (three isolates), O:11 (three isolates) and O:5/O:16 (three isolates) belonged to a single strain in each case. Serotypes O:14 (four isolates) and O:10 (28 isolates) belonged to two strains in each case. The two serotype O:10 strains, termed fingerprint groups I (four isolates from three DCUs) and II (24 isolates from 10 DCUs), were the most distantly related of all the strains identified. These findings demonstrated that the hospital DCUs had become colonized with a small number of P. aeruginosa strains, one of which (serotype O:10, fingerprint group II) predominated. These results also confirmed that DCU baseplate contamination was most likely to be due to leakage from suction system hoses at the baseplate attachment sites, probably due to loosening during use. Replacement hose connectors that firmly retained the suction hoses in the attachment sites so that they could not be loosened by movement of the suction hoses solved this problem, and eliminated further contamination of the DCU baseplates.
TI  - Nitrogen-dependent regulation of medium-chain length polyhydroxyalkanoate biosynthesis genes in pseudomonads.
AB  - Comparative transcriptional analysis of polyhdroxyalkanoate (PHA) biosynthesis genes with wild type strains and mutants, which lack the intact alternative sigma factor gene rpoN, was performed using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. In Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, phaI and phaF were co-transcribed. PhaF was a negative regulator of transcription of PHA synthase gene phaC1 but did not serve as auto-repressor. However, the alternative sigma factor RpoN is suggested as negative regulator of phaF transcription. In P. putida, phaI-phaF transcription is strongly dependent on nitrogen availability and PHA accumulation, whereas phaF transcription is not. These data suggested a differential regulation of phaF and phaIF. The phaC1 gene transcription occurred almost independently by of RpoN or nitrogen availability in both pseudomonads.
TI  - Evaluation of Etest MBL for detection of blaIMP-1 and blaVIM-2 allele-positive clinical isolates of Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp.
AB  - The Etest MBL (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) correctly differentiated all 57 isolates of Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with the bla(IMP-1) allele and 135 of 137 (98.5%) Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp. isolates with the bla(VIM-2) allele. The Etest MBL was reliable for detecting the IMP-1- and VIM-2-producing Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter isolates.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of uncommonly isolated non-enteric Gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - The frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of 3059 non-enteric Gram-negative bacilli (NGB), other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., consecutively collected as part of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (1997-2003) were reviewed. During this period, a total of 221,084 bacterial isolates were collected from several clinical specimens worldwide, including 25,305 (11.5%) NGB. Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa accounted for 82.7% of the NGB isolates and have been excluded from this analysis. The antimicrobial susceptibility results of 3509 strains from 13 species/genera have been analysed in this review. The isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution methods in three central laboratories using common reagents and procedures. More than 30 antimicrobial agents were tested and the results for the 18 most active compounds are reported here. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (2076 strains; 59.2%) was the most frequently isolated pathogen in this group, followed by Aeromonas spp. (385 strain; 11.0%), Burkholderia cepacia (269 strains; 7.7%), Pseudomonas fluorescens/putida (253 strains; 7.2%) and Alcaligenes spp. (236 strains; 6.7%). All other species/genera accounted for less than 3% of the isolates analysed. The antimicrobial agents with the most consistent activity against the NGB evaluated in the present study were the newer fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and levofloxacin with 84.1 and 84.9% susceptibility overall. Trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole was active against 85.3% of the isolates tested, but showed reduced activity against P. fluorescens/putida (22.1% susceptibility). Antimicrobial susceptibility varied significantly between species/genera and the geographical regions evaluated. Thus, proper identification and quantitative susceptibility testing will be required for the treatment of NGB infections. Extensive worldwide surveillance programmes remain extremely important to guide empirical antimicrobial therapy for rarely isolated pathogens and also for pathogens that are not routinely tested due to the lack of standardised susceptibility testing methods.
TI  - REP code: defining bacterial identity in extragenic space.
AB  - Through the analysis of 57 bacterial genomes we have detected repetitive extragenic palindromic DNA sequences (REPs) in 11 species. For a sequence to be considered as REP, the following criteria should be met: (i) It should be extragenic, (ii) palindromic, (iii) of a length between 21 and 65 bases and (iv) should constitute more than 0.5% of the total extragenic space. Species-specific REPs have been found in human pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Neisseria meningitidis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Rickettsia conorii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens and the soil bacteria Deinococcus radiodurans, Pseudomonas putida and Sinorhizobium meliloti.
TI  - Conjugal TOL transfer from Pseudomonas putida to Pseudomonas aeruginosa: effects  of restriction proficiency, toxicant exposure, cell density ratios, and conjugation detection method on observed transfer efficiencies.
AB  - The effects of restriction proficiency and premating exposure to toxicants on conjugal transfer of the TOL plasmid between Pseudomonas spp. was investigated by examinations of filter matings. A Pseudomonas putida KT2442-derived strain carrying a gfp-tagged variant of the TOL plasmid was used as a donor, and both restriction-deficient (PAO1162N) and -proficient (PAO2002N) Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were used as recipients. The in situ enumeration of conjugation events allowed us to obtain frequency estimates that were unbiased by transconjugant growth or plasmid retransfer. We observed a strong dependence of the plasmid transfer frequency on the initial donor-to-recipient ratio of surface matings, which invalidated the use of mass action-based plasmid transfer kinetic estimators. Careful control of the initial parental cell densities permitted evaluations of the true effects of restriction proficiency and toxicant exposure on TOL transfer. At standard donor-to-recipient ratios (10(-3) for PAO1162N and 2 x 10(1) for PAO2002N) and total cell densities (10(5) cells/mm(2) for PAO1162N and 10(6) cells/mm(2) for PAO2002N), plasmid transfer frequencies without toxicant exposure were approximately 10(-7) (events/mm(2))(-1) for PAO1162N and 10(-11) (events/mm(2))(-1) for PAO2002N based on in situ observations of conjugation events. The enumeration of transconjugants via selective plating yielded transfer frequencies that were up to 1 order of magnitude lower. Premating exposure to sodium dodecyl sulfate (1 to 10 mM) significantly increased the transfer frequency for the restriction-proficient strain PAO2002N (P < 0.05) but not for the restriction-deficient strain PAO1162N. On the other hand, premating exposure to ethanol, toluene, or phenol had no positive effect on the plasmid transfer frequency. Clearly, restriction proficiency provides a strong barrier to interspecific transfer of the TOL plasmid, and this barrier was only marginally attenuated by recipient exposure to toxicants within the ranges examined.
TI  - Lineage-specific regions in Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000.
AB  - SUMMARY Comparative analyses of the chromosome of Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato  DC3000 with the finished, complete genomes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, an animal pathogen, and the non-pathogenic soil inhabitant Pseudomonas putida KT2440 revealed a high degree of sequence conservation in genes involved in 'housekeeping functions'. However, divergence is present among these three fluorescent pseudomonads, yielding 'suites' of species-specific genes that may provide the genetic basis for adaptation to an ecological niche and lifestyle. For DC3000, 1053 genes located on the chromosome were specific to DC3000 and not present in PAO1 or KT2440. The majority of these DC3000-specific genes either lack a known function or are mobile genetic elements. However, these genes do share features among themselves such as association with regions of atypical trinucleotides, unusual G+C content and localization within large tracts of DC3000-specific sequence, suggestive of lateral gene transfer events. Indeed, a comparison of syntenic blocks among these three complete Pseudomonas genomes revealed that a substantial portion (533) of the DC3000-specific chromosomal genes (1053) were located in lineage-specific regions (defined as being larger than 2 kb and enriched in mobile genetic elements and/or genes specific to DC3000 in this three-way comparison). A large proportion of mobile genetic elements (199 of 318 genes; 63%), which are highly enriched in DC3000, were present within such regions. Similarly, most of the genes encoding type III secretion system virulence effectors were located in lineage-specific regions. Consistent with the plasticity of the DC3000 genome, a putative chromosomal inversion mediated by identical copies of ISPsy6 involving 2838 kb (44%) of the DC3000 genome was detected. These data suggest that a substantial portion of the differentiation of DC3000, a plant pathogen, from an animal pathogen and a soil inhabitant has involved transfer of a large number of novel genes coupled with amplification of mobile genetic elements.
TI  - Clonal relatedness and conserved integron structures in epidemiologically unrelated Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains producing the VIM-1 metallo-{beta}-lactamase from different Italian hospitals.
AB  - Three epidemiologically independent Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, representative of the first VIM-1 metallo-beta-lactamase producers detected at three different hospitals in northern Italy, were investigated to determine their genomic relatedness and to compare the structures of the genetic supports for the VIM-1 determinants. The three isolates, all of serotype O11, appeared to be clonally related according to the results of genotyping by macrorestriction analysis of genomic DNA by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and random amplification of polymorphic DNA. Investigation of the genetic support for the bla(VIM-1) determinant revealed that it was carried on identical or almost identical integrons (named In70.2 and In70.3) located within a conserved genomic context. The integrons were structurally related to In70 and In110, two plasmid-borne bla(VIM-1)-containing integrons from Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas putida isolates, respectively, from the same geographic area (northern Italy) and were found to be inserted close to the res site of a Tn5051-like transposon, different from any of those described previously, that was apparently carried on the bacterial chromosome. The present findings suggest that the three VIM-1-producing isolates are members of the same clonal complex which have been spreading in hospitals in northern Italy since the late 1990s and point to a common ancestry of their bla(VIM-1)-containing integrons.
TI  - Clinical experiences of bacteremia caused by metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative organisms.
AB  - The emergence of acquired metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) in gram-negative bacilli is regarded as a therapeutic challenge since such enzymes are capable of hydrolyzing all beta-lactams in vitro except the monobactams. The clinical characteristics and outcome of 8 episodes of gram-negative bacteremia caused by MBL-producing isolates from January 1997 through December 2000 (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 6 isolates; Pseudomonas stutzeri, 4; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1; and Pseudomonas putida, 1) were analyzed. The median age of the patients was 61 years (range, 2-95 years). Most patients (n = 6, 75%) had more than 1 comorbid illness or condition and 6 patients acquired bacteremia in the intensive care unit. The median time from admission to the first positive culture was 34.5 days (range, 1-99 days). Pneumonia was the most common site of infection. Five patients (62.5%) received a carbapenem to treat bacteremia. The median time to defervescence was 6 days (range, 2-12 days). No bacteriologic failure was noted during or after antimicrobial therapy. The overall mortality rate from bacteremia caused by gram-negative, MBL-producing organisms was nil at 14 or 28 days.
TI  - Evidence for past integration of IncP-1 plasmids into bacterial chromosomes.
AB  - Plasmids of the IncP-1 incompatibility group are self-transmissible between and stably maintained in a very broad range of Gram-negative bacteria. A characteristic feature of IncP-1 genomes is the existence of multiple binding sites (OB) for the KorB protein which plays a dual role in active partitioning of plasmid and coordinate regulation of expression of genes for replication, maintenance and transfer. A search of the available bacterial genome sequences revealed a significant number (70 out of 322) with one or more putative KorB binding sites. Binding of KorB to such a site was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) for Pseudomonas putida KT2440. While such a site may arise by chance, this is unlikely for Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 whose genome sequence contains four clustered OB sites and several regions have more than 80% nucleotide identity to traJ, trbJ and trbL of IncP-1 plasmids. A number of other bacterial genomes also contain integrated partial IncP-1 genomes or their remnants. These data provide evidence for multiple past integration events of IncP-1 plasmids into bacterial chromosomes and provide new evidence for IncP-1 plasmids being important elements in gene mobility.
TI  - Pore size dependence on growth temperature is a common characteristic of the major outer membrane protein OprF in psychrotrophic and mesophilic Pseudomonas species.
AB  - Pseudomonas species adapt well to hostile environments, which are often subjected to rapid variations. In these bacteria, the outer membrane plays an important role in the sensing of environmental conditions such as temperature. In previous studies, it has been shown that in the psychrotrophic strain P. fluorescens MF0, the major porin OprF changes its channel size according to the growth conditions and could affect outer membrane permeability. Studies of the channel-forming properties of OprFs from P. putida 01G3 and P. aeruginosa PAO1 in planar lipid bilayers generated similar results. The presence of a cysteine- or proline-rich cluster in the central linker region is not essential for channel size modulations. These findings suggest that OprF could adopt two alternative conformations in the outer membrane and that folding is thermoregulated. In contrast, no difference according to growth temperature was observed for structurally different outer membrane proteins, such as OprE3 from the Pseudomonas OprD family of specific porins. Our results are consistent with the fact that the decrease in channel size observed at low growth temperature is a particular feature of the OprF porin in various psychrotrophic and mesophilic Pseudomonas species isolated from diverse ecological niches. The ability to reduce outer membrane permeability at low growth temperature could provide these bacteria with adaptive advantages.
TI  - Unique features revealed by the genome sequence of Acinetobacter sp. ADP1, a versatile and naturally transformation competent bacterium.
AB  - Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1 is a nutritionally versatile soil bacterium closely related to representatives of the well-characterized Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. Unlike these bacteria, the Acinetobacter ADP1 is highly competent for natural transformation which affords extraordinary convenience for genetic manipulation. The circular chromosome of the Acinetobacter ADP1, presented here, encodes 3325 predicted coding sequences, of which 60% have been classified based on sequence similarity to other documented proteins. The close evolutionary proximity of Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas species, as judged by the sequences of their 16S RNA genes and by the highest level of bidirectional best hits, contrasts with the extensive divergence in the GC content of their DNA (40 versus 62%). The chromosomes also differ significantly in size, with the Acinetobacter ADP1 chromosome <60% of the length of the Pseudomonas counterparts. Genome analysis of the Acinetobacter ADP1 revealed genes for metabolic pathways involved in utilization of a large variety of compounds. Almost all of these genes, with orthologs that are scattered in other species, are located in five major 'islands of catabolic diversity', now an apparent 'archipelago of catabolic diversity', within one-quarter of the overall genome. Acinetobacter ADP1 displays many features of other aerobic soil bacteria with metabolism oriented toward the degradation of organic compounds found in their natural habitat. A distinguishing feature of this genome is the absence of a gene corresponding to pyruvate kinase, the enzyme that generally catalyzes the terminal step in conversion of carbohydrates to pyruvate for respiration by the citric acid cycle. This finding supports the view that the cycle itself is centrally geared to the catabolic capabilities of this exceptionally versatile organism.
TI  - MorA defines a new class of regulators affecting flagellar development and biofilm formation in diverse Pseudomonas species.
AB  - Assembly of bacterial flagella is developmentally important during both planktonic cell growth and biofilm formation. Flagellar biogenesis is complex, requiring coordinated expression of over 40 genes, and normally commences during the log-to-stationary transition phase. We describe here a novel membrane-localized regulator, MorA, that controls the timing of flagellar development and affects motility, chemotaxis, and biofilm formation in Pseudomonas putida. MorA is conserved among diverse Pseudomonas species, and homologues are present in all Pseudomonas genomes sequenced thus far. In P. putida, the absence of MorA derepresses flagellar development, which leads to constitutive formation of flagella in the mutant cells in all growth phases. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the absence of MorA led to a reduction in biofilm formation. However, unlike the motility of P. putida, the motility of the P. aeruginosa mutants was unaffected. Our data illustrate a novel developmentally regulated sensory and signaling pathway for several properties required for virulence and ecological fitness of Pseudomonas species.
TI  - Use of heterotrophic CO2 assimilation as a measure of metabolic activity in planktonic and sessile bacteria.
AB  - We have examined whether assimilation of CO2 can be used as a measure of metabolic activity in planktonic and sessile heterotrophic bacteria. CO2 assimilation by environmental samples and pure cultures of heterotrophic bacteria was studied using 14CO2 and 13CO2 as tracers. Heterotrophic growth on complex organic substrates resulted in assimilation of CO2 into cell biomass by activated sludge, drinking water biofilm, and pure cultures of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Es. coli ATCC 13706, Rhodococcus ruber, Burkholderia sp., Bacillus circulans, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas stutzeri, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Analysis of 13C-labelled phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) confirmed that heterotrophic bacteria may assimilate 13CO2 into cell macromolecules such as membrane lipids. All major PLFAs extracted from activated sludge and drinking water biofilm samples were enriched in 13C after incubation with CO2. Between 1.4% and 6.5% of the biomass produced by cultures of P. putida and a drinking water biofilm during growth in complex media was apparently derived from assimilation of CO2. Resting cells assimilated less CO2 compared to actively growing cells, and CO2 assimilation activity correlated with the amount of biomass produced during heterotrophic growth. The 14CO2 assimilation assay was evaluated as a tool to examine inhibitory effects of biocides on planktonic and sessile heterotrophs (biofilms). On the basis of 14CO2 assimilation activity, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of benzalkonium chloride was estimated to 21.1 and 127.2 mg l(-1) for planktonic and biofilm samples, respectively. The results indicate that assimilation of isotopically labelled CO2 can be used as a relatively simple measure of metabolic activity in heterotrophic bacteria. CO2 assimilation assays may be used to study the effects of antimicrobial agents on growth and survival of planktonic and sessile heterotrophic organisms.
TI  - ParB of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: interactions with its partner ParA and its target parS and specific effects on bacterial growth.
AB  - The par genes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been studied to increase the understanding of their mechanism of action and role in the bacterial cell. Key properties of the ParB protein have been identified and are associated with different parts of the protein. The ParB- ParB interaction domain was mapped in vivo and in vitro to the C-terminal 56 amino acids (aa); 7 aa at the C terminus play an important role. The dimerization domain of P. aeruginosa ParB is interchangeable with the dimerization domain of KorB from plasmid RK2 (IncP1 group). The C-terminal part of ParB is also involved in ParB-ParA interactions. Purified ParB binds specifically to DNA containing a putative parS sequence based on the consensus sequence found in the chromosomes of Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas putida, and Streptomyces coelicolor. The overproduction of ParB was shown to inhibit the function of genes placed near parS. This "silencing" was dependent on the parS sequence and its orientation. The overproduction of P. aeruginosa ParB or its N-terminal part also causes inhibition of the growth of P. aeruginosa and P. putida but not Escherichia coli cells. Since this inhibitory determinant is located well away from ParB segments required for dimerization or interaction with the ParA counterpart, this result may suggest a role for the N terminus of P. aeruginosa ParB in interactions with host cell components.
TI  - Regulation of the N-acyl homoserine lactone-dependent quorum-sensing system in rhizosphere Pseudomonas putida WCS358 and cross-talk with the stationary-phase RpoS sigma factor and the global regulator GacA.
AB  - Quorum sensing is a cell population-density dependent regulatory system which in  gram-negative bacteria often involves the production and detection of N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs). Some Pseudomonas putida strains have been reported to produce AHLs, and one quorum-sensing locus has been identified. However, it appears that the majority of strains do not produce AHLs. In this study we report the identification and regulation of the AHL-dependent system of rhizosphere P. putida WCS358. This system is identical to the recently identified system of P. putida strain IsoF and very similar to the las system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is composed of three genes, the luxI family member ppuI, the putative repressor rsaL, and the luxR family member ppuR. A genomic ppuR::Tn5 mutant of strain WCS358 was identified by its inability to produce AHLs when it was cross-streaked in close proximity to an AHL biosensor, whereas an rsaL::Tn5 genomic mutant was identified by its ability to overproduce AHL molecules. Using transcriptional promoter fusions, we studied expression profiles of the rsaL, ppuI, and ppuR promoters in various genetic backgrounds. At the onset of the stationary phase, the autoinducer synthase ppuI gene expression is under positive regulation by PpuR-AHL and under negative regulation by RsaL, indicating that the molecules could be in competition for binding at the ppuI promoter. In genomic rsaL::Tn5 mutants ppuI expression and production of AHL levels increased dramatically; however, both processes were still under growth phase regulation, indicating that RsaL is not involved in repressing AHL production at low cell densities. The roles of the global response regulator GacA and the stationary-phase sigma factor RpoS in the regulation of the AHL system at the onset of the stationary phase were also investigated. The P. putida WCS358 gacA gene was cloned and inactivated in the genome. It was determined that the three global regulatory systems are closely linked, with quorum sensing and RpoS regulating each other and GacA positively regulating ppuI expression. Studies of the regulation of AHL quorum-sensing systems have lagged behind other studies and are important for understanding how these systems are integrated into the overall growth phase and metabolic status of the cells.
TI  - Quorum-sensing antagonist (5Z)-4-bromo-5-(bromomethylene)-3-butyl-2(5H)-furanone  influences siderophore biosynthesis in Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Siderophore synthesis of Pseudomonas putida F1 was found to be regulated by quorum sensing since normalized siderophore production (per cell) increased 4.2-fold with cell density after the cells entered middle exponential phase; similarly, normalized siderophore concentrations in Pseudomonas aeruginosa JB2 increased 28-fold, and a 5.5-fold increase was seen for P. aeruginosa PAO1. Further evidence of the link between quorum sensing and siderophore synthesis of P. putida F1 was that the quorum-sensing-disrupter (5Z)-4-bromo-5-(bromomethylene)-3-butyl-2(5H)-furanone (furanone) from the marine red alga Delisea pulchra was found to inhibit the formation of the siderophore produced by P. putida F1 in a concentration-dependent manner, with 57% siderophore synthesis repressed by 100 microg/ml furanone. In contrast, this furanone did not affect the siderophore synthesis of Burkholderia cepacia G4 at 20-40 microg/ml, and stimulated siderophore synthesis of P. aeruginosa JB2 2.5- to 3.7-fold at 20-100 microg/ml. Similarly, 100 microg/ml furanone stimulated siderophore synthesis in P. aeruginosa PAO1 about 3.5-fold. The furanone appears to interact with the quorum-sensing machinery of P. aeruginosa PAO1 since it stimulates less siderophore synthesis in the P. aeruginosa qscR quorum-sensing mutant (QscR is a negative regulator of LasI, an acylated homoserine lactone synthase).
TI  - Distinct classes of glyoxalase I: metal specificity of the Yersinia pestis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Neisseria meningitidis enzymes.
AB  - The metalloisomerase glyoxalase I (GlxI) catalyses the conversion of methylglyoxal-glutathione hemithioacetal and related derivatives into the corresponding thioesters. In contrast with the previously characterized GlxI enzymes of Homo sapiens, Pseudomonas putida and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we recently determined that Escherichia coli GlxI surprisingly did not display Zn2+-activation, but instead exhibited maximal activity with Ni2+. To investigate whether non-Zn2+ activation defines a distinct, previously undocumented class of GlxI enzymes, or whether the E. coli GlxI is an exception to the previously established Zn2+-activated GlxI, we have cloned and characterized the bacterial GlxI from Yersinia pestis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Neisseria meningitidis. The metal-activation profiles for these additional GlxIs firmly establish the existence of a non-Zn2+-dependent grouping within the general category of GlxI enzymes. This second, established class of metal activation was formerly unidentified for this metalloenzyme. Amino acid sequence comparisons indicate a more extended peptide chain in the Zn2+-dependent forms of GlxI (H. sapiens, P. putida and S. cerevisiae), compared with the GlxI enzymes of E. coli, Y. pestis, P. aeruginosa and N. meningitidis. The longer sequence is due in part to the presence of additional regions situated fairly close to the metal ligands in the Zn2+-dependent forms of the lyase. With respect to sequence alignments, these inserts may potentially contribute to defining the metal specificity of GlxI at a structural level.
TI  - Regulation of polyhydroxyalkanoate biosynthesis in Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Regulation of medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate biosynthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida was studied conducting PHA accumulation experiments and transcriptional analysis of PHA biosynthesis genes with wild type strains and rpoN-negative mutants. In P. putida PHA accumulation was RpoN-independent, whereas in P. aeruginosa PHA accumulation was RpoN-dependent. Transcriptional analysis applying reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed strong induction of phaG, encoding the transacylase, under nitrogen starvation in P. putida KT2440 and the respective rpoN-negative mutant, indicating an RpoN-independent regulation of phaG. No transcription of phaG and no PHA accumulation was detected in the rpoN-negative mutant of P. aeruginosa neither from gluconate nor from octanoate as carbon source. Alginate-overproducing mutant P. aeruginosa FRD1 showed strongly decreased PHA accumulation from gluconate but no difference in phaC1 (encoding the PHA synthase) transcription, indicating that alginate biosynthesis competes with PHA biosynthesis regarding acetyl-CoA as precursor for both biopolymers. Transcription of phaF and phaI-F was nitrogen independent.
TI  - Genomic diversity of Burkholderia pseudomallei clinical isolates: subtractive hybridization reveals a Burkholderia mallei-specific prophage in B. pseudomallei 1026b.
AB  - Burkholderia pseudomallei is the etiologic agent of the disease melioidosis and is a category B biological threat agent. The genomic sequence of B. pseudomallei K96243 was recently determined, but little is known about the overall genetic diversity of this species. Suppression subtractive hybridization was employed to assess the genetic variability between two distinct clinical isolates of B. pseudomallei, 1026b and K96243. Numerous mobile genetic elements, including a temperate bacteriophage designated phi1026b, were identified among the 1026b-specific suppression subtractive hybridization products. Bacteriophage phi1026b was spontaneously produced by 1026b, and it had a restricted host range, infecting only Burkholderia mallei. It possessed a noncontractile tail, an isometric head, and a linear 54,865-bp genome. The mosaic nature of the phi1026b genome was revealed by comparison with bacteriophage phiE125, a B. mallei-specific bacteriophage produced by Burkholderia thailandensis. The phi1026b genes for DNA packaging, tail morphogenesis, host lysis, integration, and DNA replication were nearly identical to the corresponding genes in phiE125. On the other hand, phi1026b genes involved in head morphogenesis were similar to head morphogenesis genes encoded by Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophages. Consistent with this observation, immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated that polyclonal antiserum against phiE125 reacted with the tail of phi1026b but not with the head. The results presented here suggest that B. pseudomallei strains are genetically heterogeneous and that bacteriophages are major contributors to the genomic diversity of this species. The bacteriophage characterized in this study may be a useful diagnostic tool for differentiating B. pseudomallei and B. mallei, two closely related biological threat agents.
TI  - The arginine regulatory protein mediates repression by arginine of the operons encoding glutamate synthase and anabolic glutamate dehydrogenase in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The arginine regulatory protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ArgR, is essential for induction of operons that encode enzymes of the arginine succinyltransferase (AST) pathway, which is the primary route for arginine utilization by this organism under aerobic conditions. ArgR also induces the operon that encodes a catabolic NAD(+)-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), which converts l-glutamate, the product of the AST pathway, in alpha-ketoglutarate. The studies reported here show that ArgR also participates in the regulation of other enzymes of glutamate metabolism. Exogenous arginine repressed the specific activities of glutamate synthase (GltBD) and anabolic NADP-dependent GDH (GdhA) in cell extracts of strain PAO1, and this repression was abolished in an argR mutant. The promoter regions of the gltBD operon, which encodes GltBD, and the gdhA gene, which encodes GdhA, were identified by primer extension experiments. Measurements of beta-galactosidase expression from gltB::lacZ and gdhA::lacZ translational fusions confirmed the role of ArgR in mediating arginine repression. Gel retardation assays demonstrated the binding of homogeneous ArgR to DNA fragments carrying the regulatory regions for the gltBD and gdhA genes. DNase I footprinting experiments showed that ArgR protects DNA sequences in the control regions for these genes that are homologous to the consensus sequence of the ArgR binding site. In silica analysis of genomic information for P. fluorescens, P. putida, and P. stutzeri suggests that the findings reported here regarding ArgR regulation of operons that encode enzymes of glutamate biosynthesis in P. aeruginosa likely apply to other pseudomonads.
TI  - Evolution of function in the crotonase superfamily: (3S)-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Members of the enoyl-CoA hydratase (crotonase) superfamily catalyze different overall reactions that utilize a common catalytic strategy delivered by a shared structural scaffold; the substrates are usually acyl esters of coenzyme A, and the intermediates are usually thioester enolate anions stabilized by a conserved oxyanion hole. In many bacterial genomes, orthologous members that contain homologues of acid/base catalyst Glu164 but not of Glu144 in rat mitochondrial crotonase are encoded by operons of which the functions have not been assigned. Focusing on the orthologues from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. putida, we have determined that these operons encode enzymes in leucine catabolism with the unknown enzyme assigned as (3S)-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase (MGCH), which catalyzes the syn-hydration of (E)-3-methylglutaconyl-CoA to (3S)-hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA. The discovery that bacterial MGCHs catalyze hydration of enoyl-CoAs utilizing a single active-site residue contrasts with the paradigm crotonases as well as with the recently identified mammalian MGCHs that use homologues of both Glu144 and Glu164 in crotonase. Substrate analogues lacking a gamma-carboxylate have been shown to be competitive inhibitors of the enzyme, and installation of a glutamate for the "missing" homologue of Glu144 fails to introduce hydratase activity with the substrate analogues. Thus, bacterial MGCHs may provide an example of opportunistic evolution in which a carboxylate group of the substrate functionally replaces one of the active site glutamate residues in the reactions catalyzed by crotonases and the eukaryotic MGCHs.
TI  - A novel R-stereoselective amidase from Pseudomonas sp. MCI3434 acting on piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide.
AB  - A novel amidase acting on (R,S)-piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide was purified from Pseudomonas sp. MCI3434 and characterized. The enzyme acted R-stereoselectively on (R,S)-piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide to yield (R)-piperazine-2-carboxylic acid, and was tentatively named R-amidase. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme showed high sequence identity with that deduced from a gene named PA3598 encoding a hypothetical hydrolase in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. The gene encoding R-amidase was cloned from the genomic DNA of Pseudomonas sp. MCI3434 and sequenced. Analysis of 1332 bp of the genomic DNA revealed the presence of one open reading frame (ramA) which encodes the R-amidase. This enzyme, RamA, is composed of 274 amino acid residues (molecular mass, 30 128 Da), and the deduced amino acid sequence exhibits homology to a carbon-nitrogen hydrolase protein (PP3846) from Pseudomonas putida strain KT2440 (72.6% identity) and PA3598 protein from P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 (65.6% identity) and may be classified into a new subfamily in the carbon-nitrogen hydrolase family consisting of aliphatic amidase, beta-ureidopropionase, carbamylase, nitrilase, and so on. The amount of R-amidase in the supernatant of the sonicated cell-free extract of an Escherichia coli transformant overexpressing the ramA gene was about 30 000 times higher than that of Pseudomonas sp. MCI3434. The intact cells of the E. coli transformant could be used for the R-stereoselective hydrolysis of racemic piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide. The recombinant enzyme was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from cell-free extract of the E. coli transformant overexpressing the ramA gene. On gel-filtration chromatography, the enzyme appeared to be a monomer. It had maximal activity at 45 degrees C and pH 8.0, and was completely inactivated in the presence of p-chloromercuribenzoate, N-ethylmaleimide, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Ag+, Cd2+, Hg2+, or Pb2+. RamA had hydrolyzing activity toward the carboxamide compounds, in which amino or imino group is connected to beta- or gamma-carbon, such as beta-alaninamide, (R)-piperazine-2-carboxamide (R)-piperidine-3-carboxamide, D-glutaminamide and (R)-piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide. The enzyme, however, did not act on the other amide substrates for the aliphatic amidase despite its sequence similarity to RamA.
TI  - Identification of a novel steroid inducible gene associated with the beta hsd locus of Comamonas testosteroni.
AB  - Comamonas testosteroni is a soil bacterium, which can use a variety of steroids as carbon and energy source. Even if it can be estimated that the complete degradation of the steroid nucleus requires more than 20 enzymatic reactions, the complete molecular characterization of the genes encoding these steroid degradative enzymes as well as the genetic organization of them remain to be elucidated. We have previously reported the cloning and nucleotide sequence of two steroid-inducible genes, beta hsd and stdC encoding 3 beta-17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and a hypothetical protein respectively, located in both ends of a 3.2kb HindIII fragment. Herein, we report the cloning and characterization of another steroid-inducible gene, called sip48 (steroid inducible protein), located between these two genes. The analysis of Sip48 amino acid sequence predicts a protein of 438 amino acids with a molecular mass of 48.5 kDa. This protein bears high homology with conserved hypothetical proteins of unknown function described in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas syringae, Pseudomonas putida, Burkholderia fungorum, Shewanella oneidensis, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Thauera aromatica. The predicted protein shows a typical structure of a leader peptide at its N-terminus. A 48.5 kDa protein encoded by the recombinant plasmid was detected by SDS-PAGE analysis of in vitro [35S]-methionine labeled polypeptides. Analysis of gene expression indicates that Sip48 is tightly controlled at the transcriptional level by several steroid compounds. In addition, transcriptional analysis of sip48 and beta hsd in a sip48 mutant strain, indicates that both genes are transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA. lacZ transcriptional fusions integrated into the chromosome of C. testosteroni demonstrate that a steroid-inducible promoter located upstream of sip48 regulates the expression of both genes.
TI  - Non-fermenters in human infections.
AB  - One thousand and one hundred thirty non-fermenting gram negative bacteria were isolated from various samples. Of these, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the commonest isolate (72.83%) followed by Acinetobacter anitratus (8.4%), Alcaligenes faecalis (7.6%), Acinetobacter lwoffi (4.4%), Pseudomonas flourescens (2.4%), Schwanella putrefaciens (1.6%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.6%), Pseudomonas putida (0.4%), Bravundimonas vesicularis (0.4%) and Flavobacterium meningosepticum (0.4%). Antibiotic sensitivity pattern showed multiple drug resistance pattern with majority of the isolates being resistance to two or more drugs.
TI  - The Pseudomonas putida Crc global regulator controls the expression of genes from several chromosomal catabolic pathways for aromatic compounds.
AB  - The Crc protein is involved in the repression of several catabolic pathways for the assimilation of some sugars, nitrogenated compounds, and hydrocarbons in Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa when other preferred carbon sources are present in the culture medium (catabolic repression). Crc appears to be a component of a signal transduction pathway modulating carbon metabolism in pseudomonads, although its mode of action is unknown. To better understand the role of Crc, the proteome profile of two otherwise isogenic P. putida strains containing either a wild-type or an inactivated crc allele was compared. The results showed that Crc is involved in the catabolic repression of the hpd and hmgA genes from the homogentisate pathway, one of the central catabolic pathways for aromatic compounds that is used to assimilate intermediates derived from the oxidation of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and several aromatic hydrocarbons. This led us to analyze whether Crc also regulates the expression of the other central catabolic pathways for aromatic compounds present in P. putida. It was found that genes required to assimilate benzoate through the catechol pathway (benA and catBCA) and 4-OH-benzoate through the protocatechuate pathway (pobA and pcaHG) are also negatively modulated by Crc. However, the pathway for phenylacetate appeared to be unaffected by Crc. These results expand the influence of Crc to pathways used to assimilate several aromatic compounds, which highlights its importance as a master regulator of carbon metabolism in P. putida.
TI  - Characterization of two alkane hydroxylase genes from the marine hydrocarbonoclastic bacterium Alcanivorax borkumensis.
AB  - The marine gamma-Proteobacterium Alcanivorax borkumensis is highly specialized in the assimilation of aliphatic hydrocarbons, and makes up a large part of the biomass in oil-polluted marine environments. In addition to the previously identified alkane hydroxylase AlkB1, a second alkane hydroxylase (AlkB2) showing 65% identity to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa AlkB2 alkane hydroxylase was identified. Unlike alkB1, alkB2 is not flanked by genes involved in alkane metabolism. Heterologous expression of the A. borkumensis AP1 alkB1 and alkB2 genes showed that they encode functional alkane hydroxylases with substrate ranges similar to those of their P. putida and P. aeruginosa homologues. The transcription initiation sites and levels of the alkB1, alkB2 and alkS mRNA transcripts were determined. Expression of both alkB1 and alkB2 was induced by alkanes, but transcripts corresponding to alkB1 were much more abundant than those of alkB2. An inverted repeat similar to the binding site for the P. putida GPo1 transcriptional activator AlkS was present upstream of the promoters for alkB1 and alkB2, although that of alkB2 was less well conserved, and only the transcriptional fusion of promoter PalkB1 to the reporter gene lacZ efficiently responded to n-octane. Contrary to what has been found for the P. putida GPo1 alkane degradation pathway, expression of the A. borkumensis AP1 alkS gene was not induced by alkanes, and an AlkS binding site was not present upstream of the promoter for alkS. This indicates that, in spite of the clear similarities, the A. borkumensis alk-genes are regulated by a strategy different from that of the P. putida GPo1 alk genes.
TI  - Bacterial community dynamics during biostimulation and bioaugmentation experiments aiming at chlorobenzene degradation in groundwater.
AB  - A set of microcosm experiments was performed to assess different bioremediation strategies, i.e., biostimulation and bioaugmentation, for groundwater contaminated with chlorobenzenes. The biodegradative potential was stimulated either by the supply of electron acceptors (air, (NO3-), to increase the activity of the indigenous bacterial community, or by the addition of aerobic chlorobenzene-degrading bacteria (Pseudomonas putida GJ31, Pseudomonas aeruginosa RHO1, Pseudomonas putida F1deltaCC). Experiments were performed with natural groundwater of the aquifer of Bitterfeld, which had been contaminated with 1,2-dichlorobenzene (1,2-DCB), 1,4-dichlorobenzene (1,4-DCB), and chlorobenzene (CB). The microcosms consisted of airtight glass bottles with 800 mL of natural groundwater and were incubated under in situ temperature (13 degrees C). Behavior of the introduced strains within the indigenous bacterial community was monitored by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with species-specific oligonucleotides. Dynamics of the indigenous community and the introduced strains within the microcosms were followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of 16S rDNA amplicons obtained from total DNA of the microbial community. An indigenous biodegradation potential under aerobic as well as anaerobic denitrifying conditions was observed accompanied by fast and specific changes in the natural bacterial community composition. Augmentation with P. aeruginosa RHO1 did not enhance bio-degradation. In contrast, both P. putida GJ31 as well as P. putida F1deltaCC were capable of growing in groundwater, even in the presence of the natural microbial community, and thereby stimulating chlorobenzene depletion. P. putida GJ31 disappeared when the xenobiotics were depleted and P. putida F1deltaCC persisted even in the absence of CB. Detailed statistical analyses revealed that community dynamics of the groundwater microbiota were highly reproducible but specific to the introduced strain, its inoculum size, and the imposed physicochemical conditions. These findings could contribute to the design of better in situ bioremediation strategies for contaminated groundwater.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. Changes in CZOP susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Serratia liquefaciens, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter Iwoffii, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Bacteroides fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas. CZOP preserved its antibacterial activity against M. (B.) catarrhalis (MIC90: 4 micrograms/mL) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against H. influenzae (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli was preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), and imipenem (IPM). The MIC90 of CZOP against K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/mL, respectively. The MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. aerogenes was preferable (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activities of CZOP against S. marcescens and S. liquefaciens were relatively potent (MIC90: 0.5 and 0.25 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of CPR, CFPM, and carumonam. CZOP preserved comparable antibacterial activity to CPR against C. freundii and C. koseri (MIC90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/mL). The MIC90 of CZOP against P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, and M. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/mL, respectively. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Providencia spp. was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. aeruginosa was the most potent (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) among the test agents and comparable to those CFPM, IPM, and MEPM. CZOP had low activity against P. fluorescens and P. putida (MIC90: 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against A. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR and CFPM (MIC90: 32 micrograms/mL) and against A. lwoffii was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). Most of the test agents including CZOP had low antibacterial activity against B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, and B. fragilis group. The MIC90 of CZOP against Prevotella/Porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/mL. Bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. In non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and CFPM, CAZ, CPR, or IPM was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. In conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. cloacae possible decreased, but against other Gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.
TI  - Expression of L-ornithine Ndelta-oxygenase (PvdA) in fluorescent Pseudomonas species: an immunochemical and in silico study.
AB  - Omega-amino acid monooxygenases (EC 1.14.13.-), catalysing the formation of hydroxamate precursors of microbial siderophores (e.g., pyoverdine), have so far eluded structural and biochemical characterisation. Here, the expression of recombinant L-ornithine-Ndelta-oxygenase (PvdA) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 is reported. A library of eight monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against PvdA has been generated. Two MAb families recognising the N- and C-terminal regions of PvdA were identified. The MAbs made it possible to demonstrate that 45-48 kDa PvdA homologues are expressed in response to iron limitation by different species and strains of fluorescent pseudomonads. Despite the different degrees in sequence similarity between P. aeruginosa PvdA and putative homologues from Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas syringae, Burkholderia cepacia, and Ralstonia solanacearum, in silico domain scanning predicts an impressive conservation of putative cofactor and substrate binding domains. The MAb library was also used to monitor PvdA expression during the transition of P. aeruginosa from iron-sufficient to iron-deficient growth.
TI  - Attachment to and biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces by Acinetobacter baumannii: involvement of a novel chaperone-usher pili assembly system.
AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii causes severe infections in compromised patients, survives on abiotic surfaces in hospital environments and colonizes different medical devices. In this study the analysis of the processes involved in surface attachment and biofilm formation by the prototype strain 19606 was initiated. This strain attaches to and forms biofilm structures on plastic and glass surfaces, particularly at the liquid-air interface of cultures incubated stagnantly. The cell aggregates, which contain cell stacks separated by water channels, formed under different culture conditions and were significantly enhanced under iron limitation. Electron and fluorescence microscopy showed that pili and exopolysaccharides are part of the cell aggregates formed by this strain. Electron microscopy of two insertion derivatives deficient in attachment and biofilm formation revealed the disappearance of pili-like structures and DNA sequencing analysis showed that the transposon insertions interrupted genes with the highest similarity to hypothetical genes found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Although the products of these genes, which have been named csuC and csuE, have no known functions, they are located within a polycistronic operon that includes four other genes, two of which encode proteins related to chaperones and ushers involved in pili assembly in other bacteria. Introduction of a copy of the csuE parental gene restored the adherence phenotype and the presence of pili on the cell surface of the csuE mutant, but not that of the csuC derivative. These results demonstrate that the expression of a chaperone-usher secretion system, some of whose components appear to be acquired from unrelated sources, is required for pili formation and the concomitant attachment to plastic surfaces and the ensuing formation of biofilms by A. baumannii cells.
TI  - PCR typing of genetic determinants for metallo-beta-lactamases and integrases carried by gram-negative bacteria isolated in Japan, with focus on the class 3 integron.
AB  - From January 2001 to December 2002, 587 strains of gram-negative bacterial isolates demonstrating resistance to ceftazidime and a combination of sulbactam and cefoperazone were subjected to a disk diffusion screening test using sodium mercaptoacetic acid; 431 strains (73.4%) appeared to produce metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL). Of these 431 strains, 357 were found by PCR to carry genes for IMP-1 type MBL (bla(IMP-1)), while only 7 and 67 strains carried the IMP-2 gene (bla(IMP-2)) and the VIM-2 gene (bla(VIM-2)), respectively. Neither VIM-1 nor SPM-1 type MBL genes were found among the strains tested. Of 431 strains, 427 carried the intI1 gene, and 4 strains carrying both the intI1 and intI3 genes were reidentified as Pseudomonas putida harboring bla(IMP-1). Of these four P. putida strains, three strains and one strain, respectively, were separately isolated from two hospitals located in the same prefecture, and the three strains showed very similar pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. Of 357 bla(IMP-1) carriers, 116, 53, 51, 47, and 30 strains were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Alcaligenes xylosoxidans, P. putida/fluorescens, Serratia marcescens, and Acinetobacter baumannii, respectively. Four strains carrying bla(IMP-2) were reidentified as P. putida. Sixty-three P. aeruginosa strains and four P. putida strains carried bla(VIM-2). Of 427 intI1-positive strains, 180, 53, 51, 47, and 35 were identified as P. aeruginosa, A. xylosoxidans, P. putida/fluorescens, S. marcescens, and A. baumannii, respectively. In the present study, it was confirmed that strains carrying bla(IMP-1) with a class 1 integron are the most prevalent type in Japan, although several intI3 carriers have also been identified sporadically in this country.
TI  - Proteome reference map of Pseudomonas putida strain KT2440 for genome expression  profiling: distinct responses of KT2440 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO1 to iron deprivation and a new form of superoxide dismutase.
AB  - The genome sequence of Pseudomonas putida strain KT2440, a nutritionally versatile, saprophytic and plant root-colonizing Gram-negative soil bacterium, was recently determined by K. E. Nelson et al. (2002, Environ Microbiol 4: 799-808). Here, we present a two-dimensional gel protein reference map of KT2440 cells grown in mineral salts medium with glucose as carbon source. Proteins were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis, in conjunction with an in-house database developed from the genome sequence of KT2440, and approximately 200 two-dimensional gel spots were assigned. The map was used to assess the genomic response of KT2440 to iron limitation stress and to compare this response with that of the closely related facultative human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO1. The synthesis of about 25 proteins was affected in both strains, including four prominent upregulated ferric uptake regulator (Fur) protein-dependent proteins, but there were also striking differences in their proteome responses, for example in the expression of superoxide dismutases (Sod), which may indicate important roles of iron-responsive functions in the adaptation of these two bacteria to different lifestyles. The Sod enzyme of KT2440 was shown to be a novel heterodimer of the SodA and SodB polypeptides.
TI  - Infrequent detection of acquired metallo-beta-lactamases among carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas isolates in a Greek hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the possible distribution of metallo-beta-lactamases among nosocomial Pseudomonas isolates in a Greek hospital with a recent high prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas isolates. METHODS: All carbapenem-resistant (imipenem- and/or meropenem-resistant) (MICs > 8 mg/L) Pseudomonas non-replicate isolates recovered from clinical infections in the Microbiology Laboratory of Saint Demetrios Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece, from April 1998 to November 2000 were studied for the presence of metallo-beta-lactamases. They were tested by a disk diffusion test, PCR analysis, and nucleotide sequencing. DNA fingerprints were obtained by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of XbaI-digested chromosomal DNA. RESULTS: In total, 24 carbapenem-resistant isolates (23 P. aeruginosa and one P. putida) were recovered. The serotypes observed among the P. aeruginosa isolates were, in order of decreasing frequency, O:11 (52%), O:3 and O:12 (17% each), and O:6 (13%). PFGE grouped 17 of the P. aeruginosa isolates into four clusters, each containing from two to seven isolates, while the remaining isolates exhibited unique genotypes. blaVIM-2 was detected in the P. putida isolate and a P. aeruginosa serotype O:3 isolate. The latter strain was genotypically distinct from other contemporaneous or older carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa Greek isolates. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that, although the prevalence of metallo-beta-lactamases is low, the integron-associated blaVIM genes can spread to P. aeruginosa serotypes that have not been previously associated with carbapenem resistance in our region, as well as to other pseudomonal species.
TI  - An unusual outbreak of infusion-related bacteremia in a gastrointestinal disease  ward.
AB  
TI  - Functional characterization of genes involved in alkane oxidation by Pseudomonas  aeruginosa.
AB  - Most clinical isolates identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa grow on long-chain n-alkanes, while environmental P. aeruginosa isolates often grow on medium- as well as long-chain n-alkanes. Heterologous expression showed that the two alkane hydroxylase homologs of P. aeruginosa PAO1 (AlkB1 and AlkB2) oxidize C(12)-C(16)n-alkanes, while two rubredoxin (RubA1 and RubA2) and a rubredoxin reductase (RubB) homologs can replace their P. putida GPo1 counterparts in n-octane oxidation. The two long-chain alkane hydroxylase genes are present in all environmental and clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa strains tested in this study.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. A total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabillis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobactor baumannii, Acinetobactor lwoffii, Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lwoffii throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in antibacterial activities of CZOP against B. cepacia, and H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the emhABC efflux system for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Pseudomonas fluorescens cLP6a.
AB  - The hydrocarbon-degrading environmental isolate Pseudomonas fluorescens LP6a possesses an active efflux mechanism for the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons phenanthrene, anthracene, and fluoranthene but not for naphthalene or toluene. PCR was used to detect efflux pump genes belonging to the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) superfamily in a plasmid-cured derivative, P. fluorescens cLP6a, which is unable to metabolize hydrocarbons. One RND pump, whose gene was identified in P. fluorescens cLP6a and was designated emhB, showed homology to the multidrug and solvent efflux pumps in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. The emhB gene is located in a gene cluster with the emhA and emhC genes, which encode the membrane fusion protein and outer membrane protein components of the efflux system, respectively. Disruption of emhB by insertion of an antibiotic resistance cassette demonstrated that the corresponding gene product was responsible for the efflux of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The emhB gene disruption did not affect the resistance of P. fluorescens cLP6a to tetracycline, erythromycin, trimethoprim, or streptomycin, but it did decrease resistance to chloramphenicol and nalidixic acid, indicating that the EmhABC system also functions in the efflux of these compounds and has an unusual selectivity. Phenanthrene efflux was observed in P. aeruginosa, P. putida, and Burkholderia cepacia but not in Azotobacter vinelandii. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons represent a new class of nontoxic, highly hydrophobic compounds that are substrates of RND efflux systems, and the EmhABC system in P. fluorescens cLP6a has a narrow substrate range for these hydrocarbons and certain antibiotics.
TI  - Presence of Pseudomonas putida strains harboring plasmids bearing the metallo-beta-lactamase gene bla(IMP) in a hospital in Japan.
AB  - To determine the persistence and spread of antibiotic-resistant strains in Gunma  University Hospital, 83 Pseudomonas putida strains (each from a different patient) were isolated from January 1997 through December 2001. Of the 83 strains isolated, 27 were resistant to carbapenems. All 27 produced metallo-beta-lactamase and were found to be PCR positive for the bla(IMP) gene. Most (22 strains) were primarily isolated from the wards (W7 [9 strains] and W4 [8 strains]). Another five bla(IMP)-positive P. putida strains from wards W7 and W4 were obtained by swabbing around the water pipes. A total of 32 bla(IMP)-positive P. putida strains were assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and testing of drug susceptibility to 10 chemotherapeutic agents. Both PFGE and MIC patterns revealed that there were long-term resident strains among inpatients and hospital environments. The bla(IMP) genes of 22 of 32 strains were all transferable to a recipient strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by conjugation or transformation and conferred resistance to carbapenems and cephems. The bla(IMP) plasmids were conjugally transmissible among P. aeruginosa strains and mediated resistance to amikacin as well as beta-lactams. Ten of the 22 plasmids mediated additional resistance to gentamicin and tobramycin. Plasmids with identical DNA and drug resistance patterns were found in P. putida strains with identical PFGE patterns and with different PFGE patterns. We presumed that P. putida was one of the resident species in inpatients and especially in hospital environments, spreading drug resistance genes via plasmids among P. putida strains and supplying them to more pathogenically important species, such as P. aeruginosa.
TI  - A specific region in the N terminus of a replication initiation protein of plasmid RK2 is required for recruitment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa DnaB helicase to the plasmid origin.
AB  - Broad host range plasmid RK2 encodes two versions of its essential replication initiation protein, TrfA, using in-frame translational starts spaced 97 amino acids apart. The smaller protein, TrfA-33, is sufficient for plasmid replication in many bacterial hosts. Efficient replication in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, specifically requires the larger TrfA-44 protein. With the aim of identifying sequences of TrfA-44 required for stable replication of RK2 in P. aeruginosa, specific deletions and a substitution mutant within the N terminus sequence unique to TrfA-44 were constructed, and the mutant proteins were tested for activity. Deletion mutants were targeted to three of the four predicted helical regions in the first 97 amino acids of TrfA-44. Deletion of TrfA-44 amino acids 21-32 yielded a mutant protein, TrfA-44Delta2, that had lost the ability to bind and load the DnaB helicase of P. aeruginosa or Pseudomonas putida onto the RK2 origin in vitro and did not support stable replication of an RK2 mini-replicon in P. aeruginosa in vivo. A substitution of amino acid 22 within this essential region resulted in a protein, TrfA-44E22A, with reduced activity in vitro, particularly with the P. putida helicase. Deletion of amino acids 37-55 (TrfA-44Delta3) slightly affected protein activity in vitro with the P. aeruginosa helicase and significantly with the P. putida helicase, whereas deletion of amino acids 71-88 (TrfA-44Delta4) had no effect on TrfA activity in vitro with either helicase. These results identify regions of the TrfA-44 protein that are required for recruitment of the Pseudomonas DnaB helicases in the initiation of RK2 replication.
TI  - Genetic characterization of a novel metallo-beta-lactamase gene, blaIMP-13, harboured by a novel Tn5051-type transposon disseminating carbapenemase genes in Europe: report from the SENTRY worldwide antimicrobial surveillance programme.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In 2001, as part of the SENTRY worldwide antimicrobial surveillance programme, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 86-14571A was isolated at a hospital in Rome from a cancer patient with a bloodstream infection. The isolate was resistant to all antibiotics except amikacin, and displayed an imipenem MIC of 64 mg/L that decreased to 8 mg/L in the presence of EDTA. The resistance determinant was investigated. METHODS: The resistant determinant was cloned in Escherichia coli using a shotgun cloning approach. RESULTS: Sequence analysis revealed the presence of a novel IMP-type metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) gene, blaIMP-13. This encoded a protein displaying most identity to IMP variants: 93% and 92.3% identity, respectively, to IMP-8 and IMP-2 (previously identified in Italy). The protein had 19 amino acid changes from IMP-2 and 17 amino acid changes from IMP-8. The blaIMP-13 gene was found as a gene cassette in the first position of a class 1 integron. A 25 bp inverted repeat sequence IRi was identified 174 bp upstream of the class I integrase, which suggests that the integron is found on a Tn402-like transposon, or defective transposon derivative. This element, in turn, is located in the transposition locus (tnp region) of a Tn21 subfamily transposon that showed most identity to Tn5051, a transposon recently identified from a strain of Pseudomonas putida isolated in New York. Interestingly, the insertion point of the Tn402-like transposon and the sequence of the Tn5051-like genes were identical to those of the genetic element harbouring blaVIM-2 recently identified in Poland. CONCLUSIONS: The resistance determinant of P. aeruginosa 86-14571A is a novel IMP-type MBL carried on a composite transposon responsible for wide geographical dissemination of MBL genes in Europe.
TI  - The complete genome sequence of the Arabidopsis and tomato pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000.
AB  - We report the complete genome sequence of the model bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato DC3000 (DC3000), which is pathogenic on tomato and Arabidopsis thaliana. The DC3000 genome (6.5 megabases) contains a circular chromosome and two plasmids, which collectively encode 5,763 ORFs. We identified 298 established and putative virulence genes, including several clusters of genes encoding 31 confirmed and 19 predicted type III secretion system effector proteins. Many of the virulence genes were members of paralogous families and also were proximal to mobile elements, which collectively comprise 7% of the DC3000 genome. The bacterium possesses a large repertoire of transporters for the acquisition of nutrients, particularly sugars, as well as genes implicated in attachment to plant surfaces. Over 12% of the genes are dedicated to regulation, which may reflect the need for rapid adaptation to the diverse environments encountered during epiphytic growth and pathogenesis. Comparative analyses confirmed a high degree of similarity with two sequenced pseudomonads, Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, yet revealed 1,159 genes unique to DC3000, of which 811 lack a known function.
TI  - A comparison of the bacteria found on the hands of 'homemakers' and neonatal intensive care unit nurses.
AB  - This prevalence study was conducted to compare the counts, types and antimicrobial resistance profiles of bacterial flora on the hands of individuals in the community to that of nurses at a nearby university teaching hospital, with an intense hand hygiene regimen. Hand cultures were obtained from 204 individuals during a home visit and 119 nurses in two neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). The mean total log counts of organisms were 5.73 and 5.24 for the homemakers [defined as the person (usually the mother) who is the primary person responsible for arranging childcare, cooking, cleaning etc] and nurse hands, respectively (P<0.0001). Significantly more homemakers had Acinetobacter lwoffii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens/putida, and Staphylococcus aureus on their hands compared with the nurses (all P<0.05). However, significantly more nurses had Enterococcus faecalis, S. epidermidis, and S. warneri on their hands (P<0.05). Of note, the hands of nurses harboured significantly more S. epidermidis strains resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and oxacillin and S. warneri resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, and oxacillin (P<0.05). Surprisingly, significantly more trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant S. epidermidis and ciprofloxacin-resistant S. warneri was recovered from the hands of homemakers (P<0.05). This study demonstrates differences in prevalence, bacterial composition and antimicrobial resistance of hand flora of hospital personnel compared with homemakers. Moreover, the hands of homemakers may serve as community reservoirs for antimicrobial resistant strains of clinical importance.
TI  - Efflux as a mechanism of resistance to antimicrobials in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and related bacteria: unanswered questions.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen exhibiting innate resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents. This intrinsic multidrug resistance is caused by synergy between a low-permeability outer membrane and expression of a number of broadly-specific multidrug efflux (Mex) systems, including MexAB-OprM and MexXY-OprM. In addition to this intrinsic resistance, these and three additional systems, MexCD-OprJ, MexEF-OprN and MexJK-OprM promote acquired multidrug resistance as a consequence of hyper-expression of the efflux genes by mutational events. In addition to antibiotics, these pumps export biocides, dyes, detergents, metabolic inhibitors, organic solvents and molecules involved in bacterial cell-cell communication. Homologues of the resistance-nodulation-division systems of P. aeruginosa have been found in Burkholderia cepacia, B. pseudomallei, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and the nonpathogen P. putida, where they play roles in resistance to antimicrobials and/or organic solvents. Despite intensive studies of these multidrug efflux systems over the past several years, their precise molecular architectures, their modes of regulation of expression and their natural functions remain largely unknown.
TI  - Development of a diagnostic PCR assay that targets a heat-shock protein gene (groES) for detection of Pseudomonas spp. in cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  - Laboratory detection of Pseudomonas spp., in particular Pseudomonas aeruginosa, remains an important assay in the management of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). As the groES and groEL genes of P. aeruginosa have now been cloned and their nucleotide sequences determined, the aim of this study was to develop a novel PCR assay for the detection of Pseudomonas spp. from patients with CF by employing conserved primer regions of the groE heat-shock protein domain gene. A PCR assay was designed that targeted a 536 bp region of the groE gene to detect Pseudomonas spp. PCR amplification of genomic DNA from extracted organisms generated an amplicon of the expected size (approx. 536 bp) for all P. aeruginosa (n = 60), Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas stutzeri isolates examined, but did not produce a positive amplicon for several other genera and species that are commonly isolated from the sputum of CF patients. RFLP analysis of the amplicons of all P. aeruginosa isolates demonstrated a single RFLP type that consisted of three bands at approximately 80, 190 and 250 bp; direct sequencing of the amplicons demonstrated the presence of a single sequence type, indicating the highly conserved nature of this region. In addition, the assay successfully produced a positive signal from primary non-selective plates of three known P. aeruginosa culture-positive CF patients, but was unable to generate a signal in a further six CF patients who had no history of infection with P. aeruginosa or other Pseudomonas spp. This assay is recommended to detect the presence of Pseudomonas spp., including P. aeruginosa, from primary culture plates that originate from laboratory analysis of CF patients' sputum, particularly at review, in those patients with no previous history of Pseudomonas infection or those who appear to be transiently colonized by this organism. Employment of such molecular methodologies, in conjunction with routine clinical sputum cultures, may provide improved information on the microbial status of CF patients, which will aid clinicians in both optimum patient management in terms of antibiotic regimes and CF centre infection-control practices.
TI  - Transition from reversible to irreversible attachment during biofilm formation by Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS365 requires an ABC transporter and a large secreted protein.
AB  - We report the identification of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter and an  associated large cell-surface protein that are required for biofilm formation by Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS365. The genes coding for these proteins are designated lap for large adhesion protein. The LapA protein, with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 900 kDa, is found to be loosely associated with the cell surface and present in the culture supernatant. The LapB, LapC and LapE proteins are predicted to be the cytoplasmic membrane-localized ATPase, membrane fusion protein and outer membrane protein component, respectively, of an ABC transporter. Consistent with this prediction, LapE, like other members of this family, is localized to the outer membrane. We propose that the lapEBC-encoded ABC transporter participates in the secretion of LapA, as strains with mutations in the lapEBC genes do not have detectable LapA associated with the cell surface or in the supernatant. The lap genes are conserved among environmental pseudomonads such as P. putida KT2440, P. fluorescens PfO1 and P. fluorescens WCS365, but are absent from pathogenic pseudomonads such as P. aeruginosa and P. syringae. The wild-type strain of P. fluorescens WCS365 and its lap mutant derivatives were assessed for their biofilm forming ability in static and flow systems. The lap mutant strains are impaired in an early step in biofilm formation and are unable to develop the mature biofilm structure seen for the wild-type bacterium. Time-lapse microscopy studies determined that the lap mutants are unable to progress from reversible (or transient) attachment to the irreversible attachment stage of biofilm development. The lap mutants were also found to be defective in attachment to quartz sand, an abiotic surface these organisms likely encounter in the environment.
TI  - Characterization and identification of genes essential for dimethyl sulfide utilization in Pseudomonas putida strain DS1.
AB  - Microbial dimethyl sulfide (DMS) conversion is thought to be involved in the global sulfur cycle. We isolated Pseudomonas putida strain DS1 from soil as a bacterium utilizing DMS as a sole sulfur source, and tried to elucidate the DMS conversion mechanism of strain DS1 at biochemical and genetic level. Strain DS1 oxidized DMS to dimethyl sulfone (DMSO(2)) via dimethyl sulfoxide, whereas the oxidation was repressed in the presence of sulfate, suggesting that a sulfate starvation response is involved in DMS utilization by strain DS1. Two of the five DMS-utilization-defective mutants isolated by transposon 5 (Tn 5) mutagenesis had a Tn 5 insertion in the ssuEADCBF operon, which has been reported to encode a two-component monooxygenase system (SsuED), an ABC-type transporter (SsuABC), and a small protein (SsuF), and also to play a key role in utilization of sulfonates and sulfate esters in another bacterium, P. putida strain S-313. Disruption of ssuD and SsuD enzymatic activity demonstrated that methanesulfonate is a metabolic intermediate of DMS and desulfonated by SsuD. Disruption of ssuC or ssuF also led to a DMS-utilization-defective phenotype. Another two mutants had a defect in a gene homologous to pa2354 from P. aeruginosa PAO1, which encodes a putative transcriptional regulator, while the remaining mutant had a defect in cysM encoding O-acetylserine (thiol)-lyase B.
TI  - A multifunctional plasmid-encoded replication initiation protein both recruits and positions an active helicase at the replication origin.
AB  - The DnaA replication initiation protein has been shown to be essential for DNA strand opening at the AT-rich region of the replication origin of the Escherichia coli chromosome as well as serving to recruit and position the DnaB replicative helicase at this open region. Homologues of the dnaA gene of E. coli have been found in most bacterial species, and the DnaA protein has been shown to be required for the initiation of replication of both chromosomal and plasmid DNA. For several plasmid elements it has been found that a plasmid-encoded initiation protein is required along with the DnaA protein to bring about opening of the AT-rich region at the replication origin. The broad host range plasmid RK2 encodes two forms of its replication initiation protein (TrfA-33 and TrfA-44) that differ by an additional 98 aa at the N terminus of the larger (TrfA-44) form. Both forms initiate replication of RK2 in E. coli in vitro by a DnaA-dependent mechanism. However, as shown in this study, TrfA-44 specifically interacts with the DnaB replicative helicase of Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and initiates the formation of a prepriming open complex in the absence of DnaA protein. Thus, the TrfA-44 initiation protein has the multifunctional properties of recruiting and positioning an active form of the DnaB helicase at the RK2 replication origin by a DnaA-independent process. This unique property for a replication initiation protein undoubtedly plays an important role in extending the host range of the RK2 antibiotic resistance plasmid.
TI  - Control of rpoS transcription in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas: why so different?
AB  - In Escherichia coli, the stationary phase alternative sigma factor sigmas controls the expression of genes involved cell survival in response to cessation of growth (stationary phase) and provides cross-protection to various stresses. Levels of sigmas increase dramatically at the onset of stationary phase and are regulated at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational level, making this one of the most complex regulatory systems in bacteria. The basic mechanisms for the control of translation and sigmas proteolysis have been understood. However, studies on the transcriptional control in E. coli lag behind and are controversial. The cAMP-CRP complex and the two component BarA/UvrY system have been implicated and, ppGpp and polyphosphate appear to have a signalling role. sigmas has also been reported to be a general stress regulator in the fluorescent pseudomonads (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens and P. putida) and recent studies on sigmas regulation highlight that transcriptional regulation in these bacteria apparently plays a major role. Global regulatory systems, the GacA/GacS two component system and quorum sensing all affect rpoS expression, as does the TetR family PsrA regulator that directly binds to- and activates the rpoS promoter in stationary phase. This striking difference in regulation between E. coli and Pseudomonas can be partly attributed to the differences in the functional role of sigmas in the two bacterial species. This report will review mainly recent studies on rpoS transcriptional regulation and will try to rationalize the current knowledge into a working model.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of the alkaline ceramidase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01.
AB  - Ceramidase (CDase) hydrolyzes the amide bond in ceramides to yield free fatty acid and sphingosine. From a 3-L Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 culture, 70 microg of extracellular alkaline, Ca(2+)-dependent CDase, was purified to homogeneity, the N-terminal sequence was determined, and the CDase gene was cloned. The CDase gene encodes a 670 amino acid protein with a 26 amino acid signal peptide. CDase was expressed in five prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems. Small amounts of recombinant active extracellular CDase were expressed by Pseudomonas putida KT2440. In Pichia pastoris GS115 low amounts of recombinant extracellular glycosylated CDase were expressed. High levels of intracellular CDase were expressed by Escherichia coli DH5alpha and E. coli BL21 cells under control of the lac-promoter and T7-promoter, respectively. From a 3-L E. coli DH5alpha culture, 280 microg of pure CDase was obtained after a three-step purification protocol. Under control of the T7-promotor CDase, without its signal peptide, was produced in inclusion bodies in E. coli BL21 cells. After refolding, 1.8 mg of pure active CDase was obtained from a 2.4-L culture after ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration. Both the recombinant and wild-type CDases have a pH optimum of 8.5. The recombinant enzyme was partially characterized. This is the first report of a high yield CDase production system allowing detailed characterization of the enzyme at the molecular level.
TI  - IMP-12, a new plasmid-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase from a Pseudomonas putida clinical isolate.
AB  - A Pseudomonas putida strain showing broad-spectrum resistance to beta-lactams, including expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenems, was isolated from a patient with a urinary tract infection at the University Hospital of Varese in northern Italy. The isolate was found to produce metallo-beta-lactamase activity and to harbor a 50-kb plasmid, named pVA758, carrying a new bla(IMP) determinant, named bla(IMP-12). Plasmid pVA758 was not self-transferable by conjugation to either Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa but could be introduced by electroporation and maintained in the latter host, where it conferred resistance or decreased susceptibility to various beta-lactams. The IMP-12 enzyme is quite divergent from other IMP variants: its closest relatives are IMP-8 and IMP-2 (89 and 88% sequence identity, respectively), and IMP-1 is 85% identical to IMP-12. The bla(IMP-12) determinant is carried on an integron-borne gene cassette whose attC recombination site is related to those present in cassettes containing bla(IMP-1), bla(IMP-6), bla(IMP-7), bla(IMP-10), and bla(IMP-11) and unrelated to that present in cassettes containing bla(IMP-2) and bla(IMP-8). IMP-12 was overproduced in E. coli by using a T7-based expression system and was purified by cation-exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration. Kinetic analysis revealed that, like other IMP variants, IMP-12 exhibits an overall preference for cephalosporins and carbapenems rather than for penicillins and does not hydrolyze temocillin and aztreonam. However, IMP-12 also exhibits some notable functional differences from other IMP variants, including uniformly poor activity toward penicillins (k(cat)/K(m) values, around 10(4) M(-1). s(-1)) and a remarkably high K(m) (around 900 micro M) for imipenem.
TI  - Fluorescent Pseudomonas mainly produce the dihydro form of pyoverdine at low specific growth rate.
AB  - AIMS: To analyse the influence of cell growth rate and iron concentration on the  production of pyoverdines (PVDs) and of their reduced dihydro forms by three fluorescent Pseudomonas strains (P. putida BTP16, P. fluorescens BTP7 and P. aeruginosa 7NSK2). METHODS: PVD and dihydropyoverdine (DHPVD) productions were determined by LC ESI-MS and spectrophotometry during batch and chemostat culture at different dilution rates. SIGNIFICANCE: The relatively high PVD-to-DHPVD ratio (0.57) observed in pH-controlled batch cultures suggested that a base-catalysed chemical oxidation of the dihydroform is not the prime mechanism involved in generating PVDs. Interestingly, in chemostat cultures the PVD-to-DHPVD ratio was significantly reduced at low specific growth rate. Our results suggest that the oxidation of DHPVD to PVD is catalysed by an iron-dependent enzymatic reaction rather than a chemical oxidation.
TI  - First-order kinetics analysis of monomer composition dependent polyhydroxyalkanoic acid degradation in Pseudomonas spp.
AB  - The intracellular degradation of polyhydroxyalkanoic acid (PHA) in pseudomonads was investigated by first-order kinetics analysis using the initial rate method. One type of PHA was accumulated in five Pseudomonas spp., P. oleovorans, P. aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, P. citronellolis, and P. putida, by growing them on octanoic acid. The monomer compositions of the five PHA were not significantly different from one another: 85-90 mol % 3-hydroxyoctanoic acid (3HO), 7-12 mol % 3-hydorxycaproic acid (3HC), and 3-6 mol % 3-hydroxydecanoic acid (3HD). The first-order degradation rate constants (k(1)) for the octanoate-derived PHA (designated P(3HO)) in the five species were in a similar range between 0.060 and 0.088 h(-1). This may indicate the similar specificities of the five intracellular depolymerases. In addition, the similar k(1) among the different species may correlate with the high degree of amino acid sequence identities (over 85%) among the intracellular PHA depolymerase phaZ genes. Six other chemically different types of PHA were accumulated in P. putida from n-nonanoic acid, n-decanoic acid, 5-phenyvaleric acid, or 11-phenoxyundecanoic acid as a single or a mixed carbon source. The calculated k(1) values were characteristic to each PHA, reflecting their chemical structures. In comparison with P(3HO), an increase in the levels of the two minor monomers 3HC and 3HD as in P(21 mol % 3HC-co-56 mol % 3HO-co-23 mol % 3HD) significantly slowed the rate of intracellular degradation. From the comparison of k(1) values, it is suggested that the P. putida intracellular depolymerase is most active against P(3HO).
TI  - Identification of a novel Gsp-related pathway required for secretion of the manganese-oxidizing factor of Pseudomonas putida strain GB-1.
AB  - The manganese-oxidizing factor of Pseudomonas putida strain GB-1 is associated with the outer membrane. One of the systems of protein transport across the outer membrane is the general secretory pathway (Gsp). The gsp genes are called xcp in Pseudomonas species. In a previous study, it was shown that mutation of the prepilin peptidase XcpA and of a homologue of the pseudopilin XcpT inhibited transport of the factor. In the present study, we describe the genomic region flanking the xcpT homologue (designated xcmT1). We show that xcmT1 is part of a two-gene operon that includes an xcpS homologue (designated xcmS). No other xcp-like genes are present in the regions flanking the xcmT1/xcmS cluster. We also characterized the site of transposon insertion of another transport mutant of P. putida GB-1. This insertion appeared to be located in a gene (designated xcmX) possibly encoding another pseudopilin-related protein. This xcmX is clustered with two other xcpT-related genes (designated xcmT2 and xcmT3) on one side and homologues of three csg genes (designated csmE, csmF and csmG) on the other side. The csg genes are involved in production of aggregative fibres in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. A search for XcmX homologues revealed that the recently published genome of Ralstonia solanacearum and the unannotated genome of P. putida KT2440 contain comparable gene clusters with xcmX and xcp homologues that are different from the well-described 'regular'xcp/gsp clusters. They do contain xcpR and xcpQ homologues but, for example, homologues of xcpP, Y and Z are lacking. The results suggest a novel Xcp-related system for the transport of manganese-oxidizing enzymes to the cell surface.
TI  - Pyoverdine-mediated regulation of FpvA synthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa: involvement of a probable extracytoplasmic-function sigma factor, FpvI.
AB  - A search of the pvd pyoverdine biosynthesis locus of Pseudomonas aeruginosa identified an open reading frame, PA2387, whose product exhibited a sequence similar to those of a number of so-called extracytoplasmic- function sigma factors responsible for siderophore-dependent expression of iron-siderophore receptors in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida. Deletion of this gene, dubbed fpvI, compromised pyoverdine-dependent FpvA ferric pyoverdine receptor production and fpvA gene expression, while the cloned gene stimulated fpvA expression. A Fur-binding site was identified immediately upstream of fpvI, consistent with the observed iron-regulated expression of fpvI and fpvA.
TI  - Detection of multiple extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors in the genome of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 and their counterparts in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is highly successful in colonizing a variety habitats,  including aquatic and edaphic niches. In accordance with this ability and with the need to adapt to changing environmental conditions, P. putida has developed sophisticated mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. We analysed, at the genome level, the repertoire of sigma factors in P. putida KT2440 and identified 24 sigma factors, 19 of which corresponded to the subfamily of extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors. We detected 13 ECF sigma factors that showed similarity to the Escherichia coli FecI sigma factor, which is involved in iron acquisition. In 11 cases, a fecR-like gene was found adjacent to the fecI-like gene and, in 10 cases, a gene encoding an iron receptor lies in the vicinity of the fecI/fecR cluster. This may explain the ability of P. putida KT2440 to grow under low iron availability conditions. Five fecI/fecR/iron receptor gene clusters from P. putida were also identified in the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - The genome structure of Pseudomonas putida: high-resolution mapping and microarray analysis.
AB  - As part of a collaborative project aimed at sequencing and functionally analysing the entire genome of Pseudomonas putida strain KT2440, a physical clone map was produced as an initial resource. To this end, a high-coverage cosmid library was arrayed and ordered by clone hybridizations. Restriction fragments generated by rare-cutting enzymes and plasmids containing the rrn operon and 23S rDNA of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used as probes and, parts of the cosmids were end-sequenced. This provided the information necessary for merging and comparing the macro-restriction map, cosmid clone order and sequence information, thereby assuring co-linearity of the eventual sequence assembly with the actual genome. A tiling path of clones was selected, from the shotgun clones used for sequencing, for the production of DNA microarrays that represent the entire genome including its non-coding portions.
TI  - Complete genome sequence and comparative analysis of the metabolically versatile  Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida is a metabolically versatile saprophytic soil bacterium that has been certified as a biosafety host for the cloning of foreign genes. The bacterium also has considerable potential for biotechnological applications. Sequence analysis of the 6.18 Mb genome of strain KT2440 reveals diverse transport and metabolic systems. Although there is a high level of genome conservation with the pathogenic Pseudomonad Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85% of the predicted coding regions are shared), key virulence factors including exotoxin A and type III secretion systems are absent. Analysis of the genome gives insight into the non-pathogenic nature of P. putida and points to potential new applications in agriculture, biocatalysis, bioremediation and bioplastic production.
TI  - Evaluation of MicroScan Autoscan for identification of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  - Accurate identification of gram-negative bacilli from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is essential. Only 57% (108 of 189) of nonmucoid strains and 40% (24 of 60) of mucoid strains were definitively identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa with MicroScan Autoscan. Most common misidentifications were Pseudomonas fluorescens-Pseudomonas putida (i.e., the strain was either P. fluorescens or P. putida, but the system did not make the distinction and yielded the result P. fluorescens/putida) and Alcaligenes spp. Extending the incubation to 48 h improved identification, but 15% of isolates remained misidentified. The MicroScan Autoscan system cannot be recommended for the identification of P. aeruginosa isolates from CF patients.
TI  - Molecular analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa protease IV expressed in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - PURPOSE: In this study, the protease IV gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was expressed in the nonocular pathogenic host, Pseudomonas putida, to elucidate the molecular properties and virulence contribution of the enzyme. Recent determination of the protease IV gene sequence suggests that the protein of 463 amino acids contains a signal sequence, a propeptide domain, and a mature protease. The only form of this protein that has been detected previously is the extracellular mature protease. METHODS: The protease IV gene was cloned and expressed in a protease IV-negative Pseudomonas species, P. putida. The cloned protease IV gene product was analyzed to identify biochemical, enzymatic, and immunologic properties and its contribution to corneal virulence. RESULTS: P. putida expressing the cloned protease IV gene had significantly greater extracellular enzyme activity than P. aeruginosa. These P. putida cell extracts produced a protein with the same molecular mass as mature protease IV and two other polypeptides representing larger precursors, all of which were recognized by protease IV-specific antibodies. P. putida producing protease IV, relative to P. putida with the vector alone, caused a threefold increase in ocular inflammation and tissue damage when intrastromally injected into rabbit corneas. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates for the first time that protease IV is synthesized as a large precursor that is processed intracellularly through an intermediate form and secreted into the extracellular milieu as a mature protease. The results also confirm a significant correlation between production of protease IV and corneal virulence.
TI  - Identification and characterization of an N-acylhomoserine lactone-dependent quorum-sensing system in Pseudomonas putida strain IsoF.
AB  - Recent reports have shown that several strains of Pseudomonas putida produce N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs). These signal molecules enable bacteria to coordinately express certain phenotypic traits in a density-dependent manner in a process referred to as quorum sensing. In this study we have cloned a genomic region of the plant growth-promoting P. putida strain IsoF that, when present in trans, provoked induction of a bioluminescent AHL reporter plasmid. Sequence analysis identified a gene cluster consisting of four genes: ppuI and ppuR, whose predicted amino acid sequences are highly similar to proteins of the LuxI-LuxR family, an open reading frame (ORF) located in the intergenic region between ppuI and ppuR with significant homology to rsaL from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and a gene, designated ppuA, present upstream of ppuR, the deduced amino acid sequence of which shows similarity to long-chain fatty acid coenzyme A ligases from various organisms. Using a transcriptional ppuA::luxAB fusion we demonstrate that expression of ppuA is AHL dependent. Furthermore, transcription of the AHL synthase ppuI is shown to be subject to quorum-sensing regulation, creating a positive feedback loop. Sequencing of the DNA regions flanking the ppu gene cluster indicated that the four genes form an island in the suhB-PA3819 intergenic region of the currently sequenced P. putida strain KT2440. Moreover, we provide evidence that the ppu genes are not present in other AHL-producing P. putida strains, indicating that this gene cluster is so far unique for strain IsoF. While the wild-type strain formed very homogenous biofilms, both a ppuI and a ppuA mutant formed structured biofilms with characteristic microcolonies and water-filled channels. These results suggest that the quorum-sensing system influences biofilm structural development.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of the Escherichia coli R1 plasmid host killing peptide.
AB  - The 52 amino acid host killing peptide (Hok) from the hok/sok post-segregational  killer system of the Escherichia coli plasmid R1 was synthesized using Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) chemistry, and its molecular weight was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. Hok kills cells by depolarizing the cytoplasmic membrane when it is made in the cytosol. Six microorganisms, E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. putida, Salmonella typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus were exposed to the purified peptide but showed no significant killing. However, electroporation of Hok (200 microgml(-1)) into E. coli cells showed a dramatic reduction (100000-fold) in the number of cells transformed with plasmid DNA which indicates that the synthetic Hok peptide killed cells. Electroporation of Hok into P. putida was also very effective with a 500-fold reduction in electrocompetent cells (100 microgml(-1)). Heat shock in the presence of Hok (380 microgml(-1)) resulted in a 5-fold reduction in E. coli cells but had no effect on B. subtilis. In addition, three Hok fragments (Hok(1-28), Hok(31-52) and Hok(16-52)) killed cells when electroporated into E. coli at 200 microgml(-1) (over 1000-fold killing for Hok(1-28), 50-fold killing for Hok(16-52) and over 1000-fold killing for Hok(31-52)). E. coli cells electroporated with Hok and visualized using transmission electron microscopy showed the same morphological changes as control cells to which Hok was induced using a plasmid inside the cell.
TI  - Nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant isolates of pseudomonas putida producing VIM-1 metallo-beta-lactamase.
AB  - Successful carbapenem-based chemotherapy for the treatment of Pseudomonas infections has been seriously hindered by the recent appearance of IMP- and VIM-type metallo-beta-lactamases, which confer high-level resistance to carbapenems and most other beta-lactams. Recently, multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas putida isolates for which carbapenem MICs were >/=32 micro g/ml were recovered from cultures of urine from three inpatients in the general intensive care unit of the Ospedale di Circolo, Varese, Italy. Enzyme assays revealed production of a metallo-beta-lactamase activity, while molecular analysis detected in each isolate a bla(VIM-1) determinant carried by an apparently identical medium-sized plasmid. Conjugation experiments were unsuccessful in transferring the beta-lactamase determinant to Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Macrorestriction analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the isolates were of clonal origin. PCR mapping and sequencing of the variable region of the plasmid-borne class 1 integron carrying the bla(VIM-1) determinant (named In110) showed that the bla(VIM-1)-containing cassette was identical to that previously found in strains of different species from other Italian hospitals and that the cassette array of In110 was not identical but clearly related to that of In70 (a bla(VIM-1)-containing plasmid-borne integron from an Achromobacter xylosoxidans isolate), pointing to a common origin of this cassette and to a related evolutionary history of their cognate integrons.
TI  - Analysis of the zwf-pgl-eda-operon in Pseudomonas putida strains H and KT2440.
AB  - A 3.9-kb fragment of the genome of Pseudomonas putida H, containing the complete  zwf-pgl-eda-operon, encoding glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconolactonase and 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate-aldolase, respectively, and part of the divergently transcribed regulatory gene, hexR, was cloned and analyzed. The nucleotide sequences of these genes showed high similarities to the corresponding DNA sequences of P. putida KT2440 and also to sequences of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. Derivatives of strains H and KT2440, containing transcriptional lacZ fusions to P(zwf) were generated and used to study the expression of these operons. In both strains, this operon was induced by carbohydrates such as glucose, gluconate, fructose and glycerol. The transcription rate of the zwf-pgl-eda-operon was found to be about three times higher in the KT2440 background than in strain H. In both strains the induction of the zwf-pgl-eda-operon by carbohydrates during growth on carboxylic acids was not affected by carbon catabolite repression.
TI  - Microorganism selection and performance in bioslurry reactors treating PAH-contaminated soil.
AB  - A continuous-flow reactor (CSTR) and a soil slurry-sequencing batch reactor (SS-SBR) were operated in 81 vessels for 200 days to treat a soil contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Filtered slurry samples were used to quantify bulk biosurfactant concentrations and PAH emulsification. Concentrations of Corynebacterium aquaticum, Flavobacterium mizutaii, Mycobacterium gastri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas putida were determined using fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis. The CSTR and SS-SBR selected microbial consortia with markedly different surfactant-producing and PAH-degrading abilities. Biosurfactant levels in the SS-SBR reached 4 times the critical micelle concentration (CMC) that resulted in considerable emulsification of PAH. In contrast, CSTR operation resulted in nomeasurable biosurfactant production. Total PAH removal efficiency was 93% in the SS-SBR, compared with only 66% in the CSTR, and stripping of PAH was 3 times less in the SS-SBR. Reversing the mode of operation on day 100 caused a complete reversal in microbial consortia and in reactor performance by day 140. These results show that bioslurry reactor operation can be manipulated to control overall reactor performance.
TI  - Accumulation of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) from octanoate in different pseudomonas belonging to the rRNA homology group I.
AB  - It is admitted that one of the characteristics of pseudomonads is their inability to accumulate poly(3-hydroxybutyrate). In this paper, we show that poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate) synthesis is restricted to Pseudomonas rRNA homology group I, which includes both fluorescent and nonfluorescent species. However, within the genus Pseudomonas, the P. aeruginosa complex can be subdivided into two groups: the "P. aeruginosa group", which includes P. aeruginosa, P. alcaligenes, P. citronellolis, P. mendocina, produce poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate) from octanoate and the "P. oleovorans group" which includes the type strain of P. oleovorans, P. pseudoalcaligenes and two Pseudomonas sp., produce poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) during cultivation on octanoate. Strain GPo1 (ATCC 29347) formely identified as P. oleovorans and known to produce various medium-side-chain PHAs such as poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate) has been reclassified in the P. putida complex.
TI  - Divergent structure and regulatory mechanism of proline catabolic systems: characterization of the putAP proline catabolic operon of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and its regulation by PruR, an AraC/XylS family protein.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 utilizes proline as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen via a bifunctional enzyme (the putA gene product) that has both proline dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.99.8) and pyrroline 5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.1.12) activities. We characterized the pruR-putAP loci encoding the proline catabolic system of this strain. In contrast to the putA and putP (encoding proline permease) genes of other gram- negative bacteria, which are located at divergent or separate loci, Northern blotting demonstrated that the two genes form an operon in strain PAO1. While the phylogenetic lineage of the PutP protein of strain PAO1 was related to that of the origin (80% identity to the P. putida counterpart), PutA of PAO1 (PutA(PAO)) was rather distantly related (47% identity) to the P. putida counterpart. Moreover, unlike the PutA proteins of P. putida and enteric bacteria, PutA(PAO) appeared to lack a regulatory function. Upstream of the putAP operon, the divergent PA0781 gene specified a hypothetical outer membrane protein with a molecular weight of 74,202. This gene appeared to be dispensable for proline utilization as indicated by the normal growth of a knockout mutant of PA0781 on medium containing proline. The pruR (proline utilization regulator) gene immediately upstream of PA0781 encoded a transcriptional activator of the AraC/XylS protein family and mediated the proline-responsive expression of putAP. Primer extension studies identified a PruR-dependent promoter responsive to proline in the 5'-flanking region of putA. Thus, the proline utilization system of P. aeruginosa differs from that of P. putida with respect to putA structure, the organization of the putAP genes, and the regulatory mechanism of putA expression.
TI  - Alkane biodegradation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from a polluted  zone: identification of alkB and alkB-related genes.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains that grow on crude oil as the sole source of carbon and energy were isolated from an environment in Morocco polluted by petroleum refinery effluents. The twenty isolates grew on saturated alkanes from C12 to C22. Three of the isolates were also able to grow on low molecular weight C6 to C10 n-alkanes, but the other 17 strains were not. The strains were tested for alkB and a/kB-related genes encoding alkane-1-monooxygenase (alkane hydroxylase). Oligonucleotide primers specific for the alkB gene of strain P. putida (GPo1 ) and for the alkB1 and alkB2 genes of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 allowed amplification from the P. aeruginosa isolates of fragments similar to alkB1 and alkB2 genes of strain PAO1. Only 3 strains carried an alkB gene very similar to that of strain GPo1, and these strains were the same ones that could utilise C6 to C10 n-alkanes.
TI  - Multiple enzyme restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis for high resolution distinction of Pseudomonas (sensu stricto) 16S rRNA genes.
AB  - Members of the genus Pseudomonas (sensu stricto) are important phytopathogens and agents of human infections, while other strains and species have beneficial bioremediation and biocontrol activities. Traditionally, these important species have been difficult to differentiate phenotypically; thus, rRNA lineage analyses have often been invoked. In this report, a newly developed approach is described to rapidly detect and distinguish fluorescent Pseudomonas isolates: PCR amplification of a Pseudomonas-specific 990-bp ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) fragment [Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 64 (1998) 2545.] coupled with multiple enzyme restriction fragment length polymorphism (MERFLP) analysis using a single digestion mixture of AluI, HinfI, RsaI, and Tru9I incubated at 37 degrees C. The method distinguished 116 published sequences and 47 reference strains of authentic Pseudomonas representing 28 nomenspecies. A total of 55% (64/116) of the sequences analyzed by MERFLP were grouped into distinct phylogenetic clusters including Pseudomonas putida, P. syringae, P. aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, and P. fluorescens. The utility of the MERFLPs was confirmed when 100% (33/33) of the above named control reference strains were correctly placed into their phylogenetic clusters. The environmental relevance of the MERFLP method was confirmed when 67% of 28 forest and agricultural soil-derived presumptive Pseudomonas environmental clones and isolates were placed into the five major pseudomonad clusters, one clone fell into the P. agarici cluster, and five clones clustered near related pseudomonads. These data demonstrated that the PCR-MERFLP protocol provides an efficient and powerful tool for distinguishing isolates and rDNA gene libraries of environmental Pseudomonas species.
TI  - Multiple bacteria encode metallothioneins and SmtA-like zinc fingers.
AB  - Zinc is essential but toxic in excess. Bacterial metallothionein, SmtA from Synechococcus PCC 7942, sequesters and detoxifies four zinc ions per molecule and contains a zinc finger structurally similar to eukaryotic GATA. The dearth of other reported bacterial metallothioneins has been surprising. Here we describe related bacterial metallothioneins (BmtA) from Anabaena PCC 7120, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida that bind multiple zinc ions with high stability towards protons. Thiol modification demonstrates that cysteine coordinates zinc in all of these proteins. Additionally, (111)Cd-NMR, and (111)Cd-edited (1)H-NMR, identified histidine ligands in Anabaena PCC 7120 BmtA, analogous to SmtA. A related Escherichia coli protein bound only a single zinc ion, via four cysteine residues, with low stability towards protons; (111)Cd-NMR and (111)Cd-edited (1)H-NMR confirmed exclusive cysteine-coordination, and these cysteine residues reacted rapidly with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid). (1)H-NMR of proteins from P. aeruginosa, Anabaena PCC 7120 and E. coli generated fingerprints diagnostic for the GATA-like zinc finger fold of SmtA. These studies reveal first the existence of multiple bacterial metallothioneins, and second proteins with SmtA-like lone zinc fingers, devoid of a cluster,and designated GatA. We have identified 12 smtA-like genes in sequence databases including four of the gatA type.
TI  - Identification of bacteria in drinking and purified water during the monitoring of a typical water purification system.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A typical purification system that provides purified water which meets ionic and organic chemical standards, must be protected from microbial proliferation to minimize cross-contamination for use in cleaning and preparations in pharmaceutical industries and in health environments. METHODOLOGY: Samples of water were taken directly from the public distribution water tank at twelve different stages of a typical purification system were analyzed for the identification of isolated bacteria. Two miniature kits were used: (i) identification system (api 20 NE, Bio-Merieux) for non-enteric and non-fermenting gram-negative rods; and (ii) identification system (BBL crystal, Becton and Dickson) for enteric and non-fermenting gram-negative rods. The efficiency of the chemical sanitizers used in the stages of the system, over the isolated and identified bacteria in the sampling water, was evaluated by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method. RESULTS: The 78 isolated colonies were identified as the following bacteria genera: Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium and Acinetobacter. According to the miniature kits used in the identification, there was a prevalence of isolation of P. aeruginosa 32.05%, P. picketti (Ralstonia picketti) 23.08%, P. vesiculares 12.82%,P. diminuta 11.54%, F. aureum 6.42%, P. fluorescens 5.13%, A. lwoffi 2.56%, P. putida 2.56%, P. alcaligenes 1.28%, P. paucimobilis 1.28%, and F. multivorum 1.28%. CONCLUSIONS: We found that research was required for the identification of gram-negative non-fermenting bacteria, which were isolated from drinking water and water purification systems, since Pseudomonas genera represents opportunistic pathogens which disperse and adhere easily to surfaces, forming a biofilm which interferes with the cleaning and disinfection procedures in hospital and industrial environments.
TI  - Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of clinical isolates of nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria by the Phoenix Automated Microbiology System.
AB  - The Phoenix Automated Microbiology System (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) was evaluated for its ability to identify nonfermenting gram-negative pathogens and measure their drug susceptibility. Isolates producing rare extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (PER-1, IMP-2, VIM-1, and VIM-2) were included in the study. Species identification was compared to that given by the ATB System (bio-Merieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), whereas susceptibility results were compared to those produced by a reference broth microdilution test (panels manufactured by Pasco Laboratories, Becton Dickinson). The Phoenix system consistently identified all isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 55) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 28), while in other cases species agreement was obtained for 47/53 isolates (Acinetobacter baumannii, 29/31; Pseudomonas putida, 10/11; Burkholderia cepacia, 6/7; and Pseudomonas fluorescens, 2/4). Overall, the Phoenix and ATB systems gave equal results in 130/136 cases (95.6%). For two isolates, consistent identification was obtained at the genus level, thus bringing the cumulative agreement to 97.1%. MIC values (interpreted according to NCCLS guidelines) gave essential and categorical agreement in 94.2% and 93.1% of cases, respectively. Minor and major errors were 5.1% and 5.2%, respectively. No very major errors were produced. The mean time to results (TTR) for the Phoenix system was 14.8 +/- 1.6 h (mean +/- SD), with the shortest TTR being observedfor A. baumannii (13.0 +/- 1.8 h) and the longest one for P. aeruginosa (15.6 +/- 1.2 h). In conclusion, the Phoenix system performed rapidly and correctly in the identification of clinical isolates of important opportunistic pathogens and in measuring their susceptibility to antipseudomonal drugs.
TI  - Different responses of pyoverdine genes to autoinduction in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the group Pseudomonas fluorescens-Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - We investigated the regulation of the psbA and pvdA pyoverdine biosynthesis genes, which encode the L-ornithine N(5)-oxygenase homologues in Pseudomonas strain B10 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, respectively. We demonstrate that pyoverdine(B10), as the end product of its biosynthetic pathway, is a key participant of the control circuit regulating its own production in Pseudomonas strain B10. In P. aeruginosa PAO1, however, pyoverdine(PAO1) has no apparent role in the positive regulation of the pvdA gene.
TI  - Mechanisms of solvent tolerance in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Organic solvents can be toxic to microorganisms, depending on the inherent toxicity of the solvent and the intrinsic tolerance of the bacterial species and strains. The toxicity of a given solvent correlates with the logarithm of its partition coefficient in n-octanol and water (log Pow). Organic solvents with a log Pow between 1.5 and 4.0 are extremely toxic for microorganisms and other living cells because they partition preferentially in the cytoplasmic membrane, disorganizing its structure and impairing vital functions. Several possible mechanisms leading to solvent-tolerance in gram-negative bacteria have been proposed: (a) adaptive alterations of the membrane fatty acids and phospholipid headgroup composition, (b) formation of vesicles loaded with toxic compounds, and (c) energy-dependent active efflux pumps belonging to the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) family, which export toxic organic solvents to the external medium. In these mechanisms, changes in the phospholipid profile and extrusion of the solvents seem to be shared by different strains. The most significant changes in phospholipids are an increase in the melting temperature of the membranes by rapid cis-to-trans isomerization of unsaturated fatty acids and modifications in the phospholipid headgroups. Toluene efflux pumps are involved in solvent tolerance in several gram-negative strains, e.g., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The AcrAB-TolC and AcrEF-TolC efflux pumps are important for n-hexane tolerance in E. coli. A number of P. putida strains have been isolated that tolerate toxic hydrocarbons such as toluene, styrene, and p-xylene. At least three efflux pumps (TtgABC, TtgDEF, and TtgGHI) are present in the most extensively characterized solvent-tolerant strain, P. putida DOT-T1E, and the number of efflux pumps has been found to correlate with the degree of solvent tolerance in different P. putida strains. The operation of these efflux pumps seems to be coupled to the proton motive force via the TonB system, although the intimate mechanism of energy transfer remains elusive. Specific and global regulators control the expression of the efflux pump operons of E. coli and P. putida at the transcriptional level.
TI  - The role of the fatty acid beta-oxidation multienzyme complex from Pseudomonas oleovorans in polyhydroxyalkanoate biosynthesis: molecular characterization of the fadBA operon from P. oleovorans and of the enoyl-CoA hydratase genes phaJ from P. oleovorans and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - In order to investigate the role of the putative epimerase function of the beta-oxidation multienzyme complex (FadBA) in the provision of (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA thioesters for medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA(MCL)) biosynthesis, the fadBA(Po) operon of Pseudomonas oleovorans was cloned and characterized. The fadBA(Po) operon and a class-II PHA synthase gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were heterologously co-expressed in Escherichia coli to determine whether the putative epimerase function of FadBA(Po) has the ability to provide precursors for PHA accumulation in a non-PHA-accumulating bacterium. Cultivation studies with fatty acids as carbon source revealed that FadBA(Po) did not mediate PHA(MCL) biosynthesis in the E. coli wild-type strain harboring a PHA synthase gene. However, PHA accumulation was strongly impaired in a recombinant E. coli fadB mutant, which harbored a PHA synthase gene. These data indicate that in pseudomonads FadBA does not possess the inherent property, based on a putative epimerase function, to provide the ( R)-enantiomer of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA efficiently and that other linking enzymes are required to efficiently channel intermediates of beta-oxidation towards PHA(MCL) biosynthesis. However, the phaJ gene from P. oleovorans and from Pseudomonas putida, both of which encoded a 3- Re enoyl-CoA hydratase, was identified. The co-expression of phaJ(Po/Pp) with either a class-II PHA synthase gene or the PHA synthase gene from Aeromonas punctata in E. coli revealed that PhaJ(Po/Pp) mediated biosynthesis of either PHA(MCL), contributing to about 1% of cellular dry mass, or of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate- co-3-hydroxyhexanoate), contributing to 3.6% of cellular dry mass, when grown on decanoate. These data indicate that FadBA(Po)does not mediate the provision of (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, which resembles FadBA of non-PHA-accumulating bacteria, and that 3- Re enoyl-CoA hydratases are required to divert intermediates of fatty acid beta-oxidation towards PHA biosynthesis in P. oleovorans.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems. Thirty-two species 2,697 strains of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), Escherichia coli (n = 250), Citrobacter freundii (n = 153), Citrobacter koseri (n = 97), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), Serratia marcescens (n = 153), Proteus mirabillis (n = 103), Proteus vulgaris (n = 77), Morganella morganii (n = 141), Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii; n = 154), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), Pseudomonas putida (n = 49), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), Acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), Acinetobactor Iwoffii (n = 30), Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola; n = 124). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lowffii throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in the antibacterial activity of CZOP against H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - FpvA receptor involvement in pyoverdine biosynthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Alignment of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa ferric pyoverdine receptor, FpvA, with similar ferric-siderophore receptors revealed that the mature protein carries an extension of ca. 70 amino acids at its N terminus, an extension shared by the ferric pseudobactin receptors of P. putida. Deletion of fpvA from the chromosome of P. aeruginosa reduced pyoverdine production in this organism, as a result of a decline in expression of genes (e.g., pvdD) associated with the biosynthesis of the pyoverdine peptide moiety. Wild-type fpvA restored pvd expression in the mutant, thereby complementing its pyoverdine deficiency, although a deletion derivative of fpvA encoding a receptor lacking the N terminus of the mature protein did not. The truncated receptor was, however, functional in pyoverdine-mediated iron uptake, as evidenced by its ability to promote pyoverdine-dependent growth in an iron-restricted medium. These data are consistent with the idea that the N-terminal extension plays a role in FpvA-mediated pyoverdine biosynthesis in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Synthesis of signaling N-acyl-homoserine-lactones participating in quorum sensing in rhizosphere and soil bacteria Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas].
AB  - Signaling molecules assigned to N-acyl-homoserine-lactones (AHL) serve as autoinducers for the genes controlling the quorum sensing regulatory system. In many gram-negative bacteria, AHL are the key factors responsible for density-dependent regulation of exoenzyme and secondary metabolite production; they also participate in interaction between bacteria and higher organisms. The soil and rhisosphere bacteria Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas from different geographical zones of Russia and the former USSR were analyzed for the presence of the AHL producers. Screening was conducted by using a test system based on the mutant strain Chromobacterium violaceum, which was unable to synthesize AHL but produced a pigment violacein in the presence of exogenous AHL. The AHL-like compounds proved to be formed by 9.7% of the studied bacteria. Various Pseudomonas species differed in the capacity to synthesize this compounds. In at least a half of the isolated P. aureofaciens and P. aeruginosa, an intense AHL production was observed, whereas the AHL-producers were far less frequent among the P. fluorescens, P. chlororaphis, P. lemonnieri, P. geniculata, and P. putida. None of the 41 Xanthomonas maltophilia strains examined synthesized AHL.
TI  - Simultaneous production of polyhydroxyalkanoates and rhamnolipids by Pseudomonas  aeruginosa.
AB  - The feasibility of the simultaneous production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) and rhamnolipids, as a novel approach to reduce their production costs, was demonstrated by the cultivation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa IFO3924. Fairly large amounts of PHAs and rhamnolipids were obtained from the bacterial cells and the culture supernatant, respectively. Decanoate was a more suitable carbon source than ethanol and glucose for the simultaneous production, although glucose was suitable for cell growth without an induction period under pH control. The kind of carbon source affected PHA monomer composition markedly and PHA molecular weight slightly. Monorhamnolipids and dirhamnolipids were included in the rhamnolipids extracted from the culture supernatant using decanoate, glucose, or ethanol as the carbon source. Both PHAs and rhamnolipids were synthesized after the growth phase. PHA content in the cell reached a maximum when the carbon source was exhausted. After exhaustion of the carbon source, PHA content decreased rapidly, but rhamnolipid synthesis, which followed PHA synthesis, continued. This resulted in a time lag for the attainment of maximum levels of PHAs and rhamnolipids. The reusability of the cells used in rhamnolipid production was evaluated in the repeated batch culture of P. aeruginosa IFO3924 for the simultaneous production of PHAs and rhamnolipids. High concentrations of rhamnolipids in the culture supernatant were attained at the end of both the first and second batch cultures. High PHA content was achieved in the resting cells that were finally harvested after the second batch. Simultaneous production of PHAs and rhamnolipids will enhance the availability of valuable biocatalysts of bacterial cells, and dispel the common belief that the production cost of PHAs accumulated intracellularly is almost impossible to become lower than that of cells themselves.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. Changes in CZOP susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), Escherichia coli (n = 276), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 93), Serratia marcescens (n = 172), Serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), Citrobacter freundii (n = 177), Citrobacter koseri (n = 70), Proteus mirabilis (n = 113), Proteus vulgaris (n = 89), Morganella morganii (n = 116), Providencia spp. (n = 41), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), Pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), Pseudomonas putida (n = 63), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), Acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and Prevotella/Porphyromonas (n = 173). An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, and S. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against M.(B.) catarrhalis, C. koseri, and P. aeruginosa was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, and P. mirabilis increased year by year. The increase in MIC90 of CZOP against E. aerogenes and P. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. In contract, the susceptibility of E. cloacae to CZOP was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to CZOP. MIC90 of CZOP against C. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. Additionally, MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. fluorescens, P. putida, B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, B. fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. Changes in MIC90 of CZOP against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the AgmR regulator of Pseudomonas putida:  role in alcohol utilization.
AB  - Two-phase partitioning bioreactors (TPPBs) comprise an aqueous phase containing all non-carbon nutrients necessary for microbial growth and a solvent phase containing high concentrations of inhibitory or toxic substrates that partition at sub-inhibitory levels to the aqueous phase in response to cellular demand. This work aimed at eliminating the growth of Pseudomonas putida ATCC 11172 on medium-chain-length (C8-C12) aliphatic alcohols, hence enabling their use as xenobiotic delivery solvents within two-phase partitioning bioreactors. Experiments resulted in the isolation of a mini-Tn5 mutant unable to utilize these alcohols. The mutation, which also eliminated growth on glycerol and ethanol, was identified to be within a homologue of the P aeruginosa agmR gene, which encodes a response regulator. Enzyme analysis of the agmR::Tn5Km mutant cell extracts revealed a 10-fold decrease in pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase activity. A knockout in a gene (exaA) encoding a PQQ-linked alcohol dehydrogenase slowed but did not eliminate growth on medium-chain-length alcohols or ethanol, suggesting metabolic redundancy within P. putida ATCC 11172. Analysis of P. putida KT2440 genome sequence data indicated the presence of two PQQ-linked alcohol dehydrogenase-encoding genes. The successful elimination of alcohol utilization in the agmR mutant indicates control by AgmR on multiple pathways and presents a useful strain for biotechnological applications requiring alcohol non-utilizing microbial catalysts.
TI  - A comparative evaluation of five typing techniques for determining the diversity  of fluorescent pseudomonads.
AB  - Five typing methods were evaluated, utilising 63 strains of fluorescent pseudomonads, to assess their usefulness as tools to study the bacterial diversity within this complex group. The methods used were Biolog metabolic profiling, restriction fragment length polymorphism ribotyping, PCR ribotyping, and repetitive element sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) utilising BOX and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) primers. Cluster analysis of the results clearly demonstrated the considerable homogeneity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates and, conversely, the heterogeneity within the other species, in particular P. putida and P. fluorescens, which need further taxonomic investigation. Biolog metabolic profiling enabled the best differentiation among the species. Rep-PCR proved to be highly discriminatory, more so than the other DNA fingerprinting techniques, demonstrating its suitability for the analysis of highly clonal isolates. RFLP ribotyping, PCR ribotyping, and rep-PCR produced specific clusters of P. aeruginosa isolates, which corresponded to their origins of isolation, hence we recommend these methods for intraspecific typing of bacteria.
TI  - bla(VIM-2) cassette-containing novel integrons in metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida isolates disseminated in a Korean hospital.
AB  - We investigated the phenotypic and genetic properties of metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Pseudomonas isolates collected at a tertiary-care hospital in Korea since 1995. The prevalence of imipenem resistance among Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates reached 16% in 1997, when 9% of the resistant organisms were found to produce VIM-2 beta-lactamase, a class B enzyme previously found only in P. aeruginosa isolates from Europe. VIM-2-producing isolates of Pseudomonas putida were also detected. Resistance was transferable from both these species to P. aeruginosa PAO4089Rp by filter mating, although the resistance determinant could not be found on any detectable plasmid. Serotyping showed that many of the VIM-2-producing P. aeruginosa isolates belonged to serotypes O:11 and O:12, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of XbaI-digested genomic DNA revealed that many had identical profiles, whereas the P. putida isolates were diverse. Sequencing showed that the bla(VIM-2) genes resided as cassettes in class 1 integrons. In contrast to previous VIM-encoding integrons, the integron sequenced from a P. aeruginosa isolate had bla(VIM) located downstream of a variant of aacA4. bla(VIM) also lay in a class 1 integron in a representative P. putida strain, but the organization of this integron was different from that sequenced from the P. aeruginosa strain. In conclusion, the metallo-beta-lactamase produced by these imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas isolates was VIM-2, and the accumulation of producers reflected clonal dissemination as well as horizontal spread. Strict measures are required in order to control a further spread of resistance.
TI  - The active partition gene incC of IncP plasmids is required for stable maintenance in a broad range of hosts.
AB  - Plasmids of incompatibility group P (IncP) are capable of replication and stable  inheritance in a wide variety of gram-negative bacteria. Three determinants of IncP plasmids are components of an active partition locus that is predicted to function in the segregation of plasmid copies to daughter cells. These determinants are incC, which codes for a member of the ParA family of partition ATPases; korB, which specifies a DNA-binding protein that also functions as a global transcriptional repressor; and O(B), the DNA target for KorB, which occurs at multiple locations on IncP plasmids. To determine the importance and host range of the IncC/KorB partition system in the maintenance of IncP plasmids, we constructed an in-frame deletion of incC in the otherwise intact 60-kb IncP alpha plasmid R995. R995 Delta incC was found to be highly unstable in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, whereas wild-type R995 is stable in all these hosts. In addition, R995 Delta incC could not be established in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. trans-Complementation analysis showed that the coding region for IncC2 polypeptide, which is expressed from an internal translational start within the incC gene, was sufficient to restore stable maintenance to wild-type levels. The results show that the IncC/KorB active partition system of IncP plasmids is remarkably proficient for stable maintenance in diverse bacteria.
TI  - Functional analysis of alkane hydroxylases from gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - We have cloned homologs of the Pseudomonas putida GPo1 alkane hydroxylase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0, Alcanivorax borkumensis AP1, Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, and Prauserella rugosa NRRL B-2295. Sequence comparisons show that the level of protein sequence identity between the homologs is as low as 35%, and that the Pseudomonas alkane hydroxylases are as distantly related to each other as to the remaining alkane hydroxylases. Based on the observation that rubredoxin, an electron transfer component of the GPo1 alkane hydroxylase system, can be replaced by rubredoxins from other alkane hydroxylase systems, we have developed three recombinant host strains for the functional analysis of the novel alkane hydroxylase genes. Two hosts, Escherichia coli GEc137 and P. putida GPo12, were equipped with pGEc47 Delta B, which encodes all proteins necessary for growth on medium-chain-length alkanes (C(6) to C(12)), except a functional alkane hydroxylase. The third host was an alkB knockout derivative of P. fluorescens CHA0, which is no longer able to grow on C(12) to C(16) alkanes. All alkane hydroxylase homologs, except the Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 AlkM, allowed at least one of the three hosts to grow on n-alkanes.
TI  - A siderophore peptide synthetase gene from plant-growth-promoting Pseudomonas putida WCS358.
AB  - Under iron limiting conditions, Pseudomonas putida WCS358 produces and secretes a fluorescent siderophore called pseudobactin 358 which consists of a nonapeptide linked to a fluorescent dihydroxy quinoline moiety. Previous studies have identified a major gene cluster involved in pseudobactin 358 biosynthesis and several regulators responsible for the activation of biosynthetic genes under iron starving conditions. In this study, we identified the promoter transcribing the pseudobactin 358 synthetase gene. Promoter deletion experiments have demonstrated that the DNA region downstream of the initiation of transcription site is necessary for proper promoter functioning. This promoter controls the expression of a gene designated ppsD which encodes a 2,247-residue protein, PpsD, which has a predicted molecular weight of 247,610 Da and contains two highly homologous domains of approximately 1000 amino acids each. ppsD::Tn5 mutants of strain WCS358 are unable to synthesise pseudobactin 358 and can be complemented when ppsD is provided in trans. It is concluded that ppsD is a peptide synthetase involved in the biosynthesis of the peptide moiety of pseudobactin 358. PpsD displays a very high degree of similarity (52% aa identity) with PvdD from P. aeruginosa, a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase involved in the biosynthesis of pyoverdine, the fluorescent siderophore produced by P. aeruginosa. It also displayed homology with other peptide synthetases from other micro-organisms involved in the biosynthesis of siderophores and peptide antibiotics.
TI  - Differential infectivity of two Pseudomonas species and the immune response in the milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus (Insecta: Hemiptera).
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida show a profound differential infectivity after inoculation in Oncopeltus fasciatus. Whereas P. putida has no significant impact on nymphs, P. aeruginosa kills all experimental animals within 48 h. Both Pseudomonas species, however, induce the same four hemolymph peptides in O. fasciatus. Also injection of saline solution and injury induced these peptides. In general peptide induction was stronger in nymphs than in adult males. A significantly higher number of nymphs survived a challenge with P. aeruginosa when an immunization with P. putida preceded. The antibacterial properties of the hemolymph were demonstrated in inhibition experiments with P. putida. Two of the four inducible peptides (peptides 1 and 4) could be partially sequenced after Edman degradation and were compared with known antibacterial peptides. Peptide 1, of 15 kDa, showed 47.1% identity with the glycine-rich hemiptericin of Pyrrhocoris apterus. Peptide 4, of 2 kDa, had a 77.8% identity with the proline-rich pyrrhocoricin of P. apterus and a 76.9% identity with metalnikowin 1 of Palomena prasina. Peptides 2 and 3 are also small, with molecular weights of 8 and 5 kDa.
TI  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa displays multiple phenotypes during development as a biofilm.
AB  - Complementary approaches were employed to characterize transitional episodes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm development using direct observation and whole-cell protein analysis. Microscopy and in situ reporter gene analysis were used to directly observe changes in biofilm physiology and to act as signposts to standardize protein collection for two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis and protein identification in chemostat and continuous-culture biofilm-grown populations. Using these approaches, we characterized five stages of biofilm development: (i) reversible attachment, (ii) irreversible attachment, (iii) maturation-1, (iv) maturation-2, and (v) dispersion. Biofilm cells were shown to change regulation of motility, alginate production, and quorum sensing during the process of development. The average difference in detectable protein regulation between each of the five stages of development was 35% (approximately 525 proteins). When planktonic cells were compared with maturation-2 stage biofilm cells, more than 800 proteins were shown to have a sixfold or greater change in expression level (over 50% of the proteome). This difference was higher than when planktonic P. aeruginosa were compared with planktonic cultures of Pseudomonas putida. Las quorum sensing was shown to play no role in early biofilm development but was important in later stages. Biofilm cells in the dispersion stage were more similar to planktonic bacteria than to maturation-2 stage bacteria. These results demonstrate that P. aeruginosa displays multiple phenotypes during biofilm development and that knowledge of stage-specific physiology may be important in detecting and controlling biofilm growth.
TI  - Transcription analysis of rpoH in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - We previously determined the complete DNA sequence of the rpoH gene encoding the  heat-shock sigma factor (sigmaH) of Pseudomonas putida. In the present study, the transcriptional start sites of rpoH were determined to be 41 nucleotides (T1), 153 nucleotides (T2) and 157 nucleotides (T3) upstream from the translational start codon (AUG) of rpoH by rapid amplification of cDNA 5'-ends. Based on the locations of T2 and T3, a sigma70-type promoter (P2) was determined to be located in the open reading frame region of upstream ftsX in addition to the sigmaE-type promoter (P1; DNA Res. 6 (1999) 241). In the in vitro transcription assay with reconstituted RNA polymerases (Esigma70, EsigmaE, EsigmaH and EsigmaS) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, EsigmaE transcribed rpoH from T1 and Esigma(70) transcribed it from T2 and T3. In both cases, the level of transcription was higher at 42 degrees C than at 30 degrees C. No transcript was detected when EsigmaH or EsigmaS was used. These results indicate that EsigmaE and Esigma70 recognize P1 promoter and P2 promoter, respectively, and also prove that the synthesis of rpoH mRNA is inducible upon heat shock.
TI  - SHV-12, SHV-5, SHV-2a and VEB-1 extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in Gram-negative bacteria isolated in a university hospital in Thailand.
AB  - Sixty-one extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates were collected from Srinagarind Hospital, Thailand. These included 43 Enterobacteriaceae and 18 Pseudomonadaceae. The 43 Enterobacteriaceae were found to produce the following ESBLs: 26 (60.5%) SHV-12, 13 (30.2%) SHV-5, two (4.7%) SHV-2a, one (2.3%) VEB-1 and one (2.3%) unidentified. Twenty-four isolates (55.8%) also carried bla(TEM-1B), as well as bla(SHV) or bla(VEB-1). Plasmid DNA from transconjugants carrying the bla(SHV-12) gene showed various restriction patterns, indicating the distribution of the bla(SHV-12) gene among different antibiotic resistance plasmids. In contrast, bla(SHV-5) in 13 isolates was found on a single plasmid of c. 130 kb. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis of genomic DNA from these isolates revealed that nine of 11 Klebsiella pneumoniae gave the same pattern, indicating clonal spread of the strain within the hospital, together with the occasional spread of the plasmid to other strains. Among the pseudomonad isolates, 16 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one Pseudomonas putida had bla(VEB-like) and one P. aeruginosa had bla(SHV-12). Nine of the 16 isolates carrying bla(VEB-like) (56.3%) had identical PFGE patterns, suggesting the dissemination of this gene, also by clonal spread. At least six different bla(VEB-like-)containing integrons were found among the 18 isolates. This is the first report of bacteria producing SHV-12 and SHV-2a in Thailand and the first report of SHV-12 in P. aeruginosa, of VEB-1 in Citrobacter freundii and a VEB-1-like beta-lactamase in P. putida. These findings indicate that ESBL genes in the Far East are part of a gene pool capable of broad horizontal gene transfer, in that these genes can transfer between different families of Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa regulatory genes ptxR and ptxS.
AB  - We have previously described two Pseudomonas aeruginosa genes, ptxR, which enhances toxA and pvc (the pyoverdine chromophore operon) expression, and ptxS, the first gene of the kgu operon for the utilization of 2-ketogluconate by P. aeruginosa. ptxS interferes with the effect of ptxR on toxA expression. In this study, we have utilized DNA hybridization experiments to determine the presence of ptxR and ptxS homologous sequences in several gram-negative bacteria. ptxR homologous sequences were detected in P. aeruginosa strains only, while ptxS homologous sequences were detected in P. aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas fluorescens. Using Northern blot hybridization experiments and a ptxS-lacZ fusion plasmid, we have shown that P. aeruginosa ptxR and ptxS are expressed in P. putida and P. fluorescens. Additional Northern blot hybridization experiments confirmed that ptxS is transcribed in P. putida and P. fluorescens strains that carried no plasmid. The presence of a PtxS homologue in these strains was examined by DNA-gel shift experiments. Specific gel shift bands were detected when the lysates of P. aeruginosa, P. putida, and P. fluorescens were incubated with the ptxS operator site as probe. kgu-hybridizing sequences were detected in P. putida and P. fluorescens. These results suggest that (i) ptxR is present in P. aeruginosa, while ptxS is present in P. aeruginosa, P. putida, and P. fluorescens; (ii) both ptxR and ptxS are expressed in P. putida and P fluorescens; and (iii) a PtxS homologue may exist in P. putida and P. fluorescens.
TI  - Homologues of neisserial heme oxygenase in gram-negative bacteria: degradation of heme by the product of the pigA gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The oxidative cleavage of heme to release iron is a mechanism by which some bacterial pathogens can utilize heme as an iron source. The pigA gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is shown to encode a heme oxygenase protein, which was identified in the genome sequence by its significant homology (37%) with HemO of Neisseria meningitidis. When the gene encoding the neisserial heme oxygenase, hemO, was replaced with pigA, we demonstrated that pigA could functionally replace hemO and allow for heme utilization by neisseriae. Furthermore, when pigA was disrupted by cassette mutagenesis in P. aeruginosa, heme utilization was defective in iron-poor media supplemented with heme. This defect could be restored both by the addition of exogenous FeSO4, indicating that the mutant did not have a defect in iron metabolism, and by in trans complementation with pigA from a plasmid with an inducible promoter. The PigA protein was purified by ion-exchange chromotography. The UV-visible spectrum of PigA reconstituted with heme showed characteristics previously reported for other bacterial and mammalian heme oxygenases. The heme-PigA complex could be converted to ferric biliverdin in the presence of ascorbate, demonstrating the need for an exogenous reductant. Acidification and high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of the ascorbate reduction products identified a major product of biliverdin IX-beta. This differs from the previously characterized heme oxygenases in which biliverdin IX-alpha is the typical product. We conclude that PigA is a heme oxygenase and may represent a class of these enzymes with novel regiospecificity.
TI  - Expression of benzene dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida ML2 in cis-1,2-cyclohexanediol-degrading pseudomonads.
AB  - Benzene dioxygenase (BDO; EC 1.14.12.3) from Pseudomonas putida ML2 dihydroxylates benzene to produce cis-1,2-dihydroxy-cyclohexa-3,5-diene. As well as oxidising benzene and toluene, cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli JM109 expressing recombinant BDO oxidised cyclohexene, 1-methylcyclohexene and 3-methylcyclohexene. In an attempt to construct a novel metabolic pathway for the degradation of cyclohexene (via an initial BDO-mediated dihydroxylation of cyclohexene), cis-1,2-cyclohexanediol-degrading bacteria were isolated by enrichment culture. The bedC1C2BA genes encoding BDO (under the control of the tac promoter) were sub-cloned into pLAFR5, successfully conjugated into seven of the Gram-negative cis-1,2-cyclo-hexanediol-degrading isolates and stably maintained and expressed in three of them. However, despite their ability to grow on cis-1,2-cyclohexanediol as sole carbon source, express an active BDO and oxidise cyclohexene, none of the three strains was able to grow on cyclohexene as sole carbon source. Analysis revealed that BDO oxidised cyclohexene to a mixture of two products, a monohydroxylated (2-cyclohexen-1-ol) product and a dihydroxylated (cis-1,2-cyclohexanediol) product; and failure to grow on cyclohexene was attributed to the toxicity of metabolic intermediates accumulating from the 2-cyclohexen-1-ol metabolism.
TI  - Flagellin gene sequence variation in the genus Pseudomonas.
AB  - Flagellin gene (fliC) sequences from 18 strains of Pseudomonas sensu stricto representing 8 different species, and 9 representative fliC sequences from other members of the gamma sub-division of proteobacteria, were compared. Analysis was performed on N-terminal, C-terminal and whole fliC sequences. The fliC analyses confirmed the inferred relationship between P. mendocina, P. oleovorans and P. aeruginosa based on 16S rRNA sequence comparisons. In addition, the analyses indicated that P. putida PRS2000 was closely related to P. fluorescens SBW25 and P. fluorescens NCIMB 9046T, but suggested that P. putida PaW8 and P. putida PRS2000 were more closely related to other Pseudomonas spp. than they were to each other. There were a number of inconsistencies in inferred evolutionary relationships between strains, depending on the analysis performed. In particular, whole flagellin gene comparisons often differed from those obtained using N- and C-terminal sequences. However, there were also inconsistencies between the terminal region analyses, suggesting that phylogenetic relationships inferred on the basis of fliC sequence should be treated with caution. Although the central domain of fliC is highly variable between Pseudomonas strains, there was evidence of sequence similarities between the central domains of different Pseudomonas fliC sequences. This indicates the possibility of recombination in the central domain of fliC genes within Pseudomonas species, and between these genes and those from other bacteria.
TI  - Azurin involved in alcohol oxidation system in Pseudomonas putida HK5: expression analysis and gene cloning.
AB  - Expression of azurin in Pseudomonas putida HK5 was examined by immunoblot analysis. Similar amounts of azurin were found in the cells grown into the stationary phase on any carbon sources, including LB medium without alcohol, where no quinoprotein alcohol dehydrogenases appeared. In the early exponential phase, the highest amount of azurin was found in the cells grown on 1-butanol, but here was none in the case of LB medium, suggesting that expression of azurin is cooperative with that of the alcohol oxidase system, especially the system including quinohemoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase IIB. The azurin gene (azu) was cloned and sequenced. azu is monocistronic, and in its promoter region, FNR-binding consensus sequence was found. However, its relative position suggests different transcriptional regulation from that in azu of P. aeruginosa. The molecular weight of the mature protein without copper ion calculated from the amino acid sequence was consistent with the value of the purified azurin measured by mass spectrometry.
TI  - Metallo-beta-lactamases in clinical Pseudomonas isolates in Taiwan and identification of VIM-3, a novel variant of the VIM-2 enzyme.
AB  - A total of 209 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas (193 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10 P. putida, 4 P. stutzeri, and 2 P. fluorescens isolates) with reduced susceptibilities to imipenem and/or ceftazidime were subjected to PCR assays with primers specific for bla(IMP-1), bla(IMP-2), bla(VIM-1), and bla(VIM-2) and sequence analysis to identify the metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) prevalent among these organisms in Taiwan; and 21 isolates gave positive results. Five isolates including two P. putida and three P. stutzeri isolates were found to carry bla(IMP-1), and six isolates including five P. putida and one P. stutzeri isolates harbored bla(VIM-2). The remaining 10 isolates were P. aeruginosa, and all were found to carry a novel variant of bla(VIM-2), designated bla(VIM-3). There are only two nucleotide differences between bla(VIM-2) and bla(VIM-3), leading to two amino acid alterations. Our findings indicate that VIM-2 and its variant have become the most prevalent metalloenzymes in Pseudomonas in Taiwan. Southern hybridization with the bla(VIM-2)-, bla(VIM-3)-, and bla(IMP-1 )-specific probes revealed that only two VIM-2-producing P. putida isolates appeared to carry the MBL gene on plasmids. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that six VIM-3-producing P. aeruginosa isolates and two IMP-1-producing P. stutzeri isolates were genetically related, suggesting that the spread of these MBL genes in Taiwan could be due to clonal dissemination as well as genetic exchange between different clones.
TI  - Soft particle analysis of bacterial cells and its interpretation of cell adhesion behaviors in terms of DLVO theory.
AB  - The electrokinetic properties of two nitrifying strains, Nitrosomonas europaea and Nitrobacter winogradskyi, and three heterotrophic bacteria, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were examined by electrophoretic mobility measurement and analyzed using the soft particle electrophoresis theory that is suitable for biological particles. The bacterial adhesion characteristics onto glass bead substratum were also evaluated by packed bed method. The mobility of the bacterial cells employed converged to a non-zero value as the ionic concentration increased, suggesting that the bacterial cells exhibited typical soft particle characteristics. Moreover, cell surface potentials based on the soft particle theory were lower than those estimated by the conventional Smoluchowski formula, i.e. zeta potential. Cell collision efficiencies onto glass beads (alpha(0)) were largely dependent on interfacial interaction, although almost electrically neutral P. aeruginosa did not follow that trend. From a comparison of alpha(0) with DLVO interaction energy maximum (V(max)), it was assumed that heterocoagulation between cell and substratum at primary minimum potential took place under V(max) of 24-34 kT based on soft particle analysis. On the other hand, V(max) predictions using the Smoluchowski theory gave 81-223 kT, which indicated the possibility of overestimating electrostatic repulsive forces by the conventional Smoluchowski theory. Thus, the application of this new electrophoresis theory to several kinds of bacterial cells has led to the revision of the interpretation of bacterial mobility data and provided a more detailed understanding of the bacterial adhesion phenomenon.
TI  - Role of fatty acid de novo biosynthesis in polyhydroxyalkanoic acid (PHA) and rhamnolipid synthesis by pseudomonads: establishment of the transacylase (PhaG)-mediated pathway for PHA biosynthesis in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Since Pseudomonas aeruginosa is capable of biosynthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoic acid (PHA) and rhamnolipids, which contain lipid moieties that are derived from fatty acid biosynthesis, we investigated various fab mutants from P. aeruginosa with respect to biosynthesis of PHAs and rhamnolipids. All isogenic fabA, fabB, fabI, rhlG, and phaG mutants from P. aeruginosa showed decreased PHA accumulation and rhamnolipid production. In the phaG (encoding transacylase) mutant rhamnolipid production was only slightly decreased. Expression of phaG from Pseudomonas putida and expression of the beta-ketoacyl reductase gene rhlG from P. aeruginosa in these mutants indicated that PhaG catalyzes diversion of intermediates of fatty acid de novo biosynthesis towards PHA biosynthesis, whereas RhlG catalyzes diversion towards rhamnolipid biosynthesis. These data suggested that both biosynthesis pathways are competitive. In order to investigate whether PhaG is the only linking enzyme between fatty acid de novo biosynthesis and PHA biosynthesis, we generated five Tn5 mutants of P. putida strongly impaired in PHA production from gluconate. All mutants were complemented by the phaG gene from P. putida, indicating that the transacylase-mediated PHA biosynthesis route represents the only metabolic link between fatty acid de novo biosynthesis and PHA biosynthesis in this bacterium. The transacylase-mediated PHA biosynthesis route from gluconate was established in recombinant E. coli, coexpressing the class II PHA synthase gene phaC1 together with the phaG gene from P. putida, only when fatty acid de novo biosynthesis was partially inhibited by triclosan. The accumulated PHA contributed to 2 to 3% of cellular dry weight.
TI  - A broad host range replicon with different requirements for replication initiation in three bacterial species.
AB  - Plasmid RK2 is unusual in its ability to replicate stably in a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria. The replication origin (oriV) and a plasmid-encoded initiation protein (TrfA; expressed as 33 and 44 kDa forms) are essential for RK2 replication. To examine initiation events in bacteria unrelated to Escherichia coli, the genes encoding the replicative helicase, DnaB, of Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated and used to construct protein expression vectors. The purified proteins were tested for activity along with E.coli DnaB at RK2 oriV. Each helicase could be recruited and activated at the RK2 origin in the presence of the host-specific DnaA protein and the TrfA protein. Escherichia coli or P.putida DnaB was active with either TrfA-33 or TrfA-44, while P.aeruginosa DnaB required TrfA-44 for activation. Moreover, unlike the E.coli DnaB helicase, both Pseudomonas helicases could be delivered and activated at oriV in the absence of an ATPase accessory protein. Thus, a DnaC-like accessory ATPase is not universally required for loading the essential replicative helicase at a replication origin.
TI  - The iron- and temperature-regulated cjrBC genes of Shigella and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli strains code for colicin Js uptake.
AB  - A cosmid library of DNA from colicin Js-sensitive enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) strain O164 was made in colicin Js-resistant strain E. coli VCS257, and colicin Js-sensitive clones were identified. Sensitivity to colicin Js was associated with the carriage of a three-gene operon upstream of and partially overlapping senB. The open reading frames were designated cjrABC (for colicin Js receptor), coding for proteins of 291, 258, and 753 amino acids, respectively. Tn7 insertions in any of them led to complete resistance to colicin Js. A near-consensus Fur box was found upstream of cjrA, suggesting regulation of the cjr operon by iron levels. CjrA protein was homologous to iron-regulated Pseudomonas aeruginosa protein PhuW, whose function is unknown; CjrB was homologous to the TonB protein from Pseudomonas putida; and CjrC was homologous to a putative outer membrane siderophore receptor from Campylobacter jejuni. Cloning experiments showed that the cjrB and cjrC genes are sufficient for colicin Js sensitivity. Uptake of colicin Js into sensitive bacteria was dependent on the ExbB protein but not on the E. coli K-12 TonB and TolA, -B, and -Q proteins. Sensitivity to colicin Js is positively regulated by temperature via the VirB protein and negatively controlled by the iron source through the Fur protein. Among EIEC strains, two types of colicin Js-sensitive phenotypes were identified that differed in sensitivity to colicin Js by 1 order of magnitude. The difference in sensitivity to colicin Js is not due to differences between the sequences of the CjrB and CjrC proteins.
TI  - Regulation of rpoS gene expression in Pseudomonas: involvement of a TetR family regulator.
AB  - The rpoS gene encodes the sigma factor which was identified in several gram-negative bacteria as a central regulator during stationary phase. rpoS gene regulation is known to respond to cell density, showing higher expression in stationary phase. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, it has been demonstrated that the cell-density-dependent regulation response known as quorum sensing interacts with this regulatory response. Using the rpoS promoter of P. putida, we identified a genomic Tn5 insertion mutant of P. putida which showed a 90% decrease in rpoS promoter activity, resulting in less RpoS being present in a cell at stationary phase. Molecular analysis revealed that this mutant carried a Tn5 insertion in a gene, designated psrA (Pseudomonas sigma regulator), which codes for a protein (PsrA) of 26.3 kDa. PsrA contains a helix-turn-helix motif typical of DNA binding proteins and belongs to the TetR family of bacterial regulators. The homolog of the psrA gene was identified in P. aeruginosa; the protein showed 90% identity to PsrA of P. putida. A psrA::Tn5 insertion mutant of P. aeruginosa was constructed. In both Pseudomonas species, psrA was genetically linked to the SOS lexA repressor gene. Similar to what was observed for P. putida, a psrA null mutant of P. aeruginosa also showed a 90% reduction in rpoS promoter activity; both mutants could be complemented for rpoS promoter activity when the psrA gene was provided in trans. psrA mutants of both Pseudomonas species lost the ability to induce rpoS expression at stationary phase, but they retained the ability to produce quorum-sensing autoinducer molecules. PsrA was demonstrated to negatively regulate psrA gene expression in Pseudomonas and in Escherichia coli as well as to be capable of activating the rpoS promoter in E. coli. Our data suggest that PsrA is an important regulatory protein of Pseudomonas spp. involved in the regulatory cascade controlling rpoS gene regulation in response to cell density.
TI  - Screening for ribosomal-based false positives following prokaryotic mRNA differential display.
AB  - Differential display (DD) and the closely related RNA arbitrarily primed PCR (RAP-PCR) have become the molecular tools of choice for identifying and isolating differentially expressed genes in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems. However, one of the current drawbacks of both techniques is the high number of false positives generated. In prokaryotic applications, the many false positive typically generated by DD are subsequently identified as rRNAs because of their greater abundance compared to mRNAs. To circumvent this problem, full-length 16S and 23S rDNA probes, derived from Pseudomonas putida G7 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa FRD1, respectively, were used as a prescreening approach to discriminate between those bands, which appear to be differentially expressed mRNAs, but in fact are rRNAs, following prokaryotic mRNA DD.
TI  - Multidrug efflux pumps and antimicrobial resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and related organisms.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen characterized by an innate resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents. A major contribution to this intrinsic multidrug resistance is provided by a number of broadly-specific multidrug efflux systems, including MexAB-OprM and MexXY-OprM. In addition, these and two additional tripartite efflux systems, MexCD-OprJ and MexEF-OprN, promote acquired multidrug resistance as a result of mutational hyperexpression of the efflux genes. In addition to antibiotics, these pumps promote export of numerous dyes, detergents, inhibitors, disinfectants, organic solvents and homoserine lactones involved in quorum sensing. The efflux pump proteins are highly homologous and consist of a cytoplasmic membrane-associated drug-proton antiporter of the Resistance-Nodulation-Division (RND) family, an outer membrane channel-forming protein [sometimes called outer membrane factor (OMF)] and a periplasmic membrane fusion protein (MFP). Homologues of these systems have been described in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia cepacia, Burkholderia pseudomallei and the non-pathogen Pseudomonas putida, where they play a role in export of and resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents and/or organic solvents. Although the natural function of these multidrug efflux systems is largely unknown, their contribution to antibiotic resistance and their conservation in a number of important human pathogens makes them logical targets for therapeutic intervention.
TI  - Chromosomal locus for cadmium resistance in Pseudomonas putida consisting of a cadmium-transporting ATPase and a MerR family response regulator.
AB  - Pseudomonads from environmental sources vary widely in their sensitivity to cadmium, but the basis for this resistance is largely uncharacterized. A chromosomal fragment encoding cadmium resistance was cloned from Pseudomonas putida 06909, a rhizosphere bacterium, and sequence analysis revealed two divergently transcribed genes, cadA and cadR. CadA was similar to cadmium-transporting ATPases known mostly from gram-positive bacteria, and to ZntA, a lead-, zinc-, and cadmium-transporting ATPase from Escherichia coli. CadR was related to the MerR family of response regulators that normally control mercury detoxification in other bacterial systems. A related gene, zntR, regulates zntA in E. coli, but it is not contiguous with zntA in the E. coli genome as cadA and cadR were in P. putida. In addition, unlike ZntA and other CadA homologs, but similar to the predicted product of gene PA3690 in the P. aeruginosa genome, the P. putida CadA sequence had a histidine-rich N-terminal extension. CadR and the product of PA3689 of P. aeruginosa also had histidine-rich C-terminal extensions not found in other MerR family response regulators. Mutational analysis indicated that cadA and cadR are fully responsible for cadmium resistance and partially for zinc resistance. However, unlike zntA, they did not confer significant levels of lead resistance. The cadA promoter was responsive to Cd(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II), while the cadR promoter was only induced by Cd(II). CadR apparently represses its own expression at the transcriptional level. However, CadR apparently does not repress cadA. Homologs of the cadmium-transporting ATPase were detected in many other Pseudomonas species.
TI  - The essential HupB and HupN proteins of Pseudomonas putida provide redundant and  nonspecific DNA-bending functions.
AB  - A protein mixture containing two major components able to catalyze a beta-recombination reaction requiring nonspecific DNA bending was obtained by fractionation of a Pseudomonas putida extract. N-terminal sequence analysis and genomic data base searches identified the major component as an analogue of HupB of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, encoding one HU protein variant. The minor component of the fraction, termed HupN, was divergent enough from HupB to predict a separate DNA-bending competence. The determinants of the two proteins were cloned and hyperexpressed, and the gene products were purified. Their activities were examined in vitro in beta-recombination assays and in vivo by complementation of the Hbsu function of Bacillus subtilis. HupB and HupN were equally efficient in all tests, suggesting that they are independent and functionally redundant DNA bending proteins. This was reflected in the maintenance of in vivo activity of the final sigma54 Ps promoter of the toluene degradation plasmid, TOL, which requires facilitated DNA bending, in DeltahupB or DeltahupN strains. However, hupB/hupN double mutants were not viable. It is suggested that the requirement for protein-facilitated DNA bending is met in P. putida by two independent proteins that ensure an adequate supply of an essential cellular activity.
TI  - Distribution of catabolic pathways in some hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria from a  subsurface polluted soil.
AB  - Enrichment cultures on naphtha solvent were used to select aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria from a BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene)-contaminated subsoil obtained from beneath a paint factory located in Milan, Italy. Fifteen isolated strains were studied for their different biodegradative capacities. Among these, 13 were able to grow on naphtha solvent. Ten were identified as Pseudomonas putida and three as Pseudomonas aureofaciens. Two other degraders were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans subsp. denitrificans. Further molecular characterization of the isolates was carried out by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis to ascertain that all the studied strains belonged to different haplotypes. The isolates were characterized for the presence of genes encoding for toluene dioxygenase, xylene monooxygenase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase by polymerase chain reaction analysis and by Southern analysis. P. putida strain CM23, which showed homology with xylA,M, xylE and todC1C2BA genes, possessed multiple pathways which enabled the strain to grow on benzene, toluene and m-xylene.
TI  - Metabolic engineering of bacteria for environmental applications: construction of Pseudomonas strains for biodegradation of 2-chlorotoluene.
AB  - In this article, we illustrate the challenges and bottlenecks in the metabolic engineering of bacteria destined for environmental bioremediation, by reporting current efforts to construct Pseudomonas strains genetically designed for degradation of the recalcitrant compound 2-chlorotoluene. The assembled pathway includes one catabolic segment encoding the toluene dioxygenase of the TOD system of Pseudomonas putida F1 (todC1C2BA), which affords the bioconversion of 2-chlorotoluene into 2-chlorobenzaldehyde by virtue of its residual methyl-monooxygenase activity on o-substituted substrates. A second catabolic segment encoded the entire upper TOL pathway from pWW0 plasmid of P. putida mt-2. The enzymes, benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase (encoded by xylB) and benzaldehyde dehydrogenase (xylC) of this segment accept o-chloro-substituted substrates all the way down to 2-chlorobenzoate. These TOL and TOD segments were assembled in separate mini-Tn5 transposon vectors, such that expression of the encoded genes was dependent on the toluene-responsive Pu promoter of the TOL plasmid and the cognate XylR regulator. Such gene cassettes (mini-Tn5 [UPP2] and mini-Tn5 [TOD2]) were inserted in the chromosome of the 2-chlorobenzoate degraders Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA142 and P. aeruginosa JB2. GC-MS analysis of the metabolic intermediates present in the culture media of the resulting strains verified that these possessed, not only the genetic information, but also the functional ability to mineralise 2-chlorotoluene. However, although these strains did convert the substrate into 2-chlorobenzoate, they failed to grow on 2-chlorotoluene as the only carbon source. These results pinpoint the rate of the metabolic fluxes, the non-productive spill of side-metabolites and the physiological control of degradative pathways as the real bottlenecks for degradation of certain pollutants, rather than the theoretical enzymatic and genetic fitness of the recombinant bacteria to the process. Choices to address this general problem are discussed.
TI  - The gdhB gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes an arginine-inducible NAD(+)-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase which is subject to allosteric regulation.
AB  - The NAD(+)-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (NAD-GDH) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 was purified, and its amino-terminal amino acid sequence was determined. This sequence information was used in identifying and cloning the encoding gdhB gene and its flanking regions. The molecular mass predicted from the derived sequence for the encoded NAD-GDH was 182.6 kDa, in close agreement with that determined from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme (180 kDa). Cross-linking studies established that the native NAD-GDH is a tetramer of equal subunits. Comparison of the derived amino acid sequence of NAD-GDH from P. aeruginosa with the GenBank database showed the highest homology with hypothetical polypeptides from Pseudomonas putida, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Rickettsia prowazakii, Legionella pneumophila, Vibrio cholerae, Shewanella putrefaciens, Sinorhizobium meliloti, and Caulobacter crescentus. A moderate degree of homology, primarily in the central domain, was observed with the smaller tetrameric NAD-GDH (protomeric mass of 110 kDa) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Neurospora crassa. Comparison with the yet smaller hexameric GDH (protomeric mass of 48 to 55 kDa) of other prokaryotes yielded a low degree of homology that was limited to residues important for binding of substrates and for catalytic function. NAD-GDH was induced 27-fold by exogenous arginine and only 3-fold by exogenous glutamate. Primer extension experiments established that transcription of gdhB is initiated from an arginine-inducible promoter and that this induction is dependent on the arginine regulatory protein, ArgR, a member of the AraC/XyIS family of regulatory proteins. NAD-GDH was purified to homogeneity from a recombinant strain of P. aeruginosa and characterized. The glutamate saturation curve was sigmoid, indicating positive cooperativity in the binding of glutamate. NAD-GDH activity was subject to allosteric control by arginine and citrate, which function as positive and negative effectors, respectively. Both effectors act by influencing the affinity of the enzyme for glutamate. NAD-GDH from this organism differs from previously characterized enzymes with respect to structure, protomer mass, and allosteric properties indicate that this enzyme represents a novel class of microbial glutamate dehydrogenases.
TI  - Control of the ferric citrate transport system of Escherichia coli: mutations in  region 2.1 of the FecI extracytoplasmic-function sigma factor suppress mutations in the FecR transmembrane regulatory protein.
AB  - Transcription of the ferric citrate transport genes is initiated by binding of ferric citrate to the FecA protein in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli K-12. Bound ferric citrate does not have to be transported but initiates a signal that is transmitted by FecA across the outer membrane and by FecR across the cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm, where the FecI extracytoplasmic-function (ECF) sigma factor becomes active. In this study, we isolated transcription initiation-negative missense mutants in the cytoplasmic region of FecR that were located at four sites, L13Q, W19R, W39R, and W50R, which are highly conserved in FecR-like open reading frames of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and Caulobacter crescentus genomes. The cytoplasmic portion of the FecR mutant proteins, FecR(1-85), did not interact with wild-type FecI, in contrast to wild-type FecR(1-85), which induced FecI-mediated fecB transport gene transcription. Two missense mutations in region 2.1 of FecI, S15A and H20E, partially restored induction of ferric citrate transport gene induction of the fecR mutants by ferric citrate. Region 2.1 of sigma(70) is thought to bind RNA polymerase core enzyme; the residual activity of mutated FecI in the absence of FecR, however, was not higher than that of wild-type FecI. In addition, missense mutations in the fecI promoter region resulted in a twofold increased transcription in fecR wild-type cells and a partial restoration of fec transport gene transcription in the fecR mutants. The mutations reduced binding of the Fe(2+) Fur repressor and as a consequence enhanced fecI transcription. The data reveal properties of the FecI ECF factor distinct from those of sigma(70) and further support the novel transcription initiation model in which the cytoplasmic portion of FecR is important for FecI activity.
TI  - Analysis of the alternative pathways for the beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty  acids using transgenic plants synthesizing polyhydroxyalkanoates in peroxisomes.
AB  - Degradation of fatty acids having cis-double bonds on even-numbered carbons requires the presence of auxiliary enzymes in addition to the enzymes of the core beta-oxidation cycle. Two alternative pathways have been described to degrade these fatty acids. One pathway involves the participation of the enzymes 2, 4-dienoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase and Delta(3)-Delta(2)-enoyl-CoA isomerase, whereas the second involves the epimerization of R-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA via a 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA epimerase or the action of two stereo-specific enoyl-CoA hydratases. Although degradation of these fatty acids in bacteria and mammalian peroxisomes was shown to involve mainly the reductase-isomerase pathway, previous analysis of the relative activity of the enoyl-CoA hydratase II (also called R-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA hydro-lyase) and 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase in plants indicated that degradation occurred mainly through the epimerase pathway. We have examined the implication of both pathways in transgenic Arabidopsis expressing the polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa in peroxisomes and producing polyhydroxyalkanoate from the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediates of the beta-oxidation cycle. Analysis of the polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesized in plants grown in media containing cis-10-heptadecenoic or cis-10-pentadecenoic acids revealed a significant contribution of both the reductase-isomerase and epimerase pathways to the degradation of these fatty acids.
TI  - Activation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase in Pseudomonas putida by triggering dissociation of the propeptide-enzyme complex.
AB  - The propeptide of Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase functions both as an intramolecular chaperone required for the folding of the enzyme and as an inhibitor that prevents activity of the enzyme before its secretion into the extracellular medium. Since expression of the lasB gene, which encodes elastase, in Pseudomonas putida did not result in extracellular elastase activity, it has been suggested that the enzyme is not recognized by the Xcp secretion machinery of the heterologous host. Here, it is demonstrated that the proenzyme is normally processed in P. putida and that it is indeed not actively secreted by the Xcp machinery. Nevertheless, substantial amounts of the enzyme were detected in the extracellular medium. Co-immunoprecipitations revealed that the extracellular enzyme was associated with the propeptide, which explains the lack of enzymic activity. Since the propeptide-enzyme complex in P. putida apparently does not dissociate spontaneously, it is concluded that a host-specific factor is required to induce this event. Mutants were selected which showed extracellular elastase activity. Two mutations, located within the lasB gene, were further characterized. These mutations, resulting in the substitution of Ala and Thr at positions -15 and -153, respectively, of the propeptide (where position +1 is defined as the first residue of the mature enzyme) destabilized the propeptide-enzyme complex. It is concluded that Ala-15 and Thr-153 are required for the inhibitor function, but not for the chaperone function of the propeptide.
TI  - Quantification of biofilm structures by the novel computer program COMSTAT.
AB  - The structural organization of four microbial communities was analysed by a novel computer program, COMSTAT, which comprises ten features for quantifying three-dimensional biofilm image stacks. Monospecies biofilms of each of the four bacteria, Pseudomonas: putida, P. aureofaciens, P. fluorescens and P. aeruginosa, tagged with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) were grown in flow chambers with a defined minimal medium as substrate. Analysis by the COMSTAT program of four variables describing biofilm structure - mean thickness, roughness, substratum coverage and surface to volume ratio - showed that the four Pseudomonas: strains represent different modes of biofilm growth. P. putida had a unique developmental pattern starting with single cells on the substratum growing into micro-colonies, which were eventually succeeded by long filaments and elongated cell clusters. P. aeruginosa colonized the entire substratum, and formed flat, uniform biofilms. P. aureofaciens resembled P. aeruginosa, but had a stronger tendency to form micro-colonies. Finally, the biofilm structures of P. fluorescens had a phenotype intermediate between those of P. putida and P. aureofaciens. Analysis of biofilms of P. aureofaciens growing on 0.03 mM, 0.1 mM or 0.5 mM citrate minimal media showed that mean biofilm thickness increased with increasing citrate concentration. Moreover, biofilm roughness increased with lower citrate concentrations, whereas surface to volume ratio increased with higher citrate concentrations.
TI  - Phylogeny of the genus Pseudomonas: intrageneric structure reconstructed from the nucleotide sequences of gyrB and rpoD genes.
AB  - Phylogenetic analysis of the genus Pseudomonas: was conducted by using the combined gyrB and rpoD nucleotide sequences of 31 validly described species of Pseudomonas: (a total of 125 strains). Pseudomonas: strains diverged into two major clusters designated intrageneric cluster I (IGC I) and intrageneric cluster II (IGC II). IGC I was further split into two subclusters, the 'P: aeruginosa complex', which included P: aeruginosa, P: alcaligenes, P: citronellolis, P: mendocina, P: oleovorans and P: pseudoalcaligenes, and the 'P: stutzeri complex', which included P: balearica and P: stutzeri. IGC II was further split into three subclusters that were designated the 'P: putida complex', the 'P: syringae complex' and the 'P: fluorescens complex'. The 'P: putida complex' included P: putida and P: fulva. The 'P: syringae complex' was the cluster of phytopathogens including P: amygdali, P: caricapapayae, P: cichorii, P: ficuserectae, P: viridiflava and the pathovars of P. savastanoi and P. syringae. The 'P. fluorescens complex' was further divided into two subpopulations, the 'P. fluorescens lineage' and the 'P. chlororaphis lineage'. The 'P. fluorescens lineage' contained P. fluorescens biotypes A, B and C, P. azotoformans, P. marginalis pathovars, P. mucidolens, P. synxantha and P. tolaasii, while the 'P. chlororaphis lineage' included P. chlororaphis, P. agarici, P. asplenii, P. corrugata, P. fluorescens biotypes B and G and P. putida biovar B. The strains of P. fluorescens biotypes formed a polyphyletic group within the 'P. fluorescens complex'.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide sensitivity of catechol-2,3-dioxygenase: a cautionary note on use of xylE reporter fusions under aerobic conditions.
AB  - Catechol-2,3-dioxygenase (C23O) of Pseudomonas putida, encoded by the xylE gene,  was found to be sensitive to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) when used as a reporter in gene fusion constructs. Exposure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa katA or katA katB mutants harboring katA- or katB-lacZ (encoding beta-galactosidase) or -xylE fusion plasmids to H(2)O(2) stimulated beta-galactosidase activity, while there was little or no detectable C23O activity in these strains. More than 95% of C23O activity was lost after a 5-min exposure to equimolar H(2)O(2), while a 10,000-fold excess was required for similar inhibition of beta-galactosidase. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of the nitrosyl complexes of C23O showed that H(2)O(2) nearly stoichiometrically oxidized the essential active-site ferrous ion, thus accounting for the loss of activity. Our results suggest using caution in interpreting data derived from xylE reporter fusions under aerobic conditions, especially where oxidative stress is present or when catalase-deficient strains are used.
TI  - Pm promoter expression mutants and their use in broad-host-range RK2 plasmid vectors.
AB  - By coupling the Pm/xylS promoter system to minimal replicons of the broad-host-range plasmid RK2 we recently showed that such vectors are useful for both high- and low-level inducible expression of cloned genes in gram-negative bacteria. In this report, we extend this potential by identifying point mutations in or near the -10 transcriptional region of Pm. Point mutations leading to gene-independent enhancements of expression levels of the induced state or reduced background expression levels were identified using Escherichia coli as a host. By combining these mutations an additive effect in expression levels from the constructed Pm was observed. The highest induced expression level was obtained by inserting an E. coli consensus sigma70 - 10 recognition region. Most of the remaining activities in the reduced-background mutations appeared to originate from a transcriptional start site other than Pm. The effects of some of these mutations were also analyzed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and were found to act similarly, but less pronounced in this host.
TI  - Parameters affecting gene expression from the Pm promoter in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The Pm promoter inserted chromosomally or in broad-host-range replicons based on  plasmid RSF1010 or RK2 are useful systems for both high- and low-level expression of cloned genes in several gram-negative bacterial species. The positive Pm regulator XylS is activated by certain substituted benzoic acid derivatives, and here we show that these effectors induce expression of Pm at similar relative ranking levels in both Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa However, the kinetics of expression was not the same in the two organisms. Different carbon sources and dissolved oxygen levels displayed limited effects on expression, but surprisingly the pH of the growth medium was found to be of major importance. By combining the effects of genetic and environmental parameters, expression from Pm could be varied over a ten-thousand- to a hundred-thousand-fold continuous range, and as an example of its applications we showed that Pm can be used to control the xanthan biosynthesis in Xanthomonas campestris.
TI  - TrfA-dependent inner membrane-associated plasmid RK2 DNA synthesis and association of TrfA with membranes of different gram-negative hosts.
AB  - TrfA, the replication initiator protein of broad-host-range plasmid RK2, was tested for its ability to bind to the membrane of four different gram-negative hosts in addition to Escherichia coli: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Cells harboring TrfA-encoding plasmids were fractionated into soluble, inner membrane, and outer membrane fractions. The fractions were subjected to Western blotting, and the blots were probed with antibody to the TrfA proteins. TrfA was found to fractionate with the cell membranes of all species tested. When the two membrane fractions of these species were tested for their ability to synthesize plasmid DNA endogenously (i.e., without added template or enzymes), only the inner membrane fraction was capable of extensive synthesis that was inhibited by anti-TrfA antibody in a manner similar to that of the original host species, E. coli. In addition, although DNA synthesis did occur in the outer membrane fraction, it was much less extensive than that exhibited by the inner membrane fraction and only slightly affected by anti-TrfA antibody. Plasmid DNA synthesized by the inner membrane fraction of one representative species, P. aeruginosa, was characteristic of supercoil and intermediate forms of the plasmid. Extensive DNA synthesis was observed in the soluble fraction of another representative species, R. sphaeroides, but it was completely unaffected by anti-TrfA antibody, suggesting that such synthesis was due to repair and/or nonspecific chain extension of plasmid DNA fragments.
TI  - Diversity and correlation of specific aromatic hydrocarbon biodegradation capabilities.
AB  - This work investigated the biodegradation capabilities of indigenous microorganisms exposed to different combinations of aromatic hydrocarbons. Considerable diversity was found in the catabolic specificity of 55 strains. Toluene was the most commonly degraded compound, followed by p-xylene, m-xylene and ethylbenzene. Strains capable of degrading o-xylene and benzene, which were the least-frequently-degraded compounds, exhibited broader biodegradation capabilities. Kappa statistics showed a significant correlation between the abilities to degrade toluene and ethylbenzene, p-xylene and m-xylene, and p-xylene and o-xylene. The ability to degrade naphthalene was correlated to the ability to degrade other alkylbenzenes, but not benzene. In addition, the inability to degrade benzene was correlated to the inability to degrade o-xylene. Factorial analysis of variance showed that biodegradation capabilities were generally broader when aromatic hydrocarbons were fed as mixtures than when fed separately. Beneficial substrate interactions included enhanced degradation of benzene, p-xylene, and naphthalene when toluene was present, and enhanced degradation of naphthalene by ethylbenzene. Such heuristic relationships may be useful to predict biodegradation patterns when bacteria are exposed to different aromatic hydrocarbon mixtures.
TI  - Virulence of the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola is rpoN dependent.
AB  - We cloned the rpoN (ntrA and glnF) gene encoding sigma(54) from the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola strain ES4326. The P. syringae ES4326 rpoN gene complemented Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella aerogenes rpoN mutants for a variety of rpoN mutant phenotypes, including the inability to utilize nitrate as sole nitrogen source. DNA sequence analysis of the P. syringae ES4326 rpoN gene revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence was most similar (86% identity; 95% similarity) to the sigma(54) protein encoded by the Pseudomonas putida rpoN gene. A marker exchange protocol was used to construct an ES4326 rpoN insertional mutation, rpoN::Km(r). In contrast to wild-type ES4326, ES4326 rpoN::Km(r) was nonmotile and could not utilize nitrate, urea, C(4)-dicarboxylic acids, several amino acids, or concentrations of ammonia below 2 mM as nitrogen sources. rpoN was essential for production of the phytotoxin coronatine and for expression of the structural genes encoding coronamic acid. In addition, ES4326 rpoN::Km(r) did not multiply or elicit disease symptoms when infiltrated into Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, did not elicit the accumulation of several Arabidopsis defense-related mRNAs, and did not elicit a hypersensitive response (HR) when infiltrated into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves. Furthermore, whereas P. syringae ES4326 carrying the avirulence gene avrRpt2 elicited an HR when infiltrated into Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia leaves, ES4326 rpoN::Km(r) carrying avrRpt2 elicited no response. Constitutive expression of ES4326 hrpL in ES4326 rpoN::Km(r) partially restored defense-related mRNA accumulation, showing a direct role for the hrp cluster in host defense gene induction in a compatible host-pathogen interaction. However, constitutive expression of hrpL in ES4326 rpoN::Km(r) did not restore coronatine production, showing that coronatine biosynthesis requires factors other than hrpL.
TI  - Evolution of a degradative bacterial consortium during the enrichment of naphtha  solvent.
AB  - A microbial mixed culture able to degrade naphtha solvent, a model of hydrocarbon aromatic mixture, was isolated from a hydrocarbon-polluted soil. Composition of the population was monitored by phenotypic and molecular methods applied on soil DNA, on whole enrichment culture DNA, and on 85 isolated strains. Strains were characterized for their 16S rDNA restriction profiles and for their random amplified polymorphic DNA profiles. Catabolic capabilities were monitored by phenotypic traits and by PCR assays for the presence of the catabolic genes methyl mono-oxygenase ( xylA, M), catechol 2,3 dioxygenase (xylE) and toluene dioxygenase (todC1) of TOL and TOD pathways. Different haplotypes belonging to Pseudomonas putida, Ps. aureofaciens and Ps. aeruginosa were found to degrade aromatic compounds and naphtha solvent. The intrinsic catabolic activity of the microbial population of the polluted site was detected by PCR amplification of the xylE gene directly from soil DNA.
TI  - Heterologous expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and purification of the 9.2-kDa c-type cytochrome subunit of p-cresol methylhydroxylase.
AB  - The 9.2-kDa c-type cytochrome subunit (PchC) of the flavocytochrome p-cresol methylhydroxylase from Pseudomonas putida NCIMB 9869 has been overexpressed in recombinant form in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1-LAC, using the recently developed pUCP-Nde vector. Efforts to produce the cytochrome in Escherichia coli using a pET vector, with or without its signal peptide, were generally unsuccessful, yielding relatively low levels of the protein. In contrast, the mature form of PchC accumulated in the periplasmic space of P. aeruginosa PAO1-LAC to about 1 mg/g wet cell paste. A periplasmic fraction enriched to about 12% (w/w) of total protein with recombinant PchC was isolated from the remainder of the cells by a washing procedure using ethylenediaminetetraacetate in the presence of sucrose. The cytochrome was purified to homogeneity from the periplasmic extract by anion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B followed by chromatofocusing on PolyBuffer Exchanger 94. Purified PchC was obtained in a yield of about 50% and was shown to be identical to that resolved from the native flavocytochrome isolated from P. putida. This system may prove to be of general use for the production of recombinant c-type cytochromes.
TI  - PhaG-mediated synthesis of Poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) consisting of medium-chain-length constituents from nonrelated carbon sources in recombinant Pseudomonas fragi.
AB  - Recently, a new metabolic link between fatty acid de novo biosynthesis and biosynthesis of poly(3-hydroxy-alkanoate) consisting of medium-chain-length constituents (C(6) to C(14)) (PHA(MCL)), catalyzed by the 3-hydroxydecanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]:CoA transacylase (PhaG), has been identified in Pseudomonas putida (B. H. A. Rehm, N. Kruger, and A. Steinbuchel, J. Biol. Chem. 273:24044-24051, 1998). To establish this PHA-biosynthetic pathway in a non-PHA-accumulating bacterium, we functionally coexpressed phaC1 (encoding PHA synthase 1) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and phaG (encoding the transacylase) from P. putida in Pseudomonas fragi. The recombinant strains of P. fragi were cultivated on gluconate as the sole carbon source, and PHA accumulation to about 14% of the total cellular dry weight was achieved. The respective polyester was isolated, and GPC analysis revealed a weight average molar mass of about 130,000 g mol(-1) and a polydispersity of 2.2. The PHA was composed mainly (60 mol%) of 3-hydroxydecanoate. These data strongly suggested that functional expression of phaC1 and phaG established a new pathway for PHA(MCL) biosynthesis from nonrelated carbon sources in P. fragi. When fatty acids were used as the carbon source, no PHA accumulation was observed in PHA synthase-expressing P. fragi, whereas application of the beta-oxidation inhibitor acrylic acid mediated PHA(MCL) accumulation. The substrate for the PHA synthase PhaC1 is therefore presumably directly provided through the enzymatic activity of the transacylase PhaG by the conversion of (R)-3-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP to (R)-3-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA when the organism is cultivated on gluconate. Here we demonstrate for the first time the establishment of PHA(MCL) synthesis from nonrelated carbon sources in a non-PHA-accumulating bacterium, employing fatty acid de novo biosynthesis and the enzymes PhaG (a transacylase) and PhaC1 (a PHA synthase).
TI  - The ssu locus plays a key role in organosulfur metabolism in Pseudomonas putida S-313.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida S-313 can utilize a broad range of aromatic sulfonates as sulfur sources for growth in sulfate-free minimal medium. The sulfonates are cleaved monooxygenolytically to yield the corresponding phenols. miniTn5 mutants of strain S-313 which were no longer able to desulfurize arylsulfonates were isolated and were found to carry transposon insertions in the ssuEADCBF operon, which contained genes for an ATP-binding cassette-type transporter (ssuABC), a two-component reduced flavin mononucleotide-dependent monooxygenase (ssuED) closely related to the Escherichia coli alkanesulfonatase, and a protein related to clostridial molybdopterin-binding proteins (ssuF). These mutants were also deficient in growth with a variety of other organosulfur sources, including aromatic and aliphatic sulfate esters, methionine, and aliphatic sulfonates other than the natural sulfonates taurine and cysteate. This pleiotropic phenotype was complemented by the ssu operon, confirming its key role in organosulfur metabolism in this species. Further complementation analysis revealed that the ssuF gene product was required for growth with all of the tested substrates except methionine and that the oxygenase encoded by ssuD was required for growth with sulfonates or methionine. The flavin reductase SsuE was not required for growth with aliphatic sulfonates or methionine but was needed for growth with arylsulfonates, suggesting that an alternative isozyme exists for the former compounds that is not active in transformation of the latter substrates. Aryl sulfate ester utilization was catalyzed by an arylsulfotransferase, and not by an arylsulfatase as in the related species Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Interactions of DnaA proteins from distantly related bacteria with the replication origin of the broad host range plasmid RK2.
AB  - Replication initiation of the broad host range plasmid RK2 requires binding of the host-encoded DnaA protein to specific sequences (DnaA boxes) at its replication origin (oriV). In contrast to a chromosomal replication origin, which functionally interacts only with the native DnaA protein of the organism, the ability of RK2 to replicate in a wide range of Gram-negative bacterial hosts requires the interaction of oriV with many different DnaA proteins. In this study we compared the interactions of oriV with five different DnaA proteins. DNase I footprint, gel mobility shift, and surface plasmon resonance analyses showed that the DnaA proteins from Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bind to the DnaA boxes at oriV and are capable of inducing open complex formation, the first step in the replication initiation process. However, DnaA proteins from two Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Streptomyces lividans, while capable of specifically interacting with the DnaA box sequences at oriV, do not bind stably and fail to induce open complex formation. These results suggest that the inability of the DnaA protein of a host bacterium to form a stable and functional complex with the DnaA boxes at oriV is a limiting step for plasmid host range.
TI  - The Pseudomonas aeruginosa phaG gene product is involved in the synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoic acid consisting of medium-chain-length constituents from non-related carbon sources.
AB  - We recently identified the phaG(Pp) gene encoding (R)-3-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP:CoA transacylase in Pseudomonas putida, which directly links the fatty acid de novo biosynthesis and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biosynthesis. An open reading frame (ORF) of which the deduced amino acid sequence shared about 57% identity with PhaG from P. putida was identified in the P. aeruginosa genome sequence. Its coding region (herein called phaG(Pa)) was amplified by PCR and cloned into the vector pBBR1MCS-2 under lac promoter control. The resulting plasmid pBHR88 mediated PHA synthesis contributing to about 13% of cellular dry weight from non-related carbon sources in the phaG(Pp)-negative mutant P. putida PhaG(N)-21. The PHA was composed of 5 mol% 3-hydroxydodecanoate, 61 mol% 3-hydroxydecanoate, 29 mol% 3-hydroxyoctanoate and 5 mol% 3-hydroxyhexanoate. Furthermore, an isogenic phaG(Pa) knock-out mutant of P. aeruginosa was constructed by gene replacement. The phaG(Pa) mutant did not show any difference in growth rate, but PHA accumulation from gluconate was decreased to about 40% of wild-type level, whereas from fatty acids wild-type level PHA accumulation was obtained. These data suggested that PhaG from P. aeruginosa exhibits 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP:CoA transacylase activity and strongly enhances the metabolic flux from fatty acid de novo synthesis towards PHA(MCL) synthesis. Therefore, a function could be assigned to the ORF present in the P. aeruginosa genome, and a second PhaG is now known.
TI  - Functional analysis of PvdS, an iron starvation sigma factor of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, iron modulates gene expression through a cascade of negative and positive regulatory proteins. The master regulator Fur is involved in iron-dependent repression of several genes. One of these genes, pvdS, was predicted to encode a putative sigma factor responsible for the transcription of a subset of genes of the Fur regulon. PvdS appears to belong to a structurally and functionally distinct subgroup of the extracytoplasmic function family of alternative sigma factors. Members of this subgroup, also including PbrA from Pseudomonas fluorescens, PfrI and PupI from Pseudomonas putida, and FecI from Escherichia coli, are controlled by the Fur repressor, and they activate transcription of genes for the biosynthesis or the uptake of siderophores. Evidence is provided that the PvdS protein of P. aeruginosa is endowed with biochemical properties of eubacterial sigma factors, as it spontaneously forms 1:1 complexes with the core fraction of RNA polymerase (RNAP, alpha(2)betabeta' subunits), thereby promoting in vitro binding of the PvdS-RNAP holoenzyme to the promoter region of the pvdA gene. These functional features of PvdS are consistent with the presence of structural domains predicted to be involved in core RNAP binding, promoter recognition, and open complex formation. The activity of pyoverdin biosynthetic (pvd) promoters was significantly lower in E. coli overexpressing the multicopy pvdS gene than in wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1 carrying the single gene copy, and pvd::lacZ transcriptional fusions were silent in both pfrI (the pvdS homologue) and pfrA (a positive regulator of pseudobactin biosynthetic genes) mutants of P. putida WCS358, while they are expressed at PAO1 levels in wild-type WCS358. Moreover, the PvdS-RNAP holoenzyme purified from E. coli lacked the ability to generate in vitro transcripts from the pvdA promoter. These observations suggest that at least one additional positive regulator could be required for full activity of the PvdS-dependent transcription complex both in vivo and in vitro. This is consistent with the presence of a putative activator binding site (the iron starvation box) at variable distance from the transcription initiation sites of promoters controlled by the iron starvation sigma factors PvdS, PfrI, and PbrA of fluorescent pseudomonads.
TI  - The genes for benzene catabolism in Pseudomonas putida ML2 are flanked by two copies of the insertion element IS1489, forming a class-I-type catabolic transposon, Tn5542.
AB  - Two directly repeated sequences of the IS elements IS1489v1 and IS1489v2 flank the benzene dioxygenase (bedC1C2BA) and the cis-benzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (bedD) genes on the catabolic plasmid pHMT112 in Pseudomonas putida ML2, forming a Class-I-type composite transposon, Tn5542. Both IS1489v1 and IS1489v2 contain an identical 1371-bp open reading frame, tnpA, that is preceded by a possible ribosome binding site. The tnpA gene of IS1489v1 is bound by a pair of 40-bp imperfect inverted repeats while that of IS1489v2 is flanked only by the left inverted repeat. The tnpA gene codes for a putative 53-kDa polypeptide of 456 amino acids bearing similarity to transposases encoded on IS elements of P. alcaligenes, P. aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, and Serratia marcescens. The basic nature of the putative TnpA protein with a deduced pI of 8.93 is typical of IS-encoded transposases. Similar to other IS elements, an outward facing promoter was detected at the right end of IS1489v1. Experiments involving the suicide vector, pKNG101, failed to show transposition of Tn5542.
TI  - Crc is involved in catabolite repression control of the bkd operons of Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Crc (catabolite repression control) protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has shown to be involved in carbon regulation of several pathways. In this study, the role of Crc in catabolite repression control has been studied in Pseudomonas putida. The bkd operons of P. putida and P. aeruginosa encode the inducible multienzyme complex branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase, which is regulated in both species by catabolite repression. We report here that this effect is mediated in both species by Crc. A 13-kb cloned DNA fragment containing the P. putida crc gene region was sequenced. Crc regulates the expression of branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and amidase in both species but not urocanase, although the carbon sources responsible for catabolite repression in the two species differ. Transposon mutants affected in their expression of BkdR, the transcriptional activator of the bkd operon, were isolated and identified as crc and vacB (rnr) mutants. These mutants suggested that catabolite repression in pseudomonads might, in part, involve control of BkdR levels.
TI  - Multiple antibiotic resistance in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia: involvement of a  multidrug efflux system.
AB  - Clinical strains of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia are often highly resistant to multiple antibiotics, although the mechanisms of resistance are generally poorly understood. Multidrug resistant (MDR) strains were readily selected by plating a sensitive reference strain of the organism individually onto a variety of antibiotics, including tetracycline, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, and norfloxacin. Tetracycline-selected MDR strains typically showed cross-resistance to erythromycin and fluoroquinolones and, in some instances, aminoglycosides. MDR mutants selected with the other agents generally displayed resistance to chloramphenicol and fluoroquinolones only, although two MDR strains (e.g., K1385) were also resistant to erythromycin and hypersusceptible to aminoglycosides. Many of the MDR strains expressed either moderate or high levels of a novel outer membrane protein (OMP) of ca. 50 kDa molecular mass, a phenotype typical of MDR strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa hyperexpressing drug efflux systems. Indeed, the 50-kDa OMP of these S. maltophilia MDR strains reacted with antibody to OprM, the outer membrane component of the MexAB-OprM MDR efflux system of P. aeruginosa. Similarly, a ca. 110-kDa cytoplasmic membrane protein of these MDR strains also reacted with antibody to the MexB component of the P. aeruginosa pump. The outer and cytoplasmic membranes of several clinical S. maltophilia strains also reacted with the anti-OprM and anti-MexB antibodies. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of a cyanogen bromide-generated peptide of the 50-kDa OMP of MDR strain K1385, dubbed SmeM (Stenotrophomonas multidrug efflux), revealed it to be very similar to a number of outer membrane multidrug efflux components of P. aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. Deletion of the L1 and L2 beta-lactamase genes confirmed that these enzymes were responsible for the bulk of the beta-lactam resistance of K1385 and its parent. Still, overexpression of the MDR efflux mechanism in an L1- and L2-deficient derivative of K1385 did yield a modest increase in resistance to a few beta-lactams. These data are consistent with the MDR efflux mechanism(s) playing a role in the multidrug resistance of S. maltophilia.
TI  - Convenient test for screening metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria by using thiol compounds.
AB  - A simple disk diffusion test was constructed for detection of IMP-1-type metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria. Two Kirby-Bauer disks containing ceftazidime (CAZ) and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor were used in this test. Several IMP-1 inhibitors such as thiol compounds including 2-mercaptopropionic acid, heavy metal salts, and EDTA were evaluated for this test. Two CAZ disks were placed on a Mueller-Hinton agar plate on which a bacterial suspension was spread according to the method recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The distance between the disks was kept to about 4 to 5 cm, and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor was placed near one of the CAZ disks within a center-to-center distance of 1.0 to 2.5 cm. For IMP-1-producing strains, the growth-inhibitory zone between the two disks expanded, while no evident change in the shape of the growth-inhibitory zone was observed for CAZ-resistant strains producing serine beta-lactamases such as AmpC or SHV-12. As a result, 2 to 3 microliter of undiluted 2-mercaptopropionic acid or mercaptoacetic acid able to block IMP-1 activity gave the most reproducible and clearest results, and CAZ-resistant strains producing AmpC or extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were distinguishable from IMP-1 producers by this test. A similar observation was made with IMP-1-producing clinical isolates such as Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter spp., and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. The specificity and sensitivity of this test were comparable to those of PCR analysis using bla(IMP)-specific primers. Therefore, this convenient test would be valuable for daily use in clinical laboratories.
TI  - Properties of p-cresol methylhydroxylase flavoprotein overproduced by Escherichia coli.
AB  - The alpha(2)beta(2) flavocytochrome p-cresol methylhydroxylase (PCMH) from Pseudomonas putida is composed of a flavoprotein homodimer (alpha(2) or PchF(2); M(r) = 119 kDa) with a cytochrome monomer (beta, PchC; M(r) = 9.3 kDa) bound to each PchF subunit. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) has been transformed with a vector for expression of the pchF gene, and PchF is overproduced by this strain as the homodimer. During purification, it was recognized that some PchF had FAD bound, while the remainder was FAD-free. However, unlike PchF obtained from PCMH purified from P. putida, FAD was bound noncovalently. The FAD was conveniently removed from purified E. coli-expressed PchF by hydroxyapatite chromatography. Fluorescence quenching titration indicated that the affinity of apo-PchF for FAD was sufficiently high to prevent the determination of the dissociation constant. It was found that p-cresol was virtually incapable of reducing PchF with noncovalently bound FAD (PchF(NC)), whereas 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, the intermediate product of p-cresol oxidation by PCMH, reduced PchF(NC) fairly quickly. In contrast, p-cresol rapidly reduced PchF with covalently bound FAD (PchF(C)), but, unlike intact PCMH, which consumed 4 electron equiv/mol when titrated with p-cresol (2 electrons from p-cresol and 2 from 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol), PchF(C) accepted only 2 electron equiv/mol. This is explained by extremely slow release of 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol from reduced PchF(C). 4-Hydroxybenzyl alcohol rapidly reduced PchF(C), producing 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. It was demonstrated that p-cresol has a charge-transfer interaction with FAD when bound to oxidized PchF(NC), whereas 4-bromophenol (a substrate analogue) and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde have charge-transfer interactions with FAD when bound to either PchF(C) or PchF(NC). This is the first example of a "wild-type" flavoprotein, which normally has covalently bound flavin, to bind flavin noncovalently in a stable, redox-active manner.
TI  - Characterization of a high-affinity phenol hydroxylase from Comamonas testosteroni R5 by gene cloning, and expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1c.
AB  - Comamonas testosteroni strain R5 is a phenol-degrading bacterium which expresses  a phenol-oxygenating activity that is characterized by low Ks (the apparent half-saturation constant in Haldane's equation) and low K(SI) (the apparent inhibition constant) values. We have now cloned the gene cluster encoding a phenol hydroxylase (phcKLMNOP) and its cognate regulator (phcR) from strain R5. Transformation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1c (Phenol Catechol+) with pROR502, a derivative of pRO1614 containing the cloned genes, confers the ability to grow on phenol as the sole carbon source. The Ks and K(SI) values for the phenol-oxygenating activity of PAO1c(pROR502) are almost identical to those of strain R5, suggesting that the phcKLMNOP genes encode the major phenol hydroxylase in strain R5. A phylogenetic analysis shows the phenol hydroxylase from strain R5 to be more closely related to toluene/benzene-2-monooxygenase (Tb2m) from Pseudomonas sp. JS150 than to the phenol hydroxylases from P. putida CF600 and BH, or to the phenol hydroxylase from Ralstonia eutropha E2. Analysis of the substrate specificity of PAO1c(pROR502) and PAO1c derivatives expressing phenol hydroxylase from P. putida BH or from R. eutropha E2 indicates that these phenol hydroxylases catalyze the oxidation not only of phenol and cresols but also of toluene and benzene.
TI  - Sequence heterogeneity of the ferripyoverdine uptake (fpvA), but not the ferric uptake regulator (fur), genes among strains of the fluorescent pseudomonads Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas aureofaciens, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas aureofaciens, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas putida are of importance to medicine, agriculture and biocycling. These microbes acquire ferric ion via the use of the siderophores pyochelin and the family known as the pyoverdines or pseudobactins. The ferric uptake regulator (fur) gene is responsible, at least in part, for the regulation of siderophore synthesis and uptake in P. aeruginosa. To determine whether the organisms contain single or multiple homologues of the siderophore-related genes fpvA (ferripyoverdine uptake) and fur, and whether these homologues displayed sequence heterogeneity, their chromosomal DNAs were probed with fur and fpvA sequences. As a representative of a non-fluorescent pseudomonad, the bacterium Burkholderia (Pseudomonas) cepacia was also examined. The pseudomonads all contained fpvA- and fur-like homologues, and heterogeneity was observed among the different species. The presence of two or more fpvA-like genes is indicated in all of the fluorescent pseudomonads surveyed. In contrast, B. cepacia DNA either did not hybridize to these probes, or did so only very weakly, suggesting that fur- and fpvA-like homologues are either absent or significantly different in B. cepacia compared to the fluorescent pseudomonads examined.
TI  - Organization and sequences of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase and other plasmid-encoded genes for early enzymes of the p-cresol degradative pathway in Pseudomonas putida NCIMB 9866 and 9869.
AB  - The gene (designated pchA) encoding the aldehyde dehydrogenase that is required to metabolise the p-hydroxybenzaldehyde produced by the degradation of p-cresol in Pseudomonas putida NCIMB 9866 and 9869 has been identified on plasmids pRA4000 and pRA500, respectively. The gene lies immediately upstream of the pchC and pchF genes encoding the subunits of p-cresol methylhydroxylase (PCMH), the preceeding enzyme in the p-cresol degradative pathway. In pRA500 the latter genes are followed by the genes encoding the alpha (pcaG) and beta (pcaH) subunits of protocatechuate-3,4-dioxygenase, whereas in pRA4000 the genes encoding PCMH are followed by an open reading frame encoding a protein that is similar to the maturase-related protein of P. alcaligenes. A gene, designated pchX, that encodes a protein of unknown function was identified between the pchC and pchF genes in both plasmids.
TI  - A novel lipolytic enzyme located in the outer membrane of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - A lipase-negative deletion mutant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 still showed extracellular lipolytic activity toward short-chain p-nitrophenylesters. By screening a genomic DNA library of P. aeruginosa PAO1, an esterase gene, estA, was identified, cloned, and sequenced, revealing an open reading frame of 1,941 bp. The product of estA is a 69.5-kDa protein, which is probably processed by removal of an N-terminal signal peptide to yield a 67-kDa mature protein. A molecular mass of 66 kDa was determined for (35)S-labeled EstA by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The amino acid sequence of EstA indicated that the esterase is a member of a novel GDSL family of lipolytic enzymes. The estA gene showed high similarity to an open reading frame of unknown function located in the trpE-trpG region of P. putida and to a gene encoding an outer membrane esterase of Salmonella typhimurium. Amino acid sequence alignments led us to predict that this esterase is an autotransporter protein which possesses a carboxy-terminal beta-barrel domain, allowing the secretion of the amino-terminal passenger domain harboring the catalytic activity. Expression of estA in P. aeruginosa and Escherichia coli and subsequent cell fractionation revealed that the enzyme was associated with the cellular membranes. Trypsin treatment of whole cells released a significant amount of esterase, indicating that the enzyme was located in the outer membrane with the catalytic domain exposed to the surface. To our knowledge, this esterase is unique in that it exemplifies in P. aeruginosa (i) the first enzyme identified in the outer membrane and (ii) the first example of a type IV secretion mechanism.
TI  - In vitro transcriptional analysis of the cytochrome P-450cam hydroxylase operon.
AB  - To characterize the promoters of cytochrome P-450cam hydroxylase operon (camDCAB) and the repressor gene (camR), in vitro run-off transcription assays were performed using RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme reconstituted with the core enzyme and the sigma70 protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both the mRNAs of camDCAB and camR were accurately transcribed from the respective promoter by the reconstituted RNAP holoenzyme. Both the transcriptions were repressed by CamR protein and the repressions were suppressed by D-camphor, consistent with the regulation in P. putida. These results suggest that the RNA polymerase containing sigma70 recognizes the promoter of camDCAB as well as that of camR.
TI  - Molecular characterization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2NR degrading naphthalene.
AB  - Three naphthalene-degrading strains were isolated from compost, characterized by  morphological and physiological properties and differentiated by 16S rDNA RFLP. During growth on naphthalene, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2NR produced ortho catechol pathway intermediates and gentisic acid. The ability to accumulate and degrade gentisic acid shows that Ps. aeruginosa 2NR has a different salicylate pathway to that of the intensely studied Ps. putida NCIB 9816. Molecular analysis showed the presence both of genes of the upper naphthalene pathway and genes of the ortho and meta catechol pathways. The insertion of nagH and nagG, coding for salicylate 5-hydroxylase in Pseudomonas sp. U2, was absent in Ps. aeruginosa 2NR, as in Ps. putida NCIMB 9816.
TI  - [Elastase activity of gram-negative non-fermenting bacteria and two variations of a simple method for their detection].
AB  - The ability to produce elastase was examined in 1,168 strains of 11 representative genera of Gram-negative non-fermenting bacteria isolated from weakened patients in the course of eight years. Detection of the elastase activity was performed parallelly using the conventional method and its pulverisation variant. The difference between the results accomplished by the classical method and its pulverisation variant (53.9% versus 60.5% detected elastase-positive strains) was highly significant (p < 0.05). Among the examined strains 500 (42.8%) displayed elastase activity. The highest proportion of the elastase positive strains was found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (84.5%), P. fluorescens (60.5%), P. stutzeri (56.4%), Burkholderia cepacia (43.8%) and Shewanella putrefaciens (39.7%). Elastase activity detected in Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas alcaligenes, P. mendocina, P. putida, P. stutzeri and in Shewanella putrefaciens is apparently described for the first time.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of rpoH and identification of ftsE-ftsX in Pseudomonas putida PpG1.
AB  - The rpoH gene encoding the heat-shock sigma factor of Pseudomonas putida was cloned by using its ability to complement the temperature-sensitive growth of the Escherichia coli rpoH mutant. The cloned DNA contained an open reading frame for a 284 amino acid sequence exhibiting high homology to the sigmaH proteins of P. aeruginosa and E. coli. Moreover, homologs to the cell division genes ftsX and ftsE were found immediately upstream of the rpoH gene.
TI  - Pathways of assimilative sulfur metabolism in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Cysteine and methionine biosynthesis was studied in Pseudomonas putida S-313 and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. Both these organisms used direct sulfhydrylation of O-succinylhomoserine for the synthesis of methionine but also contained substantial levels of O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (cysteine synthase) activity. The enzymes of the transsulfuration pathway (cystathionine gamma-synthase and cystathionine beta-lyase) were expressed at low levels in both pseudomonads but were strongly upregulated during growth with cysteine as the sole sulfur source. In P. aeruginosa, the reverse transsulfuration pathway between homocysteine and cysteine, with cystathionine as the intermediate, allows P. aeruginosa to grow rapidly with methionine as the sole sulfur source. P. putida S-313 also grew well with methionine as the sulfur source, but no cystathionine gamma-lyase, the key enzyme of the reverse transsulfuration pathway, was found in this species. In the absence of the reverse transsulfuration pathway, P. putida desulfurized methionine by the conversion of methionine to methanethiol, catalyzed by methionine gamma-lyase, which was upregulated under these conditions. A transposon mutant of P. putida that was defective in the alkanesulfonatase locus (ssuD) was unable to grow with either methanesulfonate or methionine as the sulfur source. We therefore propose that in P. putida methionine is converted to methanethiol and then oxidized to methanesulfonate. The sulfonate is then desulfonated by alkanesulfonatase to release sulfite for reassimilation into cysteine.
TI  - Identification of bacterial proteins observed in MALDI TOF mass spectra from whole cells.
AB  - Characteristic ions in the MALDI TOF mass spectra from bacterial cells have been  associated with four known proteins. The proteins, observed both from cells and in filtered cellular suspensions, were isolated by HPLC and identified on the basis of their mass spectra and their partial amino acid sequence, determined using the Edman method (10-15 residues). The acid resistance proteins HdeA and HdeB give rise to ions near m/z 9735 and 9060 in MALDI TOF mass spectra from cells and from extracts of both Escherichia coli 1090 and Shigella flexneri PHS-1059. However, the proteins associated with proteolytic cleavage by the peptidase Lep, rather than the precursor proteins, were observed, both using cells and from cellular extracts. A cold-shock protein, CspA, was associated with the ion near m/z 7643 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Similarly, a cold-acclimation protein, CapB, was identified as the source of the ion near m/z 7684 in P. putida. This last protein was homologous with a known CapB from P. fragi. While these experiments involved the detection of known or homologous proteins from typical bacteria, this same approach could also be applied to the detection of unique proteins or biomarker proteins associated with other bacteria of public health significance.
TI  - [Non fermentative gram negative bacilli isolated in a hospital laboratory].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a prospective study on non fermentative gramnegative bacilli, excluded Pseudomonas aeruginosa, isolated at Dr. Julio C. Perrando Hospital in Resistencia (Argentina). The goal of this study was to know their frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For bacterial identifications we used biochemical tests. RESULTS: The greatest percentages of non fermentative gramnegative bacilli isolates were found in blood samples (25%), respiratory secretions and urine (23.9%). Acinetobacter baumannii (34.7%), Pseudomonas fluorescens/Pseudomonas putida (15.2%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (9.7%) and Burkholderia cepacia (8.7%) were the non fermentative gramnegative bacilli species most commonly isolated. Distribution of microorganism strains according to samples and area is also assessed. Antimicrobial sensitivity of most commonly isolated non fermentative gramnegative bacilli strain analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that non fermentative gramnegative bacilli are most frequently present in hospitalized that in outpatients and antibacterial therapy must be provided according to bacteriological information.
TI  - Copurification of the FpvA ferric pyoverdin receptor of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with its iron-free ligand: implications for siderophore-mediated iron transport.
AB  - The Pseudomonas aeruginosa FpvA receptor is a TonB-dependent outer membrane transport protein that catalyzes uptake of ferric pyoverdin across the outer membrane. Surprisingly, FpvA expressed in P. aeruginosa grown in an iron-deficient medium copurifies with a ligand X that we have characterized by UV, fluorescence, and mass spectrometry as being iron-free pyoverdin (apo-PaA). PaA was absent from FpvA purified from a PaA-deficient P. aeruginosa strain. The properties of ligand binding in vitro revealed very similar affinities of apo-PaA and ferric-PaA to FpvA. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer was used to study in vitro the formation of the FpvA-PaA-Fe complex in the presence of PaA-Fe or citrate-Fe. The circular dichroism spectrum of FpvA indicated a 57% beta-structure content typical of porins and in agreement with the 3D structures of the siderophore receptors FhuA and FepA. In the absence of the protease's inhibitors, a truncated form of FpvA lacking 87 amino acids at its N-terminus was purified. This truncated form still bound PaA, and its beta-sheet content was conserved. This N-terminal region displays significant homology to the N-terminal periplasmic extensions of FecA from Escherichia coli and PupB from Pseudomonas putida, which were previously shown to be involved in signal transduction. This suggests a similar function for FpvA. The mechanism of iron transport in P. aeruginosa via the pyoverdin pathway is discussed in the light of all these new findings.

TI  - Genetic organization of sulphur-controlled aryl desulphonation in Pseudomonas putida S-313.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida S-313 is able to desulphonate a broad range of aromatic sulphonates to provide sulphur for growth by monooxygenolytic cleavage to yield the corresponding phenol. After miniTn5 transposon mutagenesis of this strain, 11 mutants were isolated that were no longer able to utilize benzenesulphonate as a sulphur source. Three of these mutants were defective in the utilization of all aromatic sulphonates tested, but they grew normally with other sulphur sources. These strains contained independent insertions in the novel 4.2 kb asfRABC gene cluster, encoding a putative reductase (AsfA), a ferredoxin (AsfB), a putative periplasmic binding protein (AsfC), which was localized to the periplasm using alkaline phosphatase fusions, and a divergently oriented fourth gene, asfR, that encoded a LysR-type regulator protein. A further mutant was interrupted in the ssu locus, which includes the gene for a putative desulphonative monooxygenase. Transformation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with the asfRAB genes was sufficient to allow arylsulphonate utilization by this species, which does not normally use these compounds, suggesting that the AsfAB proteins may constitute an arylsulphonate-specific electron transport system that interacts with a less specific oxygenase. Expression of the asfABC genes in P. putida was induced by benzenesulphonate or toluenesulphonate, and it was repressed in the presence of sulphate in the growth medium. AsfR was a negative regulator of asfABC expression, and toluenesulphonate induced expression of these genes indirectly by reducing the expression of the asfR gene.
TI  - Cloning, expression, and nucleotide sequence of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa 142 ohb genes coding for oxygenolytic ortho dehalogenation of halobenzoates.
AB  - We have cloned and characterized novel oxygenolytic ortho-dehalogenation (ohb) genes from 2-chlorobenzoate (2-CBA)- and 2,4-dichlorobenzoate (2,4-dCBA)-degrading Pseudomonas aeruginosa 142. Among 3,700 Escherichia coli recombinants, two clones, DH5alphaF'(pOD22) and DH5alphaF'(pOD33), converted 2-CBA to catechol and 2,4-dCBA and 2,5-dCBA to 4-chlorocatechol. A subclone of pOD33, plasmid pE43, containing the 3,687-bp minimized ohb DNA region conferred to P. putida PB2440 the ability to grow on 2-CBA as a sole carbon source. Strain PB2440(pE43) also oxidized but did not grow on 2,4-dCBA, 2,5-dCBA, or 2,6-dCBA. Terminal oxidoreductase ISPOHB structural genes ohbA and ohbB, which encode polypeptides with molecular masses of 20,253 Da (beta-ISP) and 48,243 Da (alpha-ISP), respectively, were identified; these proteins are in accord with the 22- and 48-kDa (as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) polypeptides synthesized in E. coli and P. aeruginosa parental strain 142. The ortho-halobenzoate 1,2-dioxygenase activity was manifested in the absence of ferredoxin and reductase genes, suggesting that the ISPOHB utilized electron transfer components provided by the heterologous hosts. ISPOHB formed a new phylogenetic cluster that includes aromatic oxygenases featuring atypical structural-functional organization and is distant from the other members of the family of primary aromatic oxygenases. A putative IclR-type regulatory gene (ohbR) was located upstream of the ohbAB genes. An open reading frame (ohbC) of unknown function that overlaps lengthwise with ohbB but is transcribed in the opposite direction was found. The ohbC gene codes for a 48,969-Da polypeptide, in accord with the 49-kDa protein detected in E. coli. The ohb genes are flanked by an IS1396-like sequence containing a putative gene for a 39,715-Da transposase A (tnpA) at positions 4731 to 5747 and a putative gene for a 45,247-Da DNA topoisomerase I/III (top) at positions 346 to 1563. The ohb DNA region is bordered by 14-bp imperfect inverted repeats at positions 56 to 69 and 5984 to 5997.
TI  - [Occurrence of gram-negative non-fermenting rods in hemocultures and their sensitivity to antimicrobial agents].
AB  - In the period from January 1993 to June 1996 were at the Department of Microbiology of the University Hospital in Olomouc 122 strains of Gram-negative nonfermentative rod-shaped bacteria isolated from haemocultures. The majority represented the group of 51 strains of the genus Acinetobacter (41.8%), complex A. calcoaceticus-baumannii (Acb complex). The second largest group were 21 strains (17.2%) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These were followed by 17 strains (13.9%) of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, 8 strains (6.6%) of non-Acb complex acinetobacters, 6 strains (4.9%) of Pseudomonas putida and 5 strains (4.1%) of Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. The remaining species were represented only by 1-2 strains. In three isolations was the identification impossible. The majority of strains (24.6%) were from the Department of Haematology of the University Hospital in Olomouc. The most frequent diagnoses in patients with positive haemocultures were leukemias and lymphomas (24.6%). The most effective tested antimicrobial agents were ceftazidime (93.4% of sensitive strains) and ofloxacin (91.7%). From the total number of 80 strains detected using the equipment BacT/Alert 120, 22 (27.5%) were isolated repeatedly confirming their role in the etiology of bacteriemic or septic episodes. Because only one blood sample was obtained in 34 cases (58.6%) of the remaining 58 only once detected strains, it was impossible to confirm their etiologic role by repeated isolation. (Tab. 6, Ref. 22.)
TI  - The anti-sigma factors.
AB  - A mechanism for regulating gene expression at the level of transcription utilizes an antagonist of the sigma transcription factor known as the anti-sigma (anti-sigma) factor. The cytoplasmic class of anti-sigma factors has been well characterized. The class includes AsiA form bacteriophage T4, which inhibits Escherichia coli sigma 70; FlgM, present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which inhibits the flagella sigma factor sigma 28; SpoIIAB, which inhibits the sporulation-specific sigma factor, sigma F and sigma G, of Bacillus subtilis; RbsW of B. subtilis, which inhibits stress response sigma factor sigma B; and DnaK, a general regulator of the heat shock response, which in bacteria inhibits the heat shock sigma factor sigma 32. In addition to this class of well-characterized cytoplasmic anti-sigma factors, a new class of homologous, inner-membrane-bound anti-sigma factors has recently been discovered in a variety of eubacteria. This new class of anti-sigma factors regulates the expression of so-called extracytoplasmic functions, and hence is known as the ECF subfamily of anti-sigma factors. The range of cell processes regulated by anti-sigma factors is highly varied and includes bacteriophage phage growth, sporulation, stress response, flagellar biosynthesis, pigment production, ion transport, and virulence.
TI  - Molecular organization of the xcp gene cluster in Pseudomonas putida: absence of  an xcpX (gspK) homologue.
AB  - A DNA fragment containing xcp (gsp) gene homologues, required for extracellular protein secretion by the general secretory pathway (GSP) in various Gram-negative bacteria, was cloned from Pseudomonas putida (Pp) strain WCS358 and sequenced. The results presented here and those previously reported (de Groot, A., Krijger, J.-J., Filloux, A., Tommassen, J., 1996. Characterization of type II protein secretion (xcp) genes in the plant growth-stimulating Pseudomonas putida, strain WCS358 Mol. Gen. Genet. 250, 491-504) complete the sequence of the xcp gene cluster of Pp. Unlike that of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), the xcp gene cluster of Pp contains a gspN homologue. More surprisingly, in contrast to all known gsp gene clusters, the xcpX (gspK) homologue is not found. In addition, genes flanking the xcp cluster of Pp are not related to those flanking the xcp genes of Pa. Overall, the xcp gene products of Pp are as much related to those of Pa as to gsp gene products of enterobacterial species, suggesting that the xcp clusters of Pp and Pa have evolved separately.
TI  - Combined physical and genetic map of the Pseudomonas putida KT2440 chromosome.
AB  - A combined physical and genetic map of the Pseudomonas putida KT2440 genome was constructed from data obtained by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis techniques (PFGE) and Southern hybridization. Circular genome size was estimated at 6.0 Mb by adding the sizes of 19 SwaI, 9 PmeI, 6 PacI, and 6 I-CeuI fragments. A complete physical map was achieved by combining the results of (i) analysis of PFGE of the DNA fragments resulting from digestion of the whole genome with PmeI, SwaI, I-CeuI, and PacI as well as double digestion with combinations of these enzymes and (ii) Southern hybridization analysis of the whole wild-type genome digested with different enzymes and hybridized against a series of probes obtained as cloned genes from different pseudomonads of rRNA group I and Escherichia coli, as P. putida DNA obtained by PCR amplification based on sequences deposited at the GenBank database, and by labeling of macrorestriction fragments of the P. putida genome eluted from agarose gels. As an alternative, 10 random mini-Tn5-Km mutants of P. putida KT2440 were used as a source of DNA, and the band carrying the mini-Tn5 in each mutant was identified after PFGE of a series of complete chromosomal digestions and hybridization with the kanamycin resistance gene of the mini-Tn5 as a probe. We established a circular genome map with an average resolution of 160 kb. Among the 63 genes located on the genetic map were key markers such as oriC, 6 rrn loci (rnnA to -F), recA, ftsZ, rpoS, rpoD, rpoN, and gyrB; auxotrophic markers; and catabolic genes for the metabolism of aromatic compounds. The genetic map of P. putida KT2440 was compared to those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25. The chromosomal backbone revealed some similarity in gene clustering among the three pseudomonads but differences in physical organization, probably as a result of intraspecific rearrangements.
TI  - Isolation and transposon mutagenesis of a Pseudomonas putida KT2442 toluene-resistant variant: involvement of an efflux system in solvent resistance.
AB  - A toluene-resistant variant of Pseudomonas putida KT2442, strain TOL, was isolated after liquid cultivation under xylene followed by toluene for 1 month in each condition. Almost all the populations of the variant strain formed small but readily visible colonies under toluene within 24 h at 30 degrees C. The toluene-resistant strain also showed an increase in resistance to some unrelated antibiotics. Several toluene-sensitive Tn5 mutants have been isolated from the toluene-resistant strain and showed various levels of sensitivity. Most of these mutations did not cause significant changes in antibiotic resistance; however, one of the mutants (TOL-4) was highly susceptible to both organic solvents and various antibiotics, especially beta-lactams. Sequencing analysis revealed that the mutation in TOL-4 had been introduced into a gene that may encode a transporter protein of an efflux system. This efflux system is very similar to one of the multidrug efflux systems of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These observations indicate that a multidrug efflux system plays a major role in the organic solvent resistance of P. putida TOL. However, several other genes may also be involved.
TI  - Investigation of the function of proteins associated to polyhydroxyalkanoate inclusions in Pseudomonas putida BMO1.
AB  - Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) granule associated proteins from Pseudomonas oleovorans were purified and the N-terminal sequences of two major proteins migrating in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels with a relative molecular mass of 18 and 43 kDa (GA1 and GA2, respectively) were analyzed. Radiolabeled degenerate probes deduced from these amino acid sequences were used to identify genomic DNA fragments from P. oleovorans and Pseudomonas putida encoding GA1 and GA2. DNA sequence analysis of the fragments obtained from P. putida revealed that the genes encoding these proteins were adjacent to phaC2 and ORF3, the PHA synthase II gene and an open reading frame of unknown function, respectively, found at the P. oleovorans and P. aeruginosa PHA synthase gene locus. The open reading frames encoding GA1, GA2 and ORF3 or smaller fragments beginning at GA1 were inactivated by chromosomal insertion of the Tn5 kanamycin resistance gene block (neo). When these mutants were grown on mineral salts agar media under nitrogen limitation, containing gluconate or decanoate as carbon sources, they appeared more translucent than the wild-type grown under similar conditions. Gas-chromatographic analysis of the cellular dry mass revealed that the mutant strains accumulated 30-50% less PHA than the P. putida wild type.
TI  - Int-B13, an unusual site-specific recombinase of the bacteriophage P4 integrase family, is responsible for chromosomal insertion of the 105-kilobase clc element of Pseudomonas sp. Strain B13.
AB  - Pseudomonas sp. strain B13 carries the clcRABDE genes encoding chlorocatechol-degradative enzymes on the self-transmissible 105-kb clc element. The element integrates site and orientation specifically into the chromosomes of various bacterial recipients, with a glycine tRNA structural gene (glyV) as the integration site. We report here the localization and nucleotide sequence of the integrase gene and the activity of the integrase gene product in mediating site-specific integration. The integrase gene (int-B13) was located near the right end of the clc element. It consisted of an open reading frame (ORF) of maximally 1,971 bp with a coding capacity for 657 amino acids (aa). The full-length protein (74 kDa) was observed upon overexpression and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation. The N-terminal 430 aa of the predicted Int-B13 protein had substantial similarity to integrases from bacteriophages of the P4 family, but Int-B13 was much larger than P4-type integrases. The C-terminal 220 aa of Int-B13 were homologous to an ORF flanking a gene cluster for naphthalene degradation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PaK1. Similar to the bacteriophages phiR73 and P4, the clc element integrates into the 3' end of the target tRNA gene. This target site was characterized from four different recipient strains into which the clc element integrated, showing sequence specificity of the integration. In Pseudomonas sp. strain B13, a circular form of the clc element, which carries an 18-bp DNA sequence identical to the 3'-end portion of glyV as part of its attachment site (attP), could be detected. Upon chromosomal integration of the clc element into a bacterial attachment site (attB), a functional glyV was reconstructed at the right end of the element. The integration process could be demonstrated in RecA-deficient Escherichia coli with two recombinant plasmids, one carrying the int-B13 gene and the attP site and the other carrying the attB site of Pseudomonas putida F1.
TI  - Cloning of the Nocardia corallina polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase gene and production of poly-(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) and poly-(3-hydroxyvalerate-co-3-hydroxyheptanoate).
AB  - The polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase gene (phaCNc) from Nocardia corallina was identified in a lambda library on a 6-kb BamHI fragment. A 2.8-kb XhoII subfragment was found to contain the intact PHA synthase. This 2.8-kb fragment was subjected to DNA sequencing and was found to contain the coding region for the PHA synthase and a small downstream open reading frame of unknown function. On the basis of DNA sequence, phaCNc is closest in homology to the PHA synthases (phaCPaI and phaCPaII) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (approximately 41% identity and 55% similarity). The 2.8-kb XhoII fragment containing phaCNc was subcloned into broad host range mobilizable plasmids and transferred into Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes (both containing a plasmid bearing phaA and phaB from Ralstonia eutropha), and PHA-negative strains of R. eutropha and Pseudomonas putida. The recombinant strains were grown on various carbon sources and the resulting polymers were analyzed. In these strains, the PHA synthase from N. corallina was able to mediate the production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) containing high levels of 3-hydroxyhexanoate when grown on hexanoate and larger even-chain fatty acids and poly(3-hydroxyvalerate-co-3-hydroxyheptanoate) containing high levels of 3-hydroxyheptanoate when grown on heptanoate or larger odd-chain fatty acids.
TI  - A chaperone in the HSP70 family controls production of extracellular fibrils in Myxococcus xanthus.
AB  - Three independent Tn5-lac insertions in the S1 locus of Myxococcus xanthus inactivate the sglK gene, which is nonessential for growth but required for social motility and multicellular development. The sequence of sglK reveals that it encodes a homologue of the chaperone HSP70 (DnaK). The sglK gene is cotranscribed with the upstream grpS gene, which encodes a GrpE homologue. Unlike sglK, grpS is not required for social motility or development. Wild-type M. xanthus is encased in extracellular polysaccharide filaments associated with the multimeric fibrillin protein. Mutations in sglK inhibit cell cohesion, the binding of Congo red, and the synthesis or secretion of fibrillin, indicating that sglK mutants do not make fibrils. The fibR gene, located immediately upstream of the grpS-sglK operon, encodes a product which is predicted to have a sequence similar to those of the repressors of alginate biosynthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. Inactivation of fibR leads to the overproduction of fibrillin, suggesting that M. xanthus fibril production and Pseudomonas alginate production are regulated in analogous ways. M. xanthus and Pseudomonas exopolysaccharides may play similar roles in a mechanism of social motility conserved in these gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Crystallographic study of azurin from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Azurin from Pseudomonas putida is a blue copper protein which functions as an electron carrier. Two crystal forms of azurin were grown, one in the presence and the other in the absence of zinc acetate; each belongs to space group P21 and contains two molecules per asymmetric unit. The zinc-free crystals have cell dimensions a = 43.25, b = 50.65, c = 54.60 A, beta = 107.79 degrees, while the crystals grown from zinc-containing solution have cell dimensions a = 40.76, b = 51.22, c = 54.96 A, beta = 103.12 degrees. The latter crystals were found to have four zinc ions incorporated into the crystal lattice. Both crystal structures were solved by the molecular-replacement method using the program MERLOT. The search model was the structure of azurin from Alcaligenes denitrificans. The crystallographic R factor for native azurin is 0.169 (Rfree = 0. 257) from 8 to 1.92 A resolution, while that for zinc azurin is 0. 181 (Rfree = 0.248) from 10 to 1.6 A resolution; for each structure the root-mean-square deviation in bond lengths from ideal values is 0.007 A. In both crystal structures the Cu atom forms three strong bonds in the equatorial plane, two with Ndelta1 from His46 and His117, and one with the thiolate S atom of Cys112. Two longer axial approaches are made by the Sgamma from Met121 and the carbonyl O atom from Gly45. This results in a distorted trigonal bipyramidal co-ordination around the Cu atom. It further confirms the presence of a weak fifth bond to the copper in P. putida azurin, as with other azurin structures described at high resolution. The Ndelta1 atom of His35 is protonated, as it is in the low-pH form of azurin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa but unlike the low-pH form of the azurins from Alcaligenes denitrificans or Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. In each crystal form the two molecules of azurin in the asymmetric unit are related by a local twofold axis and form a dimer stabilized by the interaction of a pair of hydrophobic patches surrounding the partially exposed His117 side chain. In the other known azurin crystal structures, analogous dimer formation is observed, but with different relative orientations of the molecules. The four zinc ions introduced during crystallization of zinc azurin are bound to the protein and participate in five- and sixfold ligand coordination with no affect on the copper binding site. The zinc ligands are Ndelta from His, carboxylate O atoms from Asp and Glu, Ogamma from Ser and water molecules. One of the zinc ions, located on a non-crystallographic twofold axis, links the dimers of the asymmetric unit into continuous chains parallel to the crystallographic (-101) direction and is primarily responsible for the altered unit-cell parameters. Two of the other zinc ions bind to His83, one in each molecule.
TI  - [Evaluation of antibacterial activities of various antibiotics against glucose non-fermentative gram-negative rods other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa].
AB  - MICs of piperacillin, sulbactam/cefoperazone, minocycline (MINO), gentamicin, amikacin, flomoxef, ceftazidime, cefozopran, cefsulodin and imipenem were determined, against 189 clinical isolated strains of glucose non-fermentative Gram-negative Rods (NFGNR; Acinetobacter baumannii (44), Alcaligenes faecalis (5), Alcaligenes xylosoxidans (25), Burkholderia cepacia (12), Chryseobacterium indologenes (23), Chryseobacterium meningosepticum (9), Pseudomonas fluorescens (8), Pseudomonas putida (12), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (51). Most species of these NFGNR show resistance to many antibiotics tested. Among the antibiotics used in this study, the only antibiotic effective against all species of NFGNR tested is MINO. The spectrums of antibacterial activities of various antibiotics determined by MICs may be useful in preliminary test for identification of these NFGNR.
TI  - A new metabolic link between fatty acid de novo synthesis and polyhydroxyalkanoic acid synthesis. The PHAG gene from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 encodes a 3-hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein-coenzyme a transferase.
AB  - To investigate the metabolic link between fatty acid de novo synthesis and polyhydroxyalkanoic acid (PHA) synthesis, we isolated mutants of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 deficient in this metabolic route. The gene phaG was cloned by phenotypic complementation of these mutants; it encoded a protein of 295 amino acids with a molecular mass of 33,876 Da, and the amino acid sequence exhibited 44% amino acid identity to the primary structure of the rhlA gene product, which is involved in the rhamnolipid biosynthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PG201. S1 nuclease protection assay identified the transcriptional start site 239 base pairs upstream of the putative translational start codon. Transcriptional induction of phaG was observed when gluconate was provided, and PHA synthesis occurred from this carbon source. No complementation of the rhlA mutant P. aeruginosa UO299-harboring plasmid pBHR81, expressing phaG gene under lac promoter control, was obtained. Heterologous expression of phaG in Pseudomonas oleovorans, which is not capable of PHA synthesis from gluconate, enabled PHA synthesis on gluconate as the carbon source. Native recombinant PhaG was purified by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis from P. oleovorans-harboring plasmid pBHR81. It catalyzes the transfer of the acyl moiety from in vitro synthesized 3-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA to acyl carrier protein, indicating that PhaG exhibits a 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA-acyl carrier protein transferase activity.
TI  - Efflux pumps involved in toluene tolerance in Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E.
AB  - The basic mechanisms underlying solvent tolerance in Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E are efflux pumps that remove the solvent from bacterial cell membranes. The solvent-tolerant P. putida DOT-T1E grows in the presence of high concentrations (e.g., 1% [vol/vol]) of toluene and octanol. Growth of P. putida DOT-T1E cells in LB in the presence of toluene supplied via the gas phase has a clear effect on cell survival: the sudden addition of 0.3% (vol/vol) toluene to P. putida DOT-T1E pregrown with toluene in the gas phase resulted in survival of almost 100% of the initial cell number, whereas only 0.01% of cells pregrown in the absence of toluene tolerated exposure to this aromatic hydrocarbon. One class of toluene-sensitive octanol-tolerant mutant was isolated after Tn5-'phoA mutagenesis of wild-type P. putida DOT-T1E cells. The mutant, called P. putida DOT-T1E-18, was extremely sensitive to 0.3% (vol/vol) toluene added when cells were pregrown in the absence of toluene, whereas pregrowth on toluene supplied via the gas phase resulted in survival of about 0.0001% of the initial number. Solvent exclusion was tested with 1,2,4-[14C]trichlorobenzene. The levels of radiochemical accumulated in wild-type cells grown in the absence and in the presence of toluene were not significantly different. In contrast, the mutant was unable to remove 1,2,4-[14C]trichlorobenzene from the cell membranes when grown on Luria-Bertani (LB) medium but was able to remove the aromatic compound when pregrown on LB medium with toluene supplied via the gas phase. The amount of 14C-labeled substrate in whole cells increased in competition assays in which toluene-and xylenes were the unlabeled competitors, whereas this was not the case when benzene was the competitor. This finding suggests that the exclusion system works specifically with certain aromatic substrates. The mutation in P. putida DOT-T1E-18 was cloned, and the knockedout gene was sequenced and found to be homologous to the drug exclusion gene mexB, which belongs to the efflux pump family of the resistant nodulator division type.
TI  - Inhibition of human peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation by Streptococcus pyogenes cell extract is associated with arginine deiminase activity.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) cell extracts (CE) have a remarkably powerful and dose-dependent inhibitory effect on antigen, superantigen, or mitogen-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation in vitro. Purification of the inhibitory component present in S. pyogenes type M5 (Manfredo strain) CE by anion-exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography showed that the inhibitor had an approximate native molecular mass of 100 kDa. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified inhibitory fractions followed by silver staining gave a single band with an approximate molecular mass of 47 kDa, indicating that the inhibitor is composed of two identical subunits. NH2-terminal sequencing of the protein revealed that it was identical to the previously characterized streptococcal acid glycoprotein (SAGP); this protein possesses between 31.5 and 39.0% amino acid identity with arginine deiminase (AD) from Mycoplasma hominis, Mycoplasma arginini, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. AD enzyme activity was present in unfractionated CE prepared from a range of streptococcal strains, and partially purified inhibitory fractions of Manfredo CE also had high levels of activity. The inhibitory effect of Manfredo CE was overcome by the addition of L-arginine to proliferation assays in which human PBMC were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin. We conclude that SAGP, or its homolog, possesses AD activity and that the potent inhibition of proliferation of human T cells by streptococcal CE is due to activity of this enzyme.
TI  - The isolation of Pseudomonas and other Gram(-) psychrotrophic bacteria in raw milks.
AB  - In this research, totally 200 raw milk samples in different areas of Ankara were  collected from various dairy plant. The isolated psychotrophic bacteria from the raw milk samples are the species of Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., Alcaligenes and Aeromonas. Isolation of Pseudomonas and other gram(-) psychrotrophic bacteria types are determined as P. aeruginosa 11 (5.5%), P. putida 11 (5.5%), P. fluorescens biotype I 10 (5.0%), P. fluorescens biotype II 4 (2.0%), P. fluorescens biotype III 6 (3.0%), P. aurefaciens 2 (1.0%), P. pseudomallei 3 (1.5%), P. cepacia 1 (0.5%), A. calcoaceticus lowffii 5 (2.5%), A. calcoaceticus anitratum 4 (2.0%), A. faecalis 3 (1.5%) and A. hydrophilia 1 (0.5%).
TI  - IS1491 from Pseudomonas alcaligenes NCIB 9867: characterization and distribution  among Pseudomonas species.
AB  - A new insertion sequence, IS1491, has been cloned and sequenced. The 2489-bp IS1491 was isolated from a Pseudomonas alcaligenes NCIB 9867 (strain P25X) 4.8-kb PstI chromosomal fragment. IS1491 is flanked by an imperfect inverted repeat of 23 bp and carries two overlapping open reading frames, ORF1 and ORF2. Both ORF1 and ORF2 displayed homology to the IstA-like and IstB-like transposases encoded by the IS21 family of insertion sequences, which include two IS elements previously isolated from P. alcaligenes P25X, IS1474, and IS1475 (Yeo, C. C., and Poh, C. L. (1997). FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 149, 257-263). Transposition assays showed that IS1491 transposed at a frequency of approximately 1.4 x 10(-6). Transposition of IS1491 into the target pRK415 replicon was observed but when ORF2 was disrupted, a fusion between the donor and target replicons was detected. IS1491-like sequences were detected in total DNA of Pseudomonas putida NCIB 9869 (strain P35X), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Pseudomonas syringae, Pseudomonas mendocina, Comomonas acidovorans, and Comomonas testosteroni by hybridization with IS1491 DNA.
TI  - Fluorescent pseudomonad pyoverdines bind and oxidize ferrous ion.
AB  - Major pyoverdines from Pseudomonas fluorescens 2-79 (Pf-B), P. aeruginosa ATCC 15692 (Pa-C), and P. putida ATCC 12633 (Pp-C) were examined by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic techniques to investigate the interaction between ferrous ion and the pyoverdine ligand. At physiological pH, ferrous ion quenched the fluorescence of all three pyoverdines much faster than ferric ion did. Also, increased absorbance at 460 nm was observed to be much faster for Fe2+ -pyoverdine than for Fe3+ -pyoverdine. At pH 7.4, about 90% of Fe3+ was bound by pyoverdine Pa-C after 24 h whereas Fe2+ was bound by the pyoverdine completely in only 5 min. The possibility that Fe2+ underwent rapid autoxidation before being bound by pyoverdine was considered unlikely, since the Fe2+ concentration in pyoverdine-free samples remained constant over a 3-min period at pH 7.4. Incubating excess Fe2+ with pyoverdine in the presence of 8-hydroxyquinoline, an Fe3+ -specific chelating agent, resulted in the formation of a Fe3+ -hydroxyquinoline complex, suggesting that the iron in the Fe2+ -pyoverdine complex existed in the oxidized form. These results strongly suggested that pyoverdines bind and oxidize the ferrous ion.

TI  - [The experimental study of Pseudomonas contamination in soft drinks].
AB  - Bymeans of this study, we have found out about the situation of Pseudomons contamination in the soft drinks which are manufactured and sold at the area of Nanchang City. In the course of this study, we examined total 416 specimens, in which we found that 69 specimens were positive reaction. The positive rate made up 16.59% of the total specimens. From these 69 positive specimens we separate isolated andidentified the following Pseudomonas 111 strains including 16 different species: P. aeruginosa, 9; P. fluorescens biovars; 11; P. putida biovars, 14; P. syringae pathovars, 5; P. mendocina, 5; P. alcaligenes, 23; P. pseudoalcaligenes, 10; P. cepacia, 17; P. solanacearum, 1; P. testosteroni, 1; P. delafieldii, 3; P. facilis, 6; P. flava 1; P. psenudoflava, 2; P. palleronii, 1; and a new species of Pseudomonas--P. halosensibilis. The achievement of this study will provide scientific basis for working out the standards of food safety control and inspection, raising the level of food hygieneinspection, and directing the drinks menufacturers and selling units to strengthen the food safety control and inspection.
TI  - Mutagenesis of nitrite reductase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa: tyrosine-10 in the  c heme domain is not involved in catalysis.
AB  - In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, conversion of nitrite to NO in dissimilatory denitrification is catalyzed by the enzyme nitrite reductase (NiR), a homodimer containing a covalently bound c heme and a d1 heme per subunit. We report the purification and characterization of the first single mutant of P. aeruginosa cd1 NiR in which Tyr10 has been replaced by Phe; this amino acid was chosen as a possibly important residue in the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme based on the proposal (Fulop, V., Moir, J.W.B., Ferguson, S.J. and Hajdu, J. (1995) Cell 81, 369-377) that the topologically homologous Tyr25 plays a crucial role in controlling the activity of the cd1 NiR from Thiosphaera pantotropha. Our results show that in P. aeruginosa NiR substitution of Tyr10 with Phe has no effect on the activity, optical spectroscopy and electron transfer kinetics of the enzyme, indicating that distal coordination of the Fe3+ of the d1 heme is provided by different side-chains in different species.
TI  - Sequencing and functional analysis of styrene catabolism genes from Pseudomonas fluorescens ST.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the 4,377-bp chromosomal region of Pseudomonas fluorescens ST that codes for the oxidation of styrene to phenylacetic acid was determined. Four open reading frames, named styA, styB, styC, and styD, were identified in this region. Sequence analysis and biotransformation assays, performed with batch and continuous cultures, allowed us to identify the functions of the sequenced genes. styA and styB encode a styrene monooxygenase responsible for the transformation of styrene to epoxystyrene; styC codes for the second enzyme of the pathway, an epoxystyrene isomerase that converts epoxystyrene to phenylacetaldehyde; and the styD gene produces a phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase that oxidizes phenylacetaldehyde to phenylacetic acid. StyA, 415-amino-acids long, was found to be weakly homologous to p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from both P. fluorescens and P. aeruginosa and to salicylate hydroxylase from P. putida, suggesting that it might be a flavin adenine dinucleotide-binding monooxygenase. StyB was found to be partially homologous to the carboxyterminal part of the 2,4-dichlorophenol-6-monooxygenase encoded by plasmid pJP4, while the styC product did not share significant homology with any known proteins. The fourth open reading frame, styD, could encode a protein of 502 amino acids and was strongly homologous to several eukaryotic and prokaryotic aldehyde dehydrogenases. The order of the genes corresponds to that of the catabolic steps. The previously suggested presence of the gene for epoxystyrene reductase, which directly converts epoxystyrene to 2-phenylethanol (A.M. Marconi, F. Beltrametti, G. Bestetti, F. Solinas, M. Ruzzi, E. Galli, and E. Zennaro, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 61:121-127, 1996), has not been confirmed by sequencing and by biotransformation assays performed in continuous cultures. A copy of the insertion sequence ISI162, belonging to the IS21-like family of elements, was identified immediately downstream of the styrene catabolic genes.
TI  - Comparative study of five polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degrading bacterial strains isolated from contaminated soils.
AB  - Five polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) degrading bacterial strains, Pseudomonas putida 34, Pseudomonas fluorescens 62, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 57, Sphingomonas sp. strain 107, and the unidentified strain PL1, were isolated from two contaminated soils and characterized for specific features regarding PAH degradation. Degradation efficiency was determined by the rapidity to form clearing zones around colonies when sprayed with different PAH solutions and the growth in liquid medium with different PAHs as sole source of carbon and energy. The presence of plasmids, the production of biosurfactants, the effect of salicylate on PAH degradation, the transformation of indole to indigo indicating the presence of an aromatic ring dioxygenase activity, and the hybridization with the SphAb prove representing a sequence highly homologous to the naphthalene dioxygenase ferredoxin gene nahAb were examined. The most efficient strain in terms of substrate specificity and rapidity to degrade different PAHs was Sphingomonas sp. strain 107, followed by strain PL1 and P. aeruginosa 57. The less efficient strains were P. putida 34 and P. fluorescens 62. Each strain transformed indole to indigo, except strain PL1. Biosurfactants were produced by P. aeruginosa 57 and P. putida 34, and a bioemulsifier was produced by Sphingomonas sp. strain 107. The presence of salicylate in solid medium has accelerated the formation of clearing zones and the transformation of indole by Sphingomonas sp. strain 107 and P. aeruginosa 57 colonies. Plasmids were found in Sphingomonas sp. strain 107 and strain PL1. The SphAb probe hybridized with DNA extracted from each strain. However, hybridization signals were detected only in the plasmidic fraction of Sphingomonas sp. strain 107 and strain PL1. Using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach, we determined that several genes encoding enzymes involved in the upper catabolic pathway of naphthalene were present in each strain. Sequencing of PCR DNA fragments revealed that, for all the five strains, these genes are highly homologous with respective genes found in the pah, dox, and nah operons, and are arranged in a polycistronic operon. Results suggest that these genes are ordered in the five selected strains like the pah, nah, and dox operons.
TI  - Conservation of the multidrug resistance efflux gene oprM in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - An intragenic probe derived from the multidrug resistance gene oprM hybridized with genomic DNA from all 20 serotypes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and from all 34 environmental and clinical isolates tested, indicating that the MexA-MexB-OprM multidrug efflux system is highly conserved in this organism. The oprM probe also hybridized with genomic DNA from Pseudomonas aureofaciens, Pseudomonas chlororaphis, Pseudomonas syringae, Burkholderia pseudomallei, and Pseudomonas putida, suggesting that efflux-mediated multidrug resistance mechanisms may be somewhat broadly distributed.
TI  - Probing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas aureofaciens, Burkholderia (Pseudomonas) cepacia, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Pseudomonas putida with the ferripyochelin receptor A gene and the synthesis of pyochelin in Pseudomonas aureofaciens, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The ferripyochelin receptor A (fptA) gene codes for the transport of the ferrisiderophore ferripyochelin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A P. aeruginosa fptA internal fragment was used to probe chromosomal DNA from P. aureofaciens, B. cepacia, P. fluorescens, P. putida, and five strains of P.aeruginosa. These bacteria all contained DNA that hybridized to the fptA fragment. Four of the five P. aeruginosa strains displayed marked and identical patterns, indicating a high degree of sequence similarities among these strains. DNA from the non-P. aeruginosa bacteria, in contrast, hybridized less to the fptA fragment. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and B. cepacia synthesize pyochelin. Experiments were performed to confirm P. fluorescens pyochelin synthesis and to determine if pyochelin, cepabactin or salicylic acid were made by P. aureofaciens, P. putida, and P. fluorescens. Only pyochelin was isolated and identified from P. fluorescens. P. aureofaciens and P. putida produced none of these compounds. While all of these bacteria contain chromosomal DNA that hybridized to the fptA fragment probe, pyochelin synthesis did not occur in all, indicating that fptA fragment hybridization cannot always be correlated with pyochelin biosynthesis.
TI  - The flagellin gene as a stable marker for detection of Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25.
AB  - Flagellin gene central regions from 111 isolates of Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 obtained from soil during a field release experiment were analysed using a combined PCR/RFLP technique to look for variation. In addition, a 858 bp flagellin gene sequence from the original strain and the last isolate obtained from the release site were compared. There was no variation in flagellin gene sequences indicating that the gene was stable over the period of the release, and that the flagellin gene is a suitable marker for use in the detection of bacteria in release experiments. A comparison of Ps. fluorescens SBW25 flagellin with other sequenced flagellins revealed closest homology to the flagellin of Ps. putida PRS2000.
TI  - Expression and characterization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cytochrome c-551 and two site-directed mutants: role of tryptophan 56 in the modulation of redox properties.
AB  - The gene coding for Pseudomonas aeruginosa cytochrome c-551 was expressed in Pseudomonas putida under aerobic conditions, using two different expression vectors; the more efficient proved to be pNM185, induced by m-toluate. Mature holo-(cytochrome c-551) was produced in high yield by this expression system, and was purified to homogeneity. Comparison of the recombinant wild-type protein with that purified from Ps. aeruginosa showed no differences in structural and functional properties. Trp56, an internal residue in cytochrome c-551, is located at hydrogen-bonding distance from haem propionate-17, together with Arg47. Ionization of propionate-17 was related to the observed pH-dependence of redox potential. The role of Trp56 in determining the redox properties of Ps. aeruginosa cytochrome c-551 was assessed by site-directed mutagenesis, by substitution with Tyr (W56Y) and Phe (W56F). The W56Y mutant is similar to the wild-type cytochrome. On the other hand, the W56F mutant, although similar to the wild-type protein in spectral properties and electron donation to azurin, is characterized by a weakening of the Fe-Met61 bond, as shown in the oxidized protein by the loss of the 695 nm band approx. 2 pH units below the wild-type. Moreover, in W56F, the midpoint potential and its pH-dependence are both different from the wild-type. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that hydrogen-bonding to haem propionate-17 is important in modulation of the redox properties of Ps. aeruginosa cytochrome c-551.
TI  - Distribution of amine oxidases and amine dehydrogenases in bacteria grown on primary amines and characterization of the amine oxidase from Klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  - The bacteria Klebsiella oxytoca LMD 72.65 (ATCC 8724), Arthrobacter P1 LMD 81.60  (NCIB 11625), Paracoccus versutus LMD 80.62 (ATCC 25364), Escherichia coli W LMD 50.28 (ATCC 9637), E. coli K12 LMD 93.68, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 LMD 89.1 (ATCC 17933) and Pseudomonas putida LMD 68.20 (ATCC 12633) utilized primary amines as a carbon and energy source, although the range of amines accepted varied from organism to organism. The Gram-negative bacteria K. oxytoca and E. coli as well as the Gram-positive methylotroph Arthrobacter P1 used an oxidase whereas the pseudomonads and the Gram-negative methylotroph Paracoccus versutus used a dehydrogenase for amine oxidation. K. oxytoca utilized several primary amines but showed a preference for those containing a phenyl group moiety. Only a single oxidase was used for oxidation of the amines. After purification, the following characteristics of the enzyme indicated that it belonged to the group of copper-quinoprotein amine oxidase (EC 1.4.3.6): the molecular mass (172,000 Da) of the homodimeric protein; the UV/visible and EPR spectra of isolated and p-nitrophenylhydrazine-inhibited enzyme; the presence and the content of copper and topaquinone (TPQ). The amine oxidase appeared to be soluble and localized in the periplasm, but catalase and NAD-dependent aromatic aldehyde dehydrogenase, enzymes catalysing the conversion of its reaction products, were found in the cytoplasm. From the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal part as well as that of a purified peptide, it appears that K. oxytoca produces a copper-quinoprotein oxidase which is very similar to that found in other Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Relative expression and stability of a chromosomally integrated and plasmid-borne marker gene fusion in environmentally competent bacteria.
AB  - A xylE-iceC transcriptional fusion was created by ligatinga DNA fragment harboring the cloned xylE structural gene from the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 into the cloned iceC gene of Pseudomonas syringae Cit7. This fusion construct was integrated into the chromosome of Pseudomonas syringae Cit7 by homologous recombination. Both cis-merodiploid strain Cit7m17 and marker exchange strain Cit7h69 produced the XylE gene product, catechol2,3-dioxygenase. Strain Cit7m17, in which XylE was influenced by transcription initiated by the amp promoter on pBR322, exhibited XylE activity in stationary phase at levels about 45 times higher than strain Cit7h69, permitting detection of 10(7) Cit7m17 cells in the spectrophotometric assay and 10(3) cells in HPLC measurements. The stability of xylE in both Cit7m17 and Cit7h69 was compared with maintenance of xylE in several plasmid-borne constructs in P.aeruginosa, Erwinia herbicola, and Escherichia coli. Only the xylE-iceC fusion in the chromosome of Cit7h69 and Cit7m17was stable in plate assays over the course of these studies. Even though strain Cit7h69 stably expressed xylE, the low level of expression precludes its use in direct spectrophotometric or HPLC assays as a means for detecting cells in environmental samples. However, expression of xylEin Cit7h69 is sufficient for identification of colonies harboring this marker gene which is useful in laboratory plate assays, and as a marker gene system for the detection of environmentally-competent strains chromosomally taggedwith xylE for use in autecological studies.
TI  - Improved broad-host-range RK2 vectors useful for high and low regulated gene expression levels in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - This report describes the construction and use of improved broad-host-range expression vectors based on the previously constructed pJB137 and pJB653 plasmids (Blatny et al., 1997). These vectors contain the minimal replicon of RK2 and the inducible Pu or Pm promoters together with their regulatory xylR or xylS genes, respectively, from the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid pWWO. A set of ATG vectors were derived from pJB653, and these vectors are characterized by the relatively small size, the presence of multiple cloning sites downstream of Pm, the establishment of their nucleotide sequence, the presence of RK2 oriT, and different antibiotic selection markers. The copy numbers of all the vectors can easily be modified by using copy-up mutations of the trfA gene, required for initiation of replication of RK2 replicons. The vectors were used to study the expression levels of the Acetobacter xylinum phosphoglucomutase gene celB and the two commonly used reporter genes luc and cat in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas campestris. Good induction properties and tight regulation of Pm were achieved in all three species tested, and higher gene expression levels were obtained by using the ATG vectors compared to pJB653. By introducing different trfA copy-up mutations into the vectors, a wide range of gene expression levels from Pu and Pm were obtained in E. coli. Induced expression levels of luc, cat, and celB from Pm were found to be comparable to or higher than those from the Ptrc and PT7 promoters located on high copy number plasmids. The induced levels of Luc activity were higher in P. aeruginosa than in E. coli, indicating that these vectors may be useful for maximization of gene expression in strains other than E. coli. We believe that the well-characterized vectors described here are useful for gene expression studies and routine cloning experiments in many Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - 3-Hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida E23: purification and  characterization.
AB  - The NAD(+)-dependent 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase [EC 1.1.1.31] was purified to homogeneity from Pseudomonas putida E23. The enzyme was a tetramer (molecular mass, 120 kDa) consisted of identical subunits (molecular mass, 30 kDa). The enzyme was specific for NAD+ (Km, 0.44 mM). The maximal activity was obtained at about pH 10. The enzyme was specific for the L-isomer of 3-hydroxyisobutyrate. In addition to L-3-hydroxyisobutyrate, L-serine, 2-methyl-DL-serine, and 3-hydroxypropionate were substrates. The Km for L-3-hydroxyisobutyrate, L-serine, 2-methyl-DL-serine, and 3-hydroxypropionate were 0.12, 18, 44, and 83 mM, respectively. The enzyme was inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate, HgCl2, and AgNO3, but not by EDTA, alpha,alpha'-dipyridyl, and o-phenanthroline. The N-terminal 26 amino acid sequence was compared with the sequences deduced from the enzyme genes of rat liver and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the tolQRA genes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The tolQ, tolR, and tolA genes from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO were cloned using  degenerate oligonucleotide PCR primers designed based on conserved transmembrane regions of Escherichia coli TolQ and TolR and E. coli and Pseudomonas putida ExbB and ExbD. The resulting PCR product was used as a probe to isolate a 6.5-kb DNA fragment containing P. aeruginosa tolQ, tolR, and tolA. The nucleotide sequence of a 2.9-kb DNA fragment containing the tolQ, tolR, and tolA genes was determined. The DNA sequence predicts TolQ to be a 25,250-Da protein exhibiting 53% identity to E. coli TolQ. TolR is predicted to be a 15,788-Da protein, sharing 38% identity with the E. coli TolR protein. The P. aeruginosa tolA sequence predicts a 37,813-Da protein with 27% identity to the E. coli TolA. The P. aeruginosa TolQRA proteins were expressed in E. coli minicells. Analysis of plasmid-encoded tolQ::lacZ and tolA::lacZ promoter fusions in E. coli indicated that these genes are expressed at different levels, suggesting transcription from different promoters. Transcriptional analysis of the tol genes in P. aeruginosa revealed that the tolQ and tolR genes are cotranscribed as an approximately 1.5-kb transcript and that tolA is transcribed from its own promoter as an approximately 1.2-kb transcript. The P. aeruginosa Tol proteins were functionally unable to complement E. coli tol mutants, although P. aeruginosa TolQ was able to complement the iron-limited growth of an E. coli exbB mutant. Introduction of the tolQRA genes in the tol-like mutant PAO 1652 restored pyocin AR41 killing, indicating that the Tol proteins are involved in the uptake of pyocin AR41 in P. aeruginosa. Attempts to inactivate the chromosomal copy of the tolA or tolQ gene in the parent strain PAO proved to be unsuccessful, and we propose that inactivation of these genes in P. aeruginosa results in a lethal phenotype.
TI  - PCR detection of metallo-beta-lactamase gene (blaIMP) in gram-negative rods resistant to broad-spectrum beta-lactams.
AB  - We applied PCR to the rapid detection of the metallo-beta-lactamase gene, blaIMP, in clinically isolated gram-negative rods. A total of 54 high-level ceftazidime-resistant strains (MICs, > 128 micrograms/ml) were subjected to PCR analyses with the blaIMP-specific primers, since the blaIMP-bearing clinical isolates tested in our previous study always demonstrated high-level resistance to ceftazidime. Twenty-two blaIMP-positive strains including 9 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 9 Serratia marcescens, 2 Alcaligenes xylosoxidans, 1 Pseudomonas putida, and 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains were newly identified from 18 different hospitals in Japan. These strains were mostly isolated from urine samples and showed high-level resistance to almost every cephem, while their levels of resistance to carbapenems were diverse. The PCR analyses with novel integrase gene-specific (intI3) and acc(6')-Ib gene-specific primers suggested that the integron structure found in a large plasmid harbored by S. marcescens AK9373 was also well conserved among blaIMP-positive strains. These results imply that the blaIMP gene cassettes have been dispersing into various gram-negative rods with the help of the newly identified integron element. Thus, the PCR-aided rapid detection will be helpful for the early recognition of emerging blaIMP-positive clinical isolates which demonstrate consistent resistance to beta-lactams.
TI  - PhhR, a divergently transcribed activator of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene cluster of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa was recently found to possess a cluster of structural genes encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (PhhA), carbinolamine dehydratase (PhhB), and aromatic aminotransferase (PhhC). We now report the presence, in the flanking upstream region, of a divergently transcribed gene (phhR) encoding an activator protein. Inactivation of phhR markedly reduced expression of the structural genes. PhhR belongs to the large prokaryote family of sigma 54 enhancer-binding proteins, and activation of the phh operon by PhhR in P. aeruginosa required rpoN. The closest homologues of PhhR are the TyrR proteins from Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. E. coli TyrR is an unusual member of the homologue family in that the transcriptional units regulated by tyrR are driven by sigma 70 promoters. P. aeruginosa phhR was able to replace E. coli tyrR as a repressor of the aroF-tyrA operon (but not as an activator of mtr) in the heterologous E. coli system. Two regions that resemble E. coli TyrR boxes were identified in the intervening region between phhR and phhA. We propose that one or both boxes may be the target of PhhR acting as an autogenous repressor at a sigma 70 promoter in one direction. In the other direction, one or both boxes may be the upstream activator sequence targeted by PhhR to facilitate expression of the phh operon from a sigma 54 promoter. The phh operon was strongly induced in fructose- or glucose-based minimal medium by L-phenylalanine. Inactivation of phhR in P. aeruginosa abolished ability to utilize either L-phenylalanine or L-tyrosine as a sole source of carbon for growth.
TI  - Electron transfer in zinc-reconstituted nitrite reductase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - 1. The catalytic cycle of the haem-containing nitrite reductase (NIR) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa involves electron transfer between the two prosthetic groups of the enzyme, the c-haem and the d1-haem; this reaction was shown to be slow by stopped-flow analysis. The recombinant enzyme, expressed in Pseudomonas putida, contains the c-haem but no d1-haem; we have reconstituted this protein with Zn-protoporphyrin IX in the place of the d1-haem. 2. Photoexcitation of Zn-NIR is followed by electron transfer from the triplet excited state of the Zn-porphyrin to the oxidized c-haem, with a rate constant of 7 x 10(5) s-1; since the intermediate with reduced c-haem is not significantly populated, we conclude that the back reaction is probably as fast. 3. Even taking into account that in the native NIR the driving force is close to zero, the rate constant for the c-->d1 electron transfer, estimated from our experiments, is still much higher than that observed by stopped flow (k = 0.3 s-1) using reduced azurin as the electron donor. This finding may be a direct kinetic indication that reduction of the d1-haem is associated with a substantial reorganization of the co-ordination of the metal, as shown by spectroscopy of the oxidized and reduced NIR.
TI  - The nucleotide sequence of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa pyrE-crc-rph region and the purification of the crc gene product.
AB  - The gene (crc) responsible for catabolite repression control in Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been cloned and sequenced. Flanking the crc gene are genes encoding orotate phosphoribosyl transferase (pyrE) and RNase PH (rph). New crc mutants were constructed by disruption of the wild-type crc gene. The crc gene encodes an open reading frame of 259 amino acids with homology to the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease family of DNA repair enzymes. However, crc mutants do not have a DNA repair phenotype, nor can the crc gene complement Escherichia coli DNA repair-deficient strains. The crc gene product was overexpressed in both P. aeruginosa and in E. coli, and the Crc protein was purified from both. The purified Crc proteins show neither apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease nor exonuclease activity. Antibody to the purified Crc protein reacted with proteins of similar size in crude extracts from Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas fluorescens, suggesting a common mechanism of catabolite repression in these three species.
TI  - Production of specific monoclonal antibodies to Burkholderia pseudomallei and their diagnostic application.
AB  - Hybridomas secreting monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific to Burkholderia pseudomallei were produced by immunizing BALB/cJ mice with crude culture filtrate of B. pseudomallei. Two monoclonal antibodies were found to be highly specific to B.pseudomallei as tested by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting against a panel of crude whole cell extracts from B. pseudomallei, B. cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P.putida, and Escherichia coli. One of the specific MAbs, clone SP-M, IgM subclass, could directly agglutinate all 42 B. pseudomallei, isolates. The study has shown that the agglutinating MAb has potential for rapid identification of B. pseudomallei in primary bacterial culture from clinical specimens. The antibody can be used in bacteriology laboratories to reduce time of biochemical methods, which require a few days.
TI  - In vitro activities of quinolones, beta-lactams, tobramycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - From 1991 to 1995, 8,975 nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli were isolated from patients at The Ohio State University Medical Center: 71% Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 14% Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, 7.6% Acinetobacter baumannii, and < 2% each of 25 other species. The MICs of trovafloxacin (CP-99,219), ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefoperazone, ceftriaxone, imipenem, tobramycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) were determined for 308 isolates, representing 13 species, by a standardized broth microdilution method. The activities of all drugs were species dependent. The fluoroquinolones had inconsistent activity against most species, although several relatively uncommon nonfermenters were consistently susceptible or resistant. Trovafloxacin was considerably more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against S. maltophilia, A. baumannii, and several less common species. Among the beta-lactams, relative activities varied considerably; overall, imipenem had the broadest spectrum of activity but was inactive against S. maltophilia and Burkholderia cepacia isolates. Tobramycin and TMP-SMZ had stereotypic spectra of activity. Tobramycin was active against most species except S. maltophilia, Alcaligenes xylosoxidans subsp. xylosoxidans, Burkholderia spp., and Weeksella virosa. TMP-SMZ was active against most species except P. aeruginosa and Pseudomonas fluorescens-putida. A review of laboratory records indicated few changes in susceptibility patterns from 1991 to 1995; the only clear trend was toward increasing P. aeruginosa resistance to all classes of drugs.
TI  - The Pseudomonas aeruginosa tonB gene encodes a novel TonB protein.
AB  - The Pseudomonas aeruginosa tonB gene was cloned by complementation of the tonB mutation of Pseudomonas putida strain TE516 (W. Bitter, J. Tommassen & P.J. Weisbeek, 1993, Mol Microbiol 7, 117-130). The gene was 1025 bp in length, capable of encoding a protein of 36860 Da. As with previously described TonB proteins, the P. aeruginosa TonB (TonBp.a.) was rich in Pro residues (18.1%) and contained Glu-Pro/Lys-Pro repeats. Unlike previously described TonB proteins, however, TonBp.a. lacked an N-terminal membrane anchor (signal) sequence and contained, instead, a predicted internal signal/anchor sequence, expected to yield an atypical N-terminal cytoplasmic domain in this protein. TonB proteins are essential components in iron-siderophore uptake in bacteria, apparently functioning as energy transducers in coupling the energized state of the cytoplasmic membrane to outer-membrane receptor function. As expected, tonB derivatives of P. aeruginosa were defective in siderophore-mediated iron acquisition. tonB gene expression was inducible by iron-limitation, consistent with the identification of a Fur consensus binding sequence upstream of the gene. TonBp.a. showed substantially greater similarity to the Escherichia coli TonB protein than the Pseudomonas putida protein (31% identity vs. 20% identity) and tonBp.a. was able to complement deficiencies in the acquisition of ferric enterobactin and vitamin B12, and sensitivity to phage phi 80 of an E. coli tonB strain. The larger size of TonBp.a. and its ability to function in both E. coli and P. putida make it a unique TonB protein whose characterization should enhance our understanding of TonB function in bacteria.
TI  - Choice of microbial host for the naphthalene dioxygenase bioconversion.
AB  - The use of whole cell biotransformations for single and multistep enzyme conversions is gaining widespread application. In this study the naphthalene dioxygenase nah A gene was transferred into Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAC 1R, Escherichia coli JM107 and Pseudomonas putida PpG 277. The effect of ethanol on these genetically engineered Gram-negative bacteria was studied by measurement of enzyme activity, stability and cell integrity. Ethanol has been used in biotransformations as a co-substrate carbon source for co-factor recycling and as a co-solvent increasing dissolved substrate and product levels. Ethanol increased the dissolved substrate (naphthalene) concentration slightly and dissolved product ((+)-cis-(1R,2S)-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene) by approximately 30% at 4% (w/v) ethanol. Both P. aeruginosa PAC 1R and P. putida PpG 277 showed decreased activity with increasing ethanol concentration whilst E. coli enzyme activity increased with increasing ethanol concentration being comparable to that when glucose was used as a carbon source. This project highlighted the many factors involved in the selection of microbial hosts for whole cell biotransformation processes.
TI  - Acquisition of iron by the non-siderophore-producing Pseudomonas fragi.
AB  - The iron requirement, siderophore production and iron uptake mechanisms of the type strain Pseudomonas fragi ATCC 4973 and five P. fragi isolates from meat were analysed. The strains exhibited a high sensitivity to iron starvation: their growth was strongly inhibited in medium supplemented with the iron chelator ethylenediamine di(hydroxyphenylacetic acid) or in medium treated with 8-hydroxyquinoline to remove contaminating iron. No siderophores were detectable in the growth supernatants of iron-starved cells. Cross-feeding experiments in iron-depleted medium showed, however, that the bacterial growth could be strongly stimulated by siderophores of foreign origin including desferriferrioxamine B, enterobactin and some pyoverdines. Moreover, all the strains were capable of efficiently using the iron sources present in their natural environment, i.e., transferrin, lactoferrin and haemoglobin. Iron starvation led to the specific production of supplementary outer-membrane proteins of apparent molecular mass ranging from 80 to 88 kDa. Furthermore, growth in the presence of exogenous siderophores resulted, in some strains, in the induction of siderophore-mediated iron uptake systems. For one strain the concomitant synthesis of an iron-regulated, siderophore-inducible outer-membrane protein was observed.
TI  - Catechol 2,3-dioxygenases functional in oxygen-limited (hypoxic) environments.
AB  - We studied the degradation of toluene for bacteria isolated from hypoxic (i.e., oxygen-limited) petroleum-contaminated aquifers and compared such strains with other toluene degraders. Three Pseudomonas isolates, P. pickettii PKO1, Pseudomonas sp. strain W31, and P. fluorescens CFS215, grew on toluene when nitrate was present as an alternate electron acceptor in hypoxic environments. We examined kinetic parameters (K(m) and Vmax) for catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C230), a key shared enzyme of the toluene-degradative pathway for these strains, and compared these parameters with those for the analogous enzymes from archetypal toluene-degrading pseudomonads which did not show enhanced, nitrate-dependent toluene degradation. C230 purified from strains W31, PKO1, and CFS215 had a significantly greater affinity for oxygen as well as a significantly greater rate of substrate turnover than found for the analogous enzymes from the TOL plasmid (pWW0) of Pseudomonas putida PaW1, from Pseudomonas cepacia G4, or from P. putida F1. Analysis of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of C23O from strain PKO1 suggests that this extradiol dioxygenase belongs to a new cluster within the subfamily of C23Os that preferentially cleave monocyclic substrates. Moreover, deletion analysis of the nucleotide sequence upstream of the translational start of the meta-pathway operon that contains tbuE, the gene that encodes the C230 of strain PKO1, allowed identification of sequences critical for regulated expression of tbuE, including a sequence homologous to the ANR-binding site of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO. When present in cis, this site enhanced expression of tbuE under oxygen-limited conditions. Taken together, these results suggest the occurrence of a novel group of microorganisms capable of oxygen-requiring but nitrate-enhanced degradation of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes in hypoxic environments. Strain PKO1, which exemplifies this novel group of microorganisms, compensates for a low-oxygen environment by the development of an oxygen-requiring enzyme with kinetic parameters favorable to function in hypoxic environments, as well as by elevating synthesis of such an enzyme in response to oxygen limitation.
TI  - Characterization of type II protein secretion (xcp) genes in the plant growth-stimulating Pseudomonas putida, strain WCS358.
AB  - In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the products of the xcp genes are required for the secretion of exoproteins across the outer membrane. Despite structural conservation of the Xcp components, secretion of exoproteins via the Xcp pathway is generally not found in heterologous organisms. To study the specificity of this protein secretion pathway, the xcp genes of another fluorescent pseudomonad, the plant growth-promoting Pseudomonas putida strain WCS358, were cloned and characterized. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the presence of at least five genes, i.e., xcpP, Q, R, S, and T, with homology to xcp genes of P. aeruginosa. Unlike the genetic organization in P. aeruginosa, where the xcp cluster consists of two divergently transcribed operons, the xcp genes in P. putida are all oriented in the same direction, and probably comprise a single operon. Upstream of xcpP in P. putida, an additional open reading frame, with no homolog in P. aeruginosa, was identified, which possibly encodes a lipoprotein. Mutational inactivation of xcp genes in P. putida did not affect secretion, indicating that no proteins are secreted via the Xcp system under the growth conditions tested, and that an alternative secretion system is operative. To obtain some insight into the secretory pathway involved, the amino acid sequence of the N-terminus of the major extracellular protein was determined. The protein could be identified as flagellin. Mutations in the xcpQ and R genes of P. aeruginosa could not be complemented by introduction of the corresponding xcp genes of P. putida. However, expression of a hybrid XcpR protein, composed of the N-terminal one-third of P. aeruginosa XcpR and the C-terminal two-thirds of P. putida XcpR, did restore protein secretion in a P. aeruginosa xcpR mutant.
TI  - Outer Membrane Protein Heterogeneity within Pseudomonas fluorescens and P. putida and Use of an OprF Antibody as a Probe for rRNA Homology Group I Pseudomonads.
AB  - The electrophoretic patterns of outer membrane proteins of strains representing the biovars of Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas putida were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The outer membrane protein profiles were variable, and they were not useful for assigning strains to a specific biovar. However, three or four predominant outer membrane proteins migrating at 42 to 46 kDa, 33 to 38 kDa, and 20 to 22 kDa were conserved among the strains. They could be tentatively identified as OprE (44 kDa), OprF (38 kDa), OprH (21 kDa), and OprL (20.5 kDa), which are known proteins from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A 37-kDa OprF-like protein was purified from P. fluorescens DF57 and used to raise a polyclonal antibody. In Western blot (immunoblot) analysis, this antibody reacted with OprF proteins from members of Pseudomonas rRNA homology group I but not with proteins from nonpseudomonads. The heterogeneity in M(infr) of OprF was greater among P. fluorescens strains than among P. putida strains. Immunofluorescence microscopy of intact cells demonstrated that the antibody recognized epitopes that were accessible only after unmasking by EDTA treatment. The antibody was used in a colony blotting assay to determine the percentage of rRNA homology group I pseudomonads among bacteria from the rhizosphere of barley. The bacteria were isolated on 10% tryptic soy agar, King's B agar, and the pseudomonad-specific medium Gould S1 agar. The estimate of OprF-containing CFU in rhizosphere soil obtained by colony blotting on 10% tryptic soy agar was about 2 and 14 times higher than the values obtained from King's agar and Gould S1 agar, respectively, indicating that not all fluorescent pseudomonads are scored on more specific media. The colonies reacting with the OprF antibody were verified as being rRNA homology group I pseudomonads by using the API 20NE system.
TI  - Gram-negative bacteria can induce contact lens related acute red eye (CLARE) responses.
AB  - PURPOSE: Twelve volunteers participated in a study designed to measure the overnight corneal edema response with a variety of hydrogel contact lenses. During the study four subjects (5 eyes) experienced a contact lens related acute red eye (CLARE) reaction, which manifested as severe ocular pain, photophobia, corneal infiltration, and conjunctival hyperemia. An additional five subjects (7 eyes) developed corneal infiltrates only. Twelve eyes (of 9 subjects) showed no response. METHODS AND RESULTS: Upon microbiological examination of the contact lenses and storage solutions, gram-negative bacteria were isolated in large amounts. The bacteria were identified as Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Significantly greater numbers of bacteria were isolated from contact lenses of subjects who experienced CLARE than from the other subjects (P = 0.005) and from the contact lenses of subjects who experienced an adverse reaction (CLARE or infiltrates) than from the other subjects (P < 0.001). The contaminating bacteria are thought to have been introduced to the lens storage vials as a result of lens handling and subsequent failure to disinfect lenses. CONCLUSIONS: This study draws attention to the possible contribution of contaminated lenses and storage cases in contact lens related acute inflammation and specifically implicates gram-negative bacteria, in particular Pseudomonas spp. and Serratia spp., in the inducement of acute inflammatory reactions such as CLARE.
TI  - [Introduction of mutator phage D3112 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa into Alcaligenes eutrophus var. metallotollerans (Strain CH34)].
AB  - It is demonstrated that the intact genome of a D3112 tranposable phage (TP) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, integrated into a recombinant plasmid RP4 :: D3112, can be transferred by means of conjugation from P. putida PpG1 (RP4npt :: D3112) donor cells into Alcaligenes eutrophus var. metallotollerans cells. P. aeruginosa strains are unacceptable as donors because they have a bactericidal effect on A. eutrophus. RP4npt :: D3112 plasmid is stably inherited by A. eutrophus with D3112 being expressed and successfully reproduced. However, TP loses the induction ability after UV irradiation or mitomycin C treatment. It is suggested that D3112 TP and its miniderivatives could be used in manipulations with A. eutrophus var. metallotolerans.
TI  - Dissection of the core and auxiliary sequences in the vegetative replication origin of promiscuous plasmid RK2.
AB  - The vegetative replication origin (oriV) of promiscuous IncP plasmid RK2 can function in many Gram-negative bacterial species when supplied with the plasmid-encoded replication protein TrfA and host-encoded replication proteins including DnaA. Nine TrfA binding sites (iterons) are known, and also two DnaA binding sites, box 1, between TrfA iterons 4 and 5, and box 2, downstream of repeat 9. The deletion analysis presented here shows that the core oriV requires DnaA box 1 for function in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida. This DnA box is not essential in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although its deletion does reduce plasmid copy number in this species. A putative IHF binding site is located upstream of DnaA box 1, but IHF deficiency in E. coli seems not to alter replication efficiency or copy number control. Cloned oriV can interfere with maintenance of an independent RK2 replicon. Analysis of replication inhibition functions associated with oriV showed that a short putative orf between TrfA iterons 1 and 2 is not necessary for replication inhibition, the presence of repeats 5 to 9 in target and inhibitor plasmid are not sufficient for efficient inhibition and inhibition does not correlate directly with the number of direct repeats present. Rather, the results showed that the isolated repeats 1 and 2 to 4, potentiate replication inhibition disproportionately to their effect on the number of TrfA binding sites. The results are consistent with the idea that repeats 1 to 4, arranged as a single copy and as an irregular group of three, potentiate the ability of the oriV region to form complexes which inhibit replication. We suggest that TrfA bound at these iterons may be more susceptible to forming pairs between oriV sequences on different plasmids.
TI  - Detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from ovine fleece washings by PCR amplification of 16S ribosomal RNA.
AB  - Two oligonucleotides were selected from the variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene of P. aeruginosa and used as PCR primers for the detection of P. aeruginosa. The specificity of the primers was tested against the following bacterial species; Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas cepacia, Xanthamonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas mendocina, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas alcaligenes and Pseudomonas diminuta. These primers had a sensitivity of detection of 1 pg of chromosomal DNA or 1 x 10(5) cfu/microliters and were species-specific. The sensitivity of detection was increased to 1 fg or less than 10 cfu/microliters using a non-radioactively labelled probe. Using these PCR primers it was possible to detect the presence of P. aeruginosa from fleece washings collected from a flock of 100 sheep. Correlation between single PCR and bacteriological isolation showed agreement in 89% of fleece samples tested, 2% of the samples contained organic PCR inhibitors in the fleece washings, 3% were below the level of sensitivity of the test and the remaining 6% were culture negative for P. aeruginosa but PCR positive. Use of nested PCR did not increase the sensitivity of detection over single round PCR combined with the use of non-radioactively labelled probe.
TI  - In situ PCR for visualization of microscale distribution of specific genes and gene products in prokaryotic communities.
AB  - Obtaining information on the genetic capabilities and phylogenetic affinities of  individual prokaryotic cells within natural communities is a high priority in the fields of microbial ecology, microbial biogeochemistry, and applied microbiology, among others. A method for prokaryotic in situ PCR (PI-PCR), a technique which will allow single cells within complex mixtures to be identified and characterized genetically, is presented here. The method involves amplification of specific nuclei acid sequences inside intact prokaryotic cells followed by color or fluorescence detection of the localized PCR product via bright-field or epifluorescence microscopy. Prokaryotic DNA and mRNA were both used successfully as targets for PI-PCR. We demonstrate the use of PI-PCR to identify nahA-positive cells in mixtures of bacterial isolates and in model marine bacterial communities.
TI  - High-molecular-mass, iron-repressed cytoplasmic proteins in fluorescent Pseudomonas: potential peptide-synthetases for pyoverdine biosynthesis.
AB  - High molecular-mass cytoplasmic proteins were detected in iron-starved, pyoverdine-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. chlororaphis, P. fluorescens, P. putida, P. aptata and P. tolaasii. They appeared to be specifically located in the cytoplasm and thus were termed 'IRCPs', for iron-repressed cytoplasmic proteins. A strain-dependent gel electrophoresis pattern with multiple bands of M(r) values ranging from 180 to 600 kDa was usually observed for these proteins. Strains synthesizing pyoverdines differing in their peptide part presented different IRCP gel electrophoresis profiles, whereas strains synthesizing identical pyoverdines had identical IRCP gel electrophoresis profiles. Some mutants affected in pyoverdine biosynthesis presented a perturbed IRCP pattern, and no IRCPs were detected in non-fluorescent Pseudomonas strains either unable to synthesize siderophores or synthesizing non-peptidic siderophores. The data strongly suggest that the IRCPs could be related to peptide synthetases involved in the biosynthesis of the peptidic part of pyoverdine-type siderophores.
TI  - Production of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Rhamnolipid Biosurfactants in Heterologous Hosts.
AB  - The high-level production of rhamnolipid biosurfactants is a unique feature of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and is strictly regulated in response to environmental conditions. The final step in rhamnolipid biosynthesis is catalyzed by the rhlAB genes encoding a rhamnosyltransferase. The expression of the cloned rhlAB genes was studied in heterologous hosts, either under the control of the rhlR and rhlI rhamnolipid regulatory elements or under the control of the tac promoter. A recombinant P. fluorescens strain harboring multiple plasmid-encoded copies of the rhamnolipid gene cluster produced rhamnolipids (0.25 g liter(sup-1)) when grown under nitrogen-limiting conditions. The highest yields (0.6 g liter(sup-1)) and productivities (24 mg liter(sup-1) h(sup-1)) were obtained in a recombinant Pseudomonas putida strain, KT2442, harboring promoterless rhlAB genes fused to the tac promoter on a plasmid. Active rhamnosyltransferase was synthesized, but no rhamnolipids were produced, by recombinant Escherichia coli upon induction of rhlAB gene expression.
TI  - [Features of oral cavity microflora in congenital cleft lip and palate].
AB  - Cheilloschisis and uranoschisis are the most important congenital defects in children. This pathology increases the incidence of purulent inflammatory affections due to Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. The isolates were found to have multiple drug resistance determined by R plasmids of different incompatibility groups. The molecular weights of the plasmids were: 3.0, 8.0 and 9.0 MD in Staphylococcus spp., 90.0 and 110.0 MD in P. aeruginosa and P. putida, 33.0, 38.0, 49.0 and 53.0 MD in E. coli. 87.0 per cent of the Staphylococcus strains, 78.9 per cent of the Streptococcus strains, 83.3 per cent of the E. coli strains, 74.0 per cent of the P. aeruginosa strains and 66.6 per cent of the Acinetobacter stains were shown to be sensitive to the commercial pyophage product used in the study.
TI  - Quantification of the effect of substrate concentration on the conjugal transfer  rate of the TOL plasmid in short-term batch mating experiments.
AB  - Batch mating experiments with Pseudomonas putida PAW 1 (TOL) as a donor and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 1162 as a recipient strain were performed to quantify the effect of the substrate concentration in the mating medium on the observed plasmid transfer rate coefficient. The impact of the substrate concentration in the mating medium was highly correlated with the growth history of the donor strain. When the donor strain was harvested in exponential growth phase, no impact was observed; when the donor strain was taken from the stationary phase, however, a strong impact of the substrate concentration was measured: a 10-fold reduction in the substrate concentration decreased the observed plasmid transfer rate by 55%.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis of genes encoding a toluene/benzene-2-monooxygenase  from Pseudomonas sp. strain JS150.
AB  - It was previously shown by others that Pseudomonas sp. strain JS150 metabolizes benzene and alkyl- and chloro-substituted benzenes by using dioxygenase-initiated pathways coupled with multiple downstream metabolic pathways to accommodate catechol metabolism. By cloning genes encoding benzene-degradative enzymes, we found that strain JS150 also carries genes for a toluene/benzene-2-monooxygenase. The gene cluster encoding a 2-monooxygenase and its cognate regulator was cloned from a plasmid carried by strain JS150. Oxygen (18O2) incorporation experiments using Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains that carried the cloned genes confirmed that toluene hydroxylation was catalyzed through an authentic monooxygenase reaction to yield ortho-cresol. Regions encoding the toluene-2-monooxygenase and regulatory gene product were localized in two regions of the cloned fragment. The nucleotide sequence of the toluene/benzene-2-monooxygenase locus was determined. Analysis of this sequence revealed six open reading frames that were then designated tbmA, tbmB, tbmC, tbmD, tbmE, and tbmF. The deduced amino acid sequences for these genes showed the presence of motifs similar to well-conserved functional domains of multicomponent oxygenases. This analysis allowed the tentative identification of two terminal oxygenase subunits (TbmB and TbmD) and an electron transport protein (TbmF) for the monooxygenase enzyme. In addition to these gene products, all the tbm polypeptides shared significant homology with protein components from other bacterial multicomponent monooxygenases. Overall, the tbm gene products shared greater similarity with polypeptides from the phenol hydroxylases of Pseudomonas putida CF600, P35X, and BH than with those from the toluene monooxygenases of Pseudomonas mendocina KR1 and Burkholderia (Pseudomonas) pickettii PKO1. The relationship found between the phenol hydroxylases and a toluene-2-monooxygenase, characterized in this study for the first time at the nucleotide sequence level, suggested that DNA probes used for surveys of environmental populations should be carefully selected to reflect DNA sequences corresponding to the metabolic pathway of interest.
TI  - [Frequency of clinical isolation of glucose non-fermentative gram-negative rods and their susceptibilities to antibacterial agents].
AB  - A comparison was made for frequencies of isolation o glucose non-fermentative Gram-negative rods ((G)NF-GNR) from clinical specimens during a period from July, 1986 to June, 1987 (the first period) and that from January, 1994 to December, 1994 (the second period). Also, minimum inhibitory concentrations of principal drugs were determined against these isolates. The obtained results are summarized as follows: 1. Thirty four (34) species of (G)NF-GNR were found from 35,200 clinical specimens in the two periods. Numbers of strains of (G)NF-GNR obtained were 4,575 during the first period and 4,704 during the second period, thus no significant difference existed in numbers of strains isolated in the two periods. 2. Among the 34 species to which the 4,704 strains were classified into, Pseudomonas aeruginosa comprised 68.4%, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia 6.9%, Acinetobacter baumannii 5.6%, Burkholderia cepacia 3.1%, Acinetobacter Iwoffii 2.6%, Alcaligenes xylosoxidans subsp. xylosoxidans 2.4%, Flavobacterium indologenes 1.7%, Pseudomonas putida 1.1%, Acinetobacter junii 1.1% and Moraxella subgenus Moraxella lacunata 0.9%. When these frequencies of isolation were compared with those in the first period, it was found that B. cepacia decreased significantly (P < 0.01) and that S. maltophilia increased significantly (P < 0.001). 3. MIC determinations revealed multiple drug resistance strains in many different species of bacteria. Minocycline, however, were active against many such strains, and ofloxacin was found to have strong antibacterial activity against some strains.
TI  - Role of competition for inorganic nutrients in the biodegradation of mixtures of  substrates.
AB  - A study was conducted to determine whether competition for inorganic nutrients affects the biodegradation of mixtures of substrates. Little benzylamine was mineralized by Pseudomonas putida in solutions with no added P, but the substrate was degraded if the medium contained 100 nM P. The enhancement by P addition did not occur if the medium also contained caprolactam and a caprolactam-utilizing strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The suppression by the second bacterium was overcome by a higher P concentration. The rate of caprolactam utilization by P. aeruginosa was reduced if benzylamine and P. putida were also present in media with 100 nM P, but the suppression was absent if the solution contained a higher P concentration. Glutamate increased and inorganic N plus P decreased the length of the acclimation phase prior to benzylamine mineralization in lake water. We suggest that the effect of one biodegradable substrate on the metabolism of a second often results from a competition for inorganic nutrients.
TI  - Autoinducer-mediated regulation of rhamnolipid biosurfactant synthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces a variety of virulence factors, including exotoxin A, elastase, alkaline protease, alginate, phospholipases, and extracellular rhamnolipids. The previously characterized rhlABR gene cluster encodes a regulatory protein (RhlR) and a rhamnosyltransferase (RhlAB), both of which are required for rhamnolipid synthesis. Another gene, rhII, has now been identified downstream of the rhlABR gene cluster. The putative RhlI protein shares significant sequence similarity with bacterial autoinducer synthetases of the LuxI type. A P. aeruginosa rhlI mutant strain carrying a disrupted rhlI gene was unable to produce rhamnolipids and lacked rhamnosyltransferase activity. Rhamnolipid synthesis was restored by introducing a wild-type rhlI gene into such strains or, alternatively, by adding either the cell-free spent supernatant from a P. aeruginosa wild-type strain or synthetic N-acylhomoserine lactones. Half-maximal induction of rhamnolipid synthesis in the rhlI mutant strain required 0.5 microM N-butyrylhomoserine lactone or 10 microM N-(3-oxohexanoyl)homoserine lactone. The P. aeruginosa rhlA promoter was active in the heterologous host Pseudomonas putida when both the rhlR and rhlI genes were present or when the rhlR gene alone was supplied together with synthetic N-acylhomoserine lactones. The RhlR-RhlI regulatory system was found to be essential for the production of elastase as well, and cross-communication between the RhlR-RhlI rhamnolipid regulatory system and the LasR-LasI elastase regulatory system was demonstrated.
TI  - Degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by a mixed culture and its component pure cultures, obtained from PAH-contaminated soil.
AB  - A mixed culture, isolated from soil contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), grew on and degraded fluoranthene in aqueous media supplemented with glucose, yeast extract, and peptone. Increased complex nitrogen levels in the medium promoted bacterial growth and a greater extent of fluoranthene degradation. Amendment of the media with high glucose levels also diminished specific fluoranthene degradation. The mixed culture was capable of degrading a range of other PAHs, including benzo[a]pyrene, anthracene, phenanthrene, acenaphthene, and fluorene. The mixed culture contained four predominant isolates, all of which were Gram-negative rods, three of which were identified as Pseudomonas putida, Flavobacterium sp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Better degradation of a defined PAH mixture was observed with the mixed culture than with individual isolates. A reconstituted culture, prepared by combining the four individual isolates, manifested a similar PAH biodegradation performance to the original mixed culture. When compared with the mixed culture, individual isolates exhibited a relatively good capacity to remove more water-soluble PAHs (acenaphthene, fluorene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene). In contrast, removal of less water-soluble PAHs (anthracene and pyrene) was low or negligible with isolated cultures compared with the mixed culture.
TI  - Characterization of the pilF-pilD pilus-assembly locus of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  - Expression of Type IV pili by the bacterial pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae appears to be essential for colonization of the human host. Several N. gonorrhoeae gene products have been recently identified which bear homology to proteins involved in pilus assembly and protein export in other bacterial systems. We report here the isolation and characterization of transposon insertion mutants in N. gonorrhoeae whose phenotypes indicate that the N. gonorrhoeae pilF and pilD gene products are required for gonoccocal pilus biogenesis. Mutants lacking the pilD gene product, a pre-pilin peptidase, were unable to process the pre-pilin subunit into pilin and thus were non-piliated. pilF mutants processed pilin but did not assemble the mature subunit. Both classes of mutants released S-pilin, a soluble, truncated form of the pilin subunit previously correlated with defects in pilus assembly. In addition, mutants containing transposon insertions in pilD or in a downstream gene, orfX, exhibited a severely restricted growth phenotype. Deletion analysis of pilD indicated that the poor growth phenotype observed for the pilD transposon mutants was a result of polar effects of the insertions on orfX expression. orfX encodes a predicted polypeptide of 23 kDa which contains a consensus nucleotide-binding domain and has apparent homologues in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Thermus thermophilus, and the eukaryote Caenorhabditis elegans. Although expression of orfX and pilD appears to be transcriptionally coupled, mutants containing transposon insertions in orfX expressed pili. Unlike either pilF or pilD mutants, orfX mutants were also competent for DNA transformation.
TI  - [Epidemiology of microbial resistance to biocides].
AB  - In order to estimate the distribution of bacteria and fungi with an elevated level of resistance to antimicrobial substances, we have analyzed water samples and surveyed institutions presumably concerned with analyses of microbial resistance (university institutes for hygiene, health authorities) by means of questionnaire. A total of 41 water samples was drawn from various aquatic biotopes in the region of Heidelberg. The samples originated from the effluents of a community sewage treatment plant, from the Neckar river, from drinking water supplies and from public swimming pools. The following substance groups were included in a search for bacteria with an elevated resistance to antiseptics and disinfectants: Aldehydes, biguanides, quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC), phenols and halogen. Upon determination of the maximal tolerated concentrations to these antimicrobial agents, samples of treated wastewater effluents showed a considerably higher prevalence of bacteria resistant to formaldehyde, chlorhexidine and QAC. The highest levels of resistance were found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Enterobacter species. The maximal tolerated level of 0.06 percent formaldehyde by weight was considerably higher than the levels tolerated by the corresponding ATCC reference strains. The highest levels of resistance to a biguanid/QAC preparation were seen in isolates of Alcaligenes species and Providencia species, with a maximal tolerated level of 0.5 volume percent. In addition, several isolates of E. coli and Klebsiella species were observed which showed a considerably higher level of resistance to the biguanide preparation as compared to the corresponding ATCC reference strains. A questionnaire was mailed to a series of institutions and companies presumably concerned with problems of microbial resistance. Responses were in accordance with our own observations, both with regard to the spectrum of bacteria observed and to the antimicrobial substances concerned.
TI  - Cytological aspects of resistance to potassium tellurite conferred on Pseudomonas cells by plasmids.
AB  - The ultrastructure of strains Pseudomonas putida BS228 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ML4262 harboring plasmids pBS10, pBS31, and pBS221, which determine resistance to potassium tellurite, was studied. Bacteria were grown in media containing increasing concentrations of potassium tellurite. Crystalline structures containing tellurium appeared in their periplasmic space. The dynamics of crystal growth was studied. Crystals were released into the medium by pinching off of the outer membrane vesicles containing growing crystals. A possible mechanism of this process was described; cytobiochemical peculiarities were discussed.
TI  - Comparative ribosomal protein sequence analyses of a phylogenetically defined genus, Pseudomonas, and its relatives.
AB  - I analyzed various families of ribosomal proteins obtained from selected species  belonging to the genus Pseudomonas sensu stricto and allied organisms which were previously classified in the genus Pseudomonas. Partial amino acid sequencing of L30 preparations revealed that the strains which I examined could be divided into three clusters. The first cluster, which was assigned to the genus Pseudomonas sensu stricto, included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas mendocina, and Pseudomonas fluorescens. The second cluster included Burkholderia pickettii and Burkholderia plantarii. The third cluster, which was a deeply branching cluster in the stem of gram-negative bacteria, included Brevundimonas diminuta and Brevundimonas vesicularis. Despite the different levels of conservation of the N-terminal sequences of ribosomal protein families (the highest level of similarity was 74% for L27 proteins and the lowest level of similarity was 42% for L30 proteins), similar phylogenetic trees were constructed by using data obtained from sequence analyses of various ribosomal protein families, including the S20, S21, L27, L29, L31, L32, and L33 protein families. Thus, I demonstrated the efficacy of ribosomal protein analysis in bacterial taxonomy.
TI  - Alginate regulatory and biosynthetic gene homologs in Pseudomonas putida WCS358:  correlation with the siderophore regulatory gene pfrA.
AB  - A previous study [Venturi et al., Mol. Microbiol. 10 (1993) 63-73] demonstrated that the siderophore regulatory gene pfrA of Pseudomonas putida (Pp) WCS358 is highly similar and interchangeable with the alginate regulatory gene algQ (algR2) of P. aeruginosa (Pa). The algQ gene is physically linked to two other alginate regulators in the Pa chromosome, namely algR (algR1), a response regulator, and algP (algR3), a histone-like gene. In this study, we have identified the same genes and a similar genetic organization in the Pp chromosome. The two genes linked to pfrA, designated pprA and pprB, are similar to algR and algP, respectively. Chromosomal mutants of pprA and pprB were constructed showing that unlike pfrA, the two newly identified regulators are not involved in siderophore regulation. The pprA gene complemented a Pa algR mutant phenotype, suggesting that it could be involved in alginate gene regulation. The WCS358 strain is not producing alginate, but we demonstrated by Southern analysis that it also possesses, in addition to pprA and pprB, algD and algU (algT) gene homologs, two genes essential for alginate biosynthesis. Using an algD-xylE transcriptional fusion, we observed that the algD promoter is active in strain WCS358 and absolutely requires pfrA. The possibility that all five genes of Pp WCS358 are involved in alginate biosynthesis is discussed.
TI  - Mechanism of the reaction catalyzed by mandelate racemase: structure and mechanistic properties of the K166R mutant.
AB  - On the basis of the available high-resolution structures of mandelate racemase (MR) from Pseudomonas putida [Landro, J. A., Gerlt, J. A., Kozarich, J. W., Koo, C. W., Shah, V. J., Kenyon, G. L., Neidhart, D. J., Fujita, J., & Petsko, G. A. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 635-643], Lys 166 and His 297 are positioned appropriately to participate in catalysis as acid/base catalysts that either abstract the alpha-proton from the enantiomers of mandelate to form an enolic intermediate or protonate the enolic intermediate to form the enantiomers of mandelate, with Lys 166 participating as the (S)-specific acid/base catalyst and His 297 participating as the (R)-specific acid/base catalyst. In this paper we report the structural and mechanistic properties of the mutant in which Lys 166 has been replaced with arginine (K166R). The structure of K166R has been determined at 1.85 A resolution with the substrate (S)-mandelate bound in the active site. The structure of this complex reveals no geometric alterations in the active site, with the exception that the longer side chain of Arg 166 is necessarily displaced upward from the position occupied by Lys 166 by steric interactions with the bound substrate. In contrast to the H297N mutant of MR [Landro, J. A., Kallarakal, A. T., Ransom, S. C., Gerlt, J. A., Kozarich, J. W., Neidhart, D. J., & Kenyon, G. L. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 9275-9281], the K166R exhibits low levels of racemase activity [kcat is reduced 5 x 10(3)-fold in the (R)- to (S)-direction and 1 x 10(3)-fold in the (S)- to (R)-direction]. The substrate and solvent deuterium isotope effects support a reaction coordinate for the K166R-catalyzed reaction in which the transition state for interconversion of bound (S)-mandelate and the stabilized enolic intermediate is higher in energy that the transition state for interconversion of bound (R)-mandelate and the stabilized enolic intermediate. The solvent deuterium isotope effect when (S)-mandelate is substrate (2.2 +/- 0.3) supports the proposal that the formation of the enolic intermediate involves partial transfer of a solvent-derived proton from Glu 317 to the substrate as the alpha-proton is abstracted [Mitra, B., Kallarakal, A. T., Kozarich, J. W., Gerlt, J. A., Clifton, J. G., Petsko, G. A., & Kenyon, G. L. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 2777-2787].(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Mechanism of the reaction catalyzed by mandelate racemase: importance of electrophilic catalysis by glutamic acid 317.
AB  - In the high-resolution X-ray structure of mandelate racemase (MR) with the competitive inhibitor (S)-atrolactate bound in the active site [Landro, J. A., Gerlt, J. A., Kozarich, J. W., Koo, C. W., Shah, V. J., Kenyon, G. L., Neidhart, D. J., Fujita, J., & Petsko, G. A. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 635-643], the carboxylic acid group of Glu 317 is hydrogen-bonded to the carboxylate group of the bound inhibitor. This geometry suggests that the carboxylic acid functional group of Glu 317 participates as a general acid catalyst in the concerted general acid-general base catalyzed formation of a stabilized enolic tautomer of mandelic acid as a reaction intermediate. To test this hypothesis, the E317Q mutant of MR was constructed and subjected to high-resolution X-ray structural analysis in the presence of (S)-atrolactate. No conformational alterations were observed to accompany the E317Q substitution at 2.1 A resolution. The values for kcat were reduced 4.5 x 10(3)-fold for (R)-mandelate and 2.9 x 10(4)-fold for (S)-mandelate; the values for kcat/Km were reduced 3 x 10(4)-fold. The substrate and solvent deuterium isotope effects measured for both wild-type MR and the E317Q mutant are not multiplicative when deuteriated substrate is studied in D2O, which suggests that the reactions catalyzed by both enzymes are stepwise and involve the formation of stabilized enolic intermediates. In contrast to wild-type MR, E317Q does not catalyze detectable elimination of bromide ion from either enantiomer of p-(bromomethyl)mandelate. However, E317Q is irreversibly inactivated by racemic alpha-phenylglycidate at a rate comparable to that measured for wild-type MR. Taken together, these mechanistic properties confirm the importance of Glu 317 as a general acid catalyst in the reaction catalyzed by wild-type MR. The kcat for wild-type MR and the reduction in kcat observed for E317O are discussed in terms of the analysis recently described by Gerlt and Gassman for understanding the rates and mechanisms of enzyme-catalyzed proton abstraction reactions from carbon acids [Gerlt, J. A., & Gassman, P. G. (1993) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 115, 11552-11568; Gerlt, J. A., & Gassman, P. G. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 11943-11952].
TI  - Regulation of the hemA gene during 5-aminolevulinic acid formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The general tetrapyrrole precursor 5-aminolevulinic acid is formed in bacteria via two different biosynthetic pathways. Members of the alpha group of the proteobacteria use 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase for the condensation of succinyl-coenzyme A and glycine, while other bacteria utilize a two-step pathway from aminoacylated tRNA(Glu). The tRNA-dependent pathway, involving the enzymes glutamyl-tRNA reductase (encoded by hemA) and glutamate-1-semialdehyde-2,1-aminomutase (encoded by hemL), was demonstrated to be used by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Comamonas testosteroni, Azotobacter vinelandii, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. To study the regulation of the pathway, the glutamyl-tRNA reductase gene (hemA) from P. aeruginosa was cloned by complementation of an Escherichia coli hemA mutant. The hemA gene was mapped to the SpeI A fragment and the DpnIL fragment of the P. aeruginosa chromosome corresponding to min 24.1 to 26.8. The cloned hemA gene, coding for a protein of 423 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 46,234 Da, forms an operon with the gene for protein release factor 1 (prf1). This translational factor mediates the termination of the protein chain at the ribosome at amber and ochre codons. Since the cloned hemA gene did not possess one of the appropriate stop codons, an autoregulatory mechanism such as that postulated for the enterobacterial system was ruled out. Three open reading frames of unknown function transcribed in the opposite direction to the hemA gene were found. hemM/orf1 and orf2 were found to be homologous to open reading frames located in the 5' region of enterobacterial hemA genes. Utilization of both transcription start sites was changed in a P. aeruginosa mutant missing the oxygen regulator Anr (Fnr analog), indicating the involvement of the transcription factor in hemA expression. DNA sequences homologous to one half of an Anr binding site were detected at one of the determined transcription start sites.
TI  - [Pseudomonads as a marker of the sanitary-epidemiological state of maternity institutions].
AB  - In the process of the epidemiological supervision of 4 maternity hospitals in Tyumen 453 Pseudomonas strains, classified with 9 species, were isolated and studied. The overwhelming majority of the strains isolated from nursing articles and medical equipment were classified with P. aeruginosa (86.75 +/- 1.68%) and P. putida (7.11 +/- 1.27%). In the structure of Pseudomonas isolated from humans these species constituted 51.11 +/- 7.45% and 26.67 +/- 6.69% respectively. High occurrence of Pseudomonas contamination of nursing articles and medical equipment in postnatal wards (11.48 +/- 0.82%) and in infants wards (6.92 +/- 0.58%) was established. Sinks of wash-stands (3.76 +/- 1.3-28.5 +/- 2.15%), compressors for the reanimation of infants (11.1 +/- 10.47%), faucets (1.69 +/- 0.7-5.29 +/- 0.92%), etc. were found to be the most contaminated objects which could be the factor of Pseudomonas transmission. The inclusion of bacteriological control into the system of epidemiological supervision in maternity hospitals facilitates the timely detection of unfavorable epidemiological situation and makes it possible to take the necessary measures with a view to decrease the functioning of mechanisms of Pseudomonas transmission well in advance.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies to Pseudomonas pseudomallei and their potential for diagnosis of melioidosis.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for Pseudomonas pseudomallei antigens were  produced by immunizing BALB/c mice with a crude whole cell extract. Hybrids secreting MAbs specific for P. pseudomallei antigens were identified by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against a panel of crude whole cell extracts from P. pseudomallei, P. cepacia, P. aeruginosa, P. putida, P. alcaligenes, Xanthomonas maltophilia, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhi, S. krefeld, S. enteritidis, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Of the six specific clones, clone 5F8, which was IgM-producing and which reacted with all 56 P. pseudomallei isolates, was selected for further characterization and evaluation of its possible diagnostic potential. Results obtained from the indirect ELISA against various P. pseudomallei antigens, from direct bacterial agglutination, and from immunofluorescence tests suggested that 5F8 reacted with the surface envelope, and probably specifically with an epitope of the lipopolysaccharide. The antibody could be readily used to identify P. pseudomallei in primary culture or in a simulated hemoculture. The antibody was also used to prepare an affinity-purified antigen for use in an indirect ELISA that was highly sensitive and specific for the detection of circulating antibody in patients with acute septicemic melioidosis.
TI  - Pollution of modern metalworking fluids containing biocides by pathogenic bacteria in France. Reexamination of chemical treatments accuracy.
AB  - Pollution by pathogenic bacteria was examined in 150 French metalworking fluid samples. Gram-negative micro-organisms such as Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and Vibrio spp. as well as Gram-positive cocci were never isolated. Nevertheless opportunistic pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae still contaminated these fluids with an isolation frequency of 17% of samples for each. These two micro-organisms failed to grow or even survive in vitro in sterile cutting fluids protected by biocides. Preliminary growth of other micro-organisms such as Pseudomonas putida or Pseudomonas fluorescens, which are the major part of the indigenous microflora, seemed to be a prerequisite for their growth. These former two Pseudomonas could resist three different classes of biocides and, at least in the case of formaldehyde-releasers, adaptation was followed by biocide deterioration. Resistance magnification was observed in the presence of the three different types of biocides and, in the case of formaldehyde releasers the resistance and deterioration levels were close to those recommended by the manufacturers. This is probably the reason why the preliminary growth of Pseudomonas putida allowed in vitro differed growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Due to relatively high isolation frequencies of opportunistic pathogens (17% of samples) periodical microbiological examination of cutting fluids should be carried out in order to evaluate risks for human health. Wearing masks and gloves is still recommended, at least in France.
TI  - Variability of peptidoglycan structural parameters in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Muropeptide composition of peptidoglycan from the Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas sp., Acinetobacter acetoaceticus, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Vibrio parahaemolyticus Yersinia enterocolitica and Escherichia coli, was analyzed by HPLC. In all instances peptidoglycan was built up from the same subunits. A wide disparity in the relative abundance of muropeptides and all structural parameters was observed. The contribution of LD-A2pm-A2pm cross-linked muropeptides was extremely variable; from 1 to 45% of cross-linked muropeptides. Muropeptides with the dipeptides Lys-Lys or Arg-Lys, indicative of murein-bound (lipo)proteins, were detected in all instances although abundance was very variable.
TI  - Effect of cultivation medium on some physicochemical parameters of outer bacterial membrane.
AB  - The changes of surface charge and hydrophobicity of the outer bacterial membrane  in relation to utilization of n-hexadecane were studied. For this spectrophotometric study adsorption of methylene blue and transport of gentian violet were used. The decrease in the negative charge of the bacterial strains Pseudomonas putida CCM 3423, P. aeruginosa, and P. fluorescens CCM 2115, depended on the type of growth medium. The decrease of surface charge was in the order: meat extract peptone broth > mineral medium with glucose > mineral medium with n-hexadecane. The highest permeability of the bacterial membrane for gentian violet was determined in the case of P. fluorescens grown in meat extract peptone broth. This effect can be explained by a greater hydrophobicity of the bacterial surface for this strain. In other strains a lower permeability was observed. P. fluorescens showed a greater adherence to hexadecane.
TI  - Structure of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 2.15  A resolution.
AB  - Protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase catalyzes the aromatic ring cleavage of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate by incorporating both atoms of molecular oxygen to yield beta-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate. The structure of this metalloenzyme from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (now reclassified as P. putida) has been refined to an R-factor of 0.172 to 2.15 A resolution. The structure is a highly symmetric (alpha beta Fe3+)12 aggregate with a root-mean-square (r.m.s.) difference of 0.18 A among symmetry-related atoms. The tertiary structure of the two polypeptides (alpha and beta) are highly homologous (r.m.s. difference of 1.05 A over 127 C alpha atoms), suggesting that the ancestral enzyme was originally a homodimer with two active sites. Indeed, a non-functional, vestigial active site retains many of the properties of the functional active site but does not bind iron. The coordination geometry of the non-heme iron catalytic cofactor can best be described as trigonal bipyramidal with Tyr447 (147 beta) and His462 (162 beta) serving as axial ligands, and Tyr408 (108 beta), His460 (160 beta) and Wat837 serving as equitorial ligands. The active site environment has a number of basic residues that may promote binding of the acidic substrate. Within the putative active site cavity which is located between alpha and beta chains, five approximately coplanar solvent molecules suggest a position for the planar substrate Trp449 (149 beta), Ile491 (191 beta), defined by Gly14 (14 alpha) and Pro15 (15 alpha). In this position the guanidino group of Arg457 (157 beta) would be buried by the substrate, suggesting a functional role in catalysis.
TI  - Effect of temperature on antimicrobial susceptibilities of Pseudomonas species isolated from drinking water.
AB  - The susceptibility of 20 strains of Pseudomonas species isolated from drinking waters (4 P. aeruginosa, 7 P. fluorescens, 5 P. stutzeri, 1 P. maltophilia, 1 P. cepacia, 1 P. putida and 1 P. pickettii) to a variety of antibiotics (gentamicin, amikacin, azlocillin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol and polymyxin B) were determined by Stoke's method at 20 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 37 degrees C and 42 degrees C. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined for aminoglycosides on Mueller-Hinton agar at the above temperatures. There was a significant difference in susceptibility between 20 degrees C or 30 degrees C (most resistant), 37 degrees C (more susceptible) and 42 degrees C (most susceptible) to gentamicin and to a lesser degree to amikacin for P. maltophilia, P. cepacia and most strains of P. fluorescens. The P. aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, P. putida and P. pickettii strains showed no difference in susceptibility at 20 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 37 degrees C and 42 degrees C. The need for standardized conditions with special regard to temperature when antibiotic susceptibility tests are performed for P. maltophilia, P. cepacia and P. fluorescens strains is stressed.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and functional analysis of the genes encoding 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid oxygenase in Pseudomonas cepacia AC1100.
AB  - Pseudomonas cepacia AC1100 is able to use the chlorinated aromatic compound 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) as the sole source of carbon and energy. One of the early steps in this pathway is the conversion of 2,4,5-T to 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (2,4,5-TCP). 2,4,5-TCP accumulates in the culture medium when AC1100 is grown in the presence of 2,4,5-T. A DNA region from the AC1100 genome has been subcloned as a 2.7-kb SstI-XbaI DNA fragment, which on transfer to Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 allows the conversion of 2,4,5-T to 2,4,5-TCP. We have determined the directions of transcription of these genes as well as the complete nucleotide sequences of the genes and the number and sizes of the polypeptides synthesized by pulse-labeling experiments. This 2.7-kb DNA fragment encodes two polypeptides with calculated molecular masses of 51 and 18 kDa. Proteins of similar sizes were seen in the T7 pulse-labeling experiment in Escherichia coli. We have designated the genes for these proteins tftA1 (which encodes the 51-kDa protein) and tftA2 (which encodes the 18-kDa protein). TftA1 and TftA2 have strong amino acid sequence homology to BenA and BenB from the benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase system of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, as well as to XylX and XylY from the toluate 1,2-dioxygenase system of Pseudomonas putida. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 strain containing the 2.7-kb SstI-XbaI fragment was able to convert not only 2,4,5-T to 2,4,5-TCP but also 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid to 2,4-dichlorophenol and phenoxyacetate to phenol.
TI  - Heterotrophic bacterial populations in the mineral waters of thermal springs in Spain.
AB  - The microbiological quality and heterotrophic bacterial populations of 26 thermal mineral water springs in Spain were studied. In most of the springs the number of viable aerobes was less than 10(3) cfu ml-1 and the number of sporulated bacteria less than 10(2) cfu ml-1. No significant differences were found in the counts obtained with Plate Count Agar (PCA) and PCA diluted 1:10 and incubated at 22 degrees, 37 degrees and 45 degrees C. Total coliforms were found in 14 springs, faecal streptococci in three, spores of sulphite-reducing Clostridium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in seven. Neither Escherichia coli nor Staphylococcus aureus were found. A total of 665 strains were isolated and 85.4% of these identified; 329 were Gram-positive and 239 were Gram-negative. The genera most prevalent present in the springs were Pseudomonas (in 92.3%), Bacillus (65.4%), Enterobacter, Micrococcus and Staphylococcus (50%), Acinetobacter (42.3%), Arthrobacter (38.4%), Clostridium (27%) and Xanthomonas (23%). Gram-negative bacteria predominated in the mesothermal springs and Gram-positive bacteria in the hyper- and hypothermal springs. The most common Gram-negative rod species isolated were Ps. fluorescens, Ps. aeruginosa, Ps. putida, Ent. agglomerans, Ent. sakazakii, Ac. calcoaceticus and Ent. amnigenus.
TI  - Detection and differentiation of microbial siderophores by isoelectric focusing and chrome azurol S overlay.
AB  - Siderophores are microbial, low molecular weight iron-chelating compounds. Fluorescent Pseudomonads produce different, strain-specific fluorescent siderophores (pyoverdines) as well as non-fluorescent siderophores in response to low iron conditions. We present an isoelectric focusing method applicable to unpurified as well as to purified pyoverdine samples where the fluorescent siderophores are visualized under UV illumination. Siderophores from different Pseudomonas sp., amongst which are P. aeruginosa, P. fluorescens and P. putida, including egg yolk, rhizospheric and clinical isolates as well as some derived Tn5 mutants were separated by this technique. Different patterns could be observed for strains known to produce different siderophores. The application of the chrome azurol S assay as a gel overlay further allows immediate detection of non-fluorescent siderophores or possibly degradation products with residual siderophore activity. The method was also applied to other microbial siderophores such as deferrioxamine B.
TI  - Secretion of human epidermal growth factor (EGF) in autotrophic culture by a recombinant hydrogen-utilizing bacterium, Pseudomonas pseudoflava, carrying broad-host-range EGF secretion vector pKSEGF2.
AB  - We constructed the broad-host-range human epidermal growth factor (EGF) secretion plasmid pKSEGF2 by inserting the Escherichia coli tac promoter, the signal sequence of Pseudomonas stutzeri amylase, and the synthesized EGF gene into the broad-host-range vector pKT230. E. coli JM109 carrying pKSEGF2 secreted EGF into the periplasm and the culture medium under the control of the tac promoter. Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1161 carrying pKSEGF2 and Pseudomonas putida AC10 carrying pKSEGF2 secreted EGF into the culture medium constitutively. Four hydrogen-utilizing bacteria, Pseudomonas pseudoflava, Alcaligenes eutrophus, Alcaligenes paradoxus, and Paracoccus denitrificans, were transconjugated with pKSEGF2 from eight hydrogen-utilizing bacteria tested. In these transconjugated hydrogen-utilizing bacteria, P. pseudoflava carrying pKSEGF2 grew autotrophically and secreted EGF, confirmed by Western blot (immunoblot) analysis, into the culture medium constitutively.
TI  - Molecular cloning of two Pseudomonas flagellin genes and basal body structural genes.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida strains PaW8 and PRS2000 produce flagellins with apparent molecular masses of 81 kDa and 50 kDa respectively. Two Tn5 insertion mutants of P. putida PaW8 lacking the ability to bind the flagellin-specific monoclonal antibody MLV1 were isolated. Mutant PaW8-flg2 contained a Tn5 insertion within a 2.6 kb EcoRI fragment of the P. putida chromosome carrying putative basal body genes. DNA and deduced protein sequences suggested the presence on this fragment of two complete genes homologous to flgH and flgI from Salmonella typhimurium. The insertion of Tn5 occurred in the flgI locus and appeared severely to reduce expression of the P. putida flagellin gene. A Tn5-containing fragment of DNA from a second mutant, PaW8-flg1, was cloned and found to contain sequences that hybridized strongly with the Pseudomonas aeruginosa flagellin gene. A 2.3 kb HindIII fragment containing all but 62 bp of the P. putida PaW8 flagellin gene was cloned and used as a probe to identify clones carrying the equivalent gene from P. putida PRS2000. Flagellin genes from both P. putida strains were sequenced and their amino acid sequences deduced. Both flagellins were found to contain conserved amino- and carboxy-terminal regions when compared to other flagellins, with the central region being more variable. The epitope for MLV1 is likely to lie within this central region of P. putida PaW8 flagellin. The deduced molecular mass of P. putida PaW8 flagellin (68 kDa) differed significantly from its apparent molecular mass estimated by PAGE, possibly as a consequence of post-translational modification.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Oxygen dependent regulation of Vitreoscilla globin gene: evidence for positive regulation by FNR.
AB  - Vitreoscilla globin (vgb) gene, encoding for Vitreoscilla haemoglobin (VtHb) has  been cloned and functionally expressed in heterologous bacterial hosts. Analysis of vgb gene expression and the study on vgb-xylE transcriptional fusion revealed that vgb promoter is preferentially activated in response to oxygen limitation in Vitreoscilla and other heterologous bacterial hosts. Microaerobic mode of induction in various hosts, provided evidence for a common regulatory factor involved in activation of vgb promoter under hypoxic condition. Primary structure analysis of vgb upstream regulatory region indicated the presence of a possible binding site for the transcriptional activator, FNR. Further, the E.coli mutant lacking fnr gene product was not able to activate vgb promoter under microaerobic condition, suggesting the involvement of FNR or FNR-like proteins in modulating its activity. The possibility of a second level of control by CRP is also indicated. Oxygen responsive nature and regulatory characteristics of vgb promoter offers a novel system for the expression of gene in heterologous bacterial hosts in an oxygen dependent manner.
TI  - Combination effect of meropenem with aminoglycosides and teicoplanin on Pseudomonas and enterococci.
AB  - The in vitro activity of meropenem, a new carbapenem, and the combination effect  with netilmicin, tobramycin, gentamicin, and teicoplanin against Pseudomonas spp. and enterococci was studied. Meropenem showed very good in vitro activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 2 mg/l) and good to moderate activity against Pseudomonas putida (MIC90 4 mg/l) and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 8 mg/l). Aminoglycosides were highly active against P. putida (MIC90 0.5 mg/l), but showed only moderate activity against P. aeruginosa. The synergistic effect of meropenem was shown in combination with teicoplanin against E. faecalis (40%). No Pseudomonas strains were inhibited by the synergistic effect of meropenem with aminoglycosides. No antagonism occurred with any of the combinations.
TI  - Survival and respiratory activity of genetically engineered Pseudomonas spp. exposed to antimicrobial agents in broth and soil.
AB  - The effectiveness of seven chemical disinfectants were tested against genetically engineered Pseudomonas spp. under optimal growth conditions. Each chemical was tested to determine how quickly 10(8) cells/ml Pseudomonas fluorescens C5t (containing Bacillus thuringiensis endotoxin gene) were killed in King's B broth at 30 degrees C. The minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) for calcium hypochlorite, benzalkonium chloride, Germiphene and Spectrum Clear Bath were 0.06% (w/v), 0.01% (w/v), 0.08% (v/v) and 0.044 (v/v), respectively. Virocidin X and CanLab Neutral did not kill P. fluorescens C5t at concentrations up to 20% (v/v). Baxter Bacdown was ineffective as a killing agent at concentrations up to 10% (v/v). These agents were also tested on P. aureofaciens RNL11 (lacZY), P. putida strains PaW8 and PaW340 (containing the plasmid pLV1013 encoding the xylE gene) and P. aeruginosa UG2L (lacZY and luxAB). All strains were killed by similar disinfectant concentrations with the exception of P. aeruginosa UG2L. The MBCs for this strain were double the MBCs for P. fluorescens C5t with all disinfectants used except for Spectrum Clear Bath, which was similar. Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide evolution were used to assess the activity of P. fluorescens C5t inoculated in non-sterile soil in the presence of antimicrobial agents. Concentrations chosen were 0.1 and 1.0% (w/v) calcium hypochlorite, 0.01 and 0.1% (w/v) benzalkonium chloride, 0.1 and 1.0% (v/v) Germiphene and 0.1 and 1.0% (v/v) Spectrum Clear Bath. Over a 15-day period, the antimicrobial agents did not reduce respiratory activity of P. fluorescens C5t and indigenous soil micro-organisms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa glucose-selective OprB porin gene and distribution of OprB within the family Pseudomonadaceae.
AB  - OprB is a glucose-selective porin known to be produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa  and Pseudomonas putida. We have cloned and sequenced the oprB gene of P. aeruginosa and obtained expression of OprB in Escherichia coli. The mature protein consists of 423 amino acid residues with a deduced molecular mass of 47597 Da. Several clusters of amino acid residues, potentially involved in the structure or function of the protein, were identified. An area of regional homology with E. coli LamB was also identified. Carbohydrate-inducible proteins, potentially homologous to OprB, were identified in several rRNA homology-group-I pseudomonads by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, Western immunoblotting and N-terminal amino acid sequencing. These species also contained DNA that hybridized to a P. aeruginosa oprB gene probe.
TI  - Development of a PCR probe test for identifying Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas (Burkholderia) cepacia.
AB  - AIMS: To develop a system of species specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA hybridisation based on 16s ribosomal RNA sequences for the identification of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas (Burkholderia) cepacia in sputum from children with cystic fibrosis. METHODS: Most of the 16s rRNA sequences from strains of Ps aeruginosa, Ps (Burkholderia) cepacia, and Ps putida were determined. PCR primers and DNA probes were synthesised from suitable sequences and then evaluated on bacterial cultures and sputum samples. RESULTS: About 1000 bases of sequence was obtained from strains of Ps aeruginosa, Ps (Burkholderia) cepacia, and Ps putida. PCR of bacterial cultures was species specific, but PCR on sputum resulted in some non-specific amplification products. The subsequent hybridisation reaction was species specific. CONCLUSION: A species specific system of PCR and DNA hybridisation based on 16s rRNA sequences is applicable in clinical practice, and may aid the early diagnosis of respiratory tract infection with small numbers of Ps aeruginosa and Ps (Burkholderia) cepacia in patients with cystic fibrosis.
TI  - [Genetic control of the synthesis of enzymes of the common site for the aromatic  pathway in Pseudomonas bacteria].
AB  - We have shown recently that the first stage of the common site for the aromatic pathway in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. putida, P. fluorescens, P. acidovorans, and P. testosteroni is controlled by repression of 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosenate-7-phosphate-synthase synthesis with phenylalanine and tyrosine. This work is devoted to the study of genetic control of the remaining six stages of the common site for aromatic pathway in representatives of Pseudomonas genus using auxotrophic and regulatory mutants it was shown that genes aroB, aroD, aroE, aroL, aroA, and aroC operate constitutively in P. putida, P. mendocina, P. marginata, and P. acidovorans.
TI  - Characterization of type IV pilus genes in plant growth-promoting Pseudomonas putida WCS358.
AB  - In a search for factors that could contribute to the ability of the plant growth-stimulating Pseudomonas putida WCS358 to colonize plant roots, the organism was analyzed for the presence of genes required for pilus biosynthesis. The pilD gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which has also been designated xcpA, is involved in protein secretion and in the biogenesis of type IV pili. It encodes a peptidase that processes the precursors of the pilin subunits and of several components of the secretion apparatus. Prepilin processing activity could be demonstrated in P. putida WCS358, suggesting that this nonpathogenic strain may contain type IV pili as well. A DNA fragment containing the pilD (xcpA) gene of P. putida was cloned and found to complement a pilD (xcpA) mutation in P. aeruginosa. Nucleotide sequencing revealed, next to the pilD (xcpA) gene, the presence of two additional genes, pilA and pilC, that are highly homologous to genes involved in the biogenesis of type IV pili. The pilA gene encodes the pilin subunit, and pilC is an accessory gene, required for the assembly of the subunits into pili. In comparison with the pil gene cluster in P. aeruginosa, a gene homologous to pilB is lacking in the P. putida gene cluster. Pili were not detected on the cell surface of P. putida itself, not even when pilA was expressed from the tac promoter on a plasmid, indicating that not all the genes required for pilus biogenesis were expressed under the conditions tested. Expression of pilA of P. putida in P. aeruginosa resulted in the production of pili containing P. putida PilA subunits.
TI  - FptA, the Fe(III)-pyochelin receptor of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: a phenolate siderophore receptor homologous to hydroxamate siderophore receptors.
AB  - The Pseudomonas aeruginosa siderophore pyochelin is structurally unique among siderophores and possesses neither hydroxamate- nor catecholate-chelating groups. The structural gene encoding the 75-kDa outer membrane Fe(III)-pyochelin receptor FptA has been isolated by plasmid rescue techniques and sequenced. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the isolated FptA protein corresponded to that deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the fptA structural gene. The mature FptA protein has 682 amino acids and a molecular mass of 75,993 Da and has considerable overall homology with the hydroxamate siderophore receptors FpvA of P. aeruginosa, PupA and PupB of Pseudomonas putida, and FhuE of Escherichia coli. This observation indicates that homologies between siderophore receptors are an unreliable predictor of siderophore ligand class recognition by a given receptor. The fptA gene was strongly regulated by iron; fptA transcription was totally repressed by 30 microM FeCl3, as determined by Northern (RNA) blotting. The promoter of the fptA gene contained the sequence 5'-ATAATGATAAGCATTATC-3', which matches the consensus E. coli Fur-binding site at 17 of 18 positions. The -10 promoter region and transcriptional start site of the fptA gene reside within this Fur-binding site.
TI  - Self-mobilization and organization of the genes encoding the toluene metabolic pathway of Pseudomonas mendocina KR1.
AB  - The toluene metabolic pathway of Pseudomonas mendocina KR1 is chromosomally encoded, but the pathway could be transferred by conjugation from strain KR1 to the chromosome of P. aeruginosa or P. putida. Such transconjugants utilized toluene, p-cresol, and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde. However, transconjugants were unable to further transfer toluene genes to other recipients unless Pseudomonas sex factor R68.45 was present in trans. Although the genes encoding the upper pathway for toluene metabolism in P. mendocina KR1 are sufficiently linked to permit their coordinate mobilization, they were found to be encoded in three independently regulated units: one encoding toluene-4-monooxygenase, a second encoding p-cresol methylhydroxylase and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase, and a third encoding p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase. The last two regulatory units were cloned from the chromosome of a P. aeruginosa transconjugant onto a plasmid designated pRO1999. Analysis of pRO1999 showed that genes encoding p-cresol methylhydroxylase and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase are organized as an operon; the gene encoding p-hydroxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase is transcribed first, and this is followed by transcription of the gene encoding p-cresol methylhydroxylase. This operon is regulated by a positively acting regulator. The P. mendocina KR1 gene encoding p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase was linked to, but independently regulated from, the genes encoding toluene-4-monooxygenase, p-cresol methylhydroxylase, and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase.
TI  - [Antimicrobial conservation of some cosmetics].
AB  - Investigations were carried on with model cream with O/W and W/O emulsion type and three selected tooth pastes produced by Pollena-Lechia. Own "conservation test" was applied for a period of 28 days basing on methods recommended by PN-80/C-77022 for cosmetics. Applied test microorganisms were recommended by National Institute of Hygiene for investigation of disinfecting agents and strains of bacteria and fungi isolated from cosmetics. Initial level of contamination amounted to 10(6) cells/g. Following biocides were used: Nipagin A, M and P, Kathon CG, Sepicide Cl, Chlor-hexidine gluconate, Myacide SP, Bromochlorophene, Germall 115, Gropol, benzalkonium bromide, Cetrimide, Irgasan DP-300 and Bronopol. Most effective biocides for creams with W/O emulsion type effective during 5 days were Gropol and Bronopol in concentration of 0.01% and Kathon CG in concentration of 0.05%. For tooth pastes optimal biocide was Sepicide Cl in concentration of 0.3% which was cidal in time of 4 days. Out of tested microorganisms most resistant to mentioned biocides were Pseudomonas aeruginosa i P. putida isolated from cosmetic creams.
TI  - A mutagenesis system utilizing a Tn1722 derivative containing an Escherichia coli-specific vector plasmid: application to Pseudomonas species.
AB  - A novel transposon (Tn) mutagenesis system for Gram- non-enteric bacteria was developed which allowed rapid and one-step cloning of the mutated region in Escherichia coli. The Tn constructed was Tn1722-299Km, a Tn1722 derivative containing a KmR gene and the entire sequence of an E. coli-specific plasmid, pACYC184. The hybrid plasmid consisting of Tn1722-299Km and the transfer genes of plasmid R388 was conjugally transferred from E. coli to Pseudomonas putida or P. aeruginosa, and selection of the transconjugants expressing the Tn-specified resistance genes led to isolation of insertion mutants of the recipient strain. The presence of the pACYC184 replicon in the Tn greatly facilitated rapid and easy cloning of the mutated region in E. coli through (i) mini-scale preparation of the genomic DNA from the Tn-inserted mutant, (ii) digestion of the DNA with an appropriate restriction endonuclease, (iii) self-ligation, and (iv) transformation of E. coli to recover the plasmid carrying the Tn-specified resistance marker. This procedure was successfully adapted to clone the Tn-inserted trpBA region of P. putida. Such a cloned region was further employed to isolate the wild-type allele of the trpBA region without construction of a genomic library.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and expression of the Pseudomonas putida protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase genes.
AB  - The genes that encode the alpha and beta subunits of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (3,4-PCD [EC 1.13.11.3]) were cloned from a Pseudomonas putida (formerly P. aeruginosa) (ATCC 23975) genomic library prepared in lambda phage. Plaques were screened by hybridization with degenerate oligonucleotides designed using known amino acid sequences. A 1.5-kb SmaI fragment from a 15-kb primary clone was subcloned, sequenced, and shown to contain two successive open reading frames, designated pcaH and pcaG, corresponding to the beta and alpha subunits, respectively, of 3,4-PCD. The amino acid sequences deduced from pcaHG matched the chemically determined sequence of 3,4-PCD in all except three positions. Cloning of pcaHG into broad-host-range expression vector pKMY319 allowed high levels of expression in P. putida strains, as well as in Proteus mirabilis after specific induction of the plasmid-encoded nahG promoter with salicylate. The recombinant enzyme was purified and crystallized from P. mirabilis, which lacks an endogenous 3,4-PCD. The physical, spectroscopic, and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzyme were indistinguishable from those of the wild-type enzyme. Moreover, the same transient enzyme intermediates were formed during the catalytic cycle. These studies establish the methodology which will allow mechanistic investigations to be pursued through site-directed mutagenesis of P. putida 3,4-PCD, the only aromatic ring-cleaving dioxygenase for which the three-dimensional structure is known.
TI  - The specific growth rate of Pseudomonas putida PAW1 influences the conjugal transfer rate of the TOL plasmid.
AB  - The kinetics of the conjugal transfer of a TOL plasmid were investigated by using Pseudomonas putida PAW1 as the donor strain and P. aeruginosa PAO 1162 as the recipient strain. Short-term batch mating experiments were performed in a nonselective medium, while the evolution of the different cell types was determined by selective plating techniques. The experimental data were analyzed by using a mass action model that describes plasmid transfer kinetics. This method allowed analysis of the mating experiments by a single intrinsic kinetic parameter for conjugal plasmid transfer. Further results indicated that the specific growth rate of the donor strain antecedent to the mating experiment had a strong impact on the measured intrinsic plasmid transfer rate coefficient, which ranged from 1 x 10(-14) to 5 x 10(-13) ml per cell per min. Preliminary analysis suggested that the transfer rates of the TOL plasmid are large enough to maintain the TOL plasmid in a dense microbial community without selective pressures.
TI  - Biophysical characterization of OprB, a glucose-inducible porin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - OprB, a glucose-inducible porin of P. aeruginosa, was characterized by black lipid bilayer analysis and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Black lipid bilayer analysis of OprB revealed a single-channel conductance of 25 pS, the presence of a glucose binding site with a Ks for glucose of 380 +/- 40 mM, and the formation of channels with a strong selection for anions. Analysis of P. aeruginosa OprB circular dichroism spectra revealed a high beta sheet content (40%) which is within the range of that determined for other porins. Values obtained from black lipid bilayer analysis were compared to those previously obtained for OprB of P. putida [Saravolac et al. (1991). J. Bacteriol. 173, 4970-4976] and indicated extensive similarities in the single-channel conductance and glucose-binding properties of these two porins. Immunological and amino terminal sequence analysis revealed a high degree of homology. Of the first 14 amino terminal residues, 12 were identical. A major difference between the two porins was found in their ion selectivity. Whereas P. aeruginosa OprB is anion selective, P. putida OprB and other carbohydrate selective porins are known to be cation selective.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a siderophore regulatory gene (pfrA) of Pseudomonas putida WCS358: homology to the alginate regulatory gene algQ of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Genes encoding biosynthesis of pseudobactin 358 (a microbial iron transport agent) and its cognate outer membrane receptor protein, PupA, are transcribed only under iron limitation in plant growth-promoting Pseudomonas putida WCS358. Two cosmid clones were identified from a gene bank of WCS358 DNA which could independently and in an iron-dependent manner activate transcription from a WCS358 siderophore gene promoter in heterologous Pseudomonas strain A225. The functional region of one of the clones was localized by subcloning, transposon Tn3Gus mutagenesis, and DNA sequencing. Genomic transposon insertion mutants in the functional region lost the capacity to activate a siderophore gene promoter fusion transcriptionally; furthermore, these mutants no longer produced pseudobactin 358. The activating region consisted of a single gene designated pfrA (Pseudomonas ferric regulator). The pfrA gene codes for a single polypeptide, PfrA, of approximately 18 kDa, which has 58% identity to AlgQ (also known as AlgR2), a positive regulator involved in transcriptionally regulating alginate biosynthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cross-complementation studies between the pfrA gene of P. putida and the algQ gene of P. aeruginosa revealed that pfrA can restore mucoidy (alginate production) in an algQ mutant and that algQ could poorly complement a pfrA genomic mutant. It is concluded that PfrA is involved in the positive regulation of siderophore biosynthetic genes in response to iron limitation; furthermore, pfrA and algQ appeared to be interchangeable between P. putida and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis of the ferripyoverdine receptor gene fpvA of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa K437 lacks the ferripyoverdine receptor and, as a result,  grows poorly on an iron-deficient minimal medium supplemented with ethylenediamine-di(o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) (EDDHA) and pyroverdine. By using a phagemid-based in vivo cloning system, attempts were made to clone the receptor gene by complementing this growth defect. Several recombinant phagemids carrying P. aeruginosa chromosomal DNA which provided for good growth on EDDHA-pyoverdine-containing medium and which concomitantly restored production of the ferripyroverdine receptor in strain K437 were isolated. These phagemids contained a common 4.6-kb SphI fragment which similarly restored production of the receptor in K437. Nucleotide sequencing of the SphI fragment revealed a single large open reading frame, designated fpvA (ferripyoverdine uptake), of 2439 bp. The predicted translation product of fpvA has a molecular mass of 89,395 Da. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the purified ferripyoverdine receptor confirmed fpvA as the receptor gene. Moreover, it indicated that the receptor is initially synthesized as a precursor with a signal sequence of 27 amino acids which is cleaved to yield the mature protein. The deduced FpvA polypeptide exhibited homology to regions shown to be conserved in TonB-dependent receptor proteins. FpvA also shared strong homology (41.3% identity) with the PupA protein of Pseudomonas putida WCS358. This protein is the receptor for the iron-bound form of pseudobactin, a compound structurally very similar to pyoverdine.
TI  - Gene expression in Pseudomonas.
AB  - Gene regulation studies in pseudomonad bacteria are mainly restricted to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. Constitutive promoters exhibit DNA sequences similar to the sigma (70)-dependent constitutive promoters of Escherichia coli. The TOL meta-cleavage pathway operon promoter and the nah operon promoters are the best characterized sigma (70)-dependent promoters, which exhibit-10 regions rich in As and Ts and non-conserved-35 regions. The DNA binding motif recognized by the respective positive regulators lies between-40 and-80. Another set of positively controlled promoters exhibit upstream activator sequences located between-100 and-500. Transcription stimulation from some of these promoters also involves sigma (54) and/or IHF protein. In this class of promoters, DNA binding is required to establish open complexes. Promoters for the utilization of histidine (hut) are under negative control by the HutC protein. hut promoters exhibit-10/-35 consensus regions and an overlapping operator sequence between-15 and-50. Repression of hut promoters seems to be achieved through steric hindrance of RNA polymerase. Another set of promoters are controlled by catabolite repression, which seems to be cyclic-AMP independent.
TI  - Analysis of the DNA damage-mediated induction of Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa lexA genes.
AB  - A fusion between the lexA gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida and the lacZ gene was constructed in vitro and cloned in a mini-Tn5 transposon derivative to obtain chromosomal insertions which enable to quantitatively examine their transcriptional regulation in both Pseudomonas and E. coli. Analysis of DNA damage-mediated induction of these lexA-lacZ fusions showed that expression of P. putida and P. aeruginosa lexA genes was always higher and earlier than the expression of the lexA gene of E. coli. Furthermore, and in contrast to the lexA gene fusion of E. coli, the rates and extent of the induction of lexA gene fusion of P. putida and P. aeruginosa were largely independent of the UV doses applied. The behaviour of the lexA-lacZ fusions of two Pseudomonas species was the same regardless of whether they were inserted into their own chromosome or into E. coli.
TI  - Mapping of the ben, ant and cat genes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and evolutionary  relationship of the ben region of P. aeruginosa and P. putida.
AB  - Genes responsible for the utilization of benzoate, anthranilate or catechol (ben, ant, cat) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO were mapped precisely using a cosmid clone carrying all these genes. Genes were localized either by subcloning and complementation or by Tn5 mutagenesis and mapping of the Tn5 insertions. To achieve this, a novel Tn5 mutagenesis procedure was developed by constructing a Tn5 insertion derivative of the Escherichia coli strain S17-1. Preliminary mapping of the ben cat genes of P. putida PPN was accomplished by complementation using a PPN cosmid bank. Sequence homology was demonstrated by Southern hybridization between the ben regions of both P. aeruginosa and P. putida, implying an evolutionary relationship of this chromosomal region of these two pseudomonads.
TI  - Superoxide dismutase activity in root-colonizing pseudomonads.
AB  - Several saprophytic fluorescent pseudomonads that are aggressive root colonizers  express similar specific activities of superoxide dismutase during growth in liquid culture. The pseudomonads have the potential to produce hydrogen peroxide sensitive and hydrogen peroxide insensitive isoforms of superoxide dismutase with distinct mobilities in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Synthesis of the hydrogen peroxide insensitive form is enhanced by limited iron availability, by exposure to Mn2+, and to a lesser extent by external sources of superoxide anion. Unlike Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a root-colonizing strain of Pseudomonas putida did not show regulation of isoform pattern by phosphate availability. A plasmid potentially encoding the pseudomonad hydrogen peroxide sensitive form complemented the superoxide dismutase deficiency in a mutant of Escherichia coli lacking expression of both Fe and Mn genes. Contact between the plant root and pseudomonad or E. coli cells that lack or express superoxide dismutase did not influence superoxide anion production from root surface enzymes. The pseudomonad and the superoxide dismutase deficient and producing E. coli strains survived exposure to the root equally well. Only the hydrogen peroxide sensitive isoform of superoxide dismutase was detected in P. putida cells associated with bean root surfaces.
TI  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa promoters which contain a conserved GG-N10-GC motif but appear to be RpoN-independent.
AB  - The proC gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes the constitutive delta 1-pyrroline 5-carboxylate reductase (the third enzyme of proline biosynthesis) and ranks among the numerous Pseudomonas genes which are poorly transcribed in Escherichia coli. The promoters of the proC gene were located by deletion mapping. The 5' ends of the proC transcripts originating from one promoter were determined by primer extension. This promoter has a GG-N10-GC motif with a 16 bp spacing between the GC doublet and the transcription start site. Such spacing is unusually long for sigma 54-dependent promoters. In rpoN mutants of P. aeruginosa and P. putida a proC'--'lacZ fusion was expressed at wild-type levels, suggesting that sigma 54 RNA polymerase is not involved in proC transcription. The expression of another P. aeruginosa gene, anr (for anaerobic regulation of nitrate respiration and anaerobic arginine degradation), also appeared to be independent of RpoN in Pseudomonas and occurred at a very low level in E. coli. The proC and anr promoters have sequence similarities in addition to the conserved GG--N10--GC motif and may also be related to some alg (alginate) promoters of P. aeruginosa. We propose that the proC and anr promoters are activated by proteins, including perhaps an alternative sigma factor, which are present in Pseudomonas but absent from E. coli.
TI  - Enhanced mineralization of polychlorinated biphenyls in soil inoculated with chlorobenzoate-degrading bacteria.
AB  - An Altamont soil containing no measurable population of chlorobenzoate utilizers  was examined for the potential to enhance polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mineralization by inoculation with chlorobenzoate utilizers, a biphenyl utilizer, combinations of the two physiological types, and chlorobiphenyl-mineralizing transconjugants. Biphenyl was added to all soils, and biodegradation of 14C-Aroclor 1242 was assessed by disappearance of that substance and by production of 14CO2. Mineralization of PCBs was consistently greatest (up to 25.5%) in soils inoculated with chlorobenzoate degraders alone. Mineralization was significantly lower in soils receiving all other treatments: PCB cometabolizer (10.7%); chlorobiphenyl mineralizers (8.7 and 14.9%); and mixed inocula of PCB cometabolizers and chlorobenzoate utilizers (11.4 and 18.0%). However, all inoculated soils had higher mineralization than did the uninoculated control (3.1%). PCB disappearance followed trends similar to that observed with the mineralization data, with the greatest degradation occurring in soils inoculated with the chlorobenzoate-degrading strains Pseudomonas aeruginosa JB2 and Pseudomonas putida P111 alone. While the mechanism by which the introduction of chlorobenzoate degraders alone enhanced biodegradation of PCBs could not be elucidated, the possibility that chlorobenzoate inoculants acquired the ability to metabolize biphenyl and possibly PCBs was explored. When strain JB2, which does not utilize biphenyl, was inoculated into soil containing biphenyl and Aroclor 1242, the frequency of isolates able to utilize biphenyl and 2,5-dichlorobenzoate increased progressively with time from 3.3 to 44.4% between 15 and 48 days, respectively. Since this soil contained no measurable level of chlorobenzoate utilizers yet did contain a population of biphenyl utilizers, the possibility of genetic transfer between the latter group and strain JB2 cannot be excluded.
TI  - Precise deletions in large bacterial genomes by vector-mediated excision (VEX). The trfA gene of promiscuous plasmid RK2 is essential for replication in several gram-negative hosts.
AB  - We have developed a simple and efficient method of vector-mediated excision (VEX) for in vivo generation of precisely defined deletions in large bacterial genomes. The system uses homologous recombination with small cloned fragments on specialized pVEX plasmids to insert directly repeated bacteriophage P1 loxP sites at positions flanking the region to be deleted. In the presence of Cre recombinase, the loxP sites are efficiently recombined to produce the deletion. Deletion endpoints can be directed to specific nucleotides because they are defined by the termini of small homology-bearing fragments cloned into the pVEX plasmids. We have used VEX to delete trfA, the only known replication initiator gene of the 56.4 kb broad host-range plasmid RK2. The RK2 delta trfA mutant was found to be conjugation proficient, but unable to replicate in the RK2 hosts Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Caulobacter crescentus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Rhizobium meliloti, or Rhodobacter sphaeroides. These results show that trfA is essential for replication in these hosts and indicate that the broad host-range of RK2 does not involve multiple replicons.
TI  - A mutation in algN permits trans activation of alginate production by algT in Pseudomonas species.
AB  - Conversion of the mucoid phenotype, which results from the production of the exopolysaccharide alginate, is a feature typical of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains causing chronic pulmonary infections in patients with cystic fibrosis. In this study, we further characterized a recombinant plasmid, called pJF15, that contains DNA from the 65- to 70-min region of the chromosome of mucoid P. aeruginosa FRD1 and has loci involved in alginate conversion. Plasmid pJF15 complements algT mutations in trans and confers the mucoid phenotype in cis following gene replacement. However, the phenotype of nonmucoid P. aeruginosa carrying pJF15 is unchanged. Here we report the identification of a locus immediately downstream of algT, called algN, that may be a negative regulator that blocks algT from activating alginate production. Inactivation of algN by transposon Tn501 insertion allowed algT to stimulate alginate production in trans. The DNA sequence of this region identified an open reading frame that predicts an algN gene product of 33 kDa, but no homology was found to other proteins in a sequence data base. Clones of algT in which algN was deleted caused the activation of alginate biosynthesis in transconjugants of several P. aeruginosa strains. DNA containing algT was shown to hybridize to the genomes of several Pseudomonas species, including P. putida, P. stutzeri, and P. fluorescens. Transconjugants of these species carrying algT DNA (with a deletion of algN) from pJF15 showed a mucoid phenotype and increased production of uronic acid-containing polymers that resembled alginate.
TI  - Increased expression of the plasmid-determined 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase  gene in strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - A 6.5-kb EcoRI fragment containing the gene encoding 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase from the plasmid pBS312 was cloned into broad host range plasmid RSF1010 and expressed in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. The increased expression of the gene was orientation-dependent and probably due to the transcription read through from the streptomycin promoter of the vector. Subcloning experiments of the PstI fragments of pBS312 plasmid using vector pBR322 revealed that the bphC gene encoding 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase is localized on the 2.1-kb fragment. In Escherichia coli JM109, transformed by the plasmid pBS314 carrying the 2.1-kb insert in orientation which allowed expression of the bphC gene from the ampicillin promoter of pBR322, the enzyme activity of 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase was ten times higher than that in parental strain Pseudomonas putida SU83. The results presented show the first case of the increased expression of Pseudomonas degradative gene in Escherichia coli.
TI  - Nucleotide sequences of the trpI, trpB, and trpA genes of Pseudomonas syringae: positive control unique to fluorescent pseudomonads.
AB  - A 904-bp probe from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was used to identify the trpB, trpA and trpI genes of Pseudomonas syringae. Transcription initiation at the P. syringae trpBA promoter in vitro was activated by the P. aeruginosa TrpI protein in the presence of indoleglycerol phosphate. Thus, trpB and trpA are regulated positively in three species of fluorescent pseudomonads, P. aeruginosa, P. putida, and P. syringae, but in no other eubacteria so far investigated [Crawford, Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 43 (1989) 567-600]. In addition to conservation of protein-coding sequences, there is a high degree of nucleotide sequence identity in the intergenic control region that includes the divergent trpI and trpBA promoters, especially in the binding sites for TrpI protein. Differences in patterns of codon usage distinguish the trpI genes of P. syringae and P. putida from P. aeruginosa trpI and from the trpB and trpA genes of all three species.
TI  - Treatment and prevention of relapses of CAPD Pseudomonas peritonitis.
AB  - Pseudomonas peritonitis in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) can be difficult to eradicate, because it is frequently resistant to common antibiotics, inducing the loss of the peritoneal cavity in some cases. A total of 14 episodes of Pseudomonas peritonitis in 12 patients (6 male, 6 female) were treated with intraperitoneal (IP) administration of a combination of ceftazidime and tobramycin. All patients were hospitalized. The loading doses were 1000 mg/2 L of ceftazidime and 1.7 mg/kg of tobramycin, and the maintenance IP doses were 250 mg/2 L of ceftazidime and 16 mg/2 L of tobramycin. The therapy duration was 14 days. In 7 episodes (group A) no other antibiotic regimen was provided, while in the remaining 7 episodes (group B) therapy was continued with 500 mg b.i.d. of oral ciprofloxacin for the next 14 days. Pseudomonas species isolated in group A were P. alcaligenis (1), P. putida (1), P. maltophilia (1), R. cepacia (1), and unidentified (3). In group B the following Pseudomonas species were isolated: P. aeruginosa (4), P. diminuta (1), P. stutszeri (1), and unidentified (1). Recurrence of peritonitis was seen in 4 episodes of group A with 2 catheter removals, while all episodes were cured in group B. These results suggest that IP ceftazidime and tobramycin with the additional use of oral ciprofloxacin is successful in the treatment and prevention of relapses of Pseudomonas peritonitis.
TI  - The new approaches to whole genome analysis of bacteria.
AB  - A range of recombinant DNA techniques now enables whole genome analysis of any bacterium to be carried out without recourse to the classical means of bacterial genetic exchange. Using enzymes which cut infrequently, such as SpeI, combined with pulsed field gel electrophoresis, a physical map of ordered fragments can be constructed. By means of cloned fragments of known genes or oligonucleotides synthesized using data from DNA or protein sequence banks, the location of individual genes on this map can be determined. We have used these techniques to study whole genome structure in three species of Pseudomonas: P. aeruginosa, P. putida and P. solanacearum.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis and comparison of the lexA genes from Salmonella typhimurium, Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequences of the lexA genes from Salmonella typhimurium,  Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida were determined; the DNA sequences of the lexA genes from these bacteria were 86%, 76%, 61% and 59% similar, respectively, to the Escherichia coli K12 gene. The predicted amino acid sequences of the S. typhimurium, E. carotovora and P. putida LexA proteins are 202 residues long whereas that of P. aeruginosa is 204. Two putative LexA repressor binding sites were localized upstream of each of the heterologous genes, the distance between them being 5 bp in S. typhimurium and E. carotovora, as in the lexA gene of E. coli, and 3 bp in P. putida and P. aeruginosa. The first lexA site present in the lexA operator of all five bacteria is very well conserved. However, the second lexA box is considerably more variable. The Ala-84--Gly-85 bond, at which the LexA repressor of E. coli is cleaved during the induction of the SOS response, is also found in the LexA proteins of S. typhimurium and E. carotovora. Likewise, the amino acids Ser-119 and Lys-156 are present in all of these three LexA repressors. These residues also exist in the LexA proteins of P. putida and P. aeruginosa, but they are displaced by 4 and 6 residues, respectively. Furthermore, the structure and sequence of the DNA-binding domain of the LexA repressor of E. coli are highly conserved in the S. typhimurium, E. carotovora, P. aeruginosa and P. putida LexA proteins.
TI  - [Cloning the trpBA-genes from Pseudomonas mendocina and Pseudomonas marginata].
AB  - The trpBA genes of Pseudomonas mendocina and P. marginata were cloned in Escherichia coli using pBR322 as a vector. Transcription of the cloned genes took place from their own promoters, in the following order: trpB-->trpA. The latter genes were not linked to the trpF gene and could not be induced by indole glycerol phosphate. Thus, the trpBA cluster of P. mendocina and P. marginata are distinguished from that of P. putida, P. aeruginosa (trpIBA) and P. acidovorans (trpFBA).
TI  - [Plasmid determined degradation of sulfo-aromatic compounds by Pseudomonas sp. BS1304].
AB  - Utilized sulfo-aromatic compounds of Pseudomonas sp. BS1304 were isolated. It was shown that the first step of conversion is desulfonation with following meta-cleavage of the substituted aromatic ring. At least two steps are controlled by the plasmid pBS1004 (120 kb), belonging to the IncP-9 incompatibility group. The degradative plasmid marked by Tn5-lac may be mobilized to P. putida, P. aeruginosa, P. mendocina, where a degradative phenotype is expressed.
TI  - Ferrisiderophore reductases of Pseudomonas. Purification, properties and cellular location of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa ferripyoverdine reductase.
AB  - Purification of the ferripyoverdine reductase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, strain PAO1, lead to the isolation of a soluble protein of M(r) 27,000-28,000, as determined by HPLC sieving filtration and by denaturating gel electrophoresis. In the presence of NADH as the reductant, ferripyoverdine as the iron substrate, ferrozine as an iron(II)-trapping agent and FMN, this protein displayed an iron-reductase activity which resulted in the formation of ferrozine-iron(II) complex, providing that the enzymic assay was run under strict anaerobiosis. FMN was absolutely required for the activity to occur, but the lack of a visible spectrum and the lack of fluorescence for the protein in solution suggested that ferripyoverdine reductase is not a flavin-containing protein and that covalently bound FMN is not a prerequisite for the enzymatic reaction. A search of ferripyoverdine reductase by immunological detection amongst the different cellular compartments of P. aeruginosa lead to the conclusion that the soluble enzyme, which represented more than 95% of the total cellular enzyme, is not located in the periplasm but specifically in the cytoplasm. A strongly immunoreacting material, corresponding to a protein with identical M(r) as the ferripyoverdine reductase of P. aeruginosa PAO1, was detected in all the eighteen fluorescent pseudomonad strains belonging to the P. aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, P. putida and P. chlororaphis species, as well as in P. stutzeri, a non-fluorescent species, suggesting that the enzyme acting as a ferripyoverdine reductase in P. aeruginosa PAO1 is ubiquitous among the Pseudomonas.
TI  - In vitro interactions of Pseudomonas RNA polymerases with tac and RNA I promoters.
AB  - The activities of RNA polymerases from Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were compared with that of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase in an in vitro transcription system. All three enzymes initiated transcription at the tac promoter and the RNA I promoter of E. coli. We measured the rate of open complex formation between the RNA polymerases and the promoters, and the saturation level of open complex formation at equilibrium in single-round transcription. The relative rates of open complex formation were P. putida > E. coli > P. aeruginosa and the relative saturation levels of open complex formation at equilibrium were E. coli > P. putida > P. aeruginosa for the tac and RNA I promoters. The interaction of the RNA polymerases with the promoters was also studied by DNase I footprinting. The patterns of protection of the Pseudomonas RNA polymerases on the tac promoter were similar to that of E. coli RNA polymerase. However, the protection patterns of the Pseudomonas RNA polymerases on the RNA I promoter were slightly different from that of E. coli RNA polymerase.
TI  - Characterization of Pseudomonas putida mutants unable to catabolize benzoate: cloning and characterization of Pseudomonas genes involved in benzoate catabolism and isolation of a chromosomal DNA fragment able to substitute for xylS in activation of the TOL lower-pathway promoter.
AB  - Mutants of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 that are unable to convert benzoate to catechol were isolated and grouped into two classes: those that did not initiate attack on benzoate and those that accumulated 3,5-cyclohexadiene-1,2-diol-1-carboxylic acid (benzoate diol). The latter mutants, represents by strain PP0201, were shown to lack benzoate diol dehydrogenase (benD) activity. Mutants from the former class were presumed either to carry lesions in one or more subunit structural genes of benzoate dioxygenase (benABC) or the regulatory gene (benR) or to contain multiple mutations. Previous work in this laboratory suggested that benR can substitute for the TOL plasmid-encoded xylS regulatory gene, which promotes gene expression from the OP2 region of the lower or meta pathway operon. Accordingly, structural and regulatory gene mutations were distinguished by the ability of benzoate-grown mutant strains to induce expression from OP2 without xylS by using the TOL plasmid xylE gene (encoding catechol 2,3-dioxygenase) as a reporter. A cloned 12-kb BamHI chromosomal DNA fragment from the P. aeruginosa PAO1 chromosome complemented all of the mutations, as shown by restoration of growth on benzoate minimal medium. Subcloning and deletion analyses allowed identification of DNA fragments carrying benD, benABC, and the region possessing xylS substitution activity, benR. Expression of these genes was examined in a strain devoid of benzoate-utilizing ability, Pseudomonas fluorescens PFO15. The disappearance of benzoate and the production of catechol were determined by chromatographic analysis of supernatants from cultures grown with casamino acids. When P. fluorescens PFO15 was transformed with plasmids containing only benABCD, no loss of benzoate was observed. When either benR or xylS was cloned into plasmids compatible with those plasmids containing only the benABCD regions, benzoate was removed from the medium and catechol was produced. Regulation of expression of the chromosomal structural genes by benR and xylS was quantified by benzoate diol dehydrogenase enzyme assays. The results obtained when xylS was substituted for benR strongly suggest an isofunctional regulatory mechanism between the TOL plasmid lower-pathway genes (via the OP2 promoter) and chromosomal benABC. Southern hybridizations demonstrated that DNA encoding the benzoate dioxygenase structural genes showed homology to DNA encoding toluate dioxygenase from the TOL plasmid pWW0, but benR did not show homology to xylS. Evolutionary relationships between the regulatory systems of chromosomal and plasmid-encoded genes for the catabolism of benzoate and related compounds are suggested.
TI  - A variety of catalases and bromoperoxidases in genus Pseudomonas and their characterization.
AB  - A survey of bromoperoxidase in some Pseudomonas strains revealed that they contain different types of bromoperoxidase, catalase-bromoperoxidase and catalase. Although all Pseudomonas strains exhibited catalase activity, the enzyme isolated from P. pyrrolnitrica was named catalase-bromoperoxidase, because it catalyzed not only a catalase reaction, but also the bromination of monochlorodimedone. Except heme-type catalase-bromoperoxidase, this strain contained four isoenzymes of general nonheme bromoperoxidase, and their molecular weights were about 73,000. On the other hand, P. putida and P. aeruginosa had the usual heme-type catalase, but they differed in molecular weight and pI value. Both strains also had a nonheme bromoperoxidase which catalyzed the bromination of monochlorodimedone and aniline, and the molecular weight of each enzyme was 68,000 for P. putida and 86,000 for P. aeruginosa. Considering the results reported by Van Pee et al. [1] and Weisner et al. [2], regarding the haloperoxidases of Pseudomonas, the genus was revealed to contain a wide variety of bromoperoxidase and catalase.
TI  - Expression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa nitrite reductase in Pseudomonas putida and  characterization of the recombinant protein.
AB  - Nitrite reductase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been successfully expressed in  Pseudomonas putida. The purified recombinant enzyme contains haem c but no haem d1. Nonetheless, like the holoenzyme from Ps. aeruginosa, it is a stable dimer (molecular mass 120 kDa), and electron transfer to oxidized azurin is biphasic and follows bimolecular kinetics (k1 = 1.5 x 10(5) and k2 = 2.2 x 10(4) M-1.s-1). Unlike the chemically produced apoenzyme, recombinant nitrite reductase containing only haem c is water-soluble, stable at neutral pH and can be quantitatively reconstituted with haem d1, yielding a holoenzyme with the same properties as that expressed by Ps. aeruginosa (namely optical and c.d. spectra, molecular mass, cytochrome c551 oxidase activity and CO-binding kinetics).
TI  - Stability, frequency and multiplicity of transposon insertions in the pyoverdine  region in the chromosomes of different fluorescent pseudomonads.
AB  - Tn5 mutagenesis of different fluorescent pseudomonads was achieved by conjugational transfer of the suicide vector pSUP 10141. Pyoverdine negative (Pvd-) mutants were detected by the absence of fluorescence on King's B medium and by their inability to grow in the presence of the iron chelator EDDHA [ethylenediamine di(o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid)]. In P. fluorescens ATCC 17400 and three rhizosphere isolates (one P. putida and two P. fluorescens), the percentage of Pvd- mutants ranged between 0 and 0.54%. In a P. chlororaphis rhizosphere isolate, this percentage was higher (4%). In these mutants both of the Tn5 antibiotic resistances (Km and Tc) were stable and the transposon could be detected by hybridization. In Pvd- mutants of P. fluorescens ATCC 17400, the transposon was found to be inserted twice in the chromosome while single insertions were detected in the DNA of other, randomly tested mutants. In P. aeruginosa PAO1, where 13.1% of the mutants were Pvd-, both antibiotic resistances were rapidly lost and accordingly no transposon insertion could be detected by hybridization. However, the Pvd- phenotype was generally stable in these mutants. The plasmid pNK862 containing a mini-Tn10 transposon was introduced by electroporation into P. aeruginosa PAO1 and Kmr mutants were recovered, 89% of which were Pvd- and confirmed to be P. aeruginosa by PCR amplification of the P. aeruginosa lipoprotein gene. The mini-Tn10 insertions were also found to be unstable in PAO1.
TI  - DNA fingerprints of Pseudomonas spp. using rotating field electrophoresis.
AB  - Rotating field electrophoresis (RFE) was applied to evaluate the usefulness of this technique for identification of several Pseudomonas strains with suspected importance in deliberate releases. Genomes of common wild-type or genetically modified strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were digested with rare-cutting restriction endonucleases and subjected to pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Restrictions with SpeI or XbaI produced 11-28 large DNA fragments in the range of 50-500 kb pairs. The specific genomic fingerprints were different for most strains of the same species, but identical for closely related strains. Differences were not affected by the presence of natural or genetically modified plasmids.
TI  - Pseudomonas infections in patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex.
AB  - We identified and reviewed retrospectively all the cases of infection by Pseudomonas and related genera in patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex (ARC) who were hospitalized at our Institution over a 36-month period. We recorded 48 episodes of infection in 34 of 355 patients with AIDS, and in two of 73 patients with ARC: 25 pneumonias (9 community-acquired and 16 of nosocomial origin). 20 urinary tract infections, two soft tissue infections and one sepsis. In 14 of 16 patients with nosocomial pneumonia but in only one of nine patients with community-acquired pneumonia did we find coexisting opportunistic lung diseases. The following micro-organisms were isolated: P. aeruginosa in 41 cases, P. fluorescens in three cases, Xanthomonas maltophilia (P. maltophilia) in two cases, P. putida in one case. Comamonas testosteronis (P. testosteronis) and Comamonas acidovorans (P. acidovorans) in one case. Amikacin and ceftazidime, alone or in combination, appear to be the optimal choice of therapy for severe Pseudomonas infections in HIV-infected patients, although in our study six of 47 isolates were resistant in vitro to amikacin, and nine of 31 isolates were resistant to ceftazidime.
TI  - A study of the incidence of different fluorescent Pseudomonas species and biovars in the microflora of fresh and spoiled meat and fish, raw milk, cheese, soil and water.
AB  - Of 182 various foodstuffs and environmental samples examined, 86% had microflora  containing fluorescent Pseudomonas in differing proportions. A computer-aided technique was used to identify most of the 445 fluorescent strains. Pseudomonas fluorescens biovar V-1 was most frequently isolated (24%); it either predominated or was present in all types of samples. Other strains, belonging to the other subgroups of biovar V (V-2, V-4, V-5, V-6 and V-7), together represented 14.3%. We also identified Ps. fluorescens biovars I-1 and I-2 (13.9%), II-1 and II-3 (3.6%), III-1 and III-2 (8.7%), IV-2 (0.7%); Ps. putida A and B (11%); Ps. lundensis (10.3%); group B3 (2%) and Ps. aeruginosa (0.7%). Unidentified strains accounted for 10.6% of the flora, many resembling Ps. fluorescens biovar V. Although the presence of Ps. fluorescens V-1 was often marked, other taxa predominated or were present in large quantities in some particular samples, such as Ps. fluorescens I-1 in raw milk and cheese, Ps. lundensis in spoiled meat and Ps. fluorescens III-1 in spoiled fish. Pseudomonas putida A and B were evident in environmental rather than in food samples.
TI  - The dehalogenase gene dehI from Pseudomonas putida PP3 is carried on an unusual mobile genetic element designated DEH.
AB  - As a result of the production of two dehalogenases (DehI and DehII), Pseudomonas  putida PP3 utilized halogenated alkanoic acids, such as 2-monochloropropionic acid (2MCPA), as sole sources of carbon and energy. The DehI gene (dehI) was carried on a mobile genetic element (DEH) located on the chromosome of strain PP3. DEH recombined with target plasmid DNAs at high frequencies (e.g. 3.8 x 10(-4) per RP4.5 plasmid transferred). The regulated expression of dehI was detected in P. putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli strains containing derivative plasmids of RP4.5 and pWW0 recombined with DEH. Movement of DEH from the unstable RP4 derivatives pNJ5000 and pMR5 resulted in the insertion of DEH into the chromosome of RecA+ strains of P. putida but not in RecA+ nor RecA- strains of E. coli. Rescue of DEH from the chromosome of P. putida KT2441 onto plasmid RP4 involved recombination at a frequency (2.7 x 10(-4) per RP4 plasmid transferred) comparable to that observed in strain PP3. The DEH element was not classified as a conventional transposon because it did not move as a discrete DNA fragment: dehI-containing inserts in plasmid DNA targets varied in size between 6 and 13 kb. In addition, DEH exhibited a marked preference for insertion into a specific site on the plasmid pWW0, but its transposition, independent of host recombinational systems, remains to be demonstrated. However, the transposonlike characteristics of DEH included the conservation of restriction endonuclease sites, high-frequency recombination with different target replicons (plasmid and chromosomal DNA), and promiscuous insertion into plasmid RP4-based replicons. Therefore, it is proposed that DEH is an unusual mobile genetic element.
TI  - DNA homology between siderophore genes from fluorescent pseudomonads.
AB  - Many species of pseudomonads produce fluorescent siderophores involved in iron uptake. We have investigated the DNA homology between the siderophore synthesis genes of an opportunist animal pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and three plant-associated species Pseudomonas syringae, Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas sp. B10. There is extensive homology between the DNA from the different species, consistent with the suggestion that the different siderophore synthesis genes have evolved from the same ancestral set of genes. The existence of DNA homology allowed us to clone some of the siderophore synthesis genes from P. aeruginosa, and genetic mapping indicates that the cloned DNA lies in a locus previously identified as being involved in siderophore production.
TI  - Selective isolation of fluorescent and nonfluorescent Pseudomonas species from Sohag Governorate (Upper Egypt).
AB  - Three hundred and fourty nine isolates belonging to ten different species of Pseudomonas were isolated and identified from soil and water samples on four selective isolation media: Modified Trypticase soy agar (TSA), ACC-agar containing ampicillin-chloramphenicol-cycloheximide, Nitrate plus organic acid agar and Tryptophan substrate agar. The fluorescent species were P. putida (21.2% of the total Pseudomonas species), P. fluorescens (15.8%), P. aeruginosa (9.7%) and P. aureobaciens (2.6%), while the nonfluorescent species were P. stutzeri (12.4%), P. alcaligenes (11.2%), P. pseudoalcaligenes (9.5%), P. mendocina (8.3%), P. lemoignei (5.7%) and P. ruhlandii (3.4%). Modified TSA and ACC media were efficient for the isolation of both fluorescent and nonfluorescent species, whereas Nitrate and Tryptophan media were more selective for the isolation of nonfluorescent species. The optimum temperature for the isolation of different species ranged between 20 degrees and 37 degrees C.
TI  - Characterization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons degradative soil Pseudomonas.
AB  - Nine Pseudomonas strains, able to degrade polycycle aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), were isolated from enriched cultures with naphthalene, as carbon source, and soil samples from a land farming process applied on oil sludge, as inocula. Degradative tests showed that all the strains were capable to catabolize naphthalene (Nah) and phenanthrene (Phn). U2 strain transferred the selected function (Nah) to P. aeruginosa T1 (Hgr Oct+), however some of the transconjugants lost the Oct character, suggesting that it is of plasmidic nature. T1 derivatives as well the wild strains U28 and U31 transferred Nah function to P. putida AC165. All of the examined transconjugants also catabolized phenanthrene, suggesting that Nah and Phn functions in U2, U28, and U31 strains are linked and probably encoded by transferable plasmids.
TI  - One-step cloning system for isolation of bacterial lexA-like genes.
AB  - A system to isolate lexA-like genes of bacteria directly was developed. It is based upon the fact that the presence of a lexA(Def) mutation is lethal to SulA+ cells of Escherichia coli. This system is composed of a SulA- LexA(Def) HsdR- strain and a lexA-conditional killer vector (plasmid pUA165) carrying the wild-type sulA gene of E. coli and a polylinker in which foreign DNA may be inserted. By using this method, the lexA-like genes of Salmonella typhimurium, Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and P. putida were cloned. We also found that the LexA repressor of S. typhimurium presented the highest affinity for the SOS boxes of E. coli in vivo, whereas the LexA protein of P. aeruginosa had the lowest. Likewise, all of these LexA repressors were cleaved by the activated RecA protein of E. coli after DNA damage. Furthermore, under high-stringency conditions, the lexA gene of E. coli hybridized with the lexA genes of S. typhimurium and E. carotovora but not with those of P. aeruginosa and P. putida.
TI  - Conservation of xcp genes, involved in the two-step protein secretion process, in different Pseudomonas species and other gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The two-step protein secretion pathway in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is dependent on  the xcp genes. We investigated whether a similar secretion mechanism is present in non-pathogenic Pseudomonas spp. and in other gram-negative bacteria. The plant growth stimulating Pseudomonas strains P. putida WCS358, P. fluorescens WCS374 and Pseudomonas B10 appeared to secrete proteins into the extracellular medium. Southern hybridization experiments showed the presence of xcp genes in these strains and also in other gram-negative bacteria, including Xanthomonas campestris. Complementation experiments showed that the xcp gene cluster of P. aeruginosa restored protein secretion in an X. campestris secretion mutant. The secretion gene cluster of X. campestris however, restored secretion capacity in P. aeruginosa mutants only to a low degree. Two heterologous proteins were not secreted by P. fluorescens and P. aeruginosa. The results suggest the presence of a similar two-step protein secretion mechanism in different gram-negative bacteria, which however, is not always functional for heterologous proteins.
TI  - [Cloning of genes degrading 3-chlorobenzoate from Pseudomonas putida strain 87].
AB  - The ability of Pseudomonas putida strain 87 to catabolize 3-chlorobenzoate was shown to be mediated by genes of pBS109 plasmid. The plasmid may be transferred by conjugation into P. aeruginosa PAO2175. It seems possible that the pBS109 plasmid codes for pyrocatechase II specific for halogenated catechol, but not catechol. The genes specifying utilization of 3-chlorobenzoate from pBS109 plasmid were cloned in the 5.5 kb BgIII fragment by using broad-host cloning system. The resulting pBS110 plasmid was transferred into P. putida, which results in utilization of 3-chlorobenzoate by transconjugants.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefpiramide to fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In the subjects of 835 strains of 37 clinically isolated microbial strains, which were separated and identified among materials collected from patients with various infections and which were sent from medical therapeutic institutions throughout Japan in 1990, for the purpose of examining the antimicrobial activity of cefpiramide (CPM), its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), together with those of other cephem antibiotics, was determined, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. Microbial strains in which no CPM-resistant strains emerged were Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Anaerobic Gram-positive cocci. 2. In comparison with reports by many researchers at the former half of the 1980s, microbial stains suggesting an increase in resistance to CPM were Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Haemophilus influenzae, but also in other microbial strains the resistance to CPM was observed in high ratios. 3. Among strains used in the test, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, cephamycin and oxime type cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacilli of Enterobacteriaceae, and new quinolone-resistant microbes were observed in high ratios; therefore, it was considered that CPM could not exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these strains because of many resistant strains being complicated among these "CPM-resistant strains". 4. It was discussed that "the resistance mechanism observed throughout beta-lactam drugs as a while and the study themes in the dimension including social circumstances where resistant strains emerged", as pointed out by the authors in 1989, increased the significance of these days in the evaluation of timecourse changes in microbes resistant to specific drugs including CPM. 5. There are many unfavorable conditions in the antimicrobial activities of CPM to clinically isolated strains in recent years. However, it was jointly confirmed that CPM maintained effective antimicrobial activities to the majority of clinically isolated strains. Furthermore, when it was additionally considered that CPM was one of not many cephem drugs having persistent blood levels, a conclusion was drawn that CPM was one of clincally useful cephem drugs even at present.
TI  - Up-promoter mutations in the trpBA operon of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the operon encoding tryptophan synthase (trpBA) is positively regulated by the TrpI protein and an intermediate in tryptophan biosynthesis, indoleglycerol phosphate (InGP). A gene fusion in which the trpBA promoter directs expression of the Pseudomonas putida xylE gene was constructed. By using a P. putida F1 todE mutant carrying this fusion on a plasmid, three cis-acting mutations that increased xylE expression enough to allow the todE strain to grow on toluene were isolated. The level of xylE transcript from the trpBA promoter was increased in all three mutants. All three mutations are base substitutions located in the -10 region of the trpBA promoter; two of these mutations make the promoter sequence more like the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase sigma 70 promoter consensus sequence. The activities of the wild-type and mutant trpBA promoters, as monitored by xylE expression, were assayed in P. putida PpG1 and in E. coli. The up-regulatory phenotypes of the mutants were maintained in the heterologous backgrounds, as was trpI and InGP dependence. These results indicate that the P. aeruginosa trpBA promoter has the key characteristics of a typical E. coli positively regulated promoter. The results also show that the P. aeruginosa and P. putida trpI activator gene products are functionally interchangeable.
TI  - Assay for detection and enumeration of genetically engineered microorganisms which is based on the activity of a deregulated 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate monooxygenase.
AB  - An assay system was developed for the enumeration of genetically engineered microorganisms expressing a deregulated 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate (TFD) monooxygenase, which converts phenoxyacetate (PAA) to phenol. In PAA-amended cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1C(pRO103) and Pseudomonas putida PPO301(pRO103), strains which express a deregulated TFD monooxygenase, phenol production was proportional to cell number. Phenol was reacted, under specific conditions, with a 4-aminoantipyrine dye to form an intensely colored dye-phenol complex (AAPPC), which when measured spectrophotometrically could detect as few as 10(3) cells per ml. This assay was corroborated by monitoring the disappearance of PAA and the accumulation of phenol by high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography. The AAPPC assay was modified for use with plate cultures and clearly distinguished colonies of PPO301(pRO103) and PAO1C(pRO103) from a strain expressing a regulated TFD monooxygenase. Colonies of P. putida PPO301(pRO101) remained cream colored, while colonies of PPO301(pRO103) and PAO1C(pRO103) turned a distinct red.
TI  - Anaerobic growth and cyanide synthesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa depend on anr, a regulatory gene homologous with fnr of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Anaerobic growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on nitrate or arginine requires the anr gene, which codes for a positive control element (ANR) capable of functionally complementing an fnr mutation in Escherichia coli. The anr gene was sequenced; it showed 51% identity with the fnr gene at the amino acid sequence level. Four cysteine residues known to be essential in the FNR protein are conserved in ANR. The anr gene product (deduced Mr 27,129) was visualized by the maxicell method and migrated like a 32 kDa protein in gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. An anr mutant of P. aeruginosa constructed by gene replacement was defective in nitrate respiration, arginine deiminase activity, and hydrogen cyanide biosynthesis, underscoring the diverse metabolic functions of ANR during oxygen limitation. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas syringae, and Pseudomonas mendocina all had a functional analogue of ANR, indicating that similar anaerobic control mechanisms exist in these bacteria.
TI  - Broad host-range vector for efficient expression of foreign genes in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A broad host-range expression plasmid was constructed comprising the incQ replicon, the recA promoter from Escherichia coli and the g10-L ribosome binding site (RBS) derived from bacteriophage T7. The structural genes for porcine somatotropin (pst) and E. coli beta-galactosidase (lacZ) were used to monitor gene expression in a diverse collection of Gram-negative bacterial hosts: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas syringae, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas testosteroni, Serratia marcescens and Erwinia herbicola. The E. coli recA promoter was functional in this wide range of hosts and was inducible by the addition of nalidixic acid. Moreover, the level of lacZ expression was often at least as high as that observed in E. coli. Previous studies had shown that the g10-L RBS was superior to a simple "consensus" RBS sequence for expression of foreign genes in E. coli. Here we demonstrate a 38 to 70 fold increase in expression in two Pseudomonas hosts using the g10-L RBS, indicating that the translational enhancer present in the g10-L RBS is also functional in other bacteria. The juxtaposition of these transcriptional and translational elements in a broad host-range vector provides a simple way to evaluate alternate hosts for recombinant protein production.
TI  - Freeze-substitution of gram-negative eubacteria: general cell morphology and envelope profiles.
AB  - Freeze-substitution was performed on strains of Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Campylobacter fetus, Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Aeromonas salmonicida, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae, Caulobacter crescentus, and Leptothrix discophora with a substitution medium composed of 2% osmium tetroxide and 2% uranyl acetate in anhydrous acetone. A thick periplasmic gel ranging from 10.6 to 14.3 nm in width was displayed in E. coli K-12, K30, and His 1 (a K-12 derivative containing the K30 capsule genes), P. multocida, C. fetus, P. putida, A. salmonicida, H. pleuropneumoniae, and P. mirabilis. The other bacteria possessed translucent periplasms in which a thinner peptidoglycan layer was seen. Capsular polysaccharide, evident as electron-dense fibers radiating outward perpendicular to the cell surface, was observed on E. coli K30 and His 1 and P. mirabilis cells. A more random arrangement of fibers forming a netlike structure was apparent surrounding cells of H. pleuropneumoniae. For the first time a capsule, distinct from the sheath, was observed on L. discophora. In all instances, capsular polysaccharide was visualized in the absence of stabilizing agents such as homologous antisera or ruthenium red. Other distinct envelope structures were observed external to the outer membrane including the sheath of L. discophora and the S layers of A. salmonicida A450 and C. crescentus CB15A. We believe that the freeze-substitution technique presents a more accurate image of the structural organization of these cells and that it has revealed complex ultrastructural relationships between cell envelope constituents previously difficult to visualize by more conventional means of preparation.
TI  - [Regulation of the synthesis of 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptuloso-7-phosphate-synthase in Pseudomonas bacteria].
AB  - Regulation of synthesis of 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulose-7-phosphate-synthase (DAHP-synthase) was analysed in 12 strains of Pseudomonas belonging to 10 species. Repression of synthesis of DAHP-synthase was registered in half of strains under study, this being controlled by tyrosin and phenilalanine in P. aeruginosa PAO1 and PAT 2152, P. fluorescens BKMB 896, P. acidovorans BKMB 1251 and P. testosteroni BKMB 1241 and by only phenilalanine in P. maltophilia BKMB 30. In the rest of cases (in P. putida AC29, P. stutzeri BKMB 148, P. mendocina BKMB 1299, P. marginata BKMB 1298, P. vesicularis BKMB 974 and P. fluorescens BKMB 35) the enzyme was synthesized constitutively.
TI  - Molecular characterization and expression analysis of the anthranilate synthase gene of Pseudomonas syringae subsp. savastanoi.
AB  - The trpE gene, which encodes the large component of the enzyme anthranilate synthase, was isolated from a Pseudomonas syringae subsp. savastanoi (P. savastanoi) cosmid library. Cosmids that complemented an Escherichia coli trpE mutation contained a gene whose product is 86% homologous at the deduced amino acid level to TrpE of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. Amino acid sequence comparison with other TrpE sequences revealed the existence of conserved regions between the procaryotic and eucaryotic polypeptide sequences analyzed, regions that might be of functional importance. We also report on studies on the expression pattern of this gene. We analyzed the promoter activity of a trpE::lacZ transcriptional fusion, the relative amount of trpE steady-state mRNA, and the activity of anthranilate synthase from cells grown in minimal medium with or without exogenously added tryptophan and in complete medium. We concluded that under the conditions tested, expression of the trpE gene of P. savastanoi is independent of the concentration of tryptophan in the culture medium. Implications of such an expression pattern on the virulence of this bacterium are discussed.
TI  - [Quantitation of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus in mixed bacterial cultures by an enzyme immunoassay].
AB  - An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using polyclonal antibodies from rabbits has been developed for quantification of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Bacteria were added to the wells of a microtiter plate coated with anti-Acinetobacter immunoglobulin. For detecting bound cells the peroxidase-labelled immunoglobulin fraction was used. Over a distinct range there is a linear correlation between bound bacteria and measured absorbance allowing a quantification of bacteria in an order from 10(7) to 10(8) per milliliter. The specificity of the assay was evaluated by the heterologous bacteria Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli and Citrobacter freundii. Only a minimal cross-reactivity was observed. Within a certain range of error it is possible to quantitate Acinetobacter calcoaceticus in mixtures with one or several other bacterial species. Mixed with bacteria of one other species the differences to the value for Acinetobacter calcoaceticus alone do not exceed +/- 10% with a tendency to lower values. Mixed with several other species only negative differences up to -15% were obtained. Treatment of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus with 0.5% formaldehyde results in a loss of reactivity up to 15%. In conclusion, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is a useful method for quantitating bacteria not only with respect to the high sensitivity, specificity and good reproducibility but also for the minimal technical equipment and the short assay time.
TI  - [Characteristics of the biochemical properties of pseudomonads isolated from environmental objects].
AB  - Biochemical characteristics of 117 Pseudomonas cultures isolated from water bodies and washings off the hospital environment objects were under study, including the strains from patients' wound surfaces. Analysis of the strains' characteristics permitted referring 83.8 +/- 3.7% of them to typical ones as regards their biochemistry. 45.9 +/- 7.5% of these were P. putida, 21.4 +/- 4.8% were P. aeruginosa, 10.2 +/- 1.01% P. fluorescens strains, and the shares of P. cepacia and P. stutzeri strains were 11.2% each. 16.2% of the strains were found atypical because of lysine decarboxylase and growth at 42 degrees C; they were conditionally referred to P. putida. One third of these cultures were isolated in hospital. The detected differences may be helpful in identification of Pseudomonas.
TI  - The role of microorganisms in psoriasis.
AB  - The microflora of 297 psoriasis patients was extensively examined. Throat, urine, and skin surfaces from scalp, ears, chest, face, axillary, submammary, umbilical, upper back, inguinal crease, gluteal-fold, perirectal, vaginal, pubis, penis, scrotal, leg, hands, feet, finger, and toenail areas were cultured for aerobic bacteria, yeast, and dermatophytes. Antibody levels to streptococcal enzymes were performed (streptolysin-O, DNAse-B, hyaluronidase, STREPTOZYME). Giemsa smears and KOH preparations were also used to determine yeast and dermatophyte presence. Associated organisms thought to provoke a psoriatic attack were as follows: streptococcal groups A, B, C, D, F, G, S viridans, S pneumoniae; Klebsiella pneumoniae, oxytoca; Escherichia coli; Enterobacter cloacae, E aerogenes, E agglomerans; Proteus mirabilis, P vulgaris; Citrobacter freundii, C diversus; Morganella morganii; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P maltiphilia, P putida; Serratia marcescens; Acinetobacter calbio aceticus, A luoffi; Flavobacterium specie; CDC groups Ve-1, Ve-2, E-o2; Bacillus subtilis, cereus; Staphylococcus aureus; Candida albicans, C parapsilosis; Torulopsis, glabrata; Rhodotorula and dermatophytes. One or more antistreptococal enzyme tests was positive in 50% of patients. Titers to hepatitis E were elevated in one patient and to HIV in two patients.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and expression of the isoamylase gene from an isoamylase-hyperproducing mutant, Pseudomonas amyloderamosa JD210.
AB  - The isoamylase gene (ISO) of Pseudomonas amyloderamosa JD210, an isoamylase-hyperproducing mutant, was cloned in an isoamylase-deficient and transformable mutant strain K31. By deletion analysis, the ISO gene was found to be located within a 3.3 kilobases BamHI fragment. Its nucleotide sequence contained an open reading frame of 2328 nucleotides (776 amino acids) encoding a secreted isoamylase precursor. The ISO gene fragment was inserted into plasmids pKT230 and pBR 322 in opposite orientations. The expression of the ISO gene in the constructed plasmids was compared in P. amyloderamosa K31, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1-161, Pseudomonas putida mt-2 and Escherichia coli HB101. In all transformed cells, the majority of the isoamylase produced was secreted and higher isoamylase activities were obtained in transformats with the transcriptional direction of the ISO gene similar to the nearby drug-determinant gene of the vector.
TI  - Formation of polyesters consisting of medium-chain-length 3-hydroxyalkanoic acids from gluconate by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other fluorescent pseudomonads.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO and 15 other strains of this species synthesized a polyester with 3-hydroxydecanoate as the main constituent (55 to 76 mol%) if the cells were cultivated in the presence of gluconate and if the nitrogen source was exhausted; 3-hydroxyhexanoate, 3-hydroxyoctanoate, and 3-hydroxydodecanoate were minor constituents of the polymer. The polymer was deposited in granules within the cell and amounted to 70% of the cell dry matter in some strains. Among 55 different strains of 41 Pseudomonas species tested, P. aureofaciens (21.6% of cellular dry matter), P. citronellolis (78.0%), P. chlororaphis (8.5%), P. marginalis (11.4%), P. mendocina (50.7%), P. putida (33.5%), and Pseudomonas sp. strain DSM 1650 (54.6%) accumulated this type of polymer at significant levels (greater than 5%) during cultivation on gluconate. In two strains of P. facilis and P. fluorescens, as well as in one strain of P. syringae, this polymer was detected as a minor constituent (much less than 5%). All other strains accumulated either poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) or a polymer consisting mainly of 3-hydroxyoctanoate with octanoate but no polyester with gluconate as the carbon source. Only a few species (e.g., P. stutzeri) were unable to accumulate poly(hydroxyalkanoic acids) (PHA) at all. These results indicated that the formation of PHA depends on a pathway which is distinct from all other known PHA-biosynthetic pathways. The polyesters accumulated by gluconate- or octanoate-grown cells of recombinant strains of P. aeruginosa and P. putida, which harbored the Alcaligenes eutrophus poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)biosynthetic genes, contained 3-hydroxybutyrate as an additional constituent.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of newer quinolones against Pseudomonas species and Xanthomonas maltophilia isolated from patients with cancer.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibilities of three Pseudomonas species (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas fluorescens) and Xanthomonas maltophilia to quinolone antimicrobial agents were determined. Several newer agents, particularly PD117558, PD117596, PD127391, sparfloxacin (AT-4140), A-56620, and temafloxacin, were active against Pseudomonas species. X. maltophilia isolates were generally less susceptible than were Pseudomonas isolates but were inhibited by some of the newer quinolones.
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (III). Distribution of  bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in the Tohoku District of Japan].
AB  - The bacteriology of the isolates from the throat swab and the sputum respectively of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in Tohoku district of Japan during the period from January to April in 1989 was documented. Of the 2,539 patients, 1,694 had an acute upper respiratory infection, 609 had acute bronchitis, 46 had acute pneumonia, 84 had acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory infections and 106 had respiratory infections without diagnosis registered. 1887 (74.3%) strains of potential pathogens were recovered from 1507 (59.4%) of the 2539 cases. The rate of recovery of potential pathogens was very high in patients of the younger age. These patients had elevated body-temperature. There were statistically significant differences in recovery rate when classified by diagnosis, prefecture and the period of investigation. Of the 1,887 strains, 996 (52.8%) were gram-positive and 891 (47.2%) were gram-negative bacteria. The rate of recovery of gram-negative bacteria was high in patients who were less than 10 years old and more than 51 years old, in patients with pneumonia and chronic respiratory infections, and in patients with fever. Of the 1,887 strains, those which exceeded 100 were Staphylococcus aureus (481 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (340 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (329 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (117 strains) and Acinetobacter spp. (100 strains). Species other than those mentioned above had less than 100 strains. In this group there were 39 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 32 strains of Escherichia coli, 97 strains of Klebsiella spp., 40 strains of Enterobacter spp., 25 strains of Serratia spp., 12 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 43 strains of Pseudomonas putida. There was a remarkable difference in recovery rate of each species when classified by diagnosis, age class, prefecture and the period of investigation, respectively. The above results indicated that gram-positive bacteria are more frequent than gram-negative bacteria, that enterobacteriaceae and glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria are only rarely found in primary care clinics, and that the bacteriology in primary care clinic is different from that of medical school-affiliated hospitals.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the ponB gene, encoding penicillin-binding protein 1B of Escherichia coli, in heterologous systems.
AB  - A fragment from the ponB region of the Escherichia coli chromosome comprising the promoterless sequence encoding penicillin-binding protein 1B (PBP 1B) has been cloned in a broad-host-range expression vector under the control of the kanamycin resistance gene promoter present in the vector. The hybrid plasmid (pJP3) was used to transform appropriate strains of Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In all instances, the coding sequence was expressed in the heterologous hosts, yielding a product with electrophoretic mobility, protease accessibility, membrane location, and beta-lactam-binding properties identical to those of native PBP 1B in E. coli. These results indicated that PBP 1B of E. coli is compatible with the cytoplasmic membrane environment of unrelated bacterial species and support the idea that interspecific transfer of mutated alleles of genes coding for PBPs could potentially be an efficient spreading mechanism for intrinsic resistance to beta-lactams.
TI  - Chromosome mapping in Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae strain PS224.
AB  - A conjugation system for mapping the chromosome of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae PS224 has been developed using the IncP-10 plasmid R91-5; pMO22, a Tn501-loaded derivative of R91-5; and pMO75, R91-5 loaded with Tn5. Nine different donor origins were identified with R91-5 and pMO22. By insertion of Tn5 into various sites of the chromosome, an additional six donor origins were available using pMO75 as the donor plasmid. In all, 36 markers were located on three linkage groups. Many donor strains were unstable and the limited availability of stable donor strains has limited the extent to which markers have been located. This instability of donor strains is in marked contrast to the highly stable donor strains found in P. putida using the same plasmids. As in P. aeruginosa and P. putida, auxotrophic markers in P. syringae do not show the clustering of related markers found in enterobacteria.
TI  - [Incompatibility groups of epsilon-caprolactam biodegradation plasmids from bacteria of Pseudomonas genus].
AB  - Incompatibility of epsilon-caprolactam biodegradation plasmids pBS262, pBS263, pBS264, pBS265, pBS266, pBS267, pBS268, pBS270, pBS276, pBS269 with the tester plasmids of P-1, P-2, P-7, P-9 incompatibility groups in the system of strains of P. putida line BSA, as well as the character of plasmid interaction with the number of P. aeruginosa and P. putida bacteriophages have been studied. The majority of the studied plasmids belongs to IncP-7, IncP-9 or simultaneously to IncP-7 and IncP-9 incompatibility groups. The ability to restrict the growth of some bacteriophages of P. aeruginosa and P. putida has been demonstrated for some plasmids.
TI  - Cloning vectors, derived from a naturally occurring plasmid of Pseudomonas savastanoi, specifically tailored for genetic manipulations in Pseudomonas.
AB  - A minimal replicon of 1.8 kb isolated from a 10-kb plasmid of Pseudomonas savastanoi, pPS10, has been used to obtain a collection of small vectors specific for Pseudomonas (P. savastanoi, P. aeruginosa and P.putida). In addition, shuttle vectors that can be established both in Pseudomonas and Escherichia coli have been constructed by adding a pMB9 replicon. The vectors permit cloning of DNA fragments generated by a variety of restriction enzymes using different antibiotic resistance markers for selection and offer the possibility to screen recombinants by insertional inactivation. This cloning system can be used to establish recombinant plasmids in Pseudomonas either at low or high copy number. pPS10 derivatives are compatible with other Pseudomonas vectors derived from broad-host-range replicons of the incompatibility groups P1, P4/Q and W. Introduction and expression of the iaaMH operon in a P. savastanoi mutant deficient in the production of indoleacetic acid has been achieved using one of these vectors.
TI  - Monoclonal Antibodies to Ferric Pseudobactin, the Siderophore of Plant Growth-Promoting Pseudomonas putida B10.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies to ferric pseudobactin, the siderophore (microbial iron transport agent) of plant growth-promoting Pseudomonas putida B10, have been developed. Three immunoglobulin G subclass 1-type monoclonal antibodies have been characterized. Each antibody appears to be unique on the basis of their reactions with ferric pseudobactin and with culture supernatants from other pseudomonads. None of the three cross-reacts with ferric pseudobactin-type siderophores produced by seven other pseudomonads. However, P. aeruginosa ATCC 15692 and P. fluorescens ATCC 17400 produced relatively high-molecular-mass compounds (mass greater than approximately 30,000 daltons) that did react with the antibodies. The compound from P. aeruginosa was not iron regulated, while the compound from P. fluorescens was produced only under iron-limiting conditions. A competitive assay using these antibodies has a detection limit of 5 x 10 mol of ferric pseudobactin. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of monoclonal antibodies reactive with siderophores.
TI  - Evolutionary differences in chromosomal locations of four early genes of the tryptophan pathway in fluorescent pseudomonads: DNA sequences and characterization of Pseudomonas putida trpE and trpGDC.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida possesses seven structural genes for enzymes of the tryptophan pathway. All but one, trpG, which encodes the small (beta) subunit of anthranilate synthase, have been mapped on the circular chromosome. This report describes the cloning and sequencing of P. putida trpE, trpG, trpD, and trpC. In P. putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, DNA sequence analysis as well as growth and enzyme assays of insertionally inactivated strains indicated that trpG is the first gene in a three-gene operon that also contains trpD and trpC. In P. putida, trpE is 2.2 kilobases upstream from the trpGDC cluster, whereas in P. aeruginosa, they are separated by at least 25 kilobases (T. Shinomiya, S. Shiga, and M. Kageyama, Mol. Gen. Genet., 189:382-389, 1983). The DNA sequence in P. putida shows an open reading frame on the opposite strand between trpE and trpGDC; this putative gene was not characterized. Evidence is also presented for sequence similarities in the 5' untranslated regions of trpE and trpGDC in both pseudomonads; the function of these regions is unknown, but it is possible that they play some role in regulation of these genes, since all the genes respond to repression by tryptophan. The sequences of the anthranilate synthase genes in the fluorescent pseudomonads resemble those of p-aminobenzoate synthase genes of the enteric bacteria more closely than the anthranilate synthase genes of those organisms; however, no requirement for p-aminobenzoate was found in the Pseudomonas mutants created in this study.
TI  - Identification and characterization of genes for a second anthranilate synthase in Pseudomonas aeruginosa: interchangeability of the two anthranilate synthases and evolutionary implications.
AB  - Two anthranilate synthase gene pairs have been identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. They were cloned, sequenced, inactivated in vitro by insertion of an antibiotic resistance gene, and returned to P. aeruginosa, replacing the wild-type gene. One anthranilate synthase enzyme participates in tryptophan synthesis; its genes are designated trpE and trpG. The other anthranilate synthase enzyme, encoded by phnA and phnB, participates in the synthesis of pyocyanin, the characteristic phenazine pigment of the organism. trpE and trpG are independently transcribed; homologous genes have been cloned from Pseudomonas putida. The phenazine pathway genes phnA and phnB are cotranscribed. The cloned phnA phnB gene pair complements trpE and trpE(G) mutants of Escherichia coli. Homologous genes were not found in P. putida PPG1, a non-phenazine producer. Surprisingly, PhnA and PhnB are more closely related to E. coli TrpE and TrpG than to Pseudomonas TrpE and TrpG, whereas Pseudomonas TrpE and TrpG are more closely related to E. coli PabB and PabA than to E. coli TrpE and TrpG. We replaced the wild-type trpE on the P. aeruginosa chromosome with a mutant form having a considerable portion of its coding sequence deleted and replaced by a tetracycline resistance gene cassette. This resulted in tryptophan auxotrophy; however, spontaneous tryptophan-independent revertants appeared at a frequency of 10(-5) to 10(6). The anthranilate synthase of these revertants is not feedback inhibited by tryptophan, suggesting that it arises from PhnAB. phnA mutants retain a low level of pyocyanin production. Introduction of an inactivated trpE gene into a phnA mutant abolished residual pyocyanin production, suggesting that the trpE trpG gene products are capable of providing some anthranilate for pyocyanin synthesis.
TI  - Microbial degradation of quinoline and methylquinolines.
AB  - Several bacterial cultures were isolated that are able to degrade quinoline and to transform or to degrade methylquinolines. The degradation of quinoline by strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa QP and P. putida QP produced hydroxyquinolines, a transient pink compound, and other undetermined products. The quinoline-degrading strains of P. aeruginosa QP and P. putida QP hydroxylated a limited number of methylquinolines but could not degrade them, nor could they transform 2-methylquinoline, isoquinoline, or pyridine. Another pseudomonad, Pseudomonas sp. strain MQP, was isolated that could degrade 2-methylquinoline. P. aeruginosa QP was able to degrade or to transform quinoline and a few methylquinolines in a complex heterocyclic nitrogen-containing fraction of a shale oil. All of the quinoline- and methylquinoline-degrading strains have multiple plasmids including a common 250-kilobase plasmid. The 225-, 250-, and 320-kilobase plasmids of the P. aeruginosa QP strain all contained genes involved in quinoline metabolism.
TI  - Pseudomonas chromosomal replication origins: a bacterial class distinct from Escherichia coli-type origins.
AB  - The bacterial origins of DNA replication have been isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. These origins comprise a second class of bacterial origins distinct from enteric-type origins: both origins function in both Pseudomonas species, and neither functions in Escherichia coli; enteric origins do not function in either pseudomonad. Both cloned sequences hybridize to chromosomal fragments that show properties expected of replication origins. These origin plasmids are highly unstable, are present at low copy number, and show mutual incompatibility properties. DNA sequence analysis shows that both origins contain several 9-base-pair (bp) E. coli DnaA protein binding sites; four of these are conserved in position and orientation, two of which resemble the R1 and R4 sites of the E. coli origin. Conserved 13-bp direct repeats adjacent to the analogous R1 site are also found. No GATC sites are in the P. aeruginosa origin and only four are in the P. putida origin; no other 4-bp sequence is present in high abundance. Both origins are found between sequences similar to the E. coli and Bacillus subtilis dnaA, dnaN, rpmH, and rnpA genes, a gene organization identical to that for B. subtilis and unlike that of E. coli. A second autonomously replicating sequence was obtained from P. aeruginosa that has some properties of bacterial origins.
TI  - [Pseudomonas APS nutrient medium for the isolation and identification of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida].
AB  - Pseudomonas APS selective medium has been developed on the basis of a newly detected selective antibacterial action of oxaphenamide (p-oxyphenylsalicylamide), a cholagogue. This medium permits a single-stage combined isolation and identification of P. aeruginosa after 16-24 hrs incubation of inoculated material at 42 degrees C. If the material is incubated at 35-37 degrees C, isolation of P. putida and P. aeruginosa is possible, that are differentiated by a nitroreductase microtest within 3 hrs. The sensitivity and selective ability of the developed medium are superior to other media manufactured in this country and commercial media with cetrimide and irgasan, produced abroad.
TI  - Activation of Chi recombinational hotspots by RecBCD-like enzymes from enteric bacteria.
AB  - Chi sites, 5'G-C-T-G-G-T-G-G-3', enhance homologous recombination in Escherichia  coli and are activated by the RecBCD enzyme. To test the ability of Chi to be activated by analogous enzymes from other bacteria, we cloned recBCD-like genes from diverse bacteria into an E. coli recBCD deletion mutant. Clones from seven species of enteric bacteria conferred to this deletion mutant recombination proficiency, Chi hotspot activity in lambda Red- Gam- vegetative crosses, and RecBCD enzyme activities, including Chi-dependent DNA strand cleavage. Three clones from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Ps. putida conferred recombination proficiency and ATP-dependent nuclease activity, but neither Chi hotspot activity nor Chi-dependent DNA cleavage. These results imply that Chi has been conserved as a recombination-promoting signal for RecBCD-like enzymes in enteric bacteria but not in more distantly related bacteria such as Pseudomonas spp. We discuss the possibility that other, presently unknown, nucleotide sequences serve the same function as Chi in Pseudomonas spp.
TI  - Growth of genetically engineered Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida in soil and rhizosphere.
AB  - The effect of the addition of a recombinant plasmid containing the pglA gene encoding an alpha-1,4-endopolygalacturonase from Pseudomonas solanacearum on the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida in soil and rhizosphere was determined. Despite a high level of polygalacturonase production by genetically engineered P. putida and P. aeruginosa, the results suggest that polygalacturonase production had little effect on the growth of these strains in soil or rhizosphere.
TI  - Selective medium for Pseudomonas aeruginosa that uses 1,10-phenanthroline as the  selective agent.
AB  - The MIC of 1,10-phenanthroline for 35 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains was 128 micrograms/ml, whereas 32 micrograms or less per ml inhibited all other microorganisms tested. On the basis of these results, a selective agar for P. aeruginosa which contained 15 g of Trypticase soy broth (BBL Microbiology Systems), 15 g of agar, and 0.1 g of phenanthroline per liter was formulated. Forty-four P. aeruginosa strains yielded a mean efficiency of plating on this medium of 79% of the counts obtained on Trypticase soy agar, which was significantly higher than that obtained with pseudomonas isolation agar or Pseudosel agar. Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas stutzeri, representatives of 13 other genera (including gram-negative rods, gram-positive rods, and cocci), and a yeast were not recovered within 48 h at 35 degrees C when approximately 10(7) CFU were plated on this medium. Only small colonies from one strain each of P. fluorescens and P. putida could be seen at 3 and 7 days, respectively, and they had an efficiency of plating of only less than 0.001%. When 10(7) CFU of either of these strains was plated with 10(2) CFU of P. aeruginosa, it did not interfere with the quantitative recovery of P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Genetic organization and sequence of the Pseudomonas cepacia genes for the alpha  and beta subunits of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase.
AB  - The locations of the genes for the alpha and beta subunits of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.3) on a 9.5-kilobase-pair PstI fragment cloned from the Pseudomonas cepacia DBO1 chromosome were determined. This was accomplished through the construction of several subclones into the broad-host-range cloning vectors pRO2317, pRO2320, and pRO2321. The ability of each subclone to complement mutations in protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (pcaA) was tested in mutant strains derived from P. cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas putida. These complementation studies also showed that the two subunits were expressed from the same promoter. The nucleotide sequence of the region encoding for protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence matched that determined by N-terminal analysis of regions of the isolated enzyme. Although over 400 nucleotides were sequenced before the start of the genes, no homology to known promoters was found. However, a terminator stem-loop structure was found immediately after the genes. The deduced amino acid sequence showed extensive homology with the previously determined amino acid sequence of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase from another Pseudomonas species.
TI  - Cloning, expression, and regulation of the Pseudomonas cepacia protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase genes.
AB  - The genes for the alpha and beta subunits of the enzyme protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.3) were cloned from the Pseudomonas cepacia DBO1 chromosome on a 9.5-kilobase-pair PstI fragment into the broad-host-range cloning vector pRO2317. The resultant clone was able to complement protocatechuate 3,4-dioxugenase mutations in P. cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas putida. Expression studies showed that the genes were constitutively expressed and subject to catabolite repression in the heterologous host. Since the cloned genes exhibited normal induction patterns when present in P. cepacia DBO1, it was concluded that induction was subject to negative control. Regulatory studies with P. cepacia wild-type and mutant strains showed that protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase is induced either by protocatechuate or by beta-carboxymuconate. Further studies of P. cepacia DBO1 showed that p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.2), the preceding enzyme in the pathway, is induced by p-hydroxybenzoate and that beta-carboxymuconate lactonizing enzyme, which catalyzes the reaction following protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase, is induced by both p-hydroxybenzoate and beta-ketoadipate.
TI  - [Determining the sensitivity of Pseudomonas to chemotherapeutic preparations by the micromethod in liquid synthetic medium].
AB  - Ever increasing interest is being displayed lately to simple, economic and standard systems for assay of antibiotic sensitivity of microbes with microtechniques in nutrient media requiring no raw materials in short supply. For determining sensitivity of Pseudomonas spp. to chemotherapeutics a liquid synthetic medium balanced by its cationic composition and containing no competing agents of sulfanylamides was used. Three procedures were comparatively estimated: the method of serial dilutions in the liquid medium with using immunological trays, the method of serial dilutions in agar and the diffusion test. In the estimation 185 strains of various Pseudomonas species were used: P. aeruginosa, P. cepacia, P. fluorescens, P. stutzeri, P. putida and P. pseudomallei. The method using the liquid synthetic medium and trays provided more precise interpretation of the results of the assay of the Pseudomonas spp. sensitivity to aminoglycosides, tetracycline, polymyxin and sulfamonomethoxine that the routine procedures. It showed some other advantages such as simplicity, low cost, low medium requirement and glassware economy. The application of the method allowed to exclude the use of expensive imported nutrient media in assay of sulfanylamide sensitivity.
TI  - Sodium hexametaphosphate sensitizes Pseudomonas aeruginosa, several other species of Pseudomonas, and Escherichia coli to hydrophobic drugs.
AB  - Many gram-negative bacteria are known to be remarkably resistant to hydrophobic noxious agents by virtue of their outer membranes (OM). We investigated, by using four different assay methods, the ability of sodium hexametaphosphate (HMP) to disrupt this OM barrier. (i) In the growth inhibition assay, HMP was found to sensitize strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to all the hydrophobic probes tested (rifampin, fusidic acid, dactinomycin, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and Triton X-100). A concentration of 0.3% HMP decreased the MICs of the probes by a factor of approximately 10, and maximally even a 30-fold sensitization was found with 1% HMP. (ii) In the bactericidal assay, 0.3% HMP decreased the MBC of the hydrophobic probe rifampin by a factor of approximately 30. (iii) In the bacteriolytic assay, 0.1% HMP sensitized the target bacteria to lysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate and Triton X-100. (iv) In the fluorescent-probe binding assay, HMP drastically enhanced the binding of fluorescent N-phenyl naphthylamine to the membranes of the target cells. In addition to P. aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, P. putida, P. fragi, and Escherichia coli were susceptible to the OM permeability-increasing action of HMP, while P. cepacia was resistant.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and expression of the gene for NADH-sensitive citrate synthase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The structural gene for the allosteric citrate synthase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been cloned from a genomic library by using the Escherichia coli citrate synthase gene as a hybridization probe under conditions of reduced stringency. Subcloning of portions of the original 10-kilobase-pair (kbp) clone led to isolation of the structural gene, with its promoter, within a 2,083-bp length of DNA flanked by sites for KpnI and BamHI. The nucleotide sequence of this fragment is presented; the inferred amino acid sequence was 70 and 76% identical, respectively, with the citrate synthase sequences from E. coli and Acinetobacter anitratum, two other gram-negative bacteria. DEAE-cellulose chromatography of P. aeruginosa citrate synthase from an E. coli host harboring the cloned P. aeruginosa gene gave three peaks of activity. All three enzyme peaks had subunit molecular weights of 48,000; the proteins were identical by immunological criteria and very similar in kinetics of substrate saturation and NADH inhibition. Because the cloned gene contained only one open reading frame large enough to encode a polypeptide of such a size, the three peaks must represent different forms of the same protein. A portion of the cloned P. aeruginosa gene was used as a hybridization probe under stringent conditions to identify highly homologous sequences in genomic DNA of a second strain classified as P. aeruginosa and isolates of P. putida, P. stutzeri, and P. alcaligenes. When crude extracts of each of these four isolates were mixed with antiserum raised against purified P. aeruginosa citrate synthase, however, only the P. alcaligenes extract cross-reacted.
TI  - [Expression of the phospholipase C gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Escherichia  coli and Pseudomonas].
AB  - The plc gene for phospholipase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, able to be transcribed  only from its own promoter, has been introduced into Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida cells in the recombinant plasmid pPMS21 of a wide host range. The expression of plc gene in all recipient cells has been shown to be phosphate regulated. The fact emphasizes the identity of pho-regulation systems in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas cells. The level of phospholipase activity is similar in Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa under the conditions of the gene derepression, while in Escherichia coli cells the level does not exceed 10% of activity registered in Pseudomonas cells.
TI  - Plasmid control of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida phenotypes and of linalool and p-cymene oxidation.
AB  - Two Pseudomonas strains (PpG777 and PaG158) were derived from the parent isolate  Pseudomonas incognita (putida). Strain PpG777 resembles the parental culture in growth on linalool as a source of carbon and slight growth on p-cymene, whereas PaG158 grows well on p-cymene, but not on linalool or other terpenes tested, and has a P. aeruginosa phenotype. Curing studies indicate that linalool metabolism is controlled by an extrachromosomal element whose loss forms a stable strain PaG158 with the p-cymene growth and P. aeruginosa phenotype characters. The plasmid can be transferred by PpG777 to both P. putida and P. aeruginosa strains. Surprisingly, the latter assume the P. putida phenotype. We conclude that the genetic potential to oxidize p-cymene is inherent in PpG777 but expression is repressed. Similarly, this observation implies that support of linalool oxidation effectively conceals the P. aeruginosa character.
TI  - [Electrophoretic analysis of the exoproducts of bacteria in the genus Pseudomonas].
AB  - A high degree of similarity (exceeding 90%) between the electrophoregrams of the  exoproducts of 31 Pseudomonas strains, including the standard species P. aeruginosa, P. maltophilia, P. putida, P. alcaligenes, P. testosteroni, P. diminuta, P. stutseri, P. fluorescens, has been shown by the method of electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel.
TI  - Synthesis of poly-3-hydroxyalkanoates is a common feature of fluorescent pseudomonads.
AB  - The fluorescent pseudomonads are classified as a group, one characteristic of which is that they do not accumulate poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) during nutrient starvation in the presence of excess carbon source. In this paper we show that prototype strains from this subclass, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas fluorescens, do accumulate poly-3-hydroxyalkanoates (PHA) when grown on fatty acids. These PHAs are composed of medium-chain-length (C6 to C12) 3-hydroxy fatty acids. The ability to form these polyesters does not depend on the presence of plasmids. A specificity profile of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of PHA was determined by growing Pseudomonas oleovorans on fatty acids ranging from C4 to C18. In all cases, PHAs were formed which contained C6 to C12 3-hydroxy fatty acids, with a strong preference for 3-hydroxyoctanoate when Ceven fatty acids were supplied and 3-hydroxynonanoate when Codd fatty acids were the substrate. These results indicate that the formation of PHAs depends on a specific enzyme system which is distinct from that responsible for the synthesis of PHB. While the fluorescent pseudomonads are characterized by their inability to make PHB, they appear to share the capacity to produce PHAs. This characteristic may be helpful in classifying pseudomonads. It may also be useful in the optimization of PHA production for biopolymer applications.
TI  - Recruitment of a chromosomally encoded maleylacetate reductase for degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid by plasmid pJP4.
AB  - When Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1c or P. putida PPO200 or PPO300 carry plasmid pJP4, which encodes enzymes for the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (TFD) to 2-chloromaleylacetate, cells do not grow on TFD and UV-absorbing material with spectral characteristics of chloromaleylacetate accumulates in the culture medium. Using plasmid pRO1727, we cloned from the chromosome of a nonfluorescent pseudomonad, Pseudomonas sp. strain PKO1, 6- and 0.5-kilobase BamHI DNA fragments which contain the gene for maleylacetate reductase. When carrying either of the recombinant plasmids, pRO1944 or pRO1945, together with pJP4, cells of P. aeruginosa or P. putida were able to utilize TFD as a sole carbon source for growth. A novel polypeptide with an estimated molecular weight of 18,000 was detected in cell extracts of P. aeruginosa carrying either plasmid pRO1944 or plasmid pRO1945. Maleylacetate reductase activity was induced in cells of P. aeruginosa or P. putida carrying plasmid pRO1945, as well as in cells of Pseudomonas strain PKO1, when grown on L-tyrosine, suggesting that the tyrosine catabolic pathway might be the source from which maleylacetate reductase is recruited for the degradation of TFD in pJP4-bearing cells of Pseudomonas sp. strain PKO1.
TI  - Quinoprotein ethanol dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas.
AB  - Dye-linked ethanol dehydrogenases from Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 17,933 and P.  putida ATCC 17,421 were purified to homogeneity and crystallized. The amino acid composition of the two enzymes is very similar and the number of the aromatic amino acid residues found per subunit are almost identical. With respect to their catalytic and molecular properties both ethanol dehydrogenases are similar to the quinoprotein methanol dehydrogenases known from methylotrophic bacteria. They show a high pH-optimum, need ammonia or an amine as activator and are dimers of identical subunits of a molecular mass of 60,000. The dimer is the catalytically active form. Each subunit carries one prosthetic group pyrroloquinoline quinone, which can be titrated by the suicide substrate cyclopropanone ethylhemiketal. In contrast to the general methanol dehydrogenases the two ethanol dehydrogenases have a low affinity for methanol and in addition to primary alcohols they also oxidize secondary alcohols. With secondary alcohols preferentially one of the two enantiomers is oxidized. The catalytic and spectral properties of the two enzymes are very similar to the quinoprotein ethanol dehydrogenase isolated from P. aeruginosa LMD 80.53 (Groen et al., 1984. Biochem. J. 223: 921-924). However this enzyme is reported to be a monomer of molecular mass 100,000.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Analysis of nonpolar insertion mutations in the trfA gene of IncP plasmid RK2 which affect its broad-host-range property.
AB  - Replication of broad-host-range plasmid RK2 requires the protein product(s) of the plasmid-encoded trfA gene to initiate replication at oriV, the vegetative replication origin. The trfA gene contains two translational starts which direct translation of two polypeptides, of 382 and 285 amino acids, which differ by the 97 amino acids at their N-terminus. Nonpolar insertions which abolish expression of the larger TrfA polypeptide but otherwise retain the trfA gene's normal expression signals severely reduce plasmid replication efficiency in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and to a lesser extent in Pseudomonas putida, but have very little effect in Escherichia coli. This indicates that the organization of the trfA gene, producing two polypeptides products, plays an important part in the broad-host-range of plasmid RK2 by providing a degree of flexibility in the way the plasmid's replication system interacts with host biochemistry.
TI  - DNA sequence of the tryptophan synthase genes of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Genes encoding the 2 subunits of tryptophan synthase in Pseudomonas putida have been identified and cloned by their similarity to the corresponding genes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The deduced amino acid sequences were confirmed by comparison with regions ascertained earlier by protein sequencing. The Pseudomonas amino acid sequences are 85% identical for the beta subunit and 70% identical for the alpha subunit. These sequences are compared to those of Salmonella typhimurium, where the structure is known from X-ray crystallography. Although amino acid conservation drops to 54% and 36% for the beta and alpha subunits, only 3 single residue gaps are required to maintain alignment throughout and most of the residues identified as important for catalysis or cofactor binding are conserved. The 23 residues surrounding the beta chain lysine that enters into a Schiff base linkage with the pyridoxal phosphate cofactor are compared in 13 species, including representatives from the eukaryotic and both prokaryotic kingdoms; appreciable conservation is apparent. The approximately 100 base pairs separating the trpB gene from its divergently transcribed activator gene are similar in the 2 pseudomonads, but do not resemble those of any other bacterium or fungus studied to date.
TI  - Molecular cloning of salicylate hydroxylase genes from Pseudomonas cepacia and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The sal gene encoding Pseudomonas cepacia salicylate hydroxylase was cloned and the sal encoding Pseudomonas putida salicylate hydroxylase was subcloned into plasmid vector pRO2317 to generate recombinant plasmids pTK3 and pTK1, respectively. Both cloned genes were expressed in the host Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. The parental strain can utilize catechol, a product of the salicylate hydroxylase-catalyzed reaction, but not salicylate as the sole carbon source for growth due to a natural deficiency of salicylate hydroxylase. The pTK1- or pTK3-transformed P. aeruginosa PAO1, however, can be grown on salicylate as the sole carbon source and exhibited activities for the cloned salicylate hydroxylase in crude cell lysates. In wild-type P. cepacia as well as in pTK1- or pTK3-transformed P. aeruginosa PAO1, the presence of glucose in addition to salicylate in media resulted in lower efficiencies of sal expression P. cepacia apparently can degrade salicylate via the meta cleavage pathway which, unlike the plasmid-encoded pathway in P. putida, appears to be encoded on chromosome. As revealed by DNA cross hybridizations, the P. cepacia hsd and ht genes showed significant homology with the corresponding plasmid-borne genes of P. putida but the P. cepacia sal was not homologous to the P. putida sal. Furthermore, polyclonal antibodies developed against purified P. cepacia salicylate hydroxylase inactivated the cloned P. cepacia salicylate hydroxylase but not the cloned P. putida salicylate hydroxylase in P. aeruginosa PAO1. It appears that P. cepacia and P. putida salicylate hydroxylases, being structurally distinct, were probably derived through convergent evolution.
TI  - Selection and characterization of a mutant of the cloned gene for mandelate racemase that confers resistance to an affinity label by greatly enhanced production of enzyme.
AB  - The plasmid pSCR1 containing the gene for mandelate racemase (EC 5.1.2.2) from Pseudomonas putida (ATCC 12633) allows Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 15692) to grow on (R)-mandelate as its sole carbon source [Ransom, S. C., Gerlt, J. A., Powers, V. M., & Kenyon, G. L. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 540]; the chromosome of the P. aeruginosa host apparently does not contain the gene for mandelate racemase but does contain genes for the remaining enzymes in the mandelate pathway and enables growth on (S)-mandelate as carbon source. However, in the presence of alpha-phenylglycidate, an active-site-directed irreversible inhibitor (affinity label) of mandelate racemase, P. aeruginosa transformed with pSCR1 can utilize (S)-mandelate but not (R)-mandelate as carbon source. This inhibition of growth on (R)-mandelate provides a metabolic selection for mutants that are resistant to alpha-phenylglycidate. When (R)-mandelate is used as carbon source and alpha-phenylglycidate is present, a few colonies of P. aeruginosa transformed with pSCR1 grow slowly and appear on plates after several days. The plasmid isolated from these cells confers resistance to alpha-phenylglycidate on newly transformed cells of P. aeruginosa. This resistance to the affinity label is not due to a mutation within the primary structure of the enzyme. A single base change (C----A) located 87 bp upstream of the initiation codon for the gene for mandelate racemase was detected in three independent isolates of alpha-phenylglycidate-resistant colonies and appears responsible for a 30-fold increase in the amount of mandelate racemase encoded by the gene contained in the plasmid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Effect of degradative plasmid CAM-OCT on responses of Pseudomonas bacteria to UV  light.
AB  - The effect of plasmid CAM-OCT on responses to UV irradiation was compared in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in Pseudomonas putida, and in Pseudomonas putida mutants carrying mutations in UV response genes. CAM-OCT substantially increased both survival and mutagenesis in the two species. P. aeruginosa strains without CAM-OCT exhibited much higher UV sensitivity than did P. putida strains. UV-induced mutagenesis of plasmid-free P. putida was easily detected in three different assays (two reversion assays and one forward mutation assay), whereas UV mutagenesis of P. aeruginosa without CAM-OCT was seen only in the forward mutation assay. These results suggest major differences in DNA repair between the two species and highlight the presence of error-prone repair functions on CAM-OCT. A number of P. putida mutants carrying chromosomal mutations affecting either survival or mutagenesis after UV irradiation were isolated, and the effect of CAM-OCT on these mutants was determined. All mutations producing a UV-sensitive phenotype in P. putida were fully suppressed by the plasmid, whereas the plasmid had a more variable effect on mutagenesis mutations, suppressing some and producing no suppression of others. On the basis of the results reported here and results obtained by others with plasmids carrying UV response genes, it appears that CAM-OCT may differ either in regulation or in the number and functions of UV response genes encoded.
TI  - Factors affecting conjugal transfer of plasmids encoding mercury resistance from  pure cultures and mixed natural suspensions of epilithic bacteria.
AB  - Sixty-five pure cultures of epilithic bacteria were examined for their ability to transfer mercury resistance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa; five isolates transferred plasmids encoding mercury resistance with frequencies ranging from 8.4 x 10(-8) to 2.8 x 10(-3) per recipient. Two of the plasmids, pQM3 and pQM4, encoded narrow-spectrum mercury resistance, pQM3 also encoded streptomycin resistance, and both plasmids were broad host range. Maximum transfer frequencies of epilithic plasmids from pure cultures occurred over the range 10-25 degrees C at 3.5 g C l-1 and with donor to recipient ratios of 0.4-30. Transfer occurred over a range of pH values (pH 5.0-8.0) but the effect of pH was most significant at non-optimal temperature. Anaerobiosis inhibited transfer of one epilithic plasmid, pQM1, but not that of pQM3. Plasmids encoding mercury resistance were also transferred from mixed natural suspensions of epilithic bacteria (MNS) to Pseudomonas spp. on agar in the laboratory. Transfer from MNS occurred over a wide range of environmentally relevant conditions with maximum frequencies (2 x 10(-5) per recipient) after 24 h, at 25 degrees C, pH 5.5-8.0 and on a medium containing 10 g C l-1. The optimal initial cell density of MNS and recipient was 1.7 x 10(5) c.f.u. cm-2 and highest frequencies were obtained with donor to recipient ratios ranging from 1.2 x 10(-1) to 1.7 x 10(-3). Most of the plasmids (54%) from MNS transferred from their original P. aeruginosa transconjugants to a Pseudomonas putida strain, with frequencies ranging from 1.1 x 10(-6) to greater than 1.0 x 10(-1) per recipient. The majority (80%) of the plasmids were larger than 300 kb and all of these large plasmids encoded UV resistance in addition to mercury resistance. Twenty-one plasmids greater than 300 kb were analysed by restriction digests and were shown to be similar, with only minor structural alterations. One of these alterations was associated with the acquisition of streptomycin resistance. Overall, these results suggest that the epilithic bacteria examined possess the potential to transfer mercury resistance within the epilithon under a wide range of environmentally relevant conditions.
TI  - Occurrence, transfer and mobilization in epilithic strains of Acinetobacter of mercury-resistance plasmids capable of transformation.
AB  - A 7.8 kb plasmid (pQM17) encoding mercury resistance was isolated from two epilithic strains of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. The plasmid had a broad host range when mobilized by RP1, transferring into Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. putida, P. fluorescens, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris and Chromobacterium sp. with frequencies ranging from 5.3 x 10(-9) to 4.6 x 10(-4) per recipient. The plasmid could be transferred into A. calcoaceticus BD413 using intact cells of donor and recipient bacteria (i.e. natural transformation) and there was a broad temperature optimum (14-37 degrees C) for transformation. Transformation was as efficient in liquid matings as on plates but there was no effect of pH in the range 5.6-7.9. Maximum transformation frequencies were obtained after 24 h on agar plates containing 3.5-10 g C 1-1 with donor to recipient ratios ranging from 6 to 415.
TI  - Specificity of pyoverdine-mediated iron uptake among fluorescent Pseudomonas strains.
AB  - Pyoverdine-mediated iron transport was determined for seven fluorescent Pseudomonas strains belonging to different species. For all strains, cell or cell outer membrane and iron(III)-pyoverdine combinations were compared with their homologous counterparts in uptake, binding, and cross-feeding experiments. For four strains (Pseudomonas putida ATCC 12633, Pseudomonas fluorescens W, P. fluorescens ATCC 17400, and Pseudomonas tolaasii NCPPB 2192), the pyoverdine-mediated iron transport appeared to be strictly strain specific; pyoverdine-facilitated iron uptake by iron-starved cells and binding of ferripyoverdine to the purified outer membranes of such cells were efficient only in the case of the homologous systems. Cross-feeding assays, in liquid or solid cultures, resulted, however, especially for P. fluorescens ATCC 17400, in some discrepancies compared with uptake and binding assays, suggesting that growth experiments are the least likely to yield correct information on specificity of the pyoverdine-mediated iron transport. For the three other strains (P. fluorescens ATCC 13525, P. chlororaphis ATCC 9446, and P. aeruginosa ATCC 15692), cross-reactivity was demonstrated by the uptake, binding, and cross-feeding experiments. In an attempt to determine which parts of the iron transport system were responsible for the specificity, the differences in amino acid composition of the pyoverdines, together with the differences observed at the level of the iron-sensitive outer membrane protein pattern of the seven strains, are discussed.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the catA and catBC gene clusters from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO.
AB  - A 9.9-kilobase (kb) BamHI restriction endonuclease fragment encoding the catA and catBC gene clusters was selected from a gene bank of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1c chromosome. The catA, catB, and catC genes encode enzymes that catalyze consecutive reactions in the catechol branch of the beta-ketoadipate pathway: catA, catechol-1,2-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.1); catB, muconate lactonizing enzyme (EC 5.5.1.1); and catC, muconolactone isomerase (EC 5.3.3.4). A recombinant plasmid, pRO1783, which contains the 9.9-kb BamHI restriction fragment complemented P. aeruginosa mutants with lesions in the catA, catB, or catC gene; however, this fragment of chromosomal DNA did not contain any other catabolic genes which had been placed near the catA or catBC cluster based on cotransducibility of the loci. Restriction mapping, deletion subcloning, and complementation analysis showed that the order of the genes on the cloned chromosomal DNA fragment is catA, catB, catC. The catBC genes are tightly linked and are transcribed from a single promoter that is on the 5' side of the catB gene. The catA gene is approximately 3 kb from the catBC genes. The cloned P. aeruginosa catA, catB, and catC genes were expressed at basal levels in blocked mutants of Pseudomonas putida and did not exhibit an inducible response. These observations suggest positive regulation of the P. aeruginosa catA and catBC cluster, the absence of a positive regulatory element from pRO1783, and the inability of the P. putida regulatory gene product to induce expression of the P. aeruginosa catA, catB, and catC genes.
TI  - Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the transacylase components of branched chain oxoacid dehydrogenase of Pseudomonas putida, and the pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenases of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of bkdB, the structural gene for E2b, the transacylase component of branched-chain-oxoacid dehydrogenase of Pseudomonas putida has been determined and translated into its amino acid sequence. The start of bkdB was identified from the N-terminal sequence of E2b isolated from branched-chain-oxoacid dehydrogenase of the closely related species, P. aeruginosa. The reading frame was composed of 65.5% G + C with 82.3% of the codons ending in G or C. There was no intergenic space between bkdA2 and bkdB. No codons requiring minor tRNAs were utilized and the codon bias index indicated a preferential codon usage. The bkdB gene encoded 423 amino acids although the N-terminal methionine was absent from E2b prepared from P. aeruginosa. The relative molecular mass of the encoded protein was 45,134 (45,003 minus methionine) vs 47,000 obtained by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. There was a single lipoyl domain in E2b compared to three lipoyl domains in E2p, and one domain in E2o, the transacylases of pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenases of Escherichia coli respectively. There was significant similarity between the lipoyl domain of E2b and of E2p and E2o as well as between the E1-E2 binding domains of E2b, E2p and E2o. There was no similarity between the E3 binding domain of E2b to E2p and E2o which may reflect the uniqueness of the E3 component of branched-chain-oxoacid dehydrogenase of P. putida. The conclusions drawn from these comparisons are that the transacylases of prokaryotic pyruvate, 2-oxoglutarate and branched-chain-oxoacid dehydrogenases descended from a common ancestral protein probably at about the same time.
TI  - [Bacteriophages of Pseudomonas putida containing single-stranded canonical DNA breaks].
AB  - It was shown that bacteriophage tf as well as bacteriophages phi p4/40, phi p25/42, phi p23/40 and phi p6/40, which are specific to different P. putida strains, contain the single strand breaks in their DNA. The breaks are localized in one strand of DNA molecules and are repairable with T4 DNA ligase. Bacteriophage tf has no detectable DNA homology with phi p4/40, phi p25/42, phi p23/40 and phi p6/40 bacteriophages. All the phages studied have no relation with other known Pseudomonas phages. Bacteriophages phi p4/40 and phi p25/42 share the extensive DNA homology.
TI  - [Interaction of heterologous bacteriophages: growth suppression of temperate PP56 phage of Pseudomonas putida by the transposable phage D3112 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa].
AB  - We have found an inhibiting effect of hybrid RP4::D3112 plasmid (where D3112 is represented as genome of a transposable phage specific for Pseudomonas aeruginosa) on the development of temperate P. putida phage PP56. The study of the effect has revealed a previously unknown locus (in the region 12-14.2 kb of the D3112 genome) which functions in the prophage state. The locus affects PP56 decreasing phage yield. Mutants of PP56 insensitive to inhibition were found.
TI  - Thiosulfate oxidation by obligately heterotrophic bacteria.
AB  - Thiosulfate was oxidized stoichiometrically to tetrathionate during growth on glucose byKlebsiella aerogenes, Bacillus globigii, B. megaterium, Pseudomonas putida, two strains each ofP. fluorescens andP. aeruginosa, and anAeromonas sp. A gram-negative, rod-shaped soil isolate, Pseudomonad Hw, converted thiosulfate to tetrathionate during growth on acetate. None of the organisms could use thiosulfate as sole energy source. The quantitative recovery of all the thiosulfate supplied to heterotrophic cultures either as tetrathionate alone or as tetrathionate and unused thiosulfate demonstrated that no oxidation to sulfate occurred with any of the strains tested. Two strains ofEscherichia coli did not oxidize thiosulfate. Thiosulfate oxidation in batch culture occurred at different stages of the growth cycle for different organisms:P. putida oxidized thiosulfate during lag and early exponential phase,K. aerogenes oxidized thiosulfate at all stages of growth, andB. megaterium andAeromonas oxidized thiosulfate during late exponential phase. The relative rates of oxidation byP. putida andK. aerogenes were apparently determined by different concentrations of thiosulfate oxidizing enzyme. Thiosulfate oxidation byP. aeruginosa grown in chemostat culture was inducible, since organisms pregrown on thiosulfate-containing media oxidized thiosulfate, but those pregrown on glucose only could not oxidize thiosulfate. Steady state growth yield ofP. aeruginosa in glucose-limited chemostat culture increased about 23% in the presence of 5-22 mM thiosulfate, with complete or partial concomitant oxidation to tetrathionate. The reasons for this stimulation are unclear. The results suggest that heterotrophic oxidation of thiosulfate to tetrathionate is widespread across several genera and may even stimulate bacterial growth in some organisms.
TI  - [Isolation and comparative characteristics of 2 unrelated temperate phages of Pseudomonas putida PpG1].
AB  - Two temperate bacteriophages, PP56 and PP71, specific for bacteria of Pseudomonas putida strain PpG1 have been isolated for the first time. Characterization of the phages was performed. Both of them accomplish stable lysogenization of P. putida PpG1 cells. The phages are inducible. Several groups of clear plaque (c) mutants of PP56 and PP71 with altered processes of establishment and maintenance of lysogenic state have been isolated, according to complementation test. The phages differ in following characters: 1) in morphology of mature phage particles (C and B types, according to Bradley classification); 2) in sizes and genome organizations: DNA of PP56 is permuted (up to 30%), its size is 45 kb, the size of terminal redundancy being 2.5 kb; there is no permutation in PP71 DNA of 48 kb and it has "cohesive" ends; 3) no DNA/DNA homology is shown in tests between PP56 and PP71 DNAs. All the data obtained permitted to consider the phages PP56 and PP71 to belong to different unrelated species (families).
TI  - Cloning, DNA sequence analysis, and expression in Escherichia coli of the gene for mandelate racemase from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The gene for mandelate racemase (EC 5.1.2.2) from Pseudomonas putida (ATCC 12633) was cloned in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 15692). The selection for the cloned gene was based upon the inability of P. aeruginosa to grow on (R)-mandelate as sole carbon source by virtue of the absence of mandelate racemase in its mandelate pathway. Fragments of P. putida DNA obtained by digestion of chromosomal DNA with Sau3A were ligated into the BamHI site of the Gram-negative vector pKT230 and transformed into the P. aeruginosa host. A transformant able to utilize (R)-mandelate as sole carbon source was characterized, and the plasmid was found to contain approximately five kilobase pairs of P. putida DNA. Subcloning of this DNA revealed the position of the gene for the racemase within the cloned DNA from P. putida. The dideoxy-DNA sequencing procedure was used to determine the sequence of the gene and its translated sequence. The amino acid sequence and molecular weight for mandelate racemase deduced from the gene sequence (38 570) are in excellent agreement with amino acid composition and molecular weight data for the polypeptide recently determined with enzyme isolated from P. putida; these recent determinations of the polypeptide molecular weight differ significantly from the originally reported value of 69,500 [Fee, Judith A., Hegeman, G.D., & Kenyon, G.L. (1974) Biochemistry 13,2528], which was used to demonstrate that alpha-phenylglycidate, an active site directed irreversible inhibitor, binds to the enzyme with a stoichiometry of 1:1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Transcription of the fimbrial subunit gene and an associated transfer RNA gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Gene fimA encoding the structural subunit of the fimbriae of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAK is located in the centre of a 1.2-kb HindIII genomic DNA fragment [see also Sastry et al., J. Bacteriol. 164 (1985) 571-577], which in turn is located within a 6.2-kb EcoRI fragment. Immediately downstream from fimA is a putative threonine tRNA gene [Dalrymple and Mattick, Biochem. Int. 13 (1986) 547-553]. Northern blotting experiments showed that fimA is transcribed to an mRNA of approx. 650 nucleotides, which also includes the threonine tRNA sequence but no other protein-coding region. There was no indication that this mRNA is processed to release the tRNA sequence. However, the tRNA did appear to be expressed independently from its own promoter in the region 3' to fimA. When these sequences were introduced into Pseudomonas putida, we found that the level of expression of fimA from the cloned 6.2-kb EcoRI fragment was approx. 30-fold greater than that from the smaller HindIII fragment, whereas that of the specific tRNA species was unaltered. The size of the fimA transcript was also unaltered. These results provide evidence that the fimA gene is subject to specific transcriptional activation in vivo and that this activation involves sequences flanking the 1.2-kb HindIII fragment.
TI  - [Molecular genetic organization and origin of plasmid pBS52 with a broad range of bacterial hosts].
AB  - The data are presented on the localization of genetic determinants of resistance  to streptomycin, ampicillin and sulfanilamides on the physical map of conjugative R plasmid pBS52 of 38,000 bp which has a broad bacterial host range and belongs to a new incompatibility group. The plasmid has a natural "polylinker" site (less than 200 bp) containing (in the order of arrangement) the recognition sites for restriction enzymes: BamHI-EcoRI-PstI-EcoRV-BglII (PvuII). The comparative analysis shows that pBS52 contains a segment homologous to DNA of plasmid RSE1010 (IncP-4). The evolutionary origin of plasmid pBS52 is discussed. The recA-independent formation of the mini-derivatives of pBS373 and pBS374 types during the transformation of Escherichia coli with pBS52 plasmid DNA has been shown. Plasmids pBS373 and yBS374 are capable of autonomous replication in Pseudomonas putida and P. aeruginosa cells, which is provided by the rep system of IncP-4 replicon.
TI  - Catabolism of arginine, citrulline and ornithine by Pseudomonas and related bacteria.
AB  - The distribution of the arginine succinyltransferase pathway was examined in representative strains of Pseudomonas and related bacteria able to use arginine as the sole carbon and nitrogen source for growth. The arginine succinyltransferase pathway was induced in arginine-grown cells. The accumulation of succinylornithine following in vivo inhibition of succinylornithine transaminase activity by aminooxyacetic acid showed that this pathway is responsible for the dissimilation of the carbon skeleton of arginine. Catabolism of citrulline as a carbon source was restricted to relatively few of the organisms tested. In P. putida, P. cepacia and P. indigofera, ornithine was the main product of citrulline degradation. In most strains which possessed the arginine succinyltransferase pathway, the first step of ornithine utilization as a carbon source was the conversion of ornithine into succinylornithine through an ornithine succinyltransferase. However P. cepacia and P. putida used ornithine by a pathway which proceeded via proline as an intermediate and involved an ornithine cyclase activity.
TI  - [Ability to survive and interactions of selected bacterial species in activated carbon filters].
AB  - The survival and the interactions of selected, hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon filters was investigated. The numbers of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. putida increased in previously sterilized filters. After inoculation all bacteria (10(6] were adsorbed. During a period of 6-10 days the filter effluent contained no detectable bacteria. After that the colony numbers increased to a constant level of 10(4)-10(5) colony forming units (CFU)/ml effluent and 10(6)-10(7) CFU/g activated carbon. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis died off in the filter system. If the filters were inoculated simultaneously with two species, P. putida and P. aeruginosa remained at a constant level between 10(4) and 10(5) CFU/ml. E. coli was suppressed by P. aeruginosa and died off in the presence of P. putida. As in-vitro tests indicated, P. putida did not produce inhibitory substances against P. aeruginosa or E. coli. On the other hand, P. aeruginosa showed antagonistic activities against E. coli.
TI  - [Automated micromethod for the determination of the utilization of carbon sources by clinically significant Pseudomonas species].
AB  - The assimilation of 43 different carbon substrates by 93 clinical strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied by a new miniaturized rapid method. Reading of assimilation results was done photometrically after 18-20 h incubation and the resulting data were captured and stored by a microcomputer. The differentiating capacity of the assimilation tests were verified by comparing the results of 41 strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens, 48 strains of Pseudomonas putida, 52 strains of Pseudomonas maltophilia and respectively 10 strains of Pseudomonas pseudomallei and Pseudomonas cepacia. The assimilation pattern obtained from the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains agreed to those described in literature and because of miniaturization, standardisation, facility of use and automatic reading the method seems to be suitable for routine laboratory work.
TI  - The amino acid sequence of the aliphatic amidase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Amino acid sequence studies show that the aliphatic amidase (EC 3.5.1.4) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAC142 consists of a single polypeptide chain of 346 residues, giving an Mr of 38,400. The evidence from the amino acid studies is in complete agreement with that deduced from the DNA sequence of the amiE gene. Studies of the protein from Pseudomonas putida A87 show that it differs from the Ps. aeruginosa protein by about 30 amino acid substitutions. It now becomes possible to relate changes in the enzyme which result in altered specificity to structural changes in the protein.
TI  - Analysis of transcription from the trfA promoter of broad host range plasmid RK2  in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Reverse transcriptase mapping has been used to analyze transcription from the trfA promoter of broad host range plasmid RK2. The results show that trfA operon mRNA has the same 5' end in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, and Escherichia coli. The strengths of wild-type and mutant trfA promoters, which differ by defined base substitutions, have been compared and the positions of their transcriptional start sites determined. While these base substitutions do not alter the transcriptional start site, they do have marked effects on promoter strength which are broadly similar in each of the host species. A single base pair substitution, which lies in the region corresponding to the E. coli promoter consensus, brings about a large reduction in gene expression while the introduction of a second mutation, at a locus outside this region, has no further effect on promoter strength. The results indicate that these Pseudomonas species possess an RNA polymerase which recognizes the same region of the trfA promoter as that utilized by E. coli RNA polymerase. Within the limits of these observations it is clear that the trfA operon is transcribed from a single promoter which can function efficiently in diverse species, a property which may be important for its broad host range.
TI  - Survival of selected bacterial species in sterilized activated carbon filters and biological activated carbon filters.
AB  - The survival of selected hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon (AC) filters on a bench scale was investigated. The results revealed that after inoculation of the test strains the previously sterilized AC absorbed all bacteria (10(6) to 10(7)). After a period of 6 to 13 days without countable bacteria in the effluent, the numbers of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas putida increased up to 10(4) to 10(5) CFU/ml of effluent and 10(6) to 10(7) CFU/g of AC. When Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis were used, no growth in filters could be observed. The numbers of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and P. putida, however, decreased immediately and showed no regrowth in nonsterile AC from a filter which had been continuously connected to running tap water for 2 months. Under these conditions an autochthonous microflora developed on the carbon surface which could be demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy and culturing methods (heterotrophic plate count). These bacteria reduced E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and P. putida densities in the effluent by a factor of more than 10(5) within 1 to 5 days. The hypothesis that antagonistic substances of the autochthonous microflora were responsible for the elimination of the artificial contamination could not be confirmed because less than 1% of the isolates of the autochthonous microflora were able to produce such substances as indicated by in vitro tests. Competition for limiting nutrients was thought to be the reason for the observed effects.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of Pseudomonas putida R-prime plasmids.
AB  - A number of enhanced chromosome mobilizing (ECM) plasmids derived from the wide host range plasmid R68 have been used to construct R-prime plasmids carrying a maximum of two map minutes of the Pseudomonas putida PPN chromosome, using Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO as the recipient. For one ECM plasmid, pMO61, the ability to form R-primes did not correlate with the ability to mobilize chromosomes in intrastrain crosses, suggesting that different mechanisms are involved. Physical analysis of one R-prime showed that 3.5 kb of chromosomal DNA had been inserted between the tandem IS21 sequences carried by the parent ECM plasmid.
TI  - In-vitro susceptibility of Pseudomonas species to fifteen antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in-vitro susceptibility of four Pseudomonas spp. (P. aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, P. maltophilia and P. putida) to 15 antimicrobials was determined. Ciprofloxacin had the greatest in-vitro activity. Although the susceptibility of the different species to individual agents was quite variable, they tended to be less susceptible to agents such as amikacin, aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime and piperacillin, already in clinical use at our institution, than to newer agents, not currently in clinical use.
TI  - A set of cassettes and improved vectors for genetic and biochemical characterization of Pseudomonas genes.
AB  - A set of broad-host-range vectors allowing direct selection of recombinant DNA molecules to facilitate subcloning and expression analyses of Pseudomonas genes was constructed using Bg/II lacZ alpha cassette. Controlled expression vectors pVDtac39 and pVDtac24 were shown to be useful for determination of enzymatic activities encoded by the cloned DNA fragments and Mr determination of the corresponding polypeptides. A set of Pseudomonas putida xylE gene cassettes truncated at the 5' end was constructed for translational (protein) fusion studies. A protein fusion of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa algD gene, coding for GDPmannose dehydrogenase, and the truncated xylE gene cassette was used to verify the putative coding region and translational signals predicted from the algD nucleotide sequence.
TI  - Phosphate-selective porins from the outer membranes of fluorescent Pseudomonas sp.
AB  - Phosphate starvation induced oligomeric proteins from the outer membranes of Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aureofaciens, and Pseudomonas chlororaphis were purified to homogeneity. The incorporation of the purified proteins into planar lipid bilayer membranes resulted in stepwise increases in membrane conductance. Single channel conductance experiments demonstrated that these proteins were all capable of forming small channels, similar to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa phospsate porin protein P, with average single channel conductances in 1 M KCl of between 233 and 252 pS. Single channel conductance measurements made in salts of varying cation or anion size indicated that the channels were uniformly anion selective. The measurement of single channel conductance as a function of KCl concentration revealed that all channels saturated at higher salt concentrations, consistent with the presence of an anion-binding site in the channel. Apparent Kd values for Cl- binding were calculated and shown to vary only twofold (180-297 mM) among all channels, including protein P channels. Phosphate competitively inhibited chloride conductance through these channels with apparent I50 values of between 0.59 and 2.5 mM phosphate at 40 mM Cl- and between 9.7 and 27 mM phosphate at 1 m Cl-. These data were consistent with the presence of a phosphate-binding site in the channels of these phosphate-regulated proteins. Furthermore, they indicated that these channels exhibit at least a 20- to 80-fold higher affinity for phosphate than for chloride.
TI  - Severe gram-negative infections in neutropenic children cured by imipenem/cilastatin in combination with an aminoglycoside.
AB  - Nine severe Gram-negative septicaemias in neutropenic (less than 500 neutrophils/mm3) children with neoplastic diseases were treated with imipenem/cilastatin (75 mg/kg/day) in combination with an aminoglycoside. The bacterial strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa 7, P. putida 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1) were resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins, or were isolated during treatment with a broad-spectrum penicillin to which the bacterial strain was sensitive in vitro. The mean duration of neutropenia was 18.5 (3-51) days and duration of treatment 20 (8-51) days. Pyrexia was controlled in 2.8 (1-10) days and eradication of the pathogen from blood in one day. No clinical and biological adverse reaction was observed. These results show imipenem/cilastatin to be an effective treatment of infections in severely immunocompromised patients.
TI  - [Transfer of chromosomal genes and formation of R'-derivatives using PR4::D312cts15 plasmids in Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells].
AB  - Several hybrid RP4 plasmids containing the genome of heat-inducible D3112cts15 phage integrated into 2 different sites of RP4 were selected. It was shown that the plasmids RP4::D3112cts15 mobilized the chromosome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from many sites located in different chromosome regions. Chromosomal recombinants are, formed at frequencies of about 10(-4) per recipient cell. Analysis of coinheritance of unselected markers showed that the majority of recombinants inherited short donor chromosome fragments (about 5 min). R' plasmids can be easily selected by mating with a rec- recipient. For instance, the frequency of selection of R' plasmids containing argH+ locus was about 10(-5) per donor cell. Conjugative transfer of RP4::D3112cts15 into nonlysogenic strains PAO P. aeruginosa results in partial or complete loss of prophage from a hybrid plasmid. The RP4::D3112cts15 plasmids appear to have retained the broad host range of the original RP4 (they are maintained in P. putida and Escherichia coli).
TI  - Monomer sequence and acetylation pattern in some bacterial alginates.
AB  - The sequential structures and acetylation patterns of alginates from several strains of Azotobacter vinelandii and Pseudomonas species, including P. aeruginosa, P. putida, P. fluorescens, and P. mendocina, have been studied by 1H-n.m.r. spectroscopy. O-Acetyl groups were exclusively associated with the D-mannuronic acid residues and the degree of acetylation varied in the range 4-57%, depending upon the proportion of this acid in the polymer. 1H-N.m.r. spectroscopy of a naturally occurring and an artificially acetylated D-mannuronan made it possible to determine the degrees of acetylation at O-2, O-3, and O-2,3. The most conspicuous difference between alginates from A. vinelandii and the four Pseudomonas species was the complete absence of consecutive L-guluronic acid residues in the latter.
TI  - In vitro activity of imipenem towards gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - The authors studied the in vitro antimicrobial activity of imipenem towards 355 gram-negative bacterial strains, taking into particular consideration unusual or dangerous species. The study was carried out on a comparative basis with piperacillin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and gentamicin. Ninety percent of the fermentative gram-negative strains were inhibited at concentrations less than or equal to 2 mg/l. Imipenem inhibited 100% of strains of Alcaligenes faecalis, Alcaligenes denitrificans, Flavobacterium odoratum, Acinetobacter lwoffii, Acinetobacter anitratum, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas stutzeri and 90% of strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. The excellent bactericidal activity of imipenem was indicated by its minimum bactericidal concentrations equal to or slightly greater than its minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC). As far as the other parameters were concerned (influence of the dimensions of inoculum and culture medium on MICs), imipenem confirmed its excellent in vitro microbiologic characteristics.
TI  - Structure and regulation of the anthranilate synthase genes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa: I. Sequence of trpG encoding the glutamine amidotransferase subunit.
AB  - We have determined the DNA sequence of the distal 148 codons of trpE and all of trpG in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These genes encode, respectively, the large and small (glutamine amidotransferase) subunits of anthranilate synthase, the first enzyme in the tryptophan synthetic pathway. The sequenced region of trpE is homologous with the distal portion of E. coli and Bacillus subtilis trpE, whereas the trpG sequence is homologous to the glutamine amidotransferase subunit genes of a number of bacterial and fungal anthranilate synthases. The two coding sequences overlap by 23 bp. Codon usage in these Pseudomonas genes shows a marked preference for codons ending in G or C, thereby resembling that of trpB, trpA, and several other chromosomal loci from this species and others with a high G + C content in their DNA. The deduced amino acid sequence for the P. aeruginosa trpG gene product differs to a surprising extent from the directly determined amino acid sequence of the glutamine amidotransferase subunit of P. putida anthranilate synthase (Kawamura et al. 1978). This suggests that these two proteins are encoded by loci that duplicated much earlier in the phylogeny of these organisms but have recently assumed the same function. We have also determined 490 bp of DNA sequence distal to trpG but have not ascertained the function of this segment, though it is rich in dyad symmetries.
TI  - [A clinical bacteriological efficacy study on a fosfomycin otic solution].
AB  - Fosfomycin (FOM) otic solution was administered to 587 patients with suppurative  otitis media infections including 190 patients in the dose-establishment test, 126 patients in the open clinical trial and 271 patients in the double blind test. Various bacteria were detected in the 549 cases in which bacteriological investigation was possible. Main bacteria detected from the above cases were S. aureus (261 strains, 47.5%), P. aeruginosa (93 strains, 16.9%), coagulase negative Staphylococci (CNS) (89 strains, 16.2%), Providencia spp. (35 strains, 6.4%) and Proteus spp. (28 strains, 5.1%). Twenty-seven strains of anaerobic bacteria (4.9%) were also detected. The MIC of FOM, and the reference drug, chloramphenicol (CP), fradiomycin (FRM), cefmenoxime (CMX) and cephalexin (CEX), were determined up to a concentration of 800 micrograms/ml with inoculum sizes of 10(6) and 10(8) CFU/ml. About 30% of S. aureus was multi-drug resistant, including methicillin and cephems, but FOM showed excellent antibacterial activity against it. The FOM had superior antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa to CP, FRM and CMX, and was also active against other bacteria. The antibacterial activity of FOM was inferior to other drugs against CNS, Enterobacter spp., P. putida and P. cepacia. The detection rate of these bacteria, however, was low and since their role as causative organisms is not well defined, the inferior activity of FOM has no effect on the bacteriological evaluation of FOM. Since the concentration in the tympanic cavity about 1 hour after the administration of 3% FOM solution was estimated to be 2,000 to 3,000 micrograms/ml, it could be presumed that bacteria inhibited by 800 micrograms/ml of FOM at an inoculum size of 10(8) CFU/ml would be eradicable. The low ototoxicity of FOM is likely due to its characteristic as an inhibitor of bacterial cell wall synthesis. From these results, 3% FOM otic solution may be considered as a remarkably useful topical preparation for the treatment of suppurative otitis media.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies to Pseudomonas aeruginosa ferripyochelin-binding protein.
AB  - Hybridomas secreting specific monoclonal antibodies against the Pseudomonas aeruginosa ferripyochelin-binding protein (FBP) were isolated. These monoclonal antibodies reacted with FBP in immunoblots of outer membrane preparations from all serotypes of P. aeruginosa. Two of the monoclonal antibodies also reacted with FBP in strains of P. putida, P. fluorescens, and P. stutzeri. These antibodies did not react with outer membranes of P. cepacia, "P. multivorans," P. maltophilia, or other gram-negative organisms. The monoclonal antibodies were opsonophagocytic and blocked the binding of [59Fe]ferripyochelin to isolated outer membranes of strain PAO. By indirect immunofluorescence techniques, the monoclonal antibodies were used to demonstrate that FBP is present on the cell surface of P. aeruginosa cells grown in low-iron but not high-iron medium. These observations were confirmed by using 125I in surface-labeling techniques.
TI  - A comparative study of acquired amidase activity in Pseudomonas species.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida PP3 carrying dehalogenases I and II and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAU3 carrying dehalogenase I coded for by plasmid pUU2 were able to grow on 2-monochloropropionic acid (2MCPA). Neither strain utilized 2-chloropropionamide (2CPA) as a carbon or nitrogen source for growth. Mutations in both strains to 2Cpa+ phenotypes (designated P. putida PPW3 and P. aeruginosa PAU5, respectively) involved the expression of an acquired 2CPA-amidase activity. The amidase followed by dehalogenase reactions in these strains constituted a novel metabolic pathway for growth on 2CPA. P. putida PPW3 synthesized a constitutive amidase of molecular mass 59 kDa consisting of two identical subunits of 29 kDa. For those amides tested this acquired enzyme was most active against chlorinated aliphatic amides, although substrate affinities (Km) and maximum rates of activity (Vmax) were poor. P. aeruginosa PAU5 acquired a 2Cpa+ phenotype by overproducing the A-amidase normally used by this species to hydrolyse aliphatic amides. The A-amidase had only slight activity towards 2CPA. However, with constitutive synthesis the mutant grew on the chlorinated substrates. Chloroacetamide (CAA) was a toxic substrate analogue for these Pseudomonas strains. A strain resistant to CAA was isolated from P. aeruginosa PAU5 when exposed to 1-10 mM-CAA. This mutant, P. aeruginosa PAU6, synthesized an inducible A-amidase. CAA-resistance depended upon the simultaneous expression of CAA-inducible amidase and dehalogenase activities.
TI  - An investigation of a collection of yellow-pigmented Pseudomonas.
AB  - Thirty-six strains of yellow-pigmented Pseudomonas from clinical as well as non-clinical material and 11 reference strains of Pseudomonas were investigated by means of conventional bacteriological methods (a total of 53 different tests). Eighteen of the 36 yellow-pigmented strains could be classified as P. paucimobilis. Apart from the presence of lipid inclusions on beta-hydroxybutyrate, hydrolysis of DNA, and Tween 80 our results showed a high degree of accordance with other investigations. Eight strains showed characteristics compatible with inclusion in the CDC VE group; one orange-yellow strain showed the characteristics of P. vesicularis, and one was a pyoverdin negative, yellow P. putida. Eight strains remained unidentified. Strains of P. paucimobilis were most often resistant to antibiotics used for P. aeruginosa infections (viz. piperacillin, cefsulodin, ceftazidime) while the strains of the CDC VE group were often susceptible. Most strains were susceptible to the aminoglycosides. The difficulties in distinguishing yellow-pigmented strains of Pseudomonas from Flavobacterium spp. or Xanthomonas spp. are discussed.
TI  - Comparison of cross-staining reactions by Pseudomonas spp. and fluorescein-labeled polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies directed against Legionella pneumophila.
AB  - Commercially prepared polyclonal antisera to Legionella pneumophila are known to  cross-react with organisms of the genus Pseudomonas. To determine whether a commercially available monoclonal antibody reagent specific for L. pneumophila would also cross-react with pseudomonads, a two-laboratory study was undertaken to test both monoclonal and polyclonal reagents against 33 isolates of Pseudomonas spp., including 25 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 P. putida, 2 P. maltophilia, 1 P. fluorescens, and 1 P. alcaligenes. Four antisera were tested; polyclonal anti-legionella antisera pools A and B (Centers for Disease Control [CDC], Atlanta, (Ga.), polyclonal 1-6 antisera (BioDx, Inc., Denville, N.J.), and a monoclonal antibody reagent produced by Genetic Systems Corp., Seattle, Wash. All reagents were labeled with fluorescein. Cross-staining reactions were found with the BioDx L. pneumophila antisera and 10 isolates of Pseudomonas. Four of these isolates demonstrated cross-staining with CDC pool A. When tested with individual serotype-specific reagents (CDC), three of four cross-reacted with L. pneumophila serotype 1 antisera; the fourth cross-reacted with serotype 3. No cross-staining reactions were noted with the monoclonal reagent and any of the pseudomonads tested, demonstrating that the Genetic Systems Corp. monoclonal reagent is the most specific of the four reagents tested.
TI  - [Characteristics of plasmid pBS271 controlling epsilon-caprolactam degradation by bacteria in the genus Pseudomonas].
AB  - Conjugative plasmids control the ability of five Pseudomonas strains isolated from the rectifiers of chemical plants to grow on epsilon-caprolactam as a sole carbon and nitrogen source. All the plasmids have a high molecular mass of their DNA (ca. 300 MDa) and control epsilon-caprolactam degradation at least to succinate. One of the plasmids (pBS271) belongs to the incompatibility group P-2 and suppresses the growth of a broad spectrum of temperate and virulent P. aeruginosa bacteriophages as well as that of some P. putida bacteriophages.
TI  - Analysis of the vegetative replication origin of broad-host-range plasmid RK2 by  transposon mutagenesis.
AB  - A range of Tn1723 transposon mutants of the oriV region of broad-host-range plasmid RK2 have been isolated, and the internal EcoRI fragment of the transposon has been deleted from each to reduce the insertion size from 9.6 kb (Tn1723) to 35 bp (delta Tn1723). Sequencing from the delta Tn1723-derived EcoRI site has allowed the precise mapping of these insertions to various points dispersed through the origin region. Using these mutants we have determined which regions of oriV RK2 are of functional importance to plasmid establishment following transformation of the host species Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and P. aeruginosa. Insertions into an A/T-rich region, and a region containing five direct repeat sequences prevented successful transformation of each host species tested, but the continuity of sequences adjacent to the five repeats were essential only in E. coli and P. putida. The establishment and maintenance in E. coli of a mini-RK2 replicon was found to be inhibited by transcription from an inducible promoter positioned to read into oriV RK2 against the direction of replication. Assays of transcription emerging from Tn1723 demonstrated significant levels from one end of the transposon only. Four mutants with insertions downstream of oriV RK2 were unable to become established in E. coli, and contained Tn1723 in the orientation which would supply transcription toward the oriV RK2 region. These results demonstrate both that the sequence requirements for oriV RK2 function differ between host bacterial species, and that origin function may be further influenced by the genetic environment in which it lies.
TI  - Resolution of branched-chain oxo acid dehydrogenase complex of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO.
AB  - Branched-chain oxo acid dehydrogenase was purified from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO with the objective of resolving the complex into its subunits. The purified complex consisted of four proteins, of Mr 36,000, 42,000, 49,000 and 50,000. The complex was resolved by heat treatment into the 49,000 and 50,000-Mr proteins, which were separated by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose. The 49,000-Mr protein was identified as the E2 subunit by its ability to catalyse transacylation with a variety of substrates, with dihydrolipoamide as the acceptor. P. aeruginosa, like P. putida, produces two lipoamide dehydrogenases. One, the 50,000-Mr protein, was identified as the specific E3 subunit of branched-chain oxo acid dehydrogenase and had many properties in common with the lipoamide dehydrogenase LPD-val of P. putida. The second lipoamide dehydrogenase had Mr 54,000 and corresponded to the lipoamide dehydrogenase LPD-glc of P. putida. Fragments of C-terminal CNBr peptides of LPD-val from P. putida and P. aeruginosa corresponded closely, with only two amino acid differences over 31 amino acids. A corresponding fragment at the C-terminal end of lipoamide dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli also showed extensive homology. All three peptides had a common segment of eight amino acids, with the sequence TIHAHPTL. This homology was not evident in any other flavoproteins in the Dayhoff data base which suggests that this sequence might be characteristic of lipoamide dehydrogenase.
TI  - [In vitro bacteriostatic activity of piperacillin sodium against Pseudomonas].
AB  - One hundred and twenty-two strains of Pseudomonas isolated from diverse pathological processes were typified. In vitro activity of Piperacillin (antibiogram and MIC) was studied and compared with another two semisynthetic penicillins, Carbenicillin and Mezlocillin, and two aminoglycosides, Amikacin and Gentamicin. The strains isolated corresponded to: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (116), Pseudomonas cepacia (3), Pseudomonas fluorescens (1) and Pseudomonas putida (1). It was found that 110 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one Pseudomonas cepacia and one Pseudomonas fluorescens were susceptible to Piperacillin. The susceptibility to this drug was quite higher than to the other penicillins tested. The MIC50 and MIC90 of Piperacillin were lower than those of semisynthetic penicillins and the minimum susceptibility value. In comparison with aminoglycosides it was found that, although Amikacin and Gentamicin did not reach the minimum value, Piperacillin exhibited higher MICs.
TI  - Utilization of pyrimidines and pyrimidine analogues by fluorescent pseudomonads.
AB  - The fluorescent pseudomonads Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas aureofaciens and Pseudomonas putida were examined for their ability to utilize pyrimidines and pyrimidine analogues. Both P. aeruginosa and P. aureofaciens grew upon dihydrouracil, dihydrothymine, uridine and cytidine as either a sole nitrogen or carbon source while uracil, thymine and cytosine served only as sole nitrogen sources for both pseudomonads. The only difference between the observed growth of P. aeruginosa and P. aureofaciens on pyrimidines was that deoxycytidine sustained the growth of P. aeruginosa as a nitrogen source. With respect to P. putida, uracil, cytosine and cytidine were found to be nitrogen sources while dihydrothymine, uridine and cytidine served as carbon sources. The fluorescent pseudomonads investigated had fourteen nutritional characteristics which were determined in common for the pyrimidines screened. All the fluorescent pseudomonads were sensitive to a low concentration of 5-fluorouracil. Inhibition by 5-fluorouridine of P. aureofaciens growth was observed at a low concentration while a high concentration of this analogue was required to halt P. putida growth. Neither P. aureofaciens nor P. putida could grow in the presence of a high concentration of 5-fluorocytosine. Only P. aureofaciens growth was noted to be inhibited by a high concentration of 6-azauracil.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis of the phosphomannose isomerase gene (pmi) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and comparison with the corresponding Escherichia coli gene manA.
AB  - Phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) has been proposed to catalyze the first step of the alginic acid biosynthetic pathway in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The nucleotide sequence of the P. aeruginosa pmi gene contained on a 2.0-kb BamHI-SstI DNA fragment has been determined. The gene was defined by the start and stop codons and by in vitro disruption of an open reading frame of 1440 bp corresponding to a polypeptide product with a predicted Mr of 52 860. This polypeptide displayed an apparent Mr of approx. 56 000 upon electrophoresis of a maxicell extract on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The codon utilization of the pmi gene was distinct in the wobble base preference and influenced by the high G + C content (66 mol%) of the P. aeruginosa DNA. Computer assisted matching analysis failed to demonstrate any significant homology at the nucleotide level between the P. aeruginosa pmi and Escherichia coli manA (pmi) genes. However, sequences homologous to the P. aeruginosa pmi gene were found in other Pseudomonas species, such as P. putida and P. mendocina, and in Azotobacter vinelandii, all capable of producing alginic acid.
TI  - [Formaldehyde resistance to gram-negative aerobic rods from municipal sewage water].
AB  - In a municipal sewage works, a total of 30 sewage samples (19 from the inlet and  11 from the outlet of the sewage works) were analyzed for the quantitative and orientative qualitative content of microorganisms. With an incidence peak of the total bacterial count of greater than or equal to 1 X 10(6) cfu/ml in the inlet, both samples showed bacterial contents of 1 to 9 X 10(5) cfu/ml with use of MC agar and Endo agar. Fuchsin glistening colonies as well as the total bacterial counts on Sabouraud agar and Leifson agar as well as on kanamycin-esculin agar showed frequency peaks which were one power of ten lower. For pathogenic staphylococci, a distribution below the limit of detection (down to 9 X 10(3) cfu/ml) was found, and in a single case in the region of 10(4) cfu/ml. As a rule, the samples drawn from the outlet of the municipal sewage works showed values which were one power of ten lower than in the inlet. With admixture of formaldehyde in bacteriostatically active concentrations, colonies could still be cultured to a small extent with a final concentration of 0.03 weight % HCHO in the inlet, whereas values were below the limit of detection in all outlet samples. The differentiated Gram-negative aerobic rods were mainly representatives of the species Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. In a modified quantitative suspension trial, only occasional Gram-negative rods in the inlet samples survived 30 min exposure to 0.5 weight % HCHO. In comparison, the results of the outlet samples showed a very much lower resistance to formaldehyde. The 11 strains isolated under these conditions could be classified under six species, including four Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. Gram-negative rods which had previously tolerated a concentration of 0.12 weight % formaldehyde in the bacteriostasis revealed a raised resistance to formaldehyde only to an inappreciable extent under the conditions of the qualitative suspension trial. Overall, enhancements of resistance to formaldehyde such as we observed in isolates from hospital sewage could not be detected in bacterial strains isolated from the inlet or outlet of a municipal sewage works. The investigations carried out thus do not indicate that a quantitatively significant increase or a persistence of the resistance to formaldehyde is to be expected outside the actual hospital environment.
TI  - [Expression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage transposons in Pseudomonas putida PpG1 cells. II. Zygotic induction--a necessary condition for the formation of defective lysogens].
AB  - The transfer of hybrid plasmid RP4::PT (where PT is the genome of a transposable  phage specific for Pseudomonas aeruginosa) into recipient cells of P. putida strain PpG1 occurs with the same frequency as into P. aeruginosa, the homologous host for PT. Approximately 1/3 of all PpG1 exconjugants carrying RP4 markers lost the capability to produce viable PT phage. In contrast, in a cross with homologous recipient P. aeruginosa all exconjugant clones contained nondefective prophages in the hybrid plasmids. Zygotic induction is an obligatory condition for detection of PpG1 exconjugants with defective phages. The defective prophages in RP4::PT hybrid plasmids have deletions of different size; the other carry mutations indistinguishable from point mutations in an essential phage gene. Some of deletions also cover plasmid genes. At least some of the defective prophages, including deleted ones, have arisen in the recipient cells of P. putida after transfer of the hybrid plasmid.
TI  - [Hybrid plasmid pBS251 containing genes for n-alkane degradation].
AB  - The strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa BS316 utilizing H-alkanes of the C6-C12 series (Alk+) harbours the 96 Md plasmid pBS250. The use of plasmid RP4 to mobilize Alk+ markers in conjugal transfer to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida has resulted in isolation of transconjugants resistant to antibiotics (due to genes coded by plasmid RP4) and capable of growth on H-alkanes. A transconjugant from this series harbours plasmid pBS251, a derivative of plasmid RP4 containing the genes for octane and octanol catabolism. A fragment of DNA inserted into RP4 has a mol mass 3.8 Md, possesses two restriction sites for EcoRI, one site for PstI, is not restricted by SmaI and BamHI restriction endonucleases, and is localized in the region 4.5-5.7 Md on the physical map of plasmid RP4.
TI  - Regions of broad-host-range plasmid RK2 involved in replication and stable maintenance in nine species of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The replication and maintenance properties of the broad-host-range plasmid RK2 and its derivatives were examined in nine gram-negative bacterial species. Two regions of RK2, the origin of replication (oriV) and a segment that encodes for a replication protein (trfA delta kilD, designated trfA*), are sufficient for replication in all nine species tested. However, stable maintenance of this minimal replicon (less than 0.3% loss per generation under nonselection conditions) is observed only in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, and Azotobacter vinelandii. Maintenance of this minimal replicon is unstable in Rhizobium meliloti, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Caulobacter crescentus, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides. A maintenance function has been localized to a 3.1-kilobase (kb) region of RK2 encoding three previously described functions: korA (trfB korB1 korD), incP1-(II), and korB. The 3.1-kb maintenance region can increase or decrease the stability of maintenance of RK2 derivatives dependent on the host species and the presence or absence of the RK2 origin of conjugal transfer (oriT). In the case of A. calcoaceticus, stable maintenance requires an RK2 segment that includes the promoter and the kilD (kilB1) functions of the trfA operon in addition to the 3.1-kb maintenance region. The broad-host-range maintenance requirements of plasmid RK2, therefore, are encoded by multiple functions, and the requirement for one or more of these functions varies among gram-negative bacterial species.
TI  - [Expression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa transposable phages in Pseudomonas putida cells. I. The establishment of a lysogenic state and the effectiveness of lytic development].
AB  - Expression of transposable phages (TP) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the cells of  P. putida was studied. The high efficiency of phage lytic development was shown both as a consequence of zygotic induction after transfer of the RP4::TPc+ plasmid into nonlysogenic recipients, and as a result of heat induction of lysogens PpG1 (D3112cts15). The high phage yield (20-25 particles of D3112cts phage per one cell of P. putida) is an evidence for a high level of transposition in the cells of this bacterial species. Plasmids RP4::TP are transferred into cells of PpG1 and PAO1 with similar frequency. However, the efficiency of establishment of the lysogenic state is lower in PpG1. Transposable phages of P. aeruginosa can integrate into the chromosome of PpG1 producing stable inducible lysogens. The presence of RP4 in the P. putida cells is not necessary for expression of transposable phages. The transposable phage D3112cts15 can be used in experiments of interspecies transduction of plasmids and chromosomal genes.
TI  - Formation of Filaments by Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - When Pseudomonas putida 40 was grown on a variety of liquid media in which oxygen became a limiting factor during growth, the latter stages of growth involved the elongation of cells without septation, which can result in the complete filamentation of the culture (up to several hundred micrometers long). The filaments appeared to consist of a chain of protoplasts within a common sacculus. Later these filaments were capable of a rapid fragmentation by septation to give a population of ordinary rods with a corresponding increase in the number of viable particles but no appreciable change in total bacterial mass. Filamentation did not occur if slow growth rates were maintained by restriction of oxygen availability from the beginning of growth. In complex media filaments were not formed during growth on 1% peptone alone, but the addition of 0.1 M phosphate or 6.6 x 10 M EDTA induced extensive filamentation that was reversed by the addition of 6.6 x 10 M Mg. In minimal media a much higher Mg concentration than that required for active growth or present in the complex media was usually required for filamentation. A very narrow range of Mg concentration promoted filamentation, and this optimum differed markedly depending on the carbon source used. Other medium variations which influenced the level of filamentation are reported. We found that most strains of P. putida (including the neotype strain) and P. fluorescens gave filaments under the conditions developed with strain 40, whereas several strains of P. aeruginosa failed to give filaments on the same media.
TI  - Cloning of genes specifying carbohydrate catabolism in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - A 6.0-kilobase EcoRI fragment of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO chromosome containing a cluster of genes specifying carbohydrate catabolism was cloned into the multicopy plasmid pRO1769. The vector contains a unique EcoRI site for cloning within a streptomycin resistance determinant and a selectable gene encoding gentamicin resistance. Mutants of P. aeruginosa PAO transformed with the chimeric plasmid pRO1816 regained the ability to grow on glucose, and the following deficiencies in enzyme or transport activities corresponding to the specific mutations were complemented: glcT1, glucose transport and periplasmic glucose-binding protein; glcK1, glucokinase; and edd-1, 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase. Two other carbohydrate catabolic markers that are cotransducible with glcT1 and edd-1 were not complemented by plasmid pRO1816: zwf-1, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; and eda-9001, 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase. However, all five of these normally inducible activities were expressed at markedly elevated basal levels when transformed cells of prototrophic strain PAO1 were grown without carbohydrate inducer. Vector plasmid pRO1769 had no effect on the expression of these activities in transformed mutant or wild-type cells. Thus, the chromosomal insert in pRO1816 contains the edd and glcK structural genes, at least one gene (glcT) that is essential for expression of the glucose active transport system, and other loci that regulate the expression of the five clustered carbohydrate catabolic genes. The insert in pRO1816 also complemented the edd-1 mutation in a glucose-negative Pseudomonas putida mutant but not the eda-1 defect in another mutant. Moreover, pRO1816 caused the expression of high specific activities of glucokinase, an enzyme that is naturally lacking in these strains of Pseudomonas putida.
TI  - SAL-TOL in vivo recombinant plasmid pKF439.
AB  - SAL-TOL in vivo recombinant plasmid pKF439 was characterized in a strain from a mixed culture of bacteria harboring various degradative plasmids. Analysis of the gene organization of pKF439 revealed that the 57-kilobase TOL fragment, including the 40-kilobase TOL metabolic region, was inserted into the complete SAL replicon at the position of SmaI-C within XhoI-B of SAL. The molecular size of pKF439 was calculated to be 138 kilobases. pKF439 could be transferred to Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at high frequency, and the transconjugants gained the ability to grow with m-xylene, m-toluate, and salicylate as the sole carbon source.
TI  - [Effective method of transduction with virulent phage pf16 using specific mutants of Pseudomonas putida PpG1].
AB  - A procedure of simple selection of Pseudomonas putida PpG1 mutants is described.  The mutants can be used for transduction with virulent pf16 phage, giving reliable results. The frequency of transduction of chromosomal markers ilv and trp was 10(-6). Also, transduction of plasmid RP4 with phage pf16 was shown with the frequency of 10(-7).
TI  - [Resistance to organic tin compounds mediated by plasmids of bacteria of Pseudomonas genus].
AB  - Resistance to organic tin compounds of P. aeruginosa and E. coli carrying antibiotic resistance plasmids and to P. putida containing biodegradation plasmids was studied. It was shown that 5 resistance plasmids and the biodegradation CAM plasmid of Pseudomonas increased 3-4 times the strain resistance to triethylstannylsuccinylimide and triethylstannylmaleinimide. All these plasmids belong to the P-2 incompatibility group and also determine the bacterial resistance to potassium tellurite. Isolation and investigation of the mutant plasmids loosing simultaneously the capacity for determination of resistance to potassium tellurite and organic tin compounds suggest that resistance to these compounds in the investigated plasmids is determined by the same genetic system.
TI  - Chromosomal map of Pseudomonas putida PPN, and a comparison of gene order with the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO chromosomal map.
AB  - The generalized transducing phage Pf16h2 has been used to confirm linkage relationships of chromosomal markers of Pseudomonas putida previously determined from their time-of-entry in Hfr crosses, and to map new auxotrophic mutations. By means of spot matings using Hfr donors of known origin of transfer, catabolic markers forming part of a closely linked group of operons referred to as a superoperonic cluster have been shown to be chromosomally located and their map positions determined. R-prime-mediated interspecific complementation has been used to equate functionally 21 auxotrophic loci in P. putida and P. aeruginosa, and the distribution of these loci on the two genetic maps has been compared. While both maps reveal that auxotrophic markers are largely restricted to about 40% of the chromosome and that auxotrophic markers of similar phenotype are not clustered, there is evidence of at least seven chromosomal rearrangements since divergence from a presumed common ancestor.
TI  - Characterization of two surface-localized antigenic sites on porin protein F of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - A rapid colony immunoblot screening procedure was used to demonstrate the surface localization of porin protein F on bacterial colonies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. By this method, we demonstrated that protein F was accessible to four different specific monoclonal antibodies in a wide variety of both mucoid and nonmucoid P. aeruginosa strains. Controls were performed to demonstrate that, using this procedure, only surface-exposed epitopes bound monoclonal antibodies and that nonspecific binding of monoclonal antibodies either to cells lacking protein F or to mucoid exopolysaccharide did not occur. Monoclonal antibodies MA4-4, MA2-10, and MA4-10, specific for protein F, also interacted with colonies of Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas syringae, whereas the protein F specific monoclonal antibody MA5-8 interacted only with P. aeruginosa strains. Using the above-named monoclonal antibodies, we investigated the antigenic structure of protein F. Monoclonal antibodies MA4-4, MA2-10, and MA4-10 bound to 29-31 kilodalton proteolytic fragments produced after papain or trypsin digestion of purified protein F or of protein F in outer membranes or intact cells. Antibody MA5-8 did not interact with proteolytically digested protein F but did interact with two of the six fragments produced after partial cyanogen bromide cleavage of protein F. Antibodies MA4-4, MA2-10, and MA4-10 did not interact with protein F after reduction of its internal disulphide bonds with 2-mercaptoethanol; in contrast, the reactivity of MA5-8 was unaffected. This data suggests that there are at least two distinct highly conserved surface epitopes on porin protein F.
TI  - Occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative nonfermentative bacilli in cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  - Isolation of nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli (other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa) from respiratory tract cultures of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients has increased in recent years. Species recovered include Pseudomonas cepacia, P. maltophilia, P. fluorescens/putida, P. alcaligenes, P. pseudoalcaligenes, P. stutzeri, Acinetobacter spp., Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Flavobacterium spp., and CDC groups IVe and Ve. Although colonization with most of these organisms is sporadic, P. cepacia (and to a lesser extent, P. maltophilia) is usually isolated consistently, and can be associated with significant clinical deterioration. Occurrence of P. cepacia in CF respiratory tract cultures obtained close to the time of death rose nearly ten-fold from 1979 to 1982. Strains representing all nonfermentative gram-negative species encountered were assayed for susceptibility to 17 newer antimicrobial agents. Ceftazidime, n-formimidoyl thienamycin, and aztreonam were most active; cefsulodin, ceforanide, and ceftriaxone were not active against these isolates.
TI  - Volatiles of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and related species by automated headspace concentration--gas chromatography.
AB  - The volatile metabolites of three strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one strain each of Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Pseudomonas putida were analyzed using an automated headspace concentrator incorporating a gas chromatograph. The procedure does not require sample preparation and automates the entire analytical sequence to yield reproducible profiles of volatile constituents. Gas chromatographic profiles of the volatile metabolites of each species were obtained using a 20-min concentration period and two fused silica capillary columns of different polarities. The production of headspace metabolites from trypticase soy broth was studied in relationship to culture incubation time and initial cell concentration. The volatiles identified after 24 h incubation consisted of 1-butanol, isopentanol, toluene, 1-undecene, 2-butanone, 2-heptanone, 2-nonanone, and 2-undecanone. Sufficient amounts of specific metabolites were produced after 5 h incubation to provide information of possible diagnostic value. In particular, all P. aeruginosa strains produced a distinctive series of 1-undecene and methyl ketones after 5 h incubation of media inoculated to provide 2 X 10(6) cells/mL. The results indicate that when growth and analytical conditions are held constant, P. aeruginosa and related species produce characteristic profiles of headspace metabolites. Since conventional bacteriological tests require 24 h or more for the identification of these pseudomonads, automated volatile analysis could provide an alternative means for the rapid detection of these bacteria.
TI  - Anti-pseudomonal activity of HR 810.
AB  - The anti-pseudomonal activity of HR 810, a new 2-aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was compared to that of carbenicillin, azlocillin and cefsulodin against 187 non-fermenters. HR 810 was the best agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus with an MIC50 less than or equal to 4 mg/l and an MIC90 less than or equal to 16 mg/l. It was as effective as azlocillin against Pseudomonas stutzeri and Pseudomonas mendocina, with an MIC50 less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and an MIC90 less than or equal to 1 mg/l. It was not active against other species of Pseudomonas or other non-fermenters such as Flavobacterium sp.
TI  - beta-Casomorphin immunoreactive materials in cows' milk incubated with various bacterial species.
AB  - To obtain information about the possible release of beta-casomorphins from beta-casein under in vitro conditions, cows' milk was incubated with 13 strains of Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacterial species isolated from bovine milk. After incubation periods of 1-24 d, milk samples were assayed for beta-casomorphin-4, -5, -6 or -7 immunoreactive materials. In general, no beta-casomorphin immunoreactive material was found in samples incubated with non-caseolytic strains, e.g. Pseudomonas putida or Streptococcus faecalis subsp. faecalis; however, high levels were found in several samples incubated with caseolytic strains, e.g. Ps. aeruginosa or Bacillus cereus. When such materials were present, the amounts of beta-casomorphin-4, -6 or -7 greatly exceeded beta-casomorphin-5 immunoreactivity. It was concluded that while some of these materials probably represented authentic beta-casomorphins, others were more likely to be beta-casomorphin precursors.
TI  - Impact of cefotaxime on the fecal flora in children.
AB  - A differential quantitative analysis was used to study the effect of cefotaxime on the fecal flora in 26 hospitalized children ranging from two days to four years of age. Fecal specimens were obtained before, during and after therapy. This study was evaluated in comparison to 41 patients of the same age and from the same environment without antibiotic treatment or signs of infection. The fecal flora of the control group showed qualitative and quantitative stability. Two groups of species were distinguished: a group in which the upper limit was less than or equal to 10(7) bacteria/g of stool (Klebsiella, Enterobacter, other enterobacteria, Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas) and a group with less than or equal to 10(10) bacteria/g of stool (anaerobes, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus D). This stability of the control group of subjects allowed us to interpret the variations of microbial concentrations during and after cefotaxime treatment. In previous studies, we showed in the newborn a substantial risk of septicemia of intestinal origin when overgrowth occurred, especially with Klebsiella. With cefotaxime there was a decrease or a disappearance in 65% of E. coli and a slight decrease of Klebsiella and Enterobacter. This fact was of great interest in the treatment of endogenous secondary septicemia. We observed an appearance of Pseudomonas (nine Pseudomonas aeruginosa, two Pseudomonas putida, one Pseudomonas fluorescens) in 12 cases among the 26 children treated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Cloning vectors derived from the Pseudomonas plasmid pVS1.
AB  - The Pseudomonas plasmid pVS1, which has about seven copies, was reduced to a minimal replicon and used to construct stable gene-cloning vehicles. The host for all cloning experiments was P. aeruginosa strain PAO. Two nonmobilizable plasmids, pME260 and pME290, and one RP1-mobilizable plasmid, pME285, were constructed. The vectors pME260 (6.3 kb) and pME290 (6.8 kb) carry the Tn801 bla gene specifying carbenicillin (Cb) resistance, a good selective marker in Pseudomonas, and the Tn903 aph gene encoding kanamycin (Km) resistance, with useful restriction sites for insertional inactivation. The Mob+ vector pME285 (10.6 kb) carries the aph gene and the Tn501-derived merRTCA genes coding for mercuric ion resistance, another good selective marker in Pseudomonas. The hypothetical merD gene, which may follow the merA gene in Tn501 but is absent from pME285, appeared to be dispensable for mercuric ion resistance in P. aeruginosa. The Mob- vector pME290 could be introduced by transformation and maintained in strains of P. aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, P. putida, P. acidovorans, P. stutzeri, P. mendocina, P. cepacia, and P. syringae. The plasmid was compatible with IncP-1 and IncP-4 replicons.
TI  - Shuttle vector for Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - A hybrid plasmid capable of replication in 2 different genera, Escherichia and Pseudomonas, was constructed. This plasmid DNA can be used as a cloning vector in E. coli and pseudomonades cells. The described hybrid plasmid pLD411 has been constructed on the basis of 2 small E. coli vector R-plasmids used in our laboratory and cryptic plasmid pWW2 or P. putida MT1. Plasmid pLD411 DNA was mapped with restrictases; its biological activity in transformations of different bacterial strains was studied, and the characteristics of transformed cells were also described.
TI  - Discriminant analysis of volatile fatty acids produced in culture medium: a novel approach to the identification of Pseudomonas species.
AB  - The volatile fatty acids produced in culture medium by 357 Pseudomonas strains belonging to eight species were determined quantitatively by GLC. The resultant chromatograms were submitted to discriminant analysis. Stable discriminant functions were computed and included in a computerized identification system which also involved some distinctive volatile fatty acids regarded as two-state qualitative characters (presence or absence characters). Using a test group of 249 strains belonging to the studied species, more than 89% of the identifications made by this system agreed with those made by conventional biochemical methods despite the relatively poor differentiation between P. putida and P. fluorescens. When the individual species within the matrices were weighted with prior probabilities reflecting results given by two simple biochemical tests, 96% of the 249 strains were correctly identified.
TI  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa mutants affected in anaerobic growth on arginine: evidence for a four-gene cluster encoding the arginine deiminase pathway.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO was able to grow in the absence of exogenous terminal  electron acceptors, provided that the medium contained 30 to 40 mM L-arginine and 0.4% yeast extract. Under strictly anaerobic conditions (O2 at less than 1 ppm), growth could be measured as an increase in protein and proceeded in a non-exponential way; arginine was largely converted to ornithine but not entirely consumed at the end of growth. In the GasPak anaerobic jar (Becton Dickinson and Co.), the wild-type strain PAO1 grew on arginine-yeast extract medium in 3 to 5 days; mutants could be isolated that were unable to grow under these conditions. All mutants (except one) were defective in at least one of the three enzymes of the arginine deiminase pathway (arcA, arcB, and arcC mutants) or in a novel function that might be involved in anaerobic arginine uptake (arcD mutants). The mutations arcA (arginine deiminase), arcB (catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase), arcC (carbamate kinase), and arcD were highly cotransducible and mapped in the 17-min chromosome region. Some mutations in the arc cluster led to low, noninducible levels of all three arginine deiminase pathway enzymes and thus may affect control elements required for induction of the postulated arc operon. Two fluorescent pseudomonads (P. putida and P. fluorescens) and P. mendocina, as well as one PAO mutant, possessed an inducible arginine deiminase pathway and yet were unable to grow fermentatively on arginine. The ability to use arginine-derived ATP for growth may provide P. aeruginosa with a selective advantage when oxygen and nitrate are scarce.
TI  - Collaborative evaluation of the Abbott Avantage system for identification of frequently isolated nonfermentative or oxidase-positive gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - The capability of the Abbott Avantage system to identify 10 species of commonly isolated glucose nonfermentative or oxidase-positive gram-negative bacilli in a 5-h test period was evaluated in a collaborative study. The Avantage nonenteric data base uses 20 biochemical test reactions performed in an expanded Abbott bacterial identification cartridge plus the results of a manual oxidase test. The species included in the Avantage data base are Acinetobacter anitratus, Acinetobacter Iwoffi, Aeromonas hydrophila, Flavobacterium meningosepticum-IIb group, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas fluorescens-putida group, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Pasteurella multocida, and Plesiomonas shigelloides. The collaborative study included the testing of 200 coded challenge strains in all three laboratories and the subsequent testing of an additional group of 100 to 200 clinical isolates recovered independently by each laboratory. Reference identifications for all isolates were determined by conventional biochemical test reactions. The overall accuracy of identification of the coded challenge strains for the three laboratories was 97%, whereas 95% of 437 clinical isolates and selected stock cultures of clinical derivation were identified correctly.
TI  - [Phosphate and glucose accumulation by Pseudomonas cultures in relation to their  arsenic resistance].
AB  - The effect of arsenite and arsenate on 14C-glucose and 32-P-phosphate transport was studied in the cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 561 sensitive to arsenite and in the cells of Pseudomonas putida 18 oxidizing arsenite and resistant to arsenic. Transport and accumulation of phosphate and glucose were inhibited in the presence of arsenite in the cells of P. aeruginosa 561 whereas arsenate inhibited only phosphate accumulation. Arsenite and arsenate had hardly any effect at the initial transport rate and on the overall accumulation of phosphate and glucose in the cells of P. putida 18. The resistance to arsenite is supposed to be caused by selective impermeability of the cellular membranes to arsenite and arsenate.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the promoter region of the xylDEGF operon on TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The transcription initiation site of the xylDEGF operon on the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 was determined in P. putida and in Escherichia coli by S1 nuclease and reverse transcriptase mapping. The induced synthesis of mRNA started at the same start point in both P. putida and E. coli, although the amount of mRNA in E. coli cells was less than that in P. putida. The nucleotide sequence of the region surrounding the start point was also determined. The ribosome-binding site (RBS) complementary to the 3' end of the 16S rRNA of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E. coli preceded the predicted start codon for the xylD gene. The consensus nucleotide sequence for E. coli promoters was not found in the region preceding the transcription start point. On the other hand, the sequences of the "-10" and the "-35" regions of the xylDEGF operon revealed some homology with the respective, previously determined sequences of the xylABC operon of the TOL plasmid.
TI  - Differences between lipopolysaccharide compositions of plant pathogenic and saprophytic pseudomonas species.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were obtained by washing cells of plant pathogenic and  saprophytic Pseudomonas species with saline (fraction 1) and then with saline-EDTA (fraction 2). The cells subsequently were extracted with phenol to yield a third aqueous preparation (fraction 3). Each fraction type contained the LPS components, lipid A, heptose, 2-keto-3-deoxy sugar, and neutral and amino sugars. The neutral sugar compositions of fractions 1, 2, and 3, although similar within a species, differed between the Pseudomonas species. The LPS of two pathovars (pv.) of Pseudomonas syringae had glucose and rhamnose as major components: 13 (+/-3)% glucose and 87 (+/-3)% rhamnose for P. syringae pv. pisi and 18 (+/-5)% glucose and 76 (+/-2)% rhamnose for P. syringae pv. syringae. Fucose was present in addition to glucose and rhamnose for P. syringae pv. phaseolicola (68 [+/-8]% rhamnose, 14 [+/-1]% fucose, and 14 [+/-5]% glucose) and P. syringae pv. tabaci (24 [+/-2]% rhamnose, 54 [+/-3]% fucose, and 17 [+/-1]% glucose). The LPS from different races of P. syringae pv. pisi and P. syringae pv. phaseolicola could not be distinguished by neutral sugar composition. Three saprophytic species, P. aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, and P. putida, also produced LPS which had different proportions of rhamnose, fucose, and glucose. The LPS from three isolates of P. putida were distinct in possessing a high proportion of amino sugar and containing glucose as the major neutral sugar component (86 to 100%). The LPS fractions from plant pathogenic and saprophytic Pseudomonas species did not elicit browning or phytoalexin production in treated dark red kidney bean cotyledons or red Mexican bean leaves. Rather, chlorosis of the LPS-treated leaf tissue was observed.
TI  - [Introduction of the hybrid plasmid RP4::D3112 into Pseudomonas putida cells requires the presence of specific mutation in the phage genome].
AB  - The wild type of D3112, a transposable phage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa can not be introduced as a portion of the hybrid plasmid RP4::D3112 into Pseudomonas putida cells. It is only possible when phage D3112 carries mutations designated lpc (lethal for P. putida and Escherichia coli). Analysis of heteroduplex molecules between DNAs of phages D3112w+ and D3112lpc demonstrated the absence of nonhomology regions, which suggests that lpc is a point mutation. The lpc2 mutation was located within the interval 20-29.9 kb of the phage genome.
TI  - [Effect of plasmids from various incompatibility groups on the development of bacteriophages specific to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida].
AB  - The aim of this work was to study the effect of plasmids belonging to different incompatibility groups on the growth of bacteriophages in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida strains. The growth of bacteriophages was shown to be limited most often due to the presence in cells of plasmids belonging to the P-2 incompatibility group. Plasmids of the Inc P-2 group differed from one another in the spectrum of bacteriophages whose growth they limited. Phages whose growth was suppressed in strains containing plasmids of the P-5, P-9 or P-10 incompatibility groups were found. Some plasmids showed no specific interaction with bacteriophages. The plasmids investigated differed in the studied trait in P. aeruginosa and P. putida cells. In contrast to P. aeruginosa PAO, P. putida PpGI plasmid containing cells did not maintain the growth of donor-specific bacteriophages and, to a lesser degree, limited the growth of phages specific for P. putida PpGI.
TI  - Characterization of pseudomonads isolated from diseased fleece.
AB  - A total of 59 Pseudomonas isolates was obtained from 11 samples of diseased fleece taken from live sheep. All but four of the isolates could be assigned to one of nine Pseudomonas species, of which P. aeruginosa, P. alcaligenes, P. mendocina , and P. putida were the most common. P. aeruginosa was found in four of the fleece samples and, when present, appeared to predominate. Although several of the isolates of P. aeruginosa lacked the ability to produce pyocyanin (and some produced neither pyocyanin nor fluorescein), nearly all produced several virulence factors. Of the other pseudomonads, many produced proteinase, esterase, and catalase, several were able to grow at 42 degrees C and reduce nitrate, and some also produced lipase and hemolysin and, like P. aeruginosa, might serve to initiate (or sustain) the dermatitis frequently associated with fleece rot in sheep.
TI  - Genetic and molecular characterization of the Pseudomonas plasmid pVS1.
AB  - A restriction map of the 30-kb nonconjugative Pseudomonas plasmid pVS1 was constructed. Derivatives of pVS1 obtained in vitro by successive deletions were used to localize on the physical map the determinant for resistance to mercuric ions (carried by transposon Tn501), the gene(s) encoding sulfonamide resistance, a 1.6-kb region affecting plasmid stability and establishment in P. fluorescens ATCC 13525, and a segment required for mobilization of pVS1 by plasmid RP1. The sulfonamide resistance determinant of pVS1 appeared to be closely related to that of transposon Tn21. A mini-pVS1 replicon, pME259, consisting of an essential 1.55-kb segment (designated rep and thought to carry the origin of replication) and a mercury resistance determinant was able to replicate P. aeruginosa PAO but selective pressure was needed for plasmid maintenance. The copy number of pVS1 derivatives was estimated to be 6-8 per chromosome equivalent. Plasmids possessing the essential rep segment plus the adjacent stability region could be established in strains of P. aeruginosa, P. putida, P. fluorescens, P. acidovorans, P. cepacia, P. mendocina, P. stutzeri, P. syringae, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and Rhizobium leguminosarum.
TI  - [Comparative activity of azlocillin on Pseudomonas species excluding Pseudomonas  aeruginosa].
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of three acylureidopenicillins (azlocillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin) and three third generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, cefoperazone, cefsulodin) against 249 randomized strains of Pseudomonas spp. representing 10 species other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were determined by the agar dilution method in Mueller-Hinton agar and compared by parametric statistical tests. Fresh clinical and environmental hospital isolates belonged to the following species: P. fluorescens (35), P. putida (37), P. stutzeri (17), P. mendocina (4), P. cepacia (37), P. pickettii (22), P. acidovorans (36), P. diminuta (5), P. paucimobilis (23), P. maltophilia (37). Azlocillin inhibited over 88% of Pseudomonas spp at 64 mg/l or less. This good antipseudomonal activity in vitro was comparable to those of piperacillin and cefotaxime with a minimal inhibitory concentrations 50 value of 8 mg/l. Against these Pseudomonas spp, the ranking order of activity was azlocillin = piperacillin = cefotaxime greater than cefoperazone greater than mezlocillin greater than cefsulodin. Like piperacillin or cefotaxime, azlocillin, was effective against ticarcillin--and aminoglycoside--resistant Pseudomonas spp. Against P. maltophilia and P. cepacia, the two Pseudomonas spp other than P. aeruginosa that are important pathogens in opportunistic infections and in their vast majority are resistant to amino glycosides, azlocillin was significantly active. Only in the case of P. maltophilia, cefoperazone had a lower minimal inhibitory concentrations 50 (8 mg/l vs. 32 mg/l).
TI  - Nucleotide sequence surrounding transcription initiation site of xylABC operon on TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The xylABC operon on the TOL plasmid directs the synthesis of enzymes for conversion of toluene to benzoate and is positively controlled by the regulatory gene xylR. In the study here the nucleotide sequence was determined for the regulatory region of this operon. The in vivo transcription initiation site of the operon was determined by S1 nuclease and reverse transcriptase mapping. RNA was prepared from m-methylbenzyl alcohol-induced cells of Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli carrying pTN2, a derivative of the TOL plasmid containing the structural and regulatory genes of the entire toluene-degrading pathway. The amount of E. coli mRNA was estimated to be only 10% of that of P. putida mRNA. Consensus sequences of the -10 region (Pribnow box) and the -35 region (RNA polymerase recognition site) in E. coli genes were not found in the region preceding the transcription initiation site, whereas a sequence complementary to the 3' end of the 16S rRNA of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E. coli existed in front of the predicted start codon of the xylA gene. These results explain the inefficient expression of TOL genes in E. coli.
TI  - Use of ureidopenicillins for selection of plasmid vector transformants in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Broad-host-range plasmids coding for beta-lactamase were successfully selected after transformation of Pseudomonas strains. Transformants of both Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida containing plasmid pRO1614 were isolated in media containing low concentrations of piperacillin. These strains were also susceptible to other ureidopenicillins. Similar selections of transformants with carbenicillin, ampicillin, or ticarcillin required high concentrations of antibiotics and yielded backgrounds of spontaneous resistant mutants.
TI  - Degradation of 3-chlorobenzoate in soil by pseudomonads carrying biodegradative plasmids.
AB  - Degradation of continuously added 3-chlorobenzoate (3-CB) was studied in samples  of chernozem soil. Soil columns were inoculated with Pseudomonas putida growing on 3-CB and carrying the biodegradation plasmid and with Pseudomonas aeruginosa incapable of growth on 3-CB and carrying the inserted biodegradation plasmid pBS 2 determining ortho-cleavage of the aromatic ring. While the 3-CB degradation was observed in both inoculated variants, the native microflora of the soil under study was incapable to degrade 3-CB. Among pseudomonads isolated from inoculated soil at different stages of cultivation and growth on 3-CB, some had the taxonomic features of P. putida as well as those differing in 1-5 characteristics. The study of the activities of the enzymes cleaving the aromatic ring revealed the presence of pyrocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase in the isolated strains only, as estimated by means of benzoate and 3-CB as substrates.
TI  - [Effect of preservation conditions on the diagnostic traits of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens and P. putida].
AB  - After 20 years storage under the lyophylized condition 6 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens and P. putida retained all characters investigated. After storage under sterile vaseline oil for 10 years strains P. aeruginosa and P. putida lost one character, strains P. fluorescens lost 10-13 characters.
TI  - Arginine degradation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa mutants blocked in two arginine catabolic pathways.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa mutants defective in agmatine utilization (agu) were isolated. The genes encoding agmatine deiminase (aguA) and N-carbamoylputrescine amidinohydrolase (aguB) were 98% cotransducible and mapped between gpu and ser-3 in the 30 min region of the chromosome. Constructed agu arc double mutants (blocked in the arginine decarboxylase and arginine deiminase pathways) used arginine efficiently as the sole carbon and nitrogen source. This suggests the existence of a further arginine catabolic pathway in P. aeruginosa. The mapping data of this study confirm that in P. aeruginosa the chromosomal genes with catabolic functions do not show supraoperonic clustering as found in P. putida.
TI  - L-arginine utilization by Pseudomonas species.
AB  - The utilization of arginine was studied in several different Pseudomonas species. The arginine decarboxylase and agmatine deiminase pathways were found to be characteristic of Pseudomonas species of group I as defined by Palleroni et al. (1974). Pseudomonas putida strains had three distinct arginine catabolic pathways initiated by arginine decarboxylase, arginine deiminase and arginine oxidase, respectively. The two former routes were also present in P. fluorescens and P. mendocina and in P. aeruginosa which also used arginine by a further unknown pathway. None of these pathways occurred in P. cepacia strains; agmatine catabolism seemed to follow an unusual route involving guanidinobutyrate as intermediate.
TI  - [Detection of glycosidases in Pseudomonas of the fluorescent group: relation between serotype and glycosidase activities in P. aeruginosa].
AB  - Fluorescent Pseudomonas species (P. aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, P. putida) were tested for the presence of glycosidase activities (alpha-D-glucosidase, beta-D-glucosidase, alpha-D-galactosidase, beta-D-galactosidase, beta-xylosidase, alpha-D-mannosidase, alpha-L-fucosidase, beta-L-fucosidase, beta-D-glucuronidase and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase). Some of the investigated glycosidases were always absent, while N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase was constantly present in all strains; 3 glycosidase activities were observed in association or separately. Serotype O11 of P. aeruginosa was found to be homogeneous with respect to some of those enzymatic activities. Search for beta-D-galactosidase, alpha-D-glucosidase and beta-D-glucosidase may be of diagnostic value in epidemiologic studies of P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Evolution of L-phenylalanine biosynthesis in rRNA homology group I of Pseudomonas.
AB  - Group I pseudomonads exhibit diversity for L-phenylalanine biosynthesis that is a basis for separation of two subgroups. Subgroup Ib (fluorescent species such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, or P. putida) possesses an unregulated overflow pathway to L-phenylalanine, together with a second, regulated pathway. Subgroup Ia (non-fluorescent species such as P. stutzeri, P. mendocina, or P. alcaligenes) possess only the regulated pathway to L-phenylalanine. Thus, subgroup Ia species lack an unregulated isozyme of chorismate mutase and arogenate dehydratase, enzymes which are thought to divert chorismate to L-phenylalanine under conditions of high carbon input into aromatic biosynthesis. A priori the overflow pathway could have been either lost in subgroup Ia or gained in subgroup Ib. Since Group V pseudomonads (mainly Xanthomonas) are known to branch off from the Group I lineage at a deeper phylogenetic level than the point of divergence for subgroups Ia and Ib, the presence of the overflow pathway in Group V pseudomonads reveals that the overflow pathway must have been lost in the evolution of subgroup Ia. All Group I species possess a bifunctional protein (P-protein) which catalyzes both chorismate mutase and prephenate dehydratase reactions. In subgroup Ia species this highly conserved protein must be the sole source of prephenate to be used for tyrosine biosynthesis. Thus, the channeling action of the P-protein whereby chorismate is committed towards L-phenylalanine formation can be negated by selective feedback inhibition exerted by L-phenylalanine upon the prephenate dehydratase component of the P-protein. Diversion of prephenate molecules under the latter conditions towards L-tyrosine comprises a channel-shuttle mechanism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Iron-chelating compounds produced by soil pseudomonads: correlation with fungal growth inhibition.
AB  - Strains of Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas sp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were examined for their ability to grow in the presence of the iron chelator, ethylenediamine-di-(o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid). In vitro fungal inhibition assays showed that the isolates varied in their ability to inhibit the growth of representative fungal plant pathogens. Fungal inhibition in vitro was superior to that of previously reported Pseudomonas sp. Studies with Fusarium oxysporum forma sp. lycopersici and a susceptible tomato cultivar demonstrated that Pseudomonas putida PPU3.1 was able to significantly reduce wilt disease.
TI  - Bu-2470, a new peptide antibiotic complex. I. Production, isolation and properties of Bu-2470 A, B1 and B2.
AB  - A strain of Bacillus circulans produced a complex of basic peptide antibiotics designated Bu-2470, which was found to contain four active components, A, B1, B2a and B2b. Bu-2470 A specifically inhibited various Pseudomonas species including P. aeruginosa, P. maltophilia and P. putida, but otherwise its antibacterial spectrum was limited to certain Gram-negative organisms. Bu-2470 B1 and B2 (B2a + B2b) showed broad antibiotic activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas species. The physicochemical and biological properties of Bu-2470 B1 and B2 are very similar to those of the octapeptin group of antibiotics.
TI  - Expression of the argF gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,  Pseudomonas putida, and Escherichia coli.
AB  - R' plasmids carrying argF genes from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains PAO and PAC were transferred to Pseudomonas putida argF and Escherichia coli argF strains. Expression in P. putida was similar to that in P. aeruginosa and was repressed by exogenous arginine. Expression in E. coli was 2 to 4% of that in P. aeruginosa. Exogenous arginine had no effect, and there were no significant differences between argR' and argR strains of E. coli in this respect.
TI  - Complete nucleotide sequence of the metapyrocatechase gene on the TOI plasmid of  Pseudomonas putida mt-2.
AB  - Metapyrocatechase which catalyzes the oxygenative ring cleavage of catechol to form alpha-hydroxymuconic epsilon-semialdehyde is encoded by the xylE gene on the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida mt-2. We have cloned the xylE region in Escherichia coli and determined the nucleotide sequence of the DNA fragment of 985 base pairs around the gene. The fragment included only one open translational frame of sufficient length to accommodate the enzyme. The predicted amino acid sequence consisted of 307 residues, and its NH2- and COOH-terminal sequences were in perfect agreement with those of the enzyme recently determined (Nakai, C., Hori, K., Kagamiyama, H., Nakazawa, T., and Nozaki, M. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 2916-2922). A mutant plasmid was isolated which did not direct the synthesis of the active enzyme. This plasmid had a DNA region corresponding to the NH2-terminal two-thirds of the polypeptide. From the deduced amino acid sequence, the secondary structure was predicted. Around 10 base pairs upstream from the initiator codon for metapyrocatechase, there was a base sequence which was complementary to the 3'-end of 16 S rRNAs from both E.coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A preferential usage of C- and G-terminated codons was found in the coding region xylE, which contributed to the relatively high G + C content (57%) of this gene.
TI  - Pseudomonas stutzeri and related species undergo natural transformation.
AB  - Cells of Pseudomonas stutzeri are naturally transformed by homologous chromosomal DNA; they do not require chemical treatment to become competent. This capacity to undergo natural transformation was found to be shared by the closely related species P. mendocina, P. alcaligenes, and P. pseudoalcaligenes, but was not detectable in strains of P. aeruginosa, P. perfectomarinus, P. putida, P. fluorescens, or P. syringae. P. stutzeri could be transformed either on plates or in liquid medium. Only double-stranded chromosomal DNA was effective; single-stranded DNA and plasmid DNA were not. DNA fragments larger than 10 kilobase pairs were more effective than smaller fragments. The transformation frequency was proportional to DNA concentration from 1 ng/ml to 1 microgram/ml; higher concentrations were saturating. The maximum frequency, about 10(-4) transformants per recipient cell, was obtained with cells from a culture in the early stationary growth phase. A variety of chromosomal mutations have been transformed, including mutations to auxotrophy and to antibiotic resistance. Other systems for genetic exchange in P. stutzeri have not yet been found; transformation offers a means for the genetic analysis of this metabolically versatile organism.
TI  - [Transformation of Escherichia coli and different species of Pseudomonas by a plasmid DNA isolated from Pseudomonas testosteroni].
AB  - Pseudomonas testosteroni uses testosterone as sole source of carbon. We were able to isolate an extrachromosomal DNA from a strain of Pseudomonas testosteroni and to obtain Pseudomonas putida and aeruginosa and Escherichia coli transformants catabolizing testosterone.
TI  - Susceptibility of 324 nonfermentative gram-negative rods to 6 cephalosporins and  azthreonam.
AB  - Susceptibility of 324 isolates of nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria to cephalothin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, cefsulodin, and azthreonam was determined by agar dilution and disc diffusion techniques. With the exception of Moraxella species, first- and second-generation cephalosporins were minimally active against nonfermenters tested. Cefsulodin and azthreonam were mainly active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In contrast, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone exhibited wider activity spectra. Cefsulodin and ceftazidime were the most active against P. aeruginosa, followed by azthreonam and ceftriaxone. Ceftazidime was the only drug with significant activity against Pseudomonas maltophilia and Pseudomonas fluorescens/Pseudomonas putida, and was also the most active against Pseudomonas cepacia. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Alcaligenes strains were most sensitive to ceftazidime, followed by ceftriaxone and azthreonam. Ceftriaxone was the most active against moraxellas, followed by cefamandole/cefoxitin, ceftazidime, cephalothin, cefsulodin, and azthreonam. Ceftazidime was the most active against uncommonly isolated nonfermenters. Results observed in this study reflect a potential use for ceftazidime in therapy of infections caused by most gram-negative nonfermenters; therapy with cefsulodin and azthreonam in nonfermenter infections should be restricted to those caused by P. aeruginosa, and that with ceftriaxone reserved for non-P. aeruginosa infections.
TI  - Integration of R91-5::Tn501 into the Pseudomonas putida PPN chromosome and genetic circularity of the chromosomal map.
AB  - Derivatives of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa plasmid R91-5, loaded with the transposon Tn501, were transferred to P. putida PPN. Over 90% of exconjugants, which arose at a frequency of ca. 10(-6) per donor cell, exhibited high-frequency (greater than 10(-2) per donor cell) polarized transfer of chromosomal markers. In one instance it was demonstrated by transduction that the plasmid had been inserted into a gene required for serine biosynthesis. The integrated nature of the plasmid in this and other P. putida (R91-5::Tn501) derivatives was supported by the failure to detect covalently closed circular DNA in these strains. The transfer origins of six different Hfr donors have been characterized genetically, and time-of-entry kinetics obtained from interrupted matings have enabled the construction of a circular genetic map 103 min in length and containing 35 markers. The genetic map of P. putida PPN shows significant differences in marker order to that of P. aeruginosa PAO.
TI  - [Expression of the genome of Mu-like phage D3112 specific for Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida cells].
AB  - The behavior of Escherichia coli cells carrying RP4 plasmid which contains the genome of a Mu-like D3112 phage specific for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied. Two different types of D3112 genome expression were revealed in E. coli. The first is BP4-dependent expression. In this case, expression of certain D3112 genes designated as "kil" only takes place when RP4 is present. As a result, cell division stops at 30 degrees C and cells form filaments. Cell division is not blocked at 42 degrees C. The second type of D3112 genome expression is RP4-independent. A small number of phage is produced independently of RP4 plasmid but this does not take place at 42 degrees C. No detectable quantity of the functionally active repressor of the phage was determined in E. coli (D3112). It is possible that the only cause for cell stability of E. coli (D3112) or E. coli (RP4::D3112) at 42 degrees C in the absence of the repressor is the fact of an extremely poor expression of D3112. In another heterologous system, P. putida both ways of phage development (lytic and lysogenic) are observed. This special state of D3112 genome in E. coli cells is proposed to be named "conditionally expressible prophage" or, in short, "conex-phage", to distinguish it from a classical lysogenic state when stability is determined by repressor activity. Specific blockade of cell division, due to D3112 expression, was also found in P. putida cells. It is evident that the kil function of D3112 is not specific to recognize the difference between division machinery of bacteria belonging to distinct species or genera. Protein synthesis is needed to stop cell division and during a short time period this process could be reversible. Isolation of E. coli (D3112) which lost RP4 plasmid may be regarded as an evidence for D3112 transposition in E. coli. Some possibilities for using the system to look for E. coli mutants with modified expression of foreign genes are considered.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies against Pseudomonas aeruginosa outer membrane antigens: isolation and characterization.
AB  - Hybridomas secreting monoclonal antibodies specific for Pseudomonas aeruginosa outer membrane antigens were isolated. One of the antibodies was highly specific for the O antigen of the lipopolysaccharide of International Antigen Typing Scheme serotype 5 strains, reacting only weakly with a serotype 17 strain and failing to react with the outer membranes of strains representing 15 other serotypes. This monoclonal antibody was able to agglutinate heat-killed bacterial cells as well as lipopolysaccharide-coated sheep erythrocytes. Two other monoclonal antibodies were able to interact with the outer membranes of strains representing all 17 serotypes, although they were unable to agglutinate heat-killed bacterial cells. One of these was shown to be specific for the major outer membrane lipoprotein H2. The antigenic site against which this monoclonal antibody reacted was present in the outer membranes of two Pseudomonas fluorescens strains, two Pseudomonas putida strains, a Pseudomonas anguilliseptica strain, and an Azotobacter vinelandii strain, but not in the outer membranes of five other bacterial species.
TI  - Sensitivity of 341 non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria to seven beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - Susceptibility of 341 isolates of non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria to carbenicillin, piperacillin, cefoperazone, moxalactam, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, and N-formimidoyl thienamycin was determined by the agar dilution and disc diffusion methods. Piperacillin was the most active agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, thienamycin the most active against Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas putida, and moxalactam the most active against Pseudomonas maltophilia. Piperacillin and thienamycin were the most active agents against the other Pseudomonas species studied. Thienamycin proved to have excellent activity against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus--90% of strains were inhibited by less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. The two most active drugs against Alcaligenes species were piperacillin and thienamycin, both of which inhibited 90% of isolates at a concentration of 2 micrograms/ml. All drugs were active against Moraxella species. The broad sensitivity spectrum of piperacillin, thienamycin, and the third-generation cephalosporins against non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria indicates their potential use in infections caused by these organisms.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of Pseudomonas species to aminoglycosides and tetracyclines].
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa has attracted much attention through its role in hospital  outbreaks of disease. However, other members of the genus Pseudomonas, particularly Pseudomonas maltophilia and Pseudomonas cepacia, may be isolated as opportunistic pathogens of man, and can be found in hospital materials. These organisms have been less susceptible to the commonly used antibiotics. This report deals with the in vitro sensitivity of Pseudomonas strains except for P. aeruginosa to aminoglycosides and tetracyclines. The following bacteria were tested: P. maltophilia (50 strains), P. fluorescens (29 strains), P. putida (52 strains), P. cepacia (49 strains), P. putrefaciens (18 strains), P. acidovorans (12 strains). All of the strains for this study were isolated from routine cultures of infected clinical materials which sent to the Clinical Laboratories, Juntendo University Hospital during the 1 year period of 1980. The tests for susceptibility of the strains to the 3 aminoglycosides (gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin) and 3 tetracyclines (tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline) were all performed by the serial 2-fold agar plate dilution method on heart infusion agar, standardized by the Japan Society of Chemotherapy, using the microplanter apparatus with an inoculum size of approximately 10(8) CFU/ml. There were similar sensitivity patterns for the aminoglycosides tested; most of the strains of P. maltophilia, P. cepacia and P. acidovorans were resistant to the aminoglycosides, while most of P. fluorescens, P. putida and P. putrefaciens were sensitive. Minocycline and doxycycline were extremely active to the Pseudomonas species studied. Tetracycline was almost ineffective against P. maltophilia and P. cepacia.
TI  - D-Malic enzyme of Pseudomonas fluorescens.
AB  - By the enrichment culture technique 14 gram-negative bacteria and two yeast strains were isolated that used D(+)-malic acid as sole carbon source. The bacteria were identified as Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella aerogenes. In cell-free extracts of P. fluorescens and P. putida the presence of malate dehydrogenase, D-malic enzyme (NAD-dependent) and L-malic enzyme (NADP-dependent) was demonstrated. D-Malic enzyme from P. fluorescens was purified. Stabilization of the enzyme by 50 mM ammonium sulphate an 1 mM EDTA was essential. Preparation of D-malic enzyme that gave one band with disc gel electrophoresis showed a specific activity of 4-5 U/mg. D-Malic enzyme requires divalent cations. The Km values were for malate Km = 0.3 mM and for NAD Km = 0.08 mM. The pH optimum for the reaction was found to be in the range of pH 8.1 to pH 8.8. D-Malic enzyme is partially inhibited by oxaloacetic acid, meso-tartaric acid, D-lactic acid and ATP. Determined by gel filtration and gradient gel electrophoresis, the molecular weight was approximately 175 000.
TI  - Evaluation of the AutoMicrobic system for identification of glucose-nonfermenting gram-negative rods.
AB  - With the Enterobacteriaceae Plus Biochemical Card, the AutoMicrobic system (Vitek Systems, Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.) is purported to identify members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and seven species of glucose-nonfermenting gram-negative rods: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, P. putida, P. maltophilia, P. cepacia, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (saccharolytic and non-saccharolytic). The latter capability was examined in this investigation. Of 410 glucose-nonfermenting rods included in the identification profile, the AutoMicrobic system correctly identified 366 (89.3%). Of 62 glucose-nonfermenting organisms not included in the identification profile, 41 (66%) were correctly reported as "unidentified organism." The usefulness of the AutoMicrobic system-generated identification probability in establishing criteria for acceptance of identification is discussed.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa R' plasmids constructed  by interspecific mating.
AB  - Plasmid R68.45 was used to construct R' plasmids carrying a maximum of 4 to 5 map minutes of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO chromosome by interspecific mating, using P. putida PPN as the recipient. These R' plasmids were used to determine the map location of the amiE locus and to identify tentatively a number of P. putida auxotrophic mutations. Some of these R' plasmids could not be maintained in recombination-deficient P. aeruginosa strains.
TI  - [Integration of the genome of the Mu-like Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophage D3112 into plasmid RP4 and its hybrid plasmid transfer into Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli C600 bacteria].
AB  - The genome of a Mu-like bacteriophage D3112 specific for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was integrated in vivo into the RP4 plasmid. The fact of integration has been proved by two experiments: 1. The loss of RP4 plasmid is accompanied by loss of D3112 prophage; 2. Transfer of the plasmid by conjugation from Pseudomonas aeruginosa into bacteria of other species - P. putida PgG1 or Escherichia coli C600 leads to the occurrence of clones of these species which liberate phage capable of growing on the lawn of P. aeruginosa bacteria. The integrated state of D3112 inserted into RP4 is stable in P. aeruginosa, E. coli, P. putida. The transfer frequency of RP4 with integrated D3112 prophage into different bacteria which do not contain homoimmune prophage is essentially lower than that of the RP4 having no D3112 prophage. Specific manifestation of D3112 genome activity in E. coli cells is the sensitivity of cell growth to lower temperature (30 degrees C) of incubation.
TI  - In vitro combination effects of cefsulodin, moxalactam and cefoperazone with four aminoglycosides on nonfermenting nosocomial gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The activity of moxalactam, cefsulodin and cefoperazone on 67 non-fermenting gram-negative bacterial strains isolated from patients with nosocomial infections was tested either alone or in combination with gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin and netilmicin, respectively, by use of the checkerboard agar dilution technique. Cefsulodin was most active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cefoperazone was the most active cephalosporin tested against Pseudomonas fluorescens-putida and Acinetobacter antitratus. Cefoperazone-aminoglycoside interactions were found to be synergistic in only 2--5% of all strains, cefsulodin and moxalactam in combination with aminoglycosides were most potent against P. aeruginosa. Cefsulodin-gentamicin interactions were superior to other cephalosporin-amino-glycoside combinations.
TI  - The reaction of oxygen with protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida. Characterization of a new oxygenated intermediate.
AB  - The reactions of protocatechuate dioxygenase (protocatechuate:oxygen 3,4-oxidoreductase, EC 1.13.11.3) with substrates and oxygen have been studied at 4 degrees C using rapid kinetic techniques. In this study, two oxygenated intermediates were kinetically and spectrally characterized. The rate of oxygen addition to the enzyme-substrate complex was determined to be 5 X 10(5) M-1 s-1. This oxygenated complex rapidly converts (450 s-1) to another spectrally identifiable compound which then breaks down into free enzyme and the product, beta-carboxy-cis,cis-muconic acid. To carry out these experiments properly, it was necessary to use hyperbaric oxygen, thus obtaining approximately 6 mM final concentration of oxygen. The procedure is described in this work. It was also shown that the normally slow substrate, dihydroxyphenyl propionate, when reacted with the enzyme and oxygen, rapidly forms two sequential intermediates. However, the second intermediate was not spectrally the same as that observed with protocatechuate, but was more like that of enzyme-product complexes. Similar, although less extensive, studies using the protocatechuate dioxygenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed that very analogous behavior occurred with both substrates as did with the Pseudomonas putida enzyme.
TI  - Purification and properties of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida. A new iron to subunit stoichiometry.
AB  - Protocatechuate dioxygenase has been isolated from Pseudomonas putida. This new species of protocatechuate dioxygenase has been characterized and compared with the enzyme from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The enzyme reported here has visible absorption, circular dichroism, electron paramagnetic resonance, and Raman spectroscopic properties virtually identical to those for protocatechuate dioxygenase from P. aeruginosa. However, the molecular weight and iron:subunit stoichiometry differ. Protocatechuate dioxygenase from P. putida has a molecular weight of 200,000 and contains 4 alpha subunits of 23,000 daltons, 4 beta subunits of 26,500 daltons, and 4 ferric irons suggesting that the enzyme is a tetramer of (alpha beta Fe+3) catalytic units. Protocatechuate dioxygenase from P. aeruginosa has been reported to have a Mr = 700,000, consisting of 16 alpha subunits of 22,500 daltons, 16 beta subunits of 25,000 daltons, and 8 ferric irons (Yoshida, R., Hori, K., Fujiwara, M., Saeki, Y., Kagamiyama, H., and Nozaki, W. (1976) Biochemistry 15, 4048-4053). This enzyme is thought to be an octamer of (alpha 2 beta 2 Fe+3) catalytic units, although reconstitution with extra iron will somewhat increase its activity. Using stopped flow techniques, we have shown that essentially all of the iron in the P. putida enzyme is catalytically active. This suggests that the minimal catalytic unit of all non-heme iron intradiol dioxygenases is an (alpha beta Fe+3) structure.
TI  - Specific-purpose plasmid cloning vectors. II. Broad host range, high copy number, RSF1010-derived vectors, and a host-vector system for gene cloning in Pseudomonas.
AB  - Host-vector systems have been developed for gene cloning in the metabolically versatile bacterial genus Pseudomonas. They comprise restriction-negative host strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. putida and new cloning vectors derived from the high-copy-number, broad-host-range plasmid RSF1010, which are stably maintained in a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria. These plasmids contain EcoRI, SstI, HindIII, XmaI, XhoI, SalI, BamHI, and ClaI insertion sites. All cloning sites, except for BamHI and ClaI, are located within antibiotic-resistance genes' insertional inactivation of these genes during hybrid plasmid formation provides a readily scored phenotypic change for the rapid identification of bacterial clones carrying such hybrids. One of the new vector plasmids is a cosmid that may be used for the selective cloning of large DNA fragments by in vitro lambda packaging. An analogous series of vectors that are defective in their plasmid-mobilization function, and that exhibit a degree of biological containment comparable to that of current Escherichia coli vector plasmids, are also described.
TI  - Characteristics of human isolates of unidentified fluorescence pseudomonads capable of growth at 42 degrees C.
AB  - Five strains of an unidentified fluorescent Pseudomonas sp. which were capable of growth at 42 degrees C were isolated over a 3-year period and were examined and compared with chosen strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, and P. putida. The strains were examined in a range of biochemical and carbon substrate alkalinization tests. The outstanding properties of the unidentified fluorescent Pseudomonas sp. included monopolar arrangement of flagella, gelatin liquefaction, litmus milk peptonization, and growth on cetrimide and Salmonella-Shigella agars. All strains failed to produce pyocyanin, 2-ketogluconate, and nitrogen gas, failed to acidify mannitol and xylose, and failed to alkalinize acetamide and allantoin. Similarities to P. fluorescens and P. putida were reflected in their resistance to carbenicillin and susceptibility to kanamycin and tetracycline.
TI  - Isolation of alginate-producing mutants of Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas mendocina.
AB  - Spontaneous alginate-producing (muc) variants were isolated from strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. putida and P. mendocina at a frequency of 1 in 10(8) by selecting for carbenicillin resistance. The infrared spectrum of the bacterial exopolysaccharide was typical of an acetylated alginate similar to that previously described in Azotobacter vinelandii and in mucoid variants of P. aeruginosa. Mucoid variants were not isolated from P. stutzeri, P. pseudoalcaligenes, P. testosteroni, P. diminuta, P. acidovorans, P. cepacia or P. maltophilia.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of ceftizoxime against glucose-nonfermentative gram-negative rods.
AB  - Ceftizoxime, a new cephalosporin, was active against Pseudomonas cepacia, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, Alcaligenes faecalis, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and was more potent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida than was carbenicillin.
TI  - Plasmid specifying total degradation of 3-chlorobenzoate by a modified ortho pathway.
AB  - A plasmid, termed pAC25, specifying biodegradation of 3-chlorobenzoate in a strain of Pseudomonas putida has been characterized. During growth of the plasmid-harboring cells with 3-chlorobenzoate, there was an accumulation of 3-chlorocatechol and beta-chloromuconic acid as intermediates and release of more than 80% of the chlorine in the form of inorganic chloride. The plasmid had a mean molecular mass of 68 x 10(6) daltons and was transmissible to a number of Pseudomonas species such as P. aeruginosa, P. putida strain PpG1, and P. putida strain PRS1. Transfer of pAC25 to various catechol-negative mutants of P. putida strain PRS1 showed that the chromosomally coded pyrocatechase was not complemented by the plasmid-specified pyrocatechase, which appeared to be specific for the chlorinated catechols. In contrast to benzoate, which was metabolized by the ortho pathway through beta-ketoadipate as an intermediate, the plasmid specified ortho cleavage of the chlorocatechols through maleylacetate as an intermediate.
TI  - Glutamine synthetase of pseudomonads: some biochemical and physicochemical properties.
AB  - The glutamine synthetases from several Pseudomonas species were purified to homogeneity, and their properties were compared with those reported for the enzymes from Escherichia coli and other gram-negative bacteria. The glutamine synthetase from Pseudomonas fluorescens was unique because it was nearly precipitated quantitatively as a homogeneous protein during dialysis of partially purified preparations against buffer containing 10 mM imidazole (pH 7.0) and 10 mM MnCl2. The glutamine synthetases from Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were purified by affinity chromatography on Affi-blue gel. Dodecamerous forms of the E. coli and P. fluorescens glutamine synthetases had identical mobilities during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Their dissociated subunits, however, migrated differently and were readily separated by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. This difference in subunit mobilities is not related to the state of adenylylation. Regulation of the Pseudomonas glutamine synthetase activity is mediated by an adenylylation-deadenylylation cyclic cascade system. A sensitive procedure was developed for measuring the average number of adenylylated subunits per enzyme molecule for the glutamine synthetase from P. fluorescens. This method takes advantage of the large differences in transferase activity of the adenylylated and unadenylylated subunits at pH 6.0 and of the fact that the activities of both kinds of subunits are the same at pH 8.45.
TI  - Cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate levels in Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa during induction and carbon catabolite repression of histidase synthesis.
AB  - Inducibility of histidase (histidine ammonia-lyase, EC 4.3.1.3) in Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed to be strongly affected by succinate-provoked catabolite repression, but this did not occur as a consequence of reduced intracellular cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate levels, and repression could not be alleviated by exogenously added cyclic adenosine 3,'5'-monophosphate. Milder repression of histidase by lactate was also not reversed by the addition of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. These results, along with data showing intracellular cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate levels remained essentially constant during growth on such diverse carbon sources as histidine, acetamide, glucose, and succinate, indicated that catabolite repression of histidase synthesis by efficient carbon sources was not mediated through variations in internal cyclic adenosine 3,'5'-monophosphate.
TI  - [The identification of nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria. Experiences with 676 apyocyaninogenic strains (author's transl)].
AB  - During a period of 16 months 1757 strains of nonfermentative gram-negative rods have been isolated from clinical material. Of the, 1205 (69%) were P. aeruginosa, 124 (10%) of which failed to produce pyocyanin. The apyocyaninogenic strains as well as the remaining 552 isolates were differentiated by steps according to a diagnostic scheme developed by us. For identification of species two or three steps were needed. By this procedure, 530 of the 552 strains could be assigned to nineteen species within the genera Pseudomonas, Achromobacter, Alcaligenes, Flavobacterium, Agrobacterium and Acinetobacter. 17 strains could not be identified below the genus level, one strain belonged to CDC-group VE-2 and four strains were not identifiable. 72% of the 552 strains belonged to only four species: Pseudomonas putida, P. maltophilia, Acinetobacter lwoffii and A. anitratus.
TI  - Inability of the API-20E system to speciate the fluorescent group of pseudomonads.
AB  - One thousand randomly selected clinical isolates of the fluorescent group of Pseudomonas were speciated in parallel by the API-20E system and by a classic microbiologic 17-test battery. The classic battery identified the isolates as 993 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, five Pseudomonas putida, and two Pseudomonas fluorescens. To augment the P. putida and P. fluorescens data, 52 reference isolates were also tested in parallel. API-20E was found to identify 99% of P. aeruginosa as P. aeruginosa. However, the 59 P. putida and P. fluorescens isolates were not accurately identified and were designated 58% P. aeruginosa, 24% P. stutzeri, 16% ambiguous categories, and only 2% in agreement with the classic designation. These findings indicated that the API-20E system does not accurately identify the non-P. aeruginosa fluorescent pseudomonads and that errors in P. aeruginosa designations will increase as the percentages of P. putida and P. fluorescens increase in the population sample.
TI  - Combination effect of piperacillin with four aminoglycosides on nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro efficacy of piperacillin in combination with gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin and netilmicin against 57 nonfermenting gram-negative bacterial strains was compared by use of the checkerboard agar dilution technique. On average 34% of all nonfermenting strains were inhibited by additive, 13% by synergistic piperacillin-amino-glycoside combinations. Great variation occurred between the different bacterial species. Piperacillin-aminoglycoside combinations were most active on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and least potent on Pseudomonas cepacia. Piperacillin was highly active against P. aeruginosa, P. cepacia, Pseudomonas fluorescens-putida and Acinetobacter species.
TI  - Inhibition, but not uncoupling, of respiratory energy coupling of three bacterial species by nitrite.
AB  - The effect of nitrite on respiratory energy coupling of three bacteria was studied in light of a recent report that nitrite acted as an uncoupling agent with Paracoccus denitrificans grown under denitrifying conditions. Our determinations of proton translocation stoichiometry of Pseudomonas putida (aerobically grown), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and P. denitrificans (grown both aerobically and under denitrifying conditions) showed nitrite inhibition of proton-to-oxidant stoichiometry, but not uncoupling. Nitrite both reduced the H+/O ratio and decreased the rate of proton resorption. Increased proton resorption rates, characteristic of authentic uncoupling agents, were not observed. The lack of enhanced proton permeability due to nitrite was verified via passive proton permeability assays. The H+/O ratio of P. aeruginosa increased when growth conditions were changed from aerobic to denitrifying. This suggested the induction of an additional coupling site in the electron transport chain of denitrifying P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Evaluation of the Minitek system for identification of nonfermentative and nonenteric fermentative Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The Minitek identification system (MT) was compared with a conventional testing battery for the characterization of 735 isolates which included 57 species and groups of nonfermentative (NF) and nonenteric fermentative (NEF) gram-negative bacteria. The MT correctly identified 585 of 616 NF (94,96%) and 115 of 119 NEF (96.65%) bacteria and 700 of 735 strains (95.24%) overall. A total of 31 NF and NEF (4.22%) bacteria were misidentified, and no identification was determined for four strains (0.69%). All strains of Acinetobacter anitratus, Pseudomonas maltophilia, P. fluroescens, and P. putida and all but one strain of P. aeruginosa were correctly identified. The most frequently misidentified taxa were CDC group Va-1, P. pickettii (Va-2), P. mendocina, and Moraxella urethralis (M-4). Supplemental tests were needed for the complete identification of 214 strains (29.11%). An average of 1.54 supplemental tests were used with each of these strains. A total of 134 strains (18.23%) had their identification delayed by 1 day due to supplemental testing. We recommend the use of the 42 degree C growth test with the MT. When used in accord with the manufacturer's instructions and with the MT code book the MT was found to be a valuable system for the identification of a wide variety of common and infrequently encountered NF and NEF bacteria.
TI  - Expression of E. coli genes carried by hybrids of plasmid RP4.
AB  - Hybrids of the RP4 plasmid, containing bacteriophage Mu and chromosomal genes of  Escherichia coli, were transferred into Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. The individual genes of the arginine, histidine, leucine and threonine operons were expressed in these microorganisms.
TI  - Headspace analysis of volatile metabolites of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and related  species by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
AB  - Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis of headspace volatiles was performed on cultures of 11 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 1 strain each of Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas putrefaciens, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Pseudomonas maltophilia. All strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa produced a distinctive series of odd-carbon methyl ketones, particularly 2-nonanone and 2-undecanone, and 2-aminoacetophenone. The other strains failed to produce 2-aminoacetophenone. Two sulfur compounds, dimethyldisulfide and dimethyltrisulfide, were present in strains of P. aeruginosa and in variable amounts in other species. Butanol, 2-butanone, 1-undecene, and isopentanol were also detected in P. aeruginosa cultures.
TI  - Expression of the lactose transposon Tn951 in Escherichia coli, Proteus and Pseudomonas.
AB  - The control of beta-galactosidase specified by the lactose transposon Tn951 (inserted into RP1 to give pGC9114) has been studied in Escherichia coli K12, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida; in the first two species comparison could be made with Flac. In E. coli K12, the Tn951 and chromosomally encoded enzymes showed marked qualitative differences in regulatio, the former giving a substantially lower maximum induced level and induction ratio. Several parameters were slightly affected by strain background. In P. mirabilis, beta-galactosidase control determined by both Flac (in accord with earlier work) and pGC9114 was markedly different from E. coli in that maximal induced levels were about an order of magnitude lower and the induction ratio was reduced to 3 to 5. In Ps. aeruginosa and Ps. putida, Tn951-specified lac expression was qualitatively similar to that in P. mirabilis. Possible reasons for anomalous expression in Proteus and Pseudomonas are discussed.
TI  - Intergeneric evolutionary homology revealed by the study of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase from Azotobacter vinelandii.
AB  - Protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.1.3) was purified to homogeneity from extracts of Azotobacter vinelandii. The molecular weight of the oligomeric protein was estimated to be 510 000 by gel filtration and 480 000 by ultracentrifugation. The oligomer appears to be formed by association of equal amounts of nonidentical subunits which were estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis to have respective molecular weights of 23 300 and 25 250. Ten gram-atoms of iron was associated with each mol of oligomer. Therefore, the enzyme appears to be a decamer with the structure 10(alpha beta Fe). T-HE AMINO ACID COMPOSITION OF Azotobacter protocatechuate oxygenase closely resembles the amino acid compositions of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenases from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Thiobacillus sp. These proteins from P. aeruginosa and P. putida are known to be formed by association of nonidentical subunits of a physical size similar to the subunits of the Azotobacter enzyme. Furthermore, antisera prepared against the Azotobacter oxygenase cross-reacted strongly with the isofunctional enzymes from the two fluorescent Pseudomonas species. A weak immunological cross-reaction was observed when the antisera were tested against protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. The results favor the conclusion that the bacterial protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenases were derived from a common ancestral protein.
TI  - Growth of nonfermentative bacteria at 42 degrees C.
AB  - Growth at 42 degrees C is advocated to differentiate species of the fluorescent pseudomonas group as well as to differentiate other nonfermentative bacteria. Methodologies vary in the performance of the test, resulting in differing and often discrepant results between investigators. During this evaluation, the test was performed by inoculating 3 ml of Trypticase soy broth with a loopful of an overnight broth culture. Growth in the 42 degrees C tube was judged as heavy or slight after 24 and 48 h incubation at 41.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C. Pseudomonas aeruginosa grew abundantly after overnight incubation, whereas 16 of 74 isolates of P. putida (22%) showed slight turbidity in the broth after 24 or 48 h which could not be regarded as an inoculum effect. Trypticase soy agar was used in conjunction with Trypticase soy broth, with the growth again judged as heavy or slight. Growth of P. putida on slants was still seen in some cases (6%) although the number of strains showing growth had declined. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride was added to Trypticase soy broth (0.005%) as a color indicator of growth. Strains of P. putida, although showing visible evidence of growth, gave no color change when compared with the 35 degrees C control. The constancy in test results using nonfermentative bacteria is not only method dependent but also strain dependent. Although the test for growth at 42 degrees C is important as a taxonomic tool when used under controlled conditions, other tests such as acetamide are preferred as a substitute for use in the clinical laboratory.
TI  - [Numerical systematics of bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas].
AB  - In 290 strains of bacteria belonging to the genus Pseudomonas, 120 morphological  and physiologo-biochemical characters were studied and the results obtained thereby were analyzed by the methods of numerical taxonomy using computers. The majority of strains were subdivided into 11 clusters: Ps. aeruginosa (1), Ps. putida (2), Ps. rathonis (5), Ps. syringae (8), Ps. pseudoalcaligenes (9), Ps. maltophilia (10), Ps. acidovorans (11), Ps. testosteroni (12), Ps. mendocina (13), Ps. cepacia (14), Ps. fluorescens (3). The latter cluster included also the strains identified earlier as Ps. aurantiaca, Ps. lemonnieri, Ps. fluoro-violaceus, and Ps. aureofaciens. Three clusters contained strains which could not be identified and probably should be regarded as distinct species. The characteristics have been selected useful for diagnostics of the above Pseudomonas bacteria and the subgroups of Ps. fluorescens.
TI  - Deoxyribonucleic acid sequence homologies among bacterial insertion sequence elements and genomes of various organisms.
AB  - Plasmid and phage deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) harboring bacterial insertion sequence (IS) elements IS1, IS2, and IS5 were characterized and used as probes to detect homologous sequences in various procaryotic and eucaryotic genomes. The hybridization method used permits the detection of sequences partially homologous to the elements. Hybridization of the IS-containing probes to each other revealed a region of limited homology between IS1 and IS2. Homologous sequences were then detected by computer analysis of the published IS1 and IS2 nucleotide sequences. The homologous sequence contains a tandemly repeated tetranucleotide sequence which resembles the repeated sequence at the hot spot for spontaneous mutations in the lacI gene (P. J. Farabaugh, U. Schmeissner, M. Hofer, and J. Miller, J. Mol. Biol. 126:847-863, 1978). Homology between the IS elements and various genomes was determined by hybridizing labeled DNA containing IS1, IS2, and IS5 sequences to Southern blots of chromosomal DNA cleaved with restriction endonucleases. IS1 and IS5 appear limited to the enteric bacteria, whereas IS2 sequences can also be detected in Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens. Bacteria which appear not to possess extrachromosomal elements, e.g., Caulobacter crescentus, did not show homology with any insertion sequences tested. In addition, sequences homologous to IS1, IS2, or IS5 were not detected in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Dictyostelium discoideum, or calf thymus DNA.
TI  - Chromosomal mobilization from a recA mutant of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - A methyl methane sulfonate sensitive mutant of P. putida strain PpG1 is also extremely sensitive to UV-rays, compared to parent wild type cells. This mutant behaves typically as recombination less (recA) mutants of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, since as a recipient, it exhibits extremely low frequency of recombination following conjugational, transductional, and transformational gene transfer. Sex factor plasmids such as K-XYL or TOL can mobilize chromosomal genes equally well both from recA+ and recA801 donor cells, suggesting that host recombination functions are not necessary for mobilization of chromosomal genes by such plasmids.
TI  - Semiquantitative catalase test as an aid in identification of oxidative and nonsaccharolytic gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A simple and rapid semiquantitative slide catalase test useful for the identification of oxidative and nonsaccharolytic gram-negative bacteria, i.e., "nonfermenters," is described. Using the interpretative criterion of time of appearance of oxygen bubbles in 3% hydrogen peroxide, three categories of nonfermenters were established. The rapid catalase producers included Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Achromobacter species; Acinetobacter anitratus and Acinetobacter lwoffii; Bordetella bronchiseptica; CDC group IVE; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, P. putida, P. diminuta, and P. acidovorans; and Moraxella urethralis and M-6. The delayed catalase producers included Bordetella parapertussis, CDC group VA-1, P. alcaligenes, P. cepacia, P. mendocina, P. pickettii (VA-2), P. pseudoalcaligenes, P. putrefaciens, P. stutzeri, P. testosteroni, and P. vesicularis. The third group consisted of an additional 17 taxa of nonfermenters which were classified as moderate catalase producers.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of clinical isolates of Pseudomonas cepacia (author's transl)].
AB  - The yearly changes of relative frequency of glucose-nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli except for P. aeruginosa isolated from various clinical specimens over the past 5 years were studied. Acinetobacter anitratum was the most commonly encountered strain and P. maltophilia and P. putida were also frequently encountered during 1974 through 1977. In 1978, P. cepacia became a significantly predominant strain, which was 44.6% of all nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli excluding P. aeruginosa isolated in Juntendo Hospital. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of 59 similar to 61 clinical isolates of P. cepacia in 1978 were studied by agar dilution method, standardized by the Japan Society of Chemotherapy. Miloxacin and minocycline inhibited more than 95% of the strain by the concentration of 6.25 micrograms/ml. Nalidixic acid and sulfamethoxazole were sensitive to approximately 52% and 75% of the strains respectively. The minimal inhibitory concentration of gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, kanamycin, apalcillin, piperacillin and pipemidic acid for most strains was more than 1.25 micrograms/ml. More than 90% of the strains were highly resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, sulbenicillin, ticarcillin, cefazolin, cefotiam, tetracycline, clindamycin and colistin.
TI  - Insertion element analysis and mapping of the Pseudomonas plasmid alk regulon.
AB  - We characterized and mapped new mutations of the alk (alkane utilization) genes found on Pseudomonas plasmids of the Inc P-2 group. These mutations were isolated after (i) nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis, (ii) transposition of the Tn7 trimethoprim and streptomycin resistance determinant, and (iii) reversion of polarity effects of alk::Tn7 insertion mutations. Our results indicate the existence of two alk loci not previously described--alkD, whose product is required for synthesis of membrane alkane-oxidizing activities, and alkE, whose product is required for synthesis of inducible membrane alcohol dehydrogenase activity. Polarity of alk::Tn7 insertion mutations indicates the existence of an alkBAE operon. Mapping of alk loci by transduction in P. aeruginosa shows that there are at least three alk clusters in the CAM-OCT plasmid--alkRD, containing regulatory genes; alkBAE, containing genes for specific biochemical activities; and alkC, containing one or more genes needed for normal synthesis of membrane alcohol dehydrogenase. The alkRD and alkBAE clusters are linked but separated by about 42 kilobases. The alkC cluster is not linked to either of the other two alk regions. Altogether, these results indicate a complex genetic control of the alkane utilization phenotype in P. putida and P. aeruginosa involving at least six separate genes.
TI  - Nonfermentative bacilli: evaluation of three systems for identification.
AB  - Three systems for the identification of nonfermentative bacilli were evaluated for their rapidity and accuracy of identification of 217 strains. Two of the systems, API 20E (API) and Oxi/Ferm tube (OxiF), are available as kits; the oxidative attack (OA) system is not commerically available. The overall accuracies of the OA, API, and OxiF systems were 91, 69, and 50%, respectively. Identification within 48 h was achieved for 98% of the strains by OA, for 50% by API, and for 18% by OxiF. Most of the organisms that were either misidentified or not identified by API and OxiF were those nonfermentative bacilli which are relatively more fastidious or rarely encountered or both. All three systems accurately identified nonfermentative bacilli commonly isolated at Olive View Medical Center, namely, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratus, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter lwoffi, saccharolytic flavobacteria (CDC IIb), moraxellae, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Pseudomonas putida. The OA system identified 100% of the above organisms correctly, API identified 99.4%, and OxiF identified 99.3%. Since these organisms comprise 92% of the total number of nonfermentative bacilli isolated at Olive View Medical Center, we conclude that both API and OxiF may be useful alternatives to conventional methods, based on accuracy of identification alone. These two systems were considered substantially inferior to the OA system when both accuracy and rapidity of identification were taken into account.
TI  - Autoradiographic study of the localization and evolution of growth zones in bacterial colonies.
AB  - Incorporation of [3H]leucine in the bacteria of 18 to 48 h-old colonies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Bacillus thuringiensis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli enabled the localization of bacterial multiplication sites by means of autoradiography of sagittal sections. In colonies where fast diameter expansion occurred, all the bacteria from the peripheral corona contributed to peripheral growth; in colonies where the expansion was slower, the growth rate of the bacteria in this region was heterogeneous. Besides this peripheral growth, a central region of bacterial multiplication was always found, but with variable localization and extension. In aerobic species, such as P. aeruginosa and P. putida, the central growth site was limited to the zone of oxygen penetration into the bacterial mass. However, in facultatively anaerobic species, bacterial multiplication dependend on nutrient supply. For 48 h-old colonies of S. aureus, a more complex localization of growth seemed to be affected simultaneously by nutrient penetration and accumulation of toxic substances.
TI  - Identification of Gram-negative non-fermenters and oxidase-positive fermenters by the Oxi/Ferm tube.
AB  - Since the recent introduction of the Roche Oxi/Ferm Tube to the UK two identification schemes have been developed by the manufacturer for use with the kit. We evaluated the success of these two schemes in identifying 222 predominantly culture collection strains belonging to 45 taxa of non-fermenters and nine taxa of oxidase-positive fermenters. The strains were chosen to represent all the taxa included in the two identification schemes developed by the manufacturer and we have therefore been able to assess the overall success of identification by the two schemes. Since, however, our choice of strains does not reflect their incidence in clinical material, our identification rates are not necessarily those that might be obtained in a routine clinical laboratory. The most advanced identification scheme so far developed for the Oxi/Ferm Tube (CCIS System 1977-1432) allowed 62% of the 222 strains to be correctly identified although a disturbing feature was that more of the strains that were not correctly identified were incorrectly identified (24%) rather than not identified (14%); these figures represent an improvement over the earlier identification scheme (CCIS System 1976-621-74346) for which the corresponding figures were 56%, 32%, and 12%. CCIS System 1977-1432 seems likely to give a better performance in a routine clinical laboratory than in this study since for those taxa which, we would judge from the material sent to us for identification, are most commonly seen in a routine laboratory (Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, A. lwoffii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, P. maltophilia, P. pseudoalcaligenes, and P. putida) 89% were correctly identified, none remained unidentified, and 11% were incorrectly identified. Thirty strains, each of a different taxon, were tested in triplicate to assess the reproducibility of reactions in the Oxi/Ferm Tube.
TI  - TOL is a broad-host-range plasmid.
AB  - We readily isolated insertions of the carbenicillin resistance element Tn401 into the TOL plasmid in Pseudomonas putida. Hybrid TOL::Tn401 plasmids stably express the Cbr phenotype in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Whereas the replicative and conjugative functions are expressed in both hosts, the ability to grow on m-toluate is only expressed in the Pseudomonas species.
TI  - Isolation of large bacterial plasmids and characterization of the P2 incompatibility group plasmids pMG1 and pMG5.
AB  - Large plasmids from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were routinely and consistently isolated using a procedure which does not require ultracentrifugation but includes steps designed to separate large-plasmid DNA from the bacterial folded chromosome. It also selectively removes fragments of broken chromosome. A variety of large plasmids was readily visualized with agarose gel electorphoresis, including five between 70 and 85 megadaltons (Mdal) in size, six between 90 and 143 Mdal, one that was larger than 200 Mdal, and one that was larger than 300 Mdal. This isolation procedure allowed initial estimation of the molecular sizes of the two IncP2 plasmids, pMG1 and pMG5, which were 312 and 280 Mdal, respectively. A standard curve for size determination by gel electrophoresis including plasmids between 23 and 143 Mdal in size did not extrapolate linearly for plasmids of the 300-Mdal size range. Unique response of different plasmids to the isolation procedure included sensitivity of IncP1 plasmids to high pH and the co-isolation of a 20-Mdal "cryptic" plasmid in conjunction.
TI  - Isolation of TOL and RP4 recombinants by integrative suppression.
AB  - We obtained genetic and molecular evidence of non-thermosensitive recombinants of RP4 (Kmr Tcr Cbr/Apr) and the thermosensitive TOL plasmid. As first isolated in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO, the recombinant plasmid pTN1 specified noninducible synthesis of TOL enzymes and was transmissible to Escherichia coli on selection for the transfer of kanamycin resistance. The phenotypic expression of TOL genes of pTN1 in E. coli was low and also noninducible. A spontaneous segregant, pTN2, appearing from pTN1, conferred inducible synthesis of TOL enzymes. These plasmids carry all of the TOL determinants as evidenced by the ability of Pseudomonas putida carrying recombinant plasmids to grow on toluene, xylene, and m-toluate. In E. coli the expression of TOL genes with normal regulation (pTN2) appears to be extremely low without induction, and the induced expression is comparable to that with defective regulation (pTN1). The measurement of the molecular weight of pTN2 by electron microscopy gave a value of about 74 X 10(6).
TI  - RSF1010 plasmid as a potentially useful vector in Pseudomonas species.
AB  - RSF1010 plasmid DNA was introduced into Pseudomonas putida and P. aeruginosa cells and maintained stably, suggesting the potential usefulness of this plasmid as a vector in Pseudomonas species. The number of copies of RSF1010 was 43 per chromosome equivalent in P. putida cells.
TI  - TOL plasmid in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO: thermosensitivity of self-maintenance  and inhibition of host cell growth.
AB  - The TOL plasmid originally isolated in Pseudomonas putida (arvilla) mt-2 was transmissible to strains of the fluorescens group of Pseudomonas, i.e., P. putida, P. fluorescens, and P. aeruginosa, except for a strain of P. aeruginosa, strain PAO. The same strain, however, could accept the plasmid when its restriction and modification abilities were lost by mutations or by growing at high temperature. In addition, the transmissibility of the TOL plasmid from strain PAO to P. putida was low when the plasmid was modified by the donor. By using P. aeruginosa PAO carrying the TOL plasmid, the stability and genetic expression of the plasmid as well as its effect on the host cell growth were examined. Thus the self-maintenance of the plasmid was found to be thermosensitive. Furthermore, the TOL plasmid inhibited the growth of strain PAO at high temperature, accompanied by the formation of some filamentous cells. These thermosensitive properties of the TOL plasmid were host dependent and not exhibited in another strain of P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Evaluation of a multitest system for identification of saccharolytic pseudomonads.
AB  - The API-20 Enteric Strip has been proposed to have the capacity to differentiate  the nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. This multitest strip serves as the basis of an evolving system, which first provided a Register, then a Selector, and more recently a computer Index. Twenty-three strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. putida, 21 of P. fluorescens, 27 of P. maltophilia, and 33 of P. cepacia were investigated by duplicate test runs to determine reproducibility. The results were then evaluated at each of the three stages to determine accuracy of identification and the effect of the system evolution on the identification rate. Seventy-one of the 127 pseudomonads gave reproducible results in the multitest strips. Approximately half of them were correctly grouped or speciated by the Register, whereas 80 to 83% were similarly identified by both the Selector and Index. Of the clinically important pseudomonads, 61 to 65% of P. aeruginosa and 93% of P. maltophilia strains were correctly speciated; neither P. putida nor P. fluorescens strains were speciated, although most were correctly grouped. P. cepacia was speciated by the Index with only 55 to 58% accuracy. Although the present stage of the evolving system offers improvement over the Register, further modifications are needed to eliminate identification problems and to increase speciation.
TI  - Regulatory mutations of the Pseudomonas plasmid alk regulon.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida strains with plasmids carrying pleiotropic alk mutations gave  rise to alkane-positive "revertants," which differ from wild type. Some had restricted ability to utilize alkane and primary alcohol growth substrates, and others could grow on undecane and dodecanol, which are not utilized by alk+ strains. These revertants showed altered responses to normal inducers of alkA+, alkB+, and alkC+ activities. Some revertants were constitutive for these activities. Constitutive mutants could also be isolated directly from wild type, but they appeared spontaneously at a frequency of less than 2 X 10(-8). Regulatory mutations of all three types, pleiotropic negative, altered inducer specificity, and constitutive, were tightly linked in transduction crosses with a polar alkB mutation. These results demonstrate that the IncP-2 plasmid alk gene cluster constitutes a regulon. They also permit the identification of at least one cistron whose gene product participates in inducer recognition and suggest that the alkABC regulon is not under simple repressor control.
TI  - Fractionation of inducible alkane hydroxylase activity in Pseudomonas putida and  characterization of hydroxylase-negative plasmid mutations.
AB  - The plasmid-determined inducible alkane hydroxylase of Pseudomonas putida resolved into particulate and soluble fractions. Spinach reductase and spinach ferredoxin could replace the soluble hydroxylase component. Two alkane hydroxylase mutants show in vitro complementation (S. Benson and J. Shapiro, J. Bacteriol., 123: 759-760, 1975): one, alk-7, lacks an active soluble component and the other, alk-181, lacks an active particulate component. Together with previous results on a particulate alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme (Benson and Shapiro, J. Bacteriol., 126: 794-798, 1976), these results allowed us to assay three plasmid-determined inducible activities: soluble alkane hydroxylase (alkA+), particulate alkane hydroxylase (alkB+), and particulate alcohol dehydrogenase (alkC+). Growth tests and in vitro complementation assays revealed three groups of plasmid mutations that block expression of alkane hydroxylase activity: alkA, which so far includes only the alk-7 mutation; alkB, which includes alk-181 and 11 other mutations; and a pleiotropic-negative class, which includes nine mutations that lead to loss of alkA+, alkB+, and alkC+ activities. Thus, the alk+ gene cluster found on IncP-2 plasmids contains at least four cistrons. We believe it is significant that two of these determined the presence of membrane proteins. The accompanying paper shows that these loci are part of a single regulon.
TI  - Mercury and organomercurial resistances determined by plasmids in Pseudomonas.
AB  - Mercury and organomercurial resistance determined by genes on ten Pseudomonas aeruginosa plasmids and one Pseudomonas putida plasmid have been studied with regard to the range of substrates and the range of inducers. The plasmidless strains were sensitive to growth inhibition by Hg(2+) and did not volatilize Hg(0) from Hg(2+). A strain with plasmid RP1 (which does not confer resistance to Hg(2+)) similarly did not volatilize mercury. All 10 plasmids determine mercury resistance by way of an inducible enzyme system. Hg(2+) was reduced to Hg(0), which is insoluble in water and rapidly volatilizes from the growth medium. Plasmids pMG1, pMG2, R26, R933, R93-1, and pVS1 in P. aeruginosa and MER in P. putida conferred resistance to and the ability to volatilize mercury from Hg(2+), but strains with these plasmids were sensitive to and could not volatilize mercury from the organomercurials methylmercury, ethylmercury, phenylmercury, and thimerosal. These plasmids, in addition, conferred resistance to the organomercurials merbromin, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and fluorescein mercuric acetate. The other plasmids, FP2, R38, R3108, and pVS2, determined resistance to and decomposition of a range of organomercurials, including methylmercury, ethylmercury, phenylmercury, and thimerosal. These plasmids also conferred resistance to the organomercurials merbromin, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and fluorescein mercuric acetate by a mechanism not involving degradation. In all cases, organomercurial decomposition and mercury volatilization were induced by exposure to Hg(2+) or organomercurials. The plasmids differed in the relative efficacy of inducers. Hg(2+) resistance with strains that are organomercurial sensitive appeared to be induced preferentially by Hg(2+) and only poorly by organomercurials to which the cells are sensitive. However, the organomercurials p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, merbromin, and fluorescein mercuric acetate were strong gratuitous inducers but not substrates for the Hg(2+) volatilization system. With strains resistant to phenylmercury and thimerosal, these organomercurials were both inducers and substrates.
TI  - Host factor for coliphage Q beta RNA replication: presence in procaryotes and association with the 30S ribosomal subunit in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The Host Factor required for in vitro coliphage Q beta RNA replication, a heat-stable RNA binding protein present in uninfected Escherichia coli, has been detected by both immunological and functional tests in Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. It was not detectable by these criteria in Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, Caulobacter crescentus, Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Rhodopseudomonas capsulata or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In Escherichia coli the Host Factor protein has been shown to be associated with ribosomes. It is demonstrated here that this association is specific for the 30S ribosomal subunit.
TI  - Catabolism of L-lysine by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa PACI grows poorly on L-lysine as sole source of carbon but mutant derivatives which grow rapidly were readily isolated. Studies with one such mutant, P. aeruginosa PAC586, supported the existence of a route for L-lysine catabolism which differes from those reported previously in other species of Pseudomonas. The postulated route, the cadaverine or decarboxylase pathway, is initiated by the decarboxylation of L-lysine and involves the following steps: L-lysine leads to cadverine leads to I-piperideine leads 5-aminovalerate leads to glutarate semialdehyde leads glutarate. Evidence for this pathway is based on the characterization of the pathway reactions and the induction of the corresponding enzymes by growth on L-lysine. The first three enzymes were also induced by growth on cadaverine and to a lesser extent by 5-aminovalerate. No evidence was obtained for the presence of pathways involving L-lysine 2-monooxygenase or L-pipecolate dehydrogenase, but another potential route for L-lysine catabolism initiated by L-lysine 6-aminotransferase was detected. Studies with mutants unable to grow on L-lysine supported the existence of more than one catabolic pathway for L-lysine in this organism and indicated that all routes converge on a pathway for glutarate catabolism which generates acetyl-CoA. Pipecolate catabolism also appeared to converge on the glutarate pathway in P. AERUGINOSA. The results suggested that the growth rate of the parental strain is limited by the rate of transport and/or decarboxylation of L-lysine. The cadaverine pathway was present, but not so highly induced, in the parental strain P. aeruginosa PACI. Pseudomonas fluorescens contained enzymes of both the cadaverine (decarboxylase) and oxygenase pathways, strains of P. putida (biotypes A and B) contained enzymes of the oxygenase pathway but not the decarboxylase pathway and P. multivorans appeared deficient in both. All these species possessed L-lysine aminotransferase activity.
TI  - Pathways of D-fructose catabolism in species of Pseudomonas.
AB  - Cell-free extracts of D-fructose grown cells of Pseudomonas putida, P. fluorescens, P. aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, P. mendocina, P. acidovorans and P. maltophila catalyzed a P-enolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of D-fructose and contained 1-P-fructokinase activity suggesting that in these species fructose-1-P and fructose-1,6-P2 were intermediates of D-fructose catabolism. Neither the 1-P-fructokinase nor the activity catalyzing a P-enolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of D-fructose was present in significant amounts in succinate-grown cells indicating that both activities were inducible. Cell-free extracts also contained activities of fructose-1,6-P2 aldolase, fructose-1,6-P2 phosphatase, and P-hexose isomerase which could convert fructose-1,6-P2 to intermediates of either the Embden-Meyerhof pathway or Entner-Doudoroff pathway. Radiolabeling experiments with 1-14C-D-fructose suggested that in P. putida, P. aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, and P. acidovorans most of the alanine was made via the Entner-Doudoroff pathway with a minor portion being made via the Embden-Meyerhof pathway. An edd- mutant of O. putida which lacked a functional Entner-Doudoroff pathway but was able to grow on D-fructose appeared to make alanine solely via the Embden-Meyerhof pathway.
TI  - [Lysine decarboxylase in Pseudomonas aeruginosa].
AB  - The research of lysine, ornithine and arginine decarboxylases has been made for 50 strains of fluorescent Pseudomonas (P. aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, P. putida). By thin layer chromatography, all the strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the fifth of the strains of P. putida had lysine decarboxylase activity at alcaline pH (optimal pH 8) ; Pseudomonas fluorescens did not produce this decarboxylase. Arginine and ornithine decarboxylase are absent for all the strains of fluorescent Pseudomonas.
TI  - Comparative effect of methioninyl adenylate on the growth of Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The bacteriostatic effect of methioninyl adenylate(MAMP)--a specific inhibitor of the enzyme methionyl-tRNA synthetase--was investigated on Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 0.1 mM of this molecule added to the culture, inhibits the growth of S. typhimurium. The inhibition is specifically reversible by 0.1 mM L-methionine. In the same conditions even 1-2 mM MAMP has a very slight effect on the growth rate of P. aeruginosa and only during the first two generations. The same observation was made with the two other members of the fluorescens group P.fluorescens and P.putida. The growth rate of P. testosteroni with 1 mM MAMP in the medium is similar to the growth rate of P. aeruginosa but the other member of the acidovorans group P. acidovorans is much more affected by the smae concentration of the inhibitor. --P. multivorans is inhibited by MAMP like P. acidovorans but with a somewhat higher yield at the end of the culture. --MAMP has no effect on P. alcaligenes. The possible reasons for the weak bacteriostatic effect of MAMP on P. aeruginosa were investigated. It was established that the inhibitor enters the cells and is not used as a carbon and energy source. The intracellular methionine concentration in S. typhimurium and in P. aeruginosa is about the same and does not increase when bacteria are cultivated with MAMP. The MTS of the two microorganisms is inhibited by MAMP in vitro to about the same extent. Furthermore the tRNAmet from P. aeruginosa are fully acylated after 3 to 4 generations with this compound. Nevertheless MAMP elicits higher MTS activity in P. aeruginosa and in P. acidovorans after 1 h of incubation. The most striking difference between S. typhimurium and P. aeruginosa is that the intra and extracellular level of 5'phosphodiesterase which degrades MAMP is 10-20 fold higher in the second than in the first species.
TI  - [Study on biochemical activity of many strains of Pseudomonas isolated from various morbid forms (author's transl)].
AB  - The AA. refer the results of a series of bacteriological proofs on many strains of Ps. aeruginosa isolated in Messina (Italy) from various pathological matters. The proofs permit a classification of the strains as Ps. aeruginosa (91.66%) and Ps. putida (8.34%).
TI  - [About the decomposition of acetamide as taxonomic marker for some species of the genus pseudomonas (author's transl)].
AB  - The comparative examination of the acetamide-decompostition and of the acetamide-utilisation as sole source of carbon demonstrates that various groups of the Pseudomonas species with the same kind of reaction have to be distinguished. The acetamide-decomposition-test according to BUHLMANN et al. and the methylene-blue-reduction-test show homogeneous results. As a positive result of these tests the formation of ammonia has always been shown. An acetamide decomposition of this kind has been demonstrable with P. aeruginosa, P. acidovorans and many P. cepacia strains. On liquid mineral media containing acetamide P. fluorescens, P. putida and P. pseudomallei show growth although ammonia is not produced and the test according to BUHLMANN et al. as well as the methylene-blue-reduction-test result negatively. In all tests P. alcaligenes, P. marginata, P. caryophilli and with certain exceptions P. sutzeri and P. putrefaciens react negatively.
TI  - [Acetylcholinesterase activity of bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas].
AB  - The activity of acetylcholine esterase was determined in 50 strains of the Pseudomonas genus: Ps. aurantiaca (6 strains), Ps. aeruginosa (8 strains), Ps. fluorescens (31 strains), Ps. putida (1 strain), Ps. ovalis (1 strain), Ps. aureofaciens (1 strain), Ps. geniculata (1 strain), and Ps. nonliquefaciens (1 strain). The active strains of Ps. aeruginosa and Ps. aurantiaca are described.
TI  - Allantoin racemase: a new enzyme from Pseudomonas species.
AB  - 1. Allantoin racemase is a novel enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of S(+)-and R(minus)-allantoin into the racemate. 2. The enzyme is present in Pseudomonas testosteroni, Pseudomonas putida and five biotypes of Pseudomonas fluorescens, but absent in a number of other Pseudomonas species. 3. The enzyme of Ps. testosteroni was purified 133-fold and exposes optimal activity at pH 8.0-8.2 and 50 degrees C. The enzyme is stable on heating for 15 min at 70 degrees C. 4. The enzyme appeared to be specific for the optical isomers of allantoin and no cofactors are involved in the reaction. 5. The optical aspecificity of allantoinase of Proteus rettgeri was reaffirmed.
TI  - Further properties of P-2 R-factors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and their relationship to other plasmid groups.
AB  - R-factors of the P-2(prototype R-factor R931) incompatibility group of plasmidsdetected in Pseudomonas are compatible with group P,C,W, and NR-factors which areplasmids that can be transferred to Pseudomonas aeruginosa recipients. Members of the P-2 group (R130,R931) have significant homology by DNA-DNA hybridization. R-factors of the P-group (RP1, RP9) and F-group (R1) exhibited homology with P-2 R-factors but to a lesser extent than R130 with R931. Members of the I, C, and W groups showed no significant homology with P-2 R-factors. Minicircular DNA of strain 931(R931) was not homologous with R931 DNA. The host range of R931 and R130 is limited mainly to certain Pseudomonas species including P. aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, P. putida, and P. stutzeri. These R-factors could not be transferredat detectable frequencies to any member of the Enterobacteriaceae examined. R-factor-specified pili were strongly suggested by the detection of pili by electron microscopyin R-+ but not R- non-piliated mutants of P. aeruginosa strain PA01. The combinedproperties of R-factors 931 and similar R-factors reported before and in this study strongly support our previous contention that this group of R-factors form a significant new group of plasmids. A classification scheme previously proposed for plasmids occurring in Pseudomonas has been modified and four groups have been specified.
TI  - Physiological function of the Pseudomonas putida PpG6 (Pseudomonas oleovorans) alkane hydroxylase: monoterminal oxidation of alkanes and fatty acids.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida PpG6 is able to utilize purified n-alkanes of six to ten carbon atoms for growth. It can also grow on the primary terminal oxidation products of these alkanes and on 1-dodecanol but not on the corresponding 2-ketones or 1,6-hexanediol, adipic acid, or pimelic acid. Revertible point mutants can be isolated which have simultaneously lost the ability to grow on all five n-alkane growth substrates but which can still grow on octanol or nonanol. An acetate-negative mutant defective in isocitrate lysase activity is unable to grow on even-numbered alkanes and fatty acids. Analysis of double mutants defective in acetate and propionate or in acetate and glutarate metabolism shows that alkane carbon is assimilated only via acetyl-coenzyme A and propionyl-coenzyme A. These results support the following conclusions: (i) The n-alkane growth specificity of P. putida PpG6 is due to the substrate specificity of whole-cell alkane hydroxylation; (ii) there is a single alkane hydroxylase enzyme complex; (iii) the physiological role of this complex is to initiate the monoterminal oxidation of alkane chains; and (iv) straight-chain fatty acids from butyric through nonanoic are degraded exclusively by beta-oxidation from the carboxyl end of the molecule.
TI  - Antibiotic sensitivity of two Aeromonas and nine Pseudomonas species.
AB  - An agar dilution method was used to determine the in vitro sensitivity of different Pseudomonas and Aeromonas species to sulphonamide, tetracycline, colistin, gentamicin, tobramycin, amplicillin, carbenicillin, and cephalothin. P. aeruginosa was generally sensitive to carbenicillin, colistin, tobramycin, and gentamicin. P. putida and P. fluorescens were generally resistant to beta-lactam antibodies but sensitive to gentamicin and tobramycin. P. cepacia and P. maltophilia were mostly resistant to colistin, gentamicin and tobramycin. Other Pseudomonas species were usually more sensitive to the antibodies tested. Strains of Aeromonas hydrophila were mostly resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics but sensitive to other antibiotics, while strains of A. shigelloides were very sensitive to all antibiotics tested.
TI  - [Growth and antibiotic formation of bacteria of genus Pseudomonas on media with n-alkanes of low molecular weight].
AB  - The ability to assimilate n-alkanes form hexane to decane was studied among 495 collection strains and 27 freshly isolated strains belonging to the genus Pseudomonas. All freshly isolated strains and over one third of collection cultures of Ps. aurantiaca grow on mineral media with n-alkanes of low molecular weight, but do not assimilate heavy paraffins. The strains of Ps. aeruginosa, Ps. fluorescens and Ps. putida, isolated from oilbearing soils, and individual collection cultures, belonging to the two latter species, can assimilate both n-alkanes of low molecular weight (C6--C10) and heavy paraffins. Contrary to Ps. aurantiaca, other species of the Pseudomonas genus lose the ability to assimilate n-alkanes of low molecular weight after cultivation on rich organic media. An increase in the concentration of the mixture of low molecular weight paraffins (to 20 per cent by volume) has no toxic effect on the Pseudomonas bacteria whose biomass has a high content of protein and all necessary amino acids. The strains of Ps. aurantiaca produce a highly active antibiotic preparation consisting of floroglucine derivatives on the defined medium with n-alkanes of low molecular weight. The ratio between components of the preparation obtained on the media with n-alkanes and on the optimal organic media is different.
TI  - Identification of nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria in the clinical laboratory.
AB  - A simplified, concise scheme was developed for the identification of nonfermentative, gram-negative bacteria which have most frequently been reported in the literature as definite or possible agents of human disease. These organisms included apyocyanogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, P. putida, P. stutzeri, P. maltophilia, P. putrefaciens, P. cepacia, P. alcaligenes, FLAVOBACTERIUM SPECIES, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Acinetobacter anitratum (Herellea vaginicola), A. Iwoffi (Mima polymorpha), Moraxella species, Alcaligenes odorans and Alcaligenes species. The tests used for identification included production of cytochrome oxidase, amylase, deoxyribonuclease, gelatinase, urease and Beta-galactosidase; motility; oxidation of one per cent glucose and ten per cent lactose; fluorescence; indole, hydrogen sulfide and nitrogen gas production; denitrification of nitrites; growth at 42C; penicillin sensitivity and production of an aromatic odor and greenish discoloration on blood agar. Using this scheme, 85 per cent of 243 isolates (unknowns and reference strains) were identified to genus and species. Of the 15 per cent remaining, 11 per cent were identified as alkaline organisms and four per cent were unidentifiable.
TI  - Membrane filter method for the isolation and enumeration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from swimming pools.
AB  - A membrane filter technique using black membrane filters, MacConkey agar and fluorescence under ultraviolet (UV) light was investigated for the quantitative isolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from swimming pools. Three thousand four hundred forty-five samples were collected from public swimming pools and enumerated by this method over a 6-month period. Fluorescent cultures were isolated from 222 specimens. Seventy-seven of these fluorescent cultures were selected for biochemical screening, with 75 (97%) being verified as P. aeruginosa. To further assess the specificity and sensitivity of this UV screening technique, a comparative study was made of some morphological and biochemical characteristics of fluorescent pseudomonads obtained from different sources. The sensitivity of the method was unimpaired by either colony types or biochemical variations of P. aeruginosa. The failure of the other two fluorescent species, P. fluorescens and P. putida, to grow and/or fluoresce on MacConkey agar at 37 C illustrates the specificity of this technique. Further studies are needed to compare the viability of P. aeruginosa on MacConkey agar to that of efficacious nonselective media.
TI  - New gas chromatographic characterization procedure: preliminary studies on some Pseudomonas species.
AB  - Strains of saccharolytic and nonsaccharolytic Pseudomonas species were examined by a new single-step gas chromatographic characterization procedure. Cells were digested in a methanolic solution of tetramethylammonium hydroxide pentahydrate, and the digestates were subjected to gas-liquid chromatographic analysis. The chromatograms were examined for similarities and differences in their overall patterns. A single component was defined for use as an internal qualitative and quantitative standardizing component in order to develop relative retention time-relative peak height profiles of each organism. Comparison of these profiles enabled the characterization of strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. putida, P. cepacia, P. pseudomallei, P. stutzeri, P. pseudoalcaligenes, P. alcaligenes, P. diminuta, P. denitrificans, and P. acidovorans. The P. maltophilia and P. putrefaciens digestates showed chromatograms which were superficially similar yet easily distinguished as belonging to different species. The chromatograms of these two organisms were very different from those of other pseudomonads.
TI  - [Evaluation of culture media used in the differentiation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas fluorescens, isolated from clinical human material].
AB  
TI  - Pyocin sensitivity of Pseudomonas species.
AB  - Only the fluorescent pseudomonads, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. putida, and P. fluorescens, were sensitive to pyocins produced from P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Incidence and identification of Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas putida in the clinical laboratory.
AB  - Strains of Pseudomonas producing fluorescin but no pyocyanin or pyorubrin were studied by biochemical and antibiotic sensitivity testing. A rapid nitrate test was found to be useful in distinguishing P. aeruginosa (positive) from P. fluorescens and P. putida (both negative). A shortened gelatin test differentiated P. fluorescens (positive) from P. putida (negative). P. fluorescens and P. putida were very sensitive to low levels of kanamycin and resistant to carbenicillin, a pattern just the opposite of that obtained with P. aeruginosa.
TI  - In vitro antibiotic susceptibility of pseudomonads other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa recovered from cancer patients.
AB  - The increase in occurrence of infections due to opportunistic gram-negative bacilli in patients with impaired host defenses emphasizes the need for information on the antibiotic susceptibility of the organisms that colonize such patients. During a 20-month period, more than 100 pseudomonads which were not Pseudomonas aeruginosa were recovered from cancer patients at the Baltimore Cancer Research Center. These included P. fluorescens, P. putida, P. multivorans (cepacia), P. maltophilia, P. stutzeri, P. alcaligenes, and P. pseudoalcaligenes. Susceptibility tests with 12 antibiotics indicated that the intraspecies antibiograms for many of these species were more uniform than those of P. aeruginosa. The stability of susceptibility patterns allowed the antibiograms to be used as aids in the preliminary differentiation of these organisms. Variable antibiogram patterns were noted among certain species, i.e., P. fluorescens, P. stutzeri, and P. multivorans, whereas each of the other species had essentially one pattern. These in vitro studies showed that some of the Pseudomonas species other than P. aeruginosa were resistant to a number of antibiotics. Among these were antibiotics that are in general use for P. aeruginosa infections. Such differences in antibiotic susceptibilities emphasize the necessity for careful speciation of this group of microorganisms to assure proper epidemiological documentation of colonization and infection, as well as to ensure therapy with an antimicrobial agent to which the organism is susceptible in vitro.
TI  - Genetic basis of the biodegradation of salicylate in Pseudomonas.
AB  - The genetic basis of the biodegradation of salicylate in Pseudomonas putida R1 has been studied. This strain utilizes the meta pathway for oxidizing salicylate through formation of catechol and 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde. The enzymes of the meta pathway are induced by salicylate but not by catechol, and the genes specifying these enzymes are clustered. The gene cluster can be eliminated from some salicylate-positive cells by treatment with mitomycin C and appears to exist inside the cell as an extrachromosomal element. This extrachromosomal gene cluster, termed the SAL plasmid, can be transferred by conjugation from P. putida R1 to a variety of other Pseudomonas species.
TI  - Deoxyribonucleic acid homologies among some Pseudomonas species.
AB  - Phylogenetic relationships among a number of strains belonging to the genus Pseudomonas were explored by the use of in vitro deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) hybridization. The fluorescent nomenspecies (P. fluorescens, P. putida, P. aeruginosa, P. cichorii, P. syringae, and related species), as well as the nonfluorescent species P. stutzeri, P. mendocina, P. alcaligenes, and P. pseudoalcaligenes, were shown to belong to a single DNA homology complex which is isolated from other Pseudomonas species that have been studied [P. cepacia (= P. multivorans), P. caryophylli, P. marginata (= P. alliicola), P. pseudomallei, P. acidovorans, P. testosteroni, P. solanacearum, P. diminuta, P. facilis, P. delafieldii, P. saccharophila, P. palleronii]. A limited numerical analysis of the phenotypic properties of the examined strains supported, with some exceptions, their previous allocation to nomenspecies and biotypes. The internal structure and nomenclature of the "P. fluorescens homology complex" are discussed.

TI  - Characterization of Pseudomonas species isolated from clinical specimens.
AB  - More than 90 morphological and physiological characters of 227 strains of pseudomonads isolated from clinical specimens and 16 reference strains are described. The clinical isolates included P. aeruginosa (apyocyanogenic), P. fluorescens, P. putida, P. pseudomallei, P. cepacia, P. acidovorans, P. alcaligenes, P. pseudoalcaligenes, P. stutzeri, P. putrefaciens, P. maltophilia, and P. diminuta.
TI  - Anthranilate synthase enzyme system and complementation in Pseudomonas species.
AB  - Anthranilate synthase in Pseudomonas putida is a two component enzyme system. The proteins, termed AS I and AS II, have respective molecular weights of 65,000 and 18,000. Five additional Pseudomonas species, both tryptophan requiring and independent strains, were examined and all were shown to contain similar two component systems. Anthranilate formation by "amide transfer," with L-glutamine as nitrogen donor, requires both proteins; "amination," utilizing ammonium ion, proceeds at pH 9 with only the larger component, AS I. The product of the P. putida trpA gene, AS I, carries the chorismate binding and tryptophan feedback inhibition sites whereas the smaller component, AS II, functions in glutamine binding. We have not been able to prepare mutants lacking AS II activity nor have other catalytic activities been detected for this protein. The second step unique to tryptophan biosynthesis is catalyzed by phosphoribosyl transferase, in P. putida the trpB gene product. Phosphoribosyl transferase, EC 2.4.2.14, is separable from both AS I and II, and is not required for anthranilate synthesis. This chromosomal and protein organization differs from the array found in the enteric bacteria where phosphoribosyl transferase carries also the AS CoII enzymic activity.Among the six Pseudomonas species examined, two groups may be distinguished on the basis of subunit complementation, the putida-aeruginosa (p-a), and the acidovorans-testosteroni (c-t). Within these groups the hybrid enzymes are equivalent in activity to the native enzyme and the level of subunits required is comparable. Between the groups the hybrid enzymes are lower in activity than either native form. The c-t components separate with difficulty and the aggregate appears to be larger than the more freely dissociable p-a complex. P. stutzeri resembles the p-a class and P. multivorans the c-t class.
TI  - Transduction and genetic homology between Pseudomonas species putida and aeruginosa.
AB  - Genetic crosses occur by transduction between the species Pseudomonas aeruginosa  and P. putida. The frequency relative to intraspecific transfer is reduced and varies among markers, suggesting that these genomes contain discrete regions of homology and nonhomology.
TI  - Comparative immunological studies of two Pseudomonas enzymes.
AB  - Crystalline preparations of muconate lactonizing enzyme and muconolactone isomerase, two inducible enzymes that catalyze successive steps in the catechol branch of the beta-ketoadipate pathway, were used to prepare antisera. Both enzymes were isolated from a strain of Pseudomonas putida biotype A. The antisera did not cross-react with enzymes of the same bacterial strain that catalyze the chemically analogous steps in the protocatechuate branch of the beta-ketoadipate pathway, carboxymuconate lactonizing enzyme and carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase. The antisera gave heterologous cross-reactions of varying intensities with the muconate lactonizing enzymes and muconolactone isomerases of P. putida biotype B, P. aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, and all biotypes of P. fluorescens, but did not cross-react with the isofunctional enzymes of P. acidovorans, of P. multivorans, and of two bacterial species that belong to other genera. The evolutionary and taxonomic implications of the findings are discussed.
TI  - Evaluation of media for differentiating nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria of medical significance.
AB  - An evaluation was made of media and tests used for differentiating nonfermenting  gram-negative bacteria encountered in medical bacteriology in order to determine those diagnostic procedures most useful in identifying these bacteria. The organisms examined included Alcaligenes faecalis, A. odorans var. viridans, Moraxella duplex (Mima polymorpha var. oxidans), Acinetobacter anitratum (Herellea vaginicola), A. lwoffi (Mima polymorpha), Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. putida, P. maltophilia, P. pseudomallei, P. stutzeri, P. alcaligenes, and atypical strains of P. aeruginosa. The media and tests evaluated included Sellers' medium; Hugh and Leifson's OF medium; acid production from 10% lactose infusion agar; gluconate oxidation; starch, aesculin, and Tween 80 hydrolysis; lysine decarboxylase, arginine dihydrolase, deoxyribonuclease, and tyrosinase activity; tolerance to triphenyl tetrazolium chloride, cetrimide, cadmium sulfate, 2.5% and 6.5% sodium chloride, and pH 5.6; utilization of glucose, acetamide, and malonate.
TI  - Genetic control of the beta-ketoadipate pathway in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The regulation and genetic control of the beta-ketoadipate pathway in Pseudomonas aeruginosa were investigated. The pattern of enzyme induction is apparently the same as in P. putida. Mutants were obtained for all but 1 of the 11 structural genes; the proximity of these genes on the chromosome was examined by transduction of the mutants with phage F116. If a group of enzymes was induced by the same compounds, the corresponding genes were closely clustered. Surprisingly, some locispecifying enzymes not sharing a common inducer were also clustered. It is suggested that this latter finding may indicate a degree of chromosomal specialization.
TI  - Characterization of bacteriophage gh-1 for Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Lee, Lucy F. (Michigan State University, East Lansing), and J. A. Boezi. Characterization of bacteriophage gh-1 for Pseudomonas putida. J. Bacteriol. 92:1821-1827. 1966.-Bacteriophage gh-1 of Pseudomonas putida A.3.12 was isolated and purified by differential centrifugation and diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulose chromatography. An electron micrograph of the phage stained with uranyl acetate revealed a regular hexagonal outline about 50 mmu across with a short wedge-shaped tail attached at one corner of the head. The phage formed 10% as many plaques on P. putida C1S as on P. putida A.3.12, the organism used in the isolation procedure. No plaques were formed on P. fluorescens (ATCC 9712) or P. aeruginosa. The latent period of the infectious cycle was 21 min, and the average burst size was 103. The nucleic acid component of gh-1 is double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), with a base composition of 57.0% guanine plus cytosine (G + C) as determined by chemical analysis. The per cent G + C of P. putida A.3.12 DNA measured in a similar manner was 63.7%. The buoyant density of phage gh-1 measured by cesium chloride equilibrium centrifugation was 1.45 g/cm(3), whereas that of gh-1 DNA, heat-denatured gh-1 DNA, and P. putida A.3.12 DNA was 1.716, 1.730, and 1.722 g/cm(3), respectively. The per cent G + C of gh-1 DNA and P. putida A.3.12 DNA calculated from the buoyant densities was 57.1 and 63.3%, respectively. The sedimentation coefficients, S(50) (20,w), of gh-1 and the phenol-extracted gh-1 DNA, measured by the boundary sedimentation velocity method, were 460 and 18.9, respectively. The molecular weight of phenol-extracted gh-1 DNA, calculated by use of the equation of Burgi and Hershey, is 6 x 10(6).
