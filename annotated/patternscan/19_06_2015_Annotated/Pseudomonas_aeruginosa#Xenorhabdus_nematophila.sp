TI  == examining reaction specificity in pvcb, a source of diversity in isonitrile-containing natural products.
AB  == many bacteria produce isonitrile-containing natural products that are derived from aromatic amino acids. the synthetic clusters that control biosynthesis most  commonly encode two enzymes, designated pvca and pvcb, as well as additional enzymes that direct synthesis of the natural product. the pvca enzyme installs the isonitrile moiety at the amino group of either tyrosine or tryptophan, as dictated by the particular pathway. the common pathway intermediate produced by pvca is directed toward different ultimate products by pvcb, a member of the family of fe(2+), alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenases. to continue our investigation of the structural and functional properties of the isonitrile biosynthetic pathways, we present here a study of the pvcb homologues from three  organisms. two pathways, derived from pseudomonas aeruginosa and xenorhabdus nematophila, produce known products. a third pvcb homologue from erwinia amylovora is part of an uncharacterized pathway. our results demonstrate the diversity of reactions catalyzed. although all pvcb enzymes catalyze the hydroxylation of the tyrosine isonitrile substrate, the elimination of the hydroxyl in pseudomonas and erwinia is driven by deprotonation at calpha, resulting in the initial production of an unsaturated tyrosine isonitrile product that then cyclizes to a coumarin derivative. pvcb from xenorhabdus, in contrast,  catalyzes the same oxygenation, but loss of the hydroxyl group is accompanied by  decarboxylation of the intermediate. steady-state kinetic analysis of the three reactions and a docking model for the binding of the tyrosine isonitrile substrate in the pvcb active site highlight subtle differences between the pvcb homologues.

TI  == purification and characterization of an extracellular protease from xenorhabdus nematophila involved in insect immunosuppression.
AB  == xenorhabdus nematophila, a bacterium pathogenic for insects associated with the nematode steinernema carpocapsae, releases high quantities of proteases, which may participate in the virulence against insects. zymogram assays and cross-reactions of antibodies suggested that two distinct proteases were present. the major one, protease ii, was purified and shown to have a molecular mass of 60 kda and an estimated isoelectric point of 8.5. protease ii digested the chromogenic substrate n-tosyl-gly-pro-arg-paranitroanilide (pna) with v(max) and  k(m) values of 0.0551 microm/min and 234 microm, respectively, and the substrate  dl-val-leu-arg-pna with v(max) and k(m) values of 0.3830 microm/min and 429 microm, respectively. protease ii activity was inhibited 93% by pefabloc sc and 45% by chymostatin. the optimum ph for protease ii was 7, and the optimum temperature was 23c. proteolytic activity was reduced by 90% at 60 degrees c for  10 min. sequence analysis was performed on four internal peptides that resulted from the digestion of protease ii. fragments 29 and 45 are 75 and 68% identical to alkaline metalloproteinase produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa. fragment 29 is  79% identical to a metalloprotease of erwinia amylovora and 75% identical to the  protease c precursor of erwinia chrysanthemi. protease ii showed no toxicity to hemocytes but destroyed antibacterial activity on the hemolymph of inoculated insects' larvae and reduced 97% of the cecropin a bacteriolytic activity.
