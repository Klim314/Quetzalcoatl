TI  == production of humic substances through coal-solubilizing bacteria.
AB  == in this paper, the production of humic substances (hs) through the bacterial solubilization of low rank coal (lrc) was evaluated. the evaluation was carried out by 19 bacterial strains isolated in microenvironments with high contents of coal wastes. the biotransformed lrc and the hs produced were quantified in vitro  in a liquid growth medium. the humic acids (ha) obtained from the most active bacterial strain were characterized via elemental composition (c, h, n, o), ir analyses, and the e4/e6 ratio; they were then compared with the ha extracted chemically using naoh. there was lrc biotransformation ranged from 25 to 37%, and hs production ranged from 127 to 3100 mg . l(-1). more activity was detected in the isolated strains of bacillus mycoides, microbacterium sp, acinetobacter sp, and enterobacter aerogenes. the ha produced by b. mycoides had an ir spectrum and an e4/e6 ratio similar to those of the ha extracted with naoh, but their elemental composition and their degree of aromatic condensation was different. results suggest that these bacteria can be used to exploit the lrc resulting from coal mining activities and thus produce hs in order to improve the content of humified organic matter in soils.

TI  == differential activity of a lectin from solieria filiformis against human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == a lectin isolated from the red alga solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). the lectin (500 microg/ml) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus sp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/ml but the lectin (10-1000 microg/ml) had no effect on  the growth of the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and b. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. it is possible that the interaction of s. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium b. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml. the stimulation of the growth of b.  cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/ml), its hapten. thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. the present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.

AB  == the algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on chromagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (ind), lysine decarboxylase (ldc), and ornithine decarboxylase (odc) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, ind positive (ind(+)), escherichia coli; metallic blue, ind(+), ldc(+), and odc negative (odc(-)), klebsiella oxytoca; ind(+), ldc(-), and odc(+), citrobacter diversus; ind(+) or ind(-), ldc(-), and odc(-), citrobacter freundii; ind(-), ldc(+), and odc(+), enterobacter aerogenes; ind(-), ldc(-), and odc(+), enterobacter cloacae; ind(-), ldc(+), and odc(-), klebsiella pneumoniae;  diffuse brown and ind(+), morganella morganii; ind(-), proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, serratia marcescens; bluish green and ind(+), proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. during an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. a total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on chromagar orientation medium. for 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. the cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. the results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. in addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == the effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage.
AB  == the effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage was  investigated in a container leakage model system (clms). the leakage of acinetobacter calcoaceticus, staphylococcus sp., pseudomonas sp., bacillus sp., a coryneform, staph. aureus, and two biotest organisms (enterobacter cloacae nc1b 8151 and ent. aerogenes mb31) was studied. the rate of bacterial leakage (log10 cells/channel/s) was greater in the presence of a partial vacuum of 51-305 mm hg  than at atmospheric pressure. fluid flow (ml) through leakage channels was increased by the application of vacuum. leakage varied with vacuum, bacterial morphology, cell concentration, leakage channel size (0.78-120 micron 2) and channel shape (straight or convoluted). the number of leaked cells was not proportional to vacuum or channel size. the effect of channel shape varied with bacterial species. increased container medium viscosity decreased bacterial leakage. fluid flow through leakage channels was generally reduced by the most viscous solution. cells from biofilms and monolayers of ac. calcoaceticus or staph. aureus attached to nylon (hyfax) or stainless steel surfaces underwent leakage. mixed bacterial populations had characteristic leakage rates against vacuum different from the leakage pattern of individual species in the population. the composition of the leaked population was different from the original inoculum. the results indicated that container leakage is a complex process involving a range of interdependent factors.

TI  == microbial conversion of dl-2-amino-delta2-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid to l-cysteine and l-cystine: screening of microorganisms and identification of products.
AB  == microorganisms able to form l-cysteine from dl-2-amino-delta2-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid (dl-atc), a chemical intermediate  in the synthesis of dl-cysteine, were isolated from soil samples and classified as pseudomonas sp., pseudomonas cohaerens, p. desmolytica, and p. ovalis. thirteen l-cysteine-producing bacteria were also found in among 463 stock cultures representing 37 genera. these were achromobacter delmarvae. alcaligenes  denitrificans, bacillus brevis, brevibacterium flavum, enterobacter aerogenes, erwinia carotovora, escherichia coli, micrococcus sodonensis, myocoplana dimorpha, sarcina lutea, serratia marcescens, flavobacterium acidoficum, and pseudomonas ovalis. in the presence of intact cells of pseudomonas sp. aj 3854, 6.1 mg of l-cysteine and/or l-cystine per ml was produced from 10 mg of dl-atc-3h2o per ml in a molar yield of 100%. this finding suggests that racemization and asymmetric hydrolysis occurred simultaneously in this incubation mixture. after the complete oxidation of cysteine to cystine by aeration in the presence of ferrous ion, crystalline cystine was isolated; its configuration was  the l isomer based on data from x-ray diffraction, microbioassay, and optical rotation studies.

TI  == formation of methyl mercury by bacteria.
AB  == twenty-three hg2+-resistant cultures were isolated from sediment of the savannah  river in georgia; of these, 14 were gram-negative short rods belonging to the genera escherichia and enterobacter, six were gram-positive cocci (three staphylococcus sp. and three streptococcus sp.) and three were bacillus sp. all the escherichia, enterobacter, and the bacillus strain were more resistant to hg2+ than the strains of staphylococci and streptococci. adaptation using serial  dilutions and concentration gradient agar plate techniques showed that it was possible to select a hg2+-resistant strain from a parent culture identified as enterobacter aerogenes. this culture resisted 1,200 mug of hg2+ per ml of medium  and produced methyl mercury from hgcl2, but was unable to convert hg2+ to volatile elemental mercury (hg0). under constant aeration (i.e., submerged culture), slightly more methyl mercury was formed than in the absence of aeration. production of methyl mercury was cyclic in nature and slightly decreased if dl-homocysteine was present in media, but increased with methylcobalamine. it is concluded that the bacterial production of methyl mercury may be a means of resistance and detoxification against mercurials in which inorganic hg2+ is converted to organic form and secreted into the environment.

TI  == degradation of uric acid by certain aerobic bacteria.
AB  == we have isolated and identified nine cultures of aerobic bacteria capable of growing on an elective medium containing uric acid as the only source of carbon,  nitrogen, and energy. four of these cultures were identified as aerobacter aerogenes, two as klebsiella pneumoniae, and the remainder as serratia killiensis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacillus species. another culture identified as p. fluorescens required both glucose and uric acid for growth. when 23 laboratory stock cultures were inoculated into the uric acid medium, a. aerogenes, b. subtilis, mycobacterium phlei, p. aeruginosa, and s. marcescens were able to grow. these five cultures also grew when the uric acid was replaced  with adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, or allantoin, but growth was poor. in all of these media, including the uric acid medium, addition of glucose along  with the nitrogenous compounds yielded good growth. induction experiments demonstrated that the ability of a. aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, p. fluorescens, s. kiliensis, s. marcescens, b. subtilis, and bacillus sp. to degrade uric acid is an induced property. of these organisms, only bacillus sp. accumulated a small amount of intracellular uric acid.

TI  == repression of staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria. ii. causes of inhibition.
AB  == two food bacteria, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas sp. cs-1, inhibited an enterotoxigenic strain of staphylococcus aureus, apparently by out-competing it for nutrients. five others, bacillus cereus, proteus vulgaris, escherichia coli h-52, aerobacter aerogenes, and achromobacter sp., inhibited by means of antibiotic substances which were seitz-filterable, dialyzable, and stable at 90 c for 10 min. inhibition was not caused by changes in ph, oxidation-reduction potential, or production of peroxide or fatty acids. the concentrated antibiotic  material from e. coli h-52 contained amino acids but not peptides and was especially effective against staphylococci and micrococci.
