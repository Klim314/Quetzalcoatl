TI  - Expression of heparinase I of Bacteroides stercoris HJ-15 and its degradation tendency toward heparin-like glycosaminoglycans.
AB  - Recombinant heparinase I was cloned from Bacteroides stercoris HJ-15 (BSrhepI), overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and intensively characterized. The complete gene of BSrhepI was identified by Southern blotting, and was overexpressed as an inclusion body. The inclusion body was solubilized with 4 M guanidine-HCl, and the denatured BSrhepI was easily purified using Ni(2+)-affinity column chromatography. The purified but denatured enzyme was then successfully refolded by dialysis against 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) containing 1mM DTT and CaCl(2). BSrhepI was most active in 50mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl(2), and 1 mM DTT (pH 7.0) at 37 degrees C. This enzyme digested not only heparin, but also heparan sulfate. Through comparative HPLC-analysis of each degraded product of heparin and heparan sulfate by digestion with BSrhepI or flavobacterial heparinase I, we verified that BSrhepI has a broader spectrum of substrate specificities than other reported heparinases.
TI  - Cloning, overexpression, and characterization of recombinant heparinase III from  Bacteroides stercoris HJ-15.
AB  - Recombinant heparinase III (rHepIII) from Bacteroides stercoris HJ-15 was cloned, expressed, and characterized. The full-length heparinase III gene from B. stercoris HJ-15 was identified by Southern blotting, and the sequence was deposited in GenBank. The heparinase III gene, which is 2,001-bp long, was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli; highly active rHepIII was easily purified using only one step of immobilized Ni(2+) affinity column chromatography. Enzymatic properties and substrate specificities of rHepIII were assessed, and its kinetic constants were calculated. rHepIII was most active in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer with 350 mM NaCl (pH 6.6) at 45 degrees C. Through amino acid modification studies and site-directed mutagenesis assay, cysteines and histidines were identified as crucial residues for enzymatic activity. Moreover, this enzyme digested not only heparan sulfate but also heparin and hyaluronic acid, and their degradation products were verified by strong anion exchange/high-performance liquid chromatography. These characteristics, including active residues and substrate specificities were interesting compared with those of existing heparinase III from other species. We anticipate that the convenience of purification and the characteristics of this enzyme will make it a powerful tool for studies of glycosaminoglycans and their lyases.
TI  - Cloning, expression and characterization of acharan sulfate-degrading heparin lyase II from Bacteroides stercoris HJ-15.
AB  - AIMS: This study focused on the cloning, expression and characterization of recombinant heparinase II (rHepII) from Bacteroides stercoris HJ-15. METHODS AND RESULTS: The heparinase II gene from Bact. stercoris HJ-15 was identified by Southern blotting and the sequence was deposited in GenBank. The gene was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and rHepII was purified using two simple ion-exchange column chromatography steps. Enzymatic properties and substrate specificities of rHepII were assessed and its kinetic constants were calculated. Heparin-like glycosaminoglycans (HLGAGs) were digested with rHepII under optimal reaction conditions, and the products were analysed by SAX-HPLC. CONCLUSIONS: The heparinase II gene is 2322-bp long and consists of 773 amino acids. rHepII is most active in 50 mmol l(-1) sodium phosphate buffer with 75 mmol l(-1) NaCl (pH 7.4) at 32 degrees C, and the activity is stable at 4 degrees C for 15 days on storage. Acharan sulfate is the best substrate for rHepII, followed by heparan sulfate and heparin. The major degradation products were verified as highly sulfated disaccharides through SAX-HPLC analysis. It means that rHepII prefers iduronic acid over glucuronic acid on the HLGAG structure. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides easy and certain means for obtaining large amounts of pure rHepII and also provides important information regarding the tendencies of this enzyme and its digested products. rHepII digests HLGAGs in a different manner than heparinases from Flavobacterium heparinum; therefore, we anticipate that rHepII will be a powerful tool for studies of GAGs and GAGs lyases.
TI  - Cloning and expression of chondroitinase AC from Bacteroides stercoris HJ-15.
AB  - Enzymes that degrade glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) can help reveal the biological roles, structure, and mechanisms of GAGs. We cloned chondroitinase AC, which can degrade chondroitin sulfates A and C, from the genomic library of Bacteroides stercoris HJ-15 isolated from human intestine. The probe (1.4 kb) for the chondroitinase AC gene was prepared from the PCR product of the primers produced using two internal amino acid sequences of chondroitinase AC purified from B. stercoris HJ-15. Using this probe, a chondroitinase AC-positive, 4 kb DNA fragment was selected from pKF3 vector gene libraries containing 2.5-4.5 kb DNA fragments digested with HindIII. The amino acid sequence of the cloned chondroitinase AC showed 41% homology to that of Flavobacterium heparinum. The cloned chondroitinase AC gene was expressed under the T7 promoter of the expression vector, pET-26b+, in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified using His bind column chromatography. The expressed chondroitinase AC potently degraded chondroitin sulfates A and C.
