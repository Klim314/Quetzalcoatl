myxinidin, a novel antimicrobial peptide from the epidermal mucus of hagfish, myxine glutinosa l.
fish epidermal mucus contains innate immune components that provide a first line  of defense against various infectious pathogens. this study reports the bioassay-guided fractionation and characterization of a novel antimicrobial peptide, myxinidin, from the acidic epidermal mucus extract of hagfish (myxine glutinosa l.). edman sequencing and mass spectrometry revealed that myxinidin consists of 12 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 1,327.68 da. myxinidin showed activity against a broad range of bacteria and yeast pathogens at minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) ranging from 1.0 to 10.0 microg/ml. screened pathogens, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium c610, escherichia coli d31, aeromonas salmonicida a449, yersinia ruckeri 96-4, and listonella anguillarum 02-11 were found to be highly sensitive to myxinidin at the mbc of 1.0-2.5 microg/ml; staphylococcus epidermis c621 and yeast (candida albicans c627) had an mbc of 10.0 microg/ml. the antimicrobial activity of myxinidin was found to be two to 16 times more active than a potent fish-derived antimicrobial peptide, pleurocidin (nrc-17), against most of the screened pathogens. the microbicidal activity of myxinidin was retained in the presence of sodium chloride (nacl) at concentrations up to 0.3 m and had no hemolytic activity against mammalian red blood cells. these results suggest that myxinidin may have potential applications in fish and human therapeutics.
synergy of histone-derived peptides of coho salmon with lysozyme and flounder pleurocidin.
recent research has identified endogenous cationic antimicrobial peptides as important factors in the innate immunity of many organisms, including fish. it is known that antimicrobial activity, as well as lysozyme activity, can be induced in coho salmon (oncorhynchus kisutch) mucus after exposure of the fish to infectious agents. since lysozyme alone does not have antimicrobial activity against vibrio anguillarum and aeromonas salmonicida, a four-step protein purification protocol was used to isolate and identify antibacterial fractions from bacterially challenged coho salmon mucus and blood. the purification consisted of extraction with hot acetic acid, extraction and concentration on a c(18) cartridge, gel filtration, and reverse-phase chromatography on a c(18) column. n-terminal amino acid sequence analyses revealed that both the blood and the mucus antimicrobial fractions demonstrated identity with the n terminus of trout h1 histone. mass spectroscopic analysis indicated the presence of the entire histone, as well as fragments thereof, including a 26-amino-acid n-terminal segment. these fractions inhibited the growth of antibiotic-supersuscptible salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, as well as a. salmonicida and v. anguillarum. synthetic peptides identical to the n-terminally acetylated or c-terminally amidated 26-amino-acid fragment were inactive in antimicrobial assays, but they potentiated the antimicrobial activities of the flounder peptide pleurocidin, lysozyme, and crude lysozyme-containing extracts from coho salmon. the peptides bound specifically to anionic lipid monolayers. however, synergy with pleurocidin did not appear to occur at the cell membrane level. the synergistic activities of inducible histone peptides indicate that they play an important role in the first line of salmon defenses against infectious pathogens and that while some histone fragments may have direct antimicrobial effects, others improve existing defenses.
