TI  == physical impaction injury effects on bacterial cells during spread plating influenced by cell characteristics of the organisms.
AB  == aims: to understand the factors that contribute to the variations in colony-forming units (cfu) in different bacteria during spread plating. methods and results: employing a mix culture of vegetative cells of ten organisms varying in cell characteristics (gram reaction, cell shape and cell size), spread plating to the extent of just drying the agar surface (50-60 s) was tested in comparison  with the alternate spotting-and-tilt-spreading (sats) approach where 100 mul inoculum was distributed by mere tilting of plate after spotting as 20-25 microdrops. the former imparted a significant reduction in cfu by 20% over the spreader-independent sats approach. extending the testing to single organisms, gram-negative proteobacteria with relatively larger cells (escherichia, enterobacter, agrobacterium, ralstonia, pantoea, pseudomonas and sphingomonas spp.) showed significant cfu reduction with spread plating except for slow-growing methylobacterium sp., while those with small rods (xenophilus sp.) and cocci (acinetobacter sp.) were less affected. among gram-positive nonspore formers, staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant cfu reduction while staphylococcus haemolyticus and actinobacteria (microbacterium, cellulosimicrobium and brachybacterium spp.) with small rods/cocci were unaffected. vegetative cells of bacillus pumilus and b. subtilis were generally unaffected while others with larger rods (b. thuringiensis, brevibacillus, lysinibacillus and paenibacillus spp.) were significantly affected. a simulated plating study coupled with live-dead bacterial staining endorsed the chances of cell disruption with spreader impaction in afflicted organisms. conclusions: significant reduction in cfu could occur during spread plating due to physical impaction injury to bacterial cells depending on the spreader usage and the variable effects on different organisms are determined by gram reaction, cell size and cell shape. the inoculum spreader could impart physical disruption of vegetative cells against a hard surface. significance and impact of study: possibility of cfu reduction in sensitive organisms and the skewed selection of hardier organisms during spread plating, and the recommendation of sats as an easier and safer alternative for cfu enumerations.

TI  == stability of microbial communities in goat milk during a lactation year: molecular approaches.
AB  == the microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of  lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of  breeding conditions on their composition. the diversity of microbial communities  was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16s and 18s rdna sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16s rdna from clone libraries (six milks). the stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis of variable region v3 of the 16s rrna gene and variable region v4 of the 18s rrna gene. one hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed. in addition to species commonly encountered  in milk, such as lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus caprae, staphylococcus equorum, micrococcus sp., kocuria sp., pantoea agglomerans and pseudomonas putida, sequences were affiliated to other species only described in cheeses, such as corynebacterium variabile, arthrobacter sp., brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, clostridium sp. and rothia sp. several halophilic species atypical in milk were found, belonging to jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, salinicoccus sp., dietza maris, exiguobacterium, ornithinicoccus sp. and hahella chejuensis. the yeast community  was composed of debaryomyces hansenii, kluyveromyces lactis, trichosporon beigelii, rhodotorula glutinis, rhodotorula minuta, candida pararugosa, candida intermedia, candida inconspicua, cryptococcus curvatus and cryptococcus magnus. the analyses of microbial counts and microbial sscp profiles both distinguished four groups of milks corresponding to four periods defined by season and feeding  regime. the microbial community was stable within each period. milks from winter  were characterized by lactococcus and pseudomonas, those from summer by p. agglomerans and klebsiella and those from autumn by chryseobacterium indologenes, acinetobacter baumanii, staphylococcus, corynebacteria and yeasts. however, the composition of the community can vary according to factors other than feeding. this study opens new investigation fields in the field of raw milk microbial ecology.

TI  == nature of bacteria found on some wards in sultan qaboos university hospital, oman.
AB  == this study aims to determine what objects lying in the hospital environment or brought in from outside contribute to the introduction of bacteria associated with nosocomial infections. one hundred swab specimens collected from children's  toys, sinks, door handles, telephone handsets and flowers brought into the hospital were plated on different culture media. colonial growth on the media was purified and identified subsequently using standard bacteriological methods. of the 100 samples cultured, 61 (61%) grew a range of bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=14, 23.0%), acinetobacter spp. (n=13, 21.3%), serratia spp. (n=9, 14.7%), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=9, 14.7%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=4, 6.6%), staphylococcus aureus (n=4, 6.6%), enterobacter cloacae (n=3, 4.9%), pantoea sp. (n=2, 3.3%), chryseobacterium sp. (n=2, 3.3%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1, 1.6%). although all the serratia, enterobacter, klebsiella and pantoea species isolates showed varying degrees of resistance to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and cefotaxime, all were resistant to ampicillin. chryseobacterium and stenotrophomonas species isolates were resistant to amikacin, imipenem, gentamicin and ceftazidime, to which only three isolates of pseudomonas species were resistant. all the staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to methicillin. although there has been no major outbreak of a nosocomial infection in the hospital, it is strongly recommended that effective control measures (e.g., sampling the hospital water supply, disinfecting children's toys, use of appropriate hand washing and checking some of the disinfectants for presence of bacteria) are needed. these measures are necessary  to ensure that the antibiotic-resistant strains identified in this study are not  allowed to spread in the hospital.
