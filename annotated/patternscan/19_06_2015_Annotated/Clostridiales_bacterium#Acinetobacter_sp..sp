TI  == a novel lignin degradation bacterial consortium for efficient pulping.
AB  == a lignin degradation bacterial consortium named ldc was screened from the sludge  of a reeds pond by a restricted subculture. it could break down 60.9% lignin in reeds at 30 degrees c under conditions of static culture within 15 days. in order to analyze the diversity of ldc, plate isolation, 16s rdna clone library and ardra (amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis) were performed. six bacterial strains were isolated from ldc and eighteen dna phylotypes were identified from 230 bacterial analyzed clones. they were classified into clostridiales(9.1%), geovibrio thiophilus (5.1%), desulfomicrobium (10.9%), pseudomonas sp. (25.2%), azoarcus sp. (5.1%), thauera (5.1%), paenibacillus sp. (5.1%), cohnella sp. (2.2%), acinetobacter sp. (3.1%), microbacterium (7.8%), and uncultured bacterium (21.3%). in addition, physical characteristics of paper hand-sheets between biological pretreatment and chemical pretreatment were compared. the results showed that ldc had the capability of lignin degradation and was efficient for pulping, which would provide a new choice for biopulping.
