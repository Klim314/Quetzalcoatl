TI  == in vitro efficacy of cefovecin against anaerobic bacteria isolated from subgingival plaque of dogs and cats with periodontal disease.
AB  == periodontal disease is a common disease of dogs and cats often requiring antimicrobial treatment as an adjunct to mechanical debridement. however, correct compliance with oral antimicrobial therapy in companion animals is often difficult. cefovecin is a recently introduced veterinary cephalosporin that has demonstrated prolonged concentrations in extracellular fluid, allowing for dosing intervals of up to 14 days. subgingival samples were collected from the oral cavity of 29 dogs and eight cats exhibiting grade 2 or grade 3 periodontal disease. samples were cultivated on wilkin chalgrens agar and incubated in an anaerobic chamber for seven days. selected anaerobic bacteria were isolated and identified to species level using 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined for cefovecin and six additional antimicrobials using the agar dilution methodology recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute. the 65 clinical isolates were identified as porphyromonas gulae (n = 45), porphyromonas crevioricanis (n = 12), porphyromonas macacae (n = 1), porphyromonas cangingivalis (n = 1) fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 2), fusobacterium russii (n = 1) and solobacterium moorei (n = 3). this is the first report of s. moorei being isolated from companion animals with periodontal  disease. all isolates were highly susceptible to cefovecin, with a mic90 of </=0.125 mug/ml. conversely, different resistance rates to ampicillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin between isolates were detected. cefovecin is thus shown to be effective in vitro against anaerobic bacteria isolated from dogs and  cats with periodontal disease.

TI  == in vitro growth characteristics and volatile sulfur compound production of solobacterium moorei.
AB  == solobacterium moorei has recently been implicated as a causative agent of halitosis. in vitro experiments to evaluate the role of s. moorei in halitosis have, however, been complicated by a paucity of information on the ideal conditions for culturing this organism. this work aimed to optimize a liquid culture medium for s. moorei, and to determine the growth-curve of the organism.  further, the ability of s. moorei to generate volatile sulfur compounds was investigated and compared quantitatively to other oral anaerobes by an optimized  head-space gas chromatography method. serum-supplementation of standard liquid growth media gave greater growth of s. moorei than non-supplemented broths, with  the best medium found to be serum-supplemented tryptone soya broth. s. moorei was able to metabolize cysteine directly to hydrogen sulfide, but was unable to produce methanethiol from methionine. s. moorei produced 2-3 times more hydrogen  sulfide (normalized for colony forming units) than porphyromonas gingivalis and veillonella dispar, but considerably less than fusobacterium nucleatum. the study has identified reliable growth conditions for culture of s. moorei, which were employed to show that s. moorei has the requisite biochemistry consistent with a  potential role in halitosis.

TI  == effectiveness of egg yolk immunoglobulin (igy) against periodontal disease-causing fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo effectiveness of egg yolk immunoglobulin (igy) against periodontal disease-causing fusobacterium nucleatum. methods and results: four white leghorn hens (120 days old) were immunized with whole fus. nucleatum cells killed with 1% formaldehyde using three injections provided at 2-week intervals. igy was produced from egg yolks obtained from these immunized hens using water dilution, two-step salt precipitation and ultrafiltration. this igy was shown to have a purity of 86.8% based on its optical intensity in the stained sds-page bands. an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicated a high specificity for the igy against fus. nucleatum with a maximum antibody titre of 80 000. the igy had only weak cross-reactivity with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and solobacterium moorei. growth  and biofilm formation by fus. nucleatum were inhibited by igy at concentrations of 10 and 20 mg ml(-1) . immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscope assays  revealed a high binding ability of specific igy, which may explain the in vitro effectiveness of igy. in an in vivo study, igy treatment resulted in a marked decrease in alveolar bone loss after fus. nucleatum infection in a mouse model confirming the effectiveness of igy against periodontal disease-causing fus. nucleatum. conclusions: igy effectively inhibited growth and biofilm formation by fus. nucleatum and prevented the progression of periodontal disease by decreasing alveolar bone loss. significance and impact of the study: specific igy may have potential for the treatment of periodontal disease.

TI  == analysis of symptomatic and asymptomatic primary root canal infections in adult norwegian patients.
AB  == introduction: this molecular study analyzed the microbiota of primary root canal  infections from adult norwegian patients. methods: samples were taken from the necrotic root canals of teeth with symptomatic (n = 13) or asymptomatic (n = 21)  apical periodontitis and chronic apical abscesses (n = 9). dna was extracted from samples, and bacterial identifications were performed by a closed-ended reverse-capture checkerboard approach targeting 50 candidate endodontic pathogens. results: bacterial dna was detected in all cases. in teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis, the most frequent taxa were dialister invisus  (71%), fusobacterium nucleatum (62%), and porphyromonas endodontalis (62%). in chronic apical abscesses, the most prevalent taxa were p. endodontalis (100%), d. invisus (89%), parvimonas micra (78%), and solobacterium moorei (78%). in teeth with symptomatic apical periodontitis, the most prevalent taxa were d. invisus, p. endodontalis, s. moorei, propionibacterium acnes, and streptococcus species (all in 69%). none of the targeted taxa were significantly associated with either sinus tract or pain (p > .05), except for selenomonas sputigena, which was more frequently found in painful cases (p = .04). no taxa were found in significantly  higher levels in any conditions (p > .05). cluster analyses revealed bacterial groupings that differed between cases with and without pain. conclusions: although basically the same species were highly prevalent in the different conditions examined and none of the most prevalent taxa were positively associated with symptoms, results revealed that species formed different partnerships and associations in samples from teeth with or without pain. therefore, it is possible that more virulent multispecies communities can form as a result of overall bacterial combinations and give rise to acute inflammation.

TI  == a 6-month study of the effects of 0.3% triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on dental implants.
AB  == aim: supportive therapy to maintain dental implants is increasingly important. this study examined the effect of a 0.3% triclosan/2% copolymer dentifrice on oral biofilms and gingival inflammation (gi) on dental implants and peri-implant  tissues. materials and methods: one hundred and twenty adults with a dental implant and contra-lateral tooth were enrolled in this 6 month, double-blind, two-treatment, parallel group study. sixty subjects were randomly assigned to a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice test group and 60 subjects to a fluoride dentifrice control group and instructed to brush twice daily for 6 months. at baseline, 3, and 6 months, a calibrated dentist assessed dental plaque, gi and collected supragingival dental plaque for microbiological analysis. results: subjects in the triclosan/copolymer group demonstrated significantly lower levels of dental plaque, gingivitis, and bleeding on probing at 3 and 6 months at both the implant and contra-lateral tooth compared with the fluoride group (p<0.05). there were significantly fewer gram-negative anaerobes in the triclosan/copolymer group (p<0.05) including >90% reductions in aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica, solobacterium moorei, and tannerella forsythia. conclusions: twice daily use of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice may enhance dental implant maintenance by reducing dental plaque and gi.

TI  == new bacterial compositions in root-filled teeth with periradicular lesions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to isolate and detect microorganisms of root-filled teeth associated with periradicular lesions. specimens were sampled from patients undergoing root canal retreatment. the bacteria were characterized by morphologic and biochemical analysis and by 16s rrna gene sequencing. microorganisms were detected in 10 of 18 teeth. the majority of positive samples revealed a mixed culture of 2-8 species. in 2 teeth enterococcus faecalis was the only detected species. for the first time vagococcus fluvialis was detected in root canals. solobacterium moorei and fusobacterium nucleatum were the most prevalent species. presence of f. nucleatum was associated with the presence of s. moorei in 5 of 7  cases. in all teeth with parvimonas micra and dialister invisus, f. nucleatum and s. moorei were found. moreover, members of additional different genera were detected delivering bacterial compositions that have been not described yet.
