TI  - Heat shock proteins in the human periodontal disease process.
AB  - The production of HSP by periodontopathic Gram-negative bacteria was examined by  SDS-PAGE, two dimensional gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies against HSPs. Strains of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Treponema socranskii species produced HSP which reacted with anti-Yersinia enterocolitica HSP 60 and/or mycobacterial 65-kDA HSP monoclonal antibodies. It found that gingival homogenate samples from patients with adult periodontitis reacted with anti-human HSP were also found in a serum sample from a periodontitis patient. The present study suggests that HSPs are implicated in human periodontal disease process.
TI  - Absolute configuration of 3-hydroxy fatty acids present in lipopolysaccharides from various bacterial groups.
AB  - The absolute configuration of 3-hydroxy fatty acids has been studied, which are present in the lipopolysaccharides of the following bacteria: Phodopseudomonas gelatinosa, Rh. viridis, Rhodospirillum tenue, Chromobacterium violaceum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bordetella pertussis, Vibrio metchnikovii, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The 3-hydroxy acids were liberated by strong alkaline hydrolysis, converted to 3-methoxy acid L-phenylethylamides and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. With the aid of authentic D-3-hydroxy fatty acids it was shown for all lipopolysaccharides that the 3-hydroxy acids, regardless of chain lengths, branching, 3-O-substitution or type of linkage, possess the D-configuration. 2-Hydroxydodecanoic acid, which is present in some lipopolysaccharides, was analyzed in an analogous way and shown to possess the L-configuration.
