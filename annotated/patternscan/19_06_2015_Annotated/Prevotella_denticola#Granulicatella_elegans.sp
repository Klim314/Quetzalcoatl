TI  == microbial signature profiles of periodontally healthy and diseased patients.
AB  == aim: to determine microbial profiles that discriminate periodontal health from different forms of periodontal diseases. methods: subgingival biofilm was obtained from patients with periodontal health (27), gingivitis (11), chronic periodontitis (35) and aggressive periodontitis (24), and analysed for the presence of >250 species/phylotypes using homim. microbial differences among groups were examined by mann-whitney u-test. regression analyses were performed to determine microbial risk indicators of disease. results: putative and potential new periodontal pathogens were more prevalent in subjects with periodontal diseases than periodontal health. detection of porphyromonas endodontalis/porphyromonas spp. (or 9.5 [1.2-73.1]) and tannerella forsythia (or  38.2 [3.2-450.6]), and absence of neisseria polysaccharea (or 0.004 [0-0.15]) and prevotella denticola (or 0.014 [0-0.49], p < 0.05) were risk indicators of periodontal disease. presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (or 29.4 [3.4-176.5]), cardiobacterium hominis (or 14.9 [2.3-98.7]), peptostreptococcaceae sp. (or 35.9 [2.7-483.9]), p. alactolyticus (or 31.3 [2.1-477.2]), and absence of fretibacterium spp. (or 0.024 [0.002-0.357]), fusobacterium naviforme/fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii (or 0.015 [0.001-0.223]), granulicatella adiacens/granulicatella elegans (or 0.013 [0.001-0.233], p < 0.05) were associated with aggressive periodontitis. conclusion: there were specific microbial signatures of the subgingival biofilm that were able to distinguish between microbiomes of periodontal health and diseases. such profiles may be used to establish risk of disease.

TI  == molecular identification of bacteria in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from children with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == culture of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf) is the gold standard for detection of pathogens in the lower airways in cystic fibrosis (cf). however, current culture results do not explain all clinical observations in cf, including negative culture results during pulmonary exacerbation and inflammation in the absence of pathogens. we hypothesize that organisms not routinely identified by culture occur in the cf airway and may contribute to disease. to test this hypothesis we used a culture-independent molecular approach, based on use of rrna sequence analysis, to assess the bacterial composition of balf from children with cf and disease controls (dc). specimens from 42 subjects (28 cf) were examined, and approximately 6,600 total clones were screened to identify 121 species of bacteria. in general, a single rrna type dominated clone libraries from cf specimens, but not dc. thirteen cf subjects contained bacteria that are not routinely assessed by culture. in four cf subjects, candidate pathogens were identified and include the anaerobe prevotella denticola, a lysobacter sp., and members of the rickettsiales. the presumptive pathogens tropheryma whipplei and granulicatella elegans were identified in cases from the dc group. the presence of unexpected bacteria in cf may explain inflammation without documented pathogens and consequent failure to respond to standard treatment. these results  show that molecular techniques provide a broader perspective on airway bacteria than do routine clinical cultures and thus can identify targets for further clinical evaluation.
