TI  - Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis sensitivity to bacteriocins produced by two Lactobacilli strains.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to determine the inhibitory activities of two bacteriocins, produced by lactobacilli, against genital mycoplasmas. In this study, infections produced by genital mycoplasmas were studied; of these, 1.3% were caused by Mycoplasma hominis, 10.7% by Ureaplasma urealyticum and 5.6% by U. urealyticum + M. hominis. U. urealyticum was isolated from 75 out of 123 patients with genital mycoplasmas, while M. hominis was isolated from 9 patients (7.3%) and both U. urealyticum and M. hominis from 39 patients (31.7%). Bacteriocins, L23 and L60, produced by Lactobacillus fermentum and L. rhamnosus, respectively, appear to be two novel inhibitors of bacterial infection with potential antibacterial activity. Both bacteriocins proved to be active against 100% of strains tested; MICs of bacteriocin L23 ranged between 320 and 160 UA ml(-1) for 78% of the M. hominis strains and between 320 and 80 UA ml(-1) for 95% of the U. urealyticum strains. In addition, bacteriocin L60 was still active at 160 UA ml(-1) for a high percentage (56%) of M. hominis strains, and at 80 UA ml(-1) for 53% of the U. urealyticum strains. Interestingly, these antimicrobial substances produced by lactobacilli showed an inhibitory activity against genital mycoplasmas even when diluted. Altogether, our study indicates that the bacteriocins, L23 and L60, are good candidates for the treatment or prevention of genital infections in women.
TI  - Vaginal bacterial flora activates rat peritoneal mast cells.
AB  - Sixteen strains of physiological and pathological vaginal bacteria were tested for their ability to secrete histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. We noticed that Mycoplasma hominis-induced histamine release was very high (up to 53.6%). The stimulation of rat mast cells with Staphylococccus cohnii, Staphylococcus coagulase(-) (two strains), Ureaplasma urealyticum, Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides capillosus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae resulted in lower but significant histamine secretion (11.2%-17.5%). Other bacteria strains (Staphylococcus epidermidids, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Actinomyces naeslundii (two strains) and Lactobacillus fermentum (two strains) caused very low (4.2% - 8.8%) histamine release.
TI  - [The influence of anaerobic bacteria and mycoplasma isolated from the genital tract on mast cell activation].
AB  - Nowadays, it is known that mast cells, numerously appearing in all organs and being a source of a wide range of mediators and cytokines, are involved both in physiological and pathological processes. The aim of our study was to examine whether vaginal bacteria, especially those participating in Bacterial vaginosis, are able to activate mast cells to mediators secretion. The study was done on rat peritoneal mast cells. The mast cells were incubated in vitro with suspensions of Bacteroides capillosus, Actinomyces naeslundii (2 strains), Peptostreptococcus spp., Lactobacillus fermentum (2 strains), Mycoplasma hominis or Ureaplasma urealyticum killed by temperature. Activation of mast cells was estimated on the basis of histamine release. It was established that M. hominis, U. urealyticum and B. capillosus strongly stimulated rat mast cells to histamine secretion (histamine release 53.0%, 17.4% and 10.0%, respectively). Histamine release induced by Peptostreptococcus spp., A. naeslundii and L. fermentum was lower (at a range of 2.4%-8.2%). The obtained results can suggest that presumably interactions between vaginal bacteria and placental mast cells could influence the course of pregnancy.
