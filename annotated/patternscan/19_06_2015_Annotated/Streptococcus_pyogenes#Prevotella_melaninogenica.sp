TI  == bacteriological and clinical evaluation of twelve cases of post-surgical sepsis of odontogenic tumours at a referral centre.
AB  == objective: to determine the bacterial aetiology of sepsis occurring following surgery of odontogenic tumours and assess the effect of prompt and proper antibiotic usage. design: a prospective study. setting: a tertiary referral centre in lagos, nigeria. subjects: twelve patients with odontogenic tumours that developed sepsis postoperatively. eight of the patients were referred from private hospitals, the remaining were in-patients who sought for alternative medical attention following interruption of health care services at the referral  centre. intervention: adequate review of patient's medical history, bacteriological investigations and antibiotic therapy. main outcome measures: bacteriological and clinical cure following antibiotic therapy based on susceptibility test results. results: two categories of patients were identified; those who completed the course of antibiotics prescribed post-surgery and patients who failed to conform to antibiotic prescription. sepsis developed in the non-compliance group much earlier than in the group that complied (p<0.001).  infections were polybacterial with aerobes accounting for 77.4% (alpha-haemolytic streptococci 29.0%, streptococcus pyogenes 16.1%, staphylococcus aureus 16.1%, diphtheroids 9.7%, klebsiella pneumoniae 6.5%) and anaerobes 22.6% (porphyromonas gingivalis 9.7%, peptostreptococcus spp. 6.5%, prevotella melaninogenica 3.2%, clostridium perfringens 3.2%). mixed aerobic and anaerobic aetiology occurred more in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. clostridium perfringens was isolated from  a case of osteosarcoma with necrotic tissues. the anaerobic bacteria were 100% sensitive to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and augmentin, 65-85% sensitivity to ampicloxacillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin. over 92% of the streptococci were  sensitive to the beta-lactams contrast low susceptibility with s. aureus and k. pneumoniae. conclusion: interruption of healthcare service was the sole factor identified in the development of sepsis as the patients could not be monitored to ensure compliance to prescription.

TI  == management of maxillofacial infections: a review of 50 cases.
AB  == maxillofacial infections often place the oral and maxillofacial surgeon in situations where timely decisions have to be made. these decisions can be life-saving. this study reviews 50 infections treated over a 3-year period. the results reveal rapid resolution of the infections by adhering to fundamental principles in their management: recognition of airway compromise, surgical intervention, and the administration of the appropriate antibiotic. a protocol for the management of maxillofacial infections is described.

TI  == bacteriologic findings in peritonsillar abscesses in young adults.
AB  == aspirated pus samples from 124 patients with peritonsillar abscess were cultured  quantitatively for aerobes and anaerobes. a total of 98% of the samples yielded bacteria. of the 550 isolates obtained (mean, 4.4 per patient), 143 were aerobes  (representing 16 species or groups) and 407 were anaerobes (representing 40 species or groups). aerobes were isolated from 86% of patients-alone in 20 cases  and together with anaerobes in 87. the most common aerobic isolates were streptococcus pyogenes (isolated from 45% of patients), streptococcus milleri group organisms (27%), haemophilus influenzae (11%), and viridans streptococci (11%). anaerobes were isolated from 82% of the samples and as a sole finding from 15 abscesses. fusobacterium necrophorum and prevotella melaninogenica were both isolated from 38% of patients, prevotella intermedia from 32%, peptostreptococcus micros from 27%, fusobacterium nucleatum from 26%, and actinomyces odontolyticus  from 23%. the rate of previous tonsillar/peritonsillar infections was lowest (25%) among patients infected with s. pyogenes and highest (52%) among those infected with f. necrophorum (p < .01). recurrences and/or related tonsillectomies were more common among patients infected with f. necrophorum than among those infected with s. pyogenes (57% vs. 19%; p < .0001) or with s. milleri group organisms (43% vs. 19%; p < .05). beta-lactamase was produced by only 38% of the 73 isolates of prevotella species tested; however, 56% of the 36 patients  studied harbored one or more such strains.

TI  == comparative bacteriological studies on summer mastitis in grazing cattle and pyogenes mastitis in stabled cattle in denmark.
AB  == a total of 143 secretions from clinical cases of summer mastitis (sm) in grazing  cattle and from 89 cases of pyogenes mastitis (pm) in stabled cattle were examined bacteriologically. the typical bacteriological finding was a mixed flora in which the predominant organisms were actinomyces pyogenes (sm-70%, pm-85%), peptostreptococcus indolicus (54%, 54%), a microaerophilic coccus (stuart-schwan  coccus) (26%, 25%), fusobacterium necrophorum biovar b (22%, 12%), bacteroides melaninogenicus (20%, 9%) and streptococcus dysgalactiae (21%, 5%). all except six cases occurred in non-lactating animals or within three weeks after parturition. the majority of animals (about 90%) had only one quarter affected and no differences in quarter distribution were observed between the two groups.

TI  == summer mastitis in heifers: a bacteriological examination of secretions from clinical cases of summer mastitis in denmark.
AB  == a total of 166 samples of secretions collected from danish heifers suffering from clinically diagnosed summer mastitis were examined bacteriologically. one hundred and sixty three samples yielded positive findings whereas no growth was obtained  from 3 specimens. the majority of samples revealed a mixed flora in which the predominant components were actinomyces pyogenes, peptostreptococcus indolicus, a microaerophilic coccus (stuart-schwan coccus), fusobacterium necrophorum, bacteriodes melaninogenicus and streptococcus dysgalactiae. pure cultures were recovered in only 7% of cases. p. indolicus was isolated from 875 of the cases, a microaerophilic coccus from 84%, a. pyogenes from 72%, fusobacterium necrophorum  from 52%, str. dysgalactiae from 37%, b. melaninogenicus from 33% and various unidentified obligate anaerobic gram-negative rods from 31%. the results confirm  the complex bacterial aetiology of summer mastitis.

TI  == pathogenicity of capsulate and non-capsulate members of bacteroides fragilis and  b. melaninogenicus groups in mixed infection with escherichia coli and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the relationships between capsulate and non-capsulate bacteroides fragilis strains and escherichia coli, and between capsulate and non-capsulate strains of  the b. melaninogenicus group and streptococcus pyogenes, were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. selective antimicrobial agents directed against either aerobic or anaerobic bacteria were used alone or in combination to explore the effect of eradication of one component of the mixed infection. single agent therapy effective against both aerobic and anaerobic flora was also employed. single therapy of mixed infection directed at the elimination of only one organism (s. pyogenes, e. coli or bacteroides sp.) caused significant reductions in the numbers of sensitive organisms and also smaller yet significant decreases in the numbers of insensitive organisms. however, the abscesses were not eliminated after such therapy. combination therapy or use of a single agent (cefoxitin) directed against the aerobic and anaerobic components of the infection was more effective. non-capsulate bacteroides spp. became capsulate after passage in mice mixed with either s. pyogenes or e. coli. therapy directed  at the elimination of s. pyogenes and e. coli did not prevent the emergence of capsulate bacteroides spp. these data demonstrate the synergy between all members of the b. fragilis group and e. coli and between the b. melaninogenicus group and s. pyogenes, and reiterate the need to direct antimicrobial therapy at the eradication of the aerobic and anaerobic components of mixed infections.

TI  == bacteroides melaninogenicus. its recovery from tonsils of children with acute tonsillitis.
AB  == the presence of encapsulated and abscess-forming organisms belonging to the bacteroides melaninogenicus group was investigated in 25 children with acute tonsillitis, and in 23 children without tonsillar inflammation (control). encapsulated organisms of the b melaninogenicus group were found in 23 of 25 children with acute tonsillitis as compared with five of 23 controls. subcutaneous inoculation into mice of the bacteroides strains isolated from patients with tonsillitis produced abscesses in 17 of 25 instances, as compared with nine of the 23 of the controls. group a streptococci were recovered from the tonsils of five children with tonsillitis and from four of the control group. these findings suggest a possible pathogenic role for the b melaninogenicus group in acute tonsillar infection in children.

TI  == pathogenicity of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus group, b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm) group and four clinical isolates of b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal abscesses. only 11 isolates of bm group and one b. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). when the other 23 isolates, however, were injected sc in combination with either klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. the bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. capsules also formed in bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of k. pneumoniae or encapsulated bacteroides sp. once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.

TI  == survival of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria on cotton swabs in three transport systems.
AB  == the capacity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to survive on cotton swabs placed  into a dry gassed-out co2-filled tube (dgt), dry sterile aerobic tube (dat), and  a tube containing a modified stuarts' transport medium (mst), was assessed. pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in numbers by 2 and 3 logs when stored in mst and dat, respectively. the viability of p. aeruginosa, although retarded when compared to msa and dat, was not adversely affected by the co2 environment in the dgt. the mst maintained relatively constant numbers of streptococcus pyogenes during the 48-h storage period. the dat and the dgt were unable to maintain the viability of s. pyogenes. staphylococcus aureus, when stored in a dgt, dat, or mst, was maintained in relatively constant numbers throughout the entire storage  period. of the four anaerobic bacteria evaluated (bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides melaninogenicus ssp. asaccharolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius), only b. fragilis ssp. thetaiotamicron survived the 48-h storage period in the dgt. under these test conditions the dgt did not adequately maintain the viability of the majority of anaerobic bacteria tested (when held on cotton swabs). however, the mst did maintain the viability of all species tested for at least the first 2 h of storage.
