TI  == cultivable endophytic bacteria from leaf bases of agave tequilana and their role  as plant growth promoters.
AB  == agave tequilana weber var. 'azul' is grown for the production of tequila, inulin  and syrup. diverse bacteria inhabit plant tissues and play a crucial role for plant health and growth. in this study culturable endophytic bacteria were extracted from leaf bases of 100 healthy agave tequilana plants. in plant tissue  bacteria occurred at mean population densities of 3 million cfu/g of fresh plant  tissue. three hundred endophytic strains were isolated and 16s rdna sequences grouped the bacteria into eight different taxa that shared high homology with other known sequences. bacterial endophytes were identified as acinectobacter sp., a. baumanii, a. bereziniae, cronobacter sakazakii, enterobacter hormaechei,  bacillus sp. klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas sp., enterococcus casseliflavus, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and gluconobacter oxydans. isolates were confirmed to be plant growth promoting bacteria (pgpb) by their capacities for nitrogen fixation, auxin production, phosphate solubilization, or  antagonism against fusarium oxysporum ac132. e. casseliflavus jm47 and k. oxytoca jm26 secreted the highest concentrations of iaa. the endophyte acinectobacter sp. jm58 exhibited the maximum values for nitrogen fixation and phosphate solubilization index (psi). inhibition of fungi was found in pseudomonas sp. jm9p and k. oxytoca jm26. bacterial endophytes show promise for use as bio-inoculants  for agave cultivation. use of endophytes to enhance cultivation of agave may be particularly important for plants produced by micropropagation techniques, where  native endophytes may have been lost.

TI  == presence of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes in lactic acid bacteria from fermented foods of indian origin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) resistant to erythromycin were isolated from different food samples on selective media. the isolates were identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus lactis, enterococcus casseliflavus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides. of the total 60 isolates, 88 % harbored the ermb gene. the efflux gene msra was identified in e. faecium, e. durans, e. lactis, e. casseliflavus, p. pentosaceus  and l. fermentum. further analysis of the msra gene by sequencing suggested its homology to msrc. resistance to tetracycline due to the genes tetm, tetw, teto, tetk and tetl, alone or in combination, were identified in lactobacillus species. the tetracycline efflux genes tetk and tetl occurred in p. pentosaceus and enterococcus species. since it appeared that lab had acquired these genes, fermented foods may be a source of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == isolation and characterisation of lactic acid bacteria from jiang-gua (fermented  cucumbers), a traditional fermented food in taiwan.
AB  == background: jiang-gua (fermented cucumbers) is a popular traditional fermented food in taiwan. the microflora of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in jiang-gua have not been investigated in detail. in this study, lab from jiang-gua were isolated, characterised and identified. results: a total of 103 lab were isolated; 70 cultures were isolated from jiang-gua samples and 33 cultures were isolated from  its raw substrate, cucumber. these isolates were mainly characterised phenotypically and then divided into seven groups (a-g) by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of 16s ribosomal dna. the isolates were identified as enterococcus casseliflavus, leuconostoc lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paraplantarum, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, weissella cibaria and weissella  hellenica. the antibacterial activities of the isolates were determined and 11 lc. lactis subsp. lactis strains showed inhibitory activity against the indicator strain lactobacillus sakei jcm 1157(t) . conclusion: heterofermentative w. cibaria and leu. lactis were the major lab found in jiang-gua samples without soy sauce. in soy sauce-added samples, homofermentative l. pentosus and l. plantarum  were the most abundant lab. in addition, the results also suggested that hhai and rsai restriction enzymes could be applied to distinguish w. hellenica and weissella paramesenteroides.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal italian goat cheese.
AB  == the lactic acid bacteria community in traditional goat cheese produced in three dairies in valsesia (piemonte, italy) was studied at different steps of the manufacturing process. these cheeses were produced from raw milk without starter  bacteria, and no protocol was followed during the manufacturing process. three hundred thirty-two isolates were characterized and grouped by results of both morphophysiological tests and random amplification of polymorphic dna plus pcr analysis. bacteria were identified by partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. lactococci were the dominant lactic acid bacteria in raw milk. their initial numbers ranged from 5 to 7 log cfu ml(-1). their levels increased during manufacturing and decreased during ripening. the growth trend for enterococci was comparable to that of lactococci, although enterococci counts were lower. lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, lactococcus garviae, and enterococcus faecalis were the most frequently isolated species during goat cheese manufacturing, whereas the highest numbers of enterococcus (e. faecium, e. durans, e. gilvus, and e. casseliflavus) were isolated with the greatest frequency from ripened cheese samples. occasionally, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc lactis, and lactobacillus paraplantarum also were isolated.

TI  == probiotic table olives: microbial populations adhering on olive surface in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in an industrial plant.
AB  == this study reports the dynamics of microbial populations adhering on the surface  of debittered green olives cv. bella di cerignola in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in different brining conditions (4% and 8% (w/v) nacl) at room temperature and 4 degrees c. the probiotic strain successfully colonized the olive surface dominating the natural  lab population and decreasing the ph of brines to <or=5.0 after 30 days until the end of fermentation. the dynamics of microbial populations associated with olive  surface and belonging to the different groups indicated that inoculated olives held at room temperature did not host enterobacteriaceae at the end of fermentation. yeast populations were present in a low number (<or=log(10) 5.7 cfu/g) throughout the process. a considerable genetic diversity of lab species colonizing the olive surface was found mainly in inoculated set brined in 8% nacl, as indicated by the shannon diversity index calculated for each set. generally, strains of lactobacillus coryniformis, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l.  pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. brevis, l. mali, l. vaccinostercus, l.casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, weissella paramesenteroides, w. cibaria, enterococcus casseliflavus group and e.  italicus were identified during the whole process. in particular, l. pentosus was the most frequently isolated species and it showed a high strain diversity throughout fermentation in all processes except for the one held at 4 degrees c.  also a notable incidence of leuc. mesenteroides on olives was highlighted in this study during all fermentation. results indicated that the human strain l. paracasei impc2.1 can be considered an example of a strain used in the dual role  of starter and probiotic culture which allowed the control of fermentation processes and the realization of a final probiotic product with functional appeal.

TI  == study of the ecology of fresh sausages and characterization of populations of lactic acid bacteria by molecular methods.
AB  == in this study, a polyphasic approach was used to study the ecology of fresh sausages and to characterize populations of lactic acid bacteria (lab). the microbial profile of fresh sausages was monitored from the production day to the  10th day of storage at 4 degrees c. samples were collected on days 0, 3, 6, and 10, and culture-dependent and -independent methods of detection and identification were applied. traditional plating and isolation of lab strains, which were subsequently identified by molecular methods, and the application of pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) to dna and rna extracted directly from the fresh sausage samples allowed the study in detail of the changes in the bacterial and yeast populations during storage. brochothrix thermosphacta and lactobacillus sakei were the main populations present. in particular, b. thermosphacta was present throughout the process, as determined by both dna and rna analysis. other bacterial species, mainly staphylococcus xylosus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and l. curvatus, were detected by dgge. moreover, an uncultured bacterium and an uncultured staphylococcus sp. were present, too. lab strains isolated at day 0 were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, l. casei, and enterococcus casseliflavus, and on day 3 a strain of leuconostoc mesenteroides was identified. the remaining strains isolated belonged to l. sakei. concerning the yeast ecology, only debaryomyces hansenii was established in the fresh sausages. capronia mansonii was initially present, but it was not detected after the first 3 days. at last, l. sakei isolates were characterized by randomly amplified polymorphic dna pcr and repetitive dna element pcr. the results obtained underlined how different populations took over  at different steps of the process. this is believed to be the result of the selection of the particular population, possibly due to the low storage temperature employed.
