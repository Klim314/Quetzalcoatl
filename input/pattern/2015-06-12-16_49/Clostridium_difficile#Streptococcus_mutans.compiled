TI  - Site-directed mutations in the lanthipeptide mutacin 1140.
AB  - The oral bacterium Streptococcus mutans, strain JH1140, produces the antibiotic mutacin 1140. Mutacin 1140 belongs to a group of antibiotics called lanthipeptides. More specifically, mutacin 1140 is related to the epidermin type A(I) lanthipeptides. Mutagenesis experiments of this group of lanthipeptides have been primarily restricted to the posttranslationally modified meso-lanthionine and 3-methyllanthionine residues. Site-directed mutagenesis of the core peptide of mutacin 1140 was performed using the suicide vector pVA891. Substitutions of the N-terminal residue, the charged residue in the hinge region, and residues in ring A and intertwined rings C and D were investigated. A truncation and insertion of residues in ring A and intertwined rings C and D were also performed to determine whether or not they would alter the antimicrobial activity of the producing strain. Bioassays revealed that five of 14 mutants studied had improved antimicrobial activity against the indicator strain Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240. MICs against Streptococcus mutans UA159, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 27336, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Clostridium difficile UK1, and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240 were determined for three mutacin 1140 variants that had the most significant increases in bioactivity in the M. luteus bioassay. This mutagenesis study of the epidermin group of lanthipeptides shows that antimicrobial activity can be significantly improved.
TI  - Attenuation regulation of amino acid biosynthetic operons in proteobacteria: comparative genomics analysis.
AB  - Candidate attenuators were identified that regulate operons responsible for biosynthesis of branched amino acids, histidine, threonine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine in gamma- and alpha-proteobacteria, and in some cases in low-GC Gram-positive bacteria, Thermotogales and Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi. This allowed us not only to describe the evolutionary dynamics of regulation by attenuation of transcription, but also to annotate a number of hypothetical genes. In particular, orthologs of ygeA of Escherichia coli were assigned the branched chain amino acid racemase function. Three new families of histidine transporters were predicted, orthologs of yuiF and yvsH of Bacillus subtilis, and lysQ of Lactococcus lactis. In Pasteurellales, the single bifunctional aspartate kinase/homoserine dehydrogenase gene thrA was predicted to be regulated not only by threonine and isoleucine, as in E. coli, but also by methionine. In alpha-proteobacteria, the single acetolactate synthase operon ilvIH was predicted to be regulated by branched amino acids-dependent attenuators. Histidine biosynthetic operons his were predicted to be regulated by histidine-dependent attenuators in Bacillus cereus and Clostridium difficile, and by histidine T-boxes in L. lactis and Streptococcus mutans.
TI  - The ICESt1 element of Streptococcus thermophilus belongs to a large family of integrative and conjugative elements that exchange modules and change their specificity of integration.
AB  - The 34,734-bp element ICESt1 from Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368 is site-specifically integrated into the 3(') end of the gene fda. ICESt1 encodes integrative functions and putative transfer functions. Six proteins of the putative conjugative system of ICESt1 are related to those encoded by the conjugative transposon Tn916 from Enterococcus faecalis. A comparison of these proteins with those encoded by the complete or partial genome sequences of various low G+C bacteria including Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium difficile, E. faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus mutans revealed the presence of numerous putative site-specific integrative conjugative elements and/or conjugative transposons within these genomes. Sequence comparisons revealed that these elements possess a modular structure and that exchanges of unrelated or distantly related modules and genes have occurred between these elements, and also plasmids and prophages. These exchanges have probably led to modifications in the site specificity of integration of these elements. Therefore, a distinction between low specificity integrative conjugative elements (i.e., conjugative transposons) and site-specific integrative conjugative elements does not appear to be relevant. We propose to call all the conjugative elements that excise by site-specific recombination and integrate by recombination between a specific site of a circular intermediate and another site, "Integrative and Conjugative Elements" (ICEs), irrespective of the integration specificity.
TI  - Bovine milk antibodies for health.
AB  - The immunoglobulins of bovine colostrum provide the major antimicrobial protection against microbial infections and confer a passive immunity to the newborn calf until its own immune system matures. The concentration in colostrum of specific antibodies against pathogens can be raised by immunising cows with these pathogens or their antigens. Immune milk products are preparations made of such hyperimmune colostrum or antibodies enriched from it. These preparations can be used to give effective specific protection against different enteric diseases in calves and suckling pigs. Colostral immunoglobulin supplements designed for farm animals are commercially available in many countries. Also, some immune milk products containing specific antibodies against certain pathogens have been launched on the market. A number of clinical studies are currently in progress to evaluate the efficacy of immune milks in the prevention and treatment of various human infections, including those caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria. Bovine colostrum-based immune milk products have proven effective in prophylaxis against various infectious diseases in humans. Good results have been obtained with products targeted against rotavirus, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, Streptococcus mutans, Cryptosporidium parvum and Helicobacter pylori. Some successful attempts have been made to use immune milk in balancing gastrointestinal microbial flora. Immune milk products are promising examples of health-promoting functional foods, or nutraceuticals. This review summarises the recent progress in the development of these products and evaluates their potential as dietary supplements and in clinical nutrition.
TI  - Genetic characterisation of the botulinum toxin complex of Clostridium botulinum  strain NCTC 2916.
AB  - An 8 kb segment of the Clostridium botulinum NCTC 2916 genome 5' to the type A botulinum neurotoxin gene has been sequenced revealing five open reading frames. Four encode components (HA70, HA17, HA34 and NTNH/A) of the progenitor toxin complex. The product of the fifth, OrfX, possesses a putative C-terminal helix-turn-helix motif, exhibits homology with known regulatory proteins (including MsmR from Streptococcus mutans, UviA from C. perfringens and Orftxe1 located upstream of the C. difficile toxin B gene) and is also found within the vicinity of genes encoding tetanus toxin and types B, C, D and G botulinum toxins. Primer extension and Northern blotting analysis demonstrates that the genes are expressed as two divergent operons [HA34, HA17, HA70] and [NTNH/A, type A toxin gene], with the OrfX gene expressed singly. Immediately adjacent to the transcriptional start sites of the HA34 and NTNH/A genes are two highly conserved motifs (5'-ATTTTagGTTTACAAAA-3' and 5'-ATGTTATATgTaA-3'), separated by 12 bp, that span the putative -35 and -10 promoter regions. Homologous sequences occur in the equivalent position relative to the genes at type C botulinum toxin gene and the tetanus toxin gene loci. It is likely that these sequence motifs, together with OrfX, are involved in the co-ordinate expression of the genes encoding the various components of the botulinum toxin complex in groups I, III and IV C. botulinum strains and in that of the tetanus toxin gene.
TI  - Definition of a fundamental repeating unit in streptococcal glucosyltransferase glucan-binding regions and related sequences.
AB  - The C-termini of the glucosyltransferases (Gtfs) of oral streptococci are responsible for glucan binding. These glucan-binding domains (GBDs) are composed of a series of repeated sequences that have been classified into four different classes (A-D) by virtue of sequence similarity and which, by inference, have been suggested to be of functional importance. In contrast, we propose that repeat sequences evolve in response to selection for an increase in the number of copies of a particular domain through multiple duplication events occurring at different times. According to this hypothesis, repeats should possess various degrees of similarity, especially if only key residues are of functional importance. Analysis of the GBDs of the Gtfs indicated that a common fundamental repeat, designated the "YG" repeat, could be discerned within the "A", "B", "C", and "D" repeats. Similar elements were also conserved in the ligand-binding repeats of the Clostridium difficile toxins and the lysins and the PspA protein of Streptococcus pneumoniae, suggesting that similar selective pressures had also been imposed on these sequences. Analysis of the "YG" repeats present in the GtfJ and GtfK of Streptococcus salivarius indicated that some of the "YG" repeats in the GBDs of these proteins had arisen as a result of duplication events involving a series of three sequential "YG" repeats.
TI  - Evidence for a modular structure of the homologous repetitive C-terminal carbohydrate-binding sites of Clostridium difficile toxins and Streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferases.
AB  - The homologous C-terminal repeats of Clostridium difficile toxins (ToxA and ToxB) and streptococcal glucosyltransferases appear to mediate protein-carbohydrate interactions at cellular binding sites with sugar moieties as substrates. A consensus sequence of 134 repeating units from gram-positive bacteria indicates that these repeats have a modular design with (i) a stretch of aromatic amino acids proposed to be involved in the primary carbohydrate-protein interaction, (ii) an amplification of this interaction by repetition of the respective sequences, and (iii) a second domain, not characterized, that is responsible for carbohydrate specificity.
TI  - Structural properties and evolutionary relationships of PspA, a surface protein of Streptococcus pneumoniae, as revealed by sequence analysis.
AB  - Analysis of the sequence for the gene encoding PspA (pneumococcal surface protein A) of Streptococcus pneumoniae revealed the presence of four distinct domains in the mature protein. The structure of the N-terminal half of PspA was highly consistent with that of an alpha-helical coiled-coil protein. The alpha-helical domain was followed by a proline-rich domain (with two regions in which 18 of 43 and 5 of 11 of the residues are prolines) and a repeat domain consisting of 10 highly conserved 20-amino-acid repeats. A fourth domain consisting of a hydrophobic region too short to serve as a membrane anchor and a poorly charged region followed the repeats and preceded the translation stop codon. The C-terminal region of PspA did not possess features conserved among numerous other surface proteins, suggesting that PspA is attached to the cell by a mechanism unique among known surface proteins of gram-positive bacteria. The repeat domain of PspA was found to have significant homology with C-terminal repeat regions of proteins from Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus downei, Clostridium difficile, and S. pneumoniae. Comparisons of these regions with respect to functions and homologies suggested that, through evolution, the repeat regions may have lost or gained a mechanism for attachment to the bacterial cell.
TI  - Antigenic cross-reactivity and functional inhibition by antibodies to Clostridium difficile toxin A, Streptococcus mutans glucan-binding protein, and a synthetic peptide.
AB  - A 10-amino-acid repeating sequence of the hemagglutinating portion of Clostridium difficile toxin A has been synthesized and used to produce antisera in rabbits. Antipeptide antibody inhibited toxin A-mediated hemagglutination and neutralized cytotoxic activity. Immunoblot analysis with the antipeptide antibody revealed cross-reactivity with native toxin, a recombinant protein containing the toxin A repeats, and a glucan-binding protein from Streptococcus mutans whose primary structure has repeating amino acid motifs similar to those of the synthetic peptide. A polyclonal antibody against the glucan-binding protein, which cross-reacted with purified toxin A, also inhibited toxin A-mediated hemagglutination and neutralized cytotoxic activity. We recently identified toxin A and the glucan-binding protein as members of a novel family of clostridial and streptococcal binding proteins based on conserved repeating amino acid motifs at the C-terminal region of the molecules. This study provides immunological and functional evidence of the predicted relationship between toxin A and the glucan-binding protein and further implicates the repeating subunits as ligand-binding domains in this family of proteins.
TI  - A family of clostridial and streptococcal ligand-binding proteins with conserved  C-terminal repeat sequences.
AB  - Analysis of the derived amino acid sequences of toxins A and B from Clostridium difficile has identified an extraordinarily large number of repeat amino acid units in the C-terminal regions of the proteins. Nearly one third of each of the proteins consist of repeating units which appear, at least in the case of toxin A, to be responsible for carbohydrate binding. Similar repeat units are also found in the C-terminal region of four glucosyltransferases from Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus downei, and in four lytic enzymes from Streptococcus pneumoniae and its bacteriophages (HB-3, Cp-1 and Cp-9). In each case the repeats constitute the ligand-binding portion of the respective enzymes. A glucan-binding protein from S. mutans, which lacks enzymatic activity, has similar repeats spanning almost the entire molecule. This family of ligand-binding proteins appears to be of modular design, with one module consisting of a repetitive ligand-binding domain located in the C-terminal region and the other module(s) providing enzymatic functions.
TI  - Effect of bacterial contamination on cecal size and cecal contents of gnotobiotic rodents.
AB  - In the present investigation the effect of various bacterial contaminations of gnotobiotic mice and rats on cecal size is presented. Of the species tested, Bacteroides oralis and Fusobacterium nucleatum did not establish in germ-free mice. Streptococcus mutans, Clostridium difficile, a Neisseria strain and two recent cecal isolates established, but failed to exert an effect upon the cecum of mice. A group K streptococcus and B. fragilis increased the cecal size apparently by increasing the levels of water-soluble protein, peptides, and carbohydrates in the cecal contents. Mixed ileal bacteria decreased the cecal size by preventing accumulation of soluble proteins and carbohydrates in the cecum. A Peptococcus strain caused a reduction by lowering the levels of insoluble material in the cecum. When this strain was combined with two Clostridium isolates and introduced into gnotobiotic rats, 50 to 65% cecal reduction was observed. This polycontamination did not decrease the per cent water of the cecal contents but caused lower levels of both soluble and insoluble material to accumulate in the cecum. No net nitrogen absorption from the distal small intestine occurred in either the germ-free or polycontaminated rats.
