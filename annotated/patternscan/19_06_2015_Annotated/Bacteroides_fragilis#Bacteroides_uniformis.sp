TI  == trends in the susceptibility of commonly encountered clinically significant anaerobes and susceptibilities of blood isolates of anaerobes to 16 antimicrobial agents, including fidaxomicin and rifaximin, 2008-2012, northern taiwan.
AB  == we investigated the antimicrobial resistance trends and profiles of clinical anaerobic isolates in northern taiwan. trends in the susceptibility of five commonly encountered clinical anaerobic isolates to seven agents from 2008 to 2012 were measured using the cochran-armitage trend test. the minimum inhibitory  concentrations (mics) of 16 antimicrobial agents, including fidaxomicin and rifaximin, against anaerobic blood isolates from two medical centers were determined using the agar dilution method. during the study period, susceptibility data on 11,105 isolates were evaluated. metronidazole and chloramphenicol retained excellent activities. around 20-30 % of isolates of bacteroides and prevotella species were resistant to ampicillin-sulbactam, cefmetazole, flomoxef, and clindamycin. of the 507 tested blood isolates, the rates of resistance to commonly used agents were much higher, namely, 16.2 % for  amoxicillin-clavulanate, 15.6 % for ampicillin-sulbactam, 24.7 % for cefmetazole, and 36.1 % for clindamycin. notably, 13.5 % of b. fragilis isolates were resistant to ertapenem. also, 15.2 % of b. uniformis, 17.2 % of other bacteroides species, 14.3 % of prevotella species, and 14 % of clostridium other than c. perfringens isolates were resistant to moxifloxacin. cefoperazone-sulbactam was active against most isolates, except for clostridium species other than perfringens (resistance rate, 18.6 %). fidaxomicin exerted poor activities against most anaerobes tested (mic90 of >128 mug/ml for b. fragilis and all isolates), except for c. perfringens (mic90 of 0.03 mug/ml) and peptostreptococcus micros (mic90 of 2 mug/ml). however, rifaximin showed a wide range of susceptibilities against the tested anaerobes (mic90 of 0.5 mug/ml for b. fragilis). the emergence of resistance to ertapenem and moxifloxacin among bacteremic anaerobes highlights the need for continuous monitoring.

TI  == prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of bacteroides fragilis group isolated from stool samples in north lebanon.
AB  == fifty one strains of the bacteroides fragilis group were isolated from 45 fecal samples. classical phenotypic identification showed that 16 isolates were b. thetaiotaomicron, 12 b. uniformis, 9 b. eggerthii, 7 b. vulgatus, 3 b. caccae, 2  parabacteroides distasonis with 1 identified b. ovatus and 1 b. fragilis. the 51  strains were tested for susceptibility against 16 antimicrobial agents and the mics for metronidazole were determined. the tests showed that imipenem, meropenem and chloramphenicol were the most effective antibiotics (98%, 98% and 92.16% of susceptibility, respectively) followed by ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam, rifampin (88.24% susceptibility), moxifloxacin 86.27% and tigecycline 84.31%. ofloxacin and cefotaxime were the least effective antibiotics with 27.45% and 0% of activity respectively. only six of the 51 isolated strains were resistant to metronidazole with mics = 64 mg/l (1 strain) and > 256 mg/l (5 strains).

TI  == ethnic diversity of gut microbiota: species characterization of bacteroides fragilis group and genus bifidobacterium in healthy belgian adults, and comparison with data from japanese subjects.
AB  == the composition of the human gut microbiota is related to host health, and it is  thought that dietary habits may play a role in shaping this composition. here, we examined the population size and prevalence of six predominant bacterial genera and the species compositions of genus bifidobacterium (g-bifid) and bacteroides fragilis group (g-bfra) in 42 healthy belgian adults by quantitative pcr (qpcr) over a period of one month. the population sizes and prevalence of these bacteria were basically stable throughout the study period. the predominant g-bifid species were bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium longum ss. longum,  and the predominant g-bfra species were bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides uniformis, and bacteroides ovatus. the belgian gut microbiota data were then compared with gut microbiota data from 46 japanese subjects collected according to the same protocol (matsuki et al., appl. environ. microbiol. 70, 167-173, 2004). the population size and prevalence of bifidobacterium catenulatum group were significantly lower in the belgian gut microbiota than in the japanese gut microbiota (p < 0.001); however, the population size and prevalence of g-bifid did not differ. this species-level qpcr analysis will be helpful for investigating the diversity of gut microbiota among ethnic groups.

TI  == bioinformatic evidence and characterization of novel putative large conjugative transposons residing in genomes of genera bacteroides and prevotella.
AB  == bioinformatic evidence of the presence of a large conjugative transposon in ruminal bacterium prevotella bryantii b(1)4(t) is presented. the described transposon appears to be related to another large conjugative transposon ctnbst,  described in bacteroides uniformis wh207 and to the conjugative transposon ctn3-bf, which was observed in the genome of bacteroides fragilis strain ych46. all three transposons share tra gene regions with high amino acid identity and clearly conserved gene order. additionally, a second conserved region consisting  of hypothetical genes was discovered in all three transposons and named the gg region. this region served as a specific sequence signature and made possible the discovery of several other apparently related hypothetical conjugative transposons in bacteria from the genus bacteroides. a cluster of genes involved in sugar utilization and metabolism was discovered within the hypothetical ctnb(1)4, to a certain extent resembling the polysaccharide utilization loci which were described recently in some bacteroides strains. this is the first firm report on the presence of a large mobile genetic element in any strain from the genus prevotella.

TI  == structural segregation of gut microbiota between colorectal cancer patients and healthy volunteers.
AB  == despite a long-suspected role in the development of human colorectal cancer (crc), the composition of gut microbiota in crc patients has not been adequately  described. in this study, fecal bacterial diversity in crc patients (n=46) and healthy volunteers (n=56) were profiled by 454 pyrosequencing of the v3 region of the 16s ribosomal rna gene. both principal component analysis and unifrac analysis showed structural segregation between the two populations. forty-eight operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified by redundancy analysis as key  variables significantly associated with the structural difference. one otu closely related to bacteroides fragilis was enriched in the gut microbiota of crc patients, whereas three otus related to bacteroides vulgatus and bacteroides uniformis were enriched in that of healthy volunteers. a total of 11 otus belonging to the genera enterococcus, escherichia/shigella, klebsiella, streptococcus and peptostreptococcus were significantly more abundant in the gut  microbiota of crc patients, and 5 otus belonging to the genus roseburia and other butyrate-producing bacteria of the family lachnospiraceae were less abundant. real-time quantitative pcr further validated the significant reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut microbiota of crc patients by measuring the copy numbers of butyryl-coenzyme a coa transferase genes (mann-whitney test,  p<0.01). reduction of butyrate producers and increase of opportunistic pathogens  may constitute a major structural imbalance of gut microbiota in crc patients.

TI  == application of quantitative real-time pcr for rapid identification of bacteroides fragilis group and related organisms in human wound samples.
AB  == our goal was to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qrt-pcr) method to detect bacteroides fragilis group and related organisms from clinical specimens. compared to conventional anaerobic culture, qrt-pcr can provide accurate and more rapid detection and identification of b. fragilis group and similar species. b. fragilis group and related organisms are the most frequently isolated anaerobic pathogens from clinical samples. however, culture and phenotypic identification is quite time-consuming. we designed specific primers and probes based on the 16s rrna gene sequences of bacteroides caccae, bacteroides eggerthii, b. fragilis, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides stercoris, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides vulgatus, odoribacter splanchnicus (bacteroides splanchnicus), parabacteroides distasonis (bacteroides distasonis) and parabacteroides merdae (bacteroides merdae), and detected these species by means of qrt-pcr in 400 human surgical wound infection samples or closed abscesses. the target bacteria were detected from 31 samples (8%) by culture, but from 132 samples (33%) by qrt-pcr (p-value < 0.001). b. uniformis was the most common species (44 positive samples) according to qrt-pcr while culture showed it to be b. fragilis (16 positive samples). additionally, for each species qrt-pcr detected higher counts than culture did; this may reflect detecting dna of dead organisms by qrt-pcr. qrt-pcr is a rapid and sensitive method which has great potential for detection of b. fragilis group and related organisms in wound samples.

TI  == longitudinal analysis of the prevalence, maintenance, and iga response to species of the order bacteroidales in the human gut.
AB  == bacteroidales species are the most abundant gram-negative bacteria of the human intestinal microbiota. these bacteria evolved to synthesize numerous capsular polysaccharides (ps) that are subject to phase variation. in bacteroides fragilis, ps synthesis is regulated so that only one of the eight ps biosynthesis loci is transcribed at a time in each bacterium. to determine if the bacteria evolved this unusual property to evade a host iga response, we directly studied the human fecal ecosystem. we performed a longitudinal analysis of the abundant bacteroidales species from 15 healthy adults at four intervals over a year. for this study, we used bacterial culture to perform analyses not accurate with dna-based methods, including quantification of total viable bacteroidales bacteria, strain maintenance, and iga responses. abundant bacteroidales isolates  were identified to the species level using multiplex pcr and 16s rrna gene sequencing. arbitrarily primed pcr was used for strain typing. iga responses to endogenous strains carried over the year were analyzed, and the orientations of the invertible ps locus promoters from the ecosystem were quantified. subjects consistently harbored from 5 x 10(8) to 8 x 10(10) bacteroidales bacteria/g of feces. within the cohort, 20 different bacteroidales species were detected at high concentrations. bacteroides uniformis was the most prevalent; however, abundant bacteroidales species varied between subjects. strains could be maintained over the year within the ecosystem at high density. iga responses were often not induced and did not correlate with the elimination of a strain or major changes in the orientations of the capsular ps locus promoters.

TI  == intestinal bacteroides species associated with coeliac disease.
AB  == aims: to characterise the predominant species of bacterial populations associated with duodenal biopsies of paediatric patients with active and treated coeliac disease. methods: 20 biopsy specimens from patients with active coeliac disease,  12 from patients with treated coeliac disease, and eight from age-matched controls were evaluated for comparative purposes. bacteroides, bifidobacterium and lactic acid bacteria (lab) populations were analysed by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis using group-specific primers. results: bacteroides diversity was higher in biopsy specimens from controls than in those from patients with active and treated coeliac disease. bacteroides distasonis, bacteroides fragilis/bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides ovatus were more abundant in controls than in patients with coeliac disease (p<0.05). bacteroides vulgatus was more frequently detected in controls than in patients with treated coeliac disease (p<0.01). bacteroides dorei was more common in patients with active coeliac disease than in those with treated coeliac disease and control children (p<0.01). bifidobacterium diversity was higher in patients with coeliac disease than in controls. bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis were more prevalent in patients with active coeliac disease than in patients with treated coeliac disease and control children. a higher lab diversity was found in patients with treated coeliac disease and controls than in patients with active coeliac disease. weissella spp and lactobacillus fermentum were more frequently detected  in patients with treated coeliac disease than in controls and patients with active coeliac disease. conclusions: bacteroides, bifidobacterium and lab populations in the duodenum of spanish children with typical coeliac disease (active and treated) and controls differ in diversity and species composition; this could contribute to features of the disease.

TI  == lessons learned from the anaerobe survey: historical perspective and review of the most recent data (2005-2007).
AB  == background: the rationale and lessons learned through the evolution of the national survey for the susceptibility of bacteroides fragilis group from its initiation in 1981 through 2007 are reviewed here. the survey was conceived in 1980 to track emerging antimicrobial resistance in bacteroides species. methods:  data from the last 11 years of the survey (1997-2007), including 6574 isolates from 13 medical centers, were analyzed for in vitro antimicrobial resistance to both frequently used and newly developed anti-anaerobic agents. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the antibiotics were determined using agar dilution  in accordance with clinical and laboratory standards institute recommendations. results: the analyses revealed that the carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, and doripenem) and piperacillin-tazobactam were the most active agents against these pathogens, with resistance rates of 0.9%-2.3%. in the most recent 3 years of the survey (2005-2007), resistance to some agents was shown to depend on the species, such as ampicillin-sulbactam against bacteroides distasonis (20.6%)  and tigecycline against bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides eggerthii ( approximately 7%). very high resistance rates (>50%) were noted for moxifloxacin  and trovafloxacin, particularly against bacteroides vulgatus. during that period  of study, non-b. fragilis bacteroides species had >40% resistance to clindamycin. metronidazole-resistant bacteroides strains were also first reported during that  period. conclusions: in summary, resistance to antibiotics was greater among non-b. fragilis bacteroides species than among b. fragilis and was especially greater among species with a low frequency of isolation, such as bacteroides caccae and b. uniformis. the emergence of resistance among the non-b. fragilis bacteroides species underscores the need for speciation of b. fragilis group isolates and for clinicians to be aware of associations between species and drug  resistance.

TI  == species identification of clinical isolates of bacteroides by matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis and related species are important human pathogens involved in mixed infections of different origins. the b. fragilis group isolates are phenotypically very similar, grow more slowly than aerobic bacteria and, accordingly, are frequently misidentifed with classical or automated phenotypical identification methods. recent taxonomic changes and new species accepted as members of the bacteroides genus are not included in the different databases of commercially available identification kits. the use of matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) was therefore evaluated for the species identification of 277 clinical isolates of the bacteroides genus. species identification was carried out with maldi bruker daltonik biotyper software (bruker daltonik gmbh, bremen, germany) by comparing the mass spectrum of each strain with the mass spectra of the 3260 reference strains currently available. the results of conventional phenotypical identification of the isolates were used as a reference. 16s rrna gene sequencing was performed for a selection of the strains that gave discrepant results and for all those inconclusively identified by maldi-tof ms; 270 isolates (97.5%) were unequivocally identified [log(score) >/=2.0] by comparison with the reference strains present in the maldi biotyper database. of the 23 isolates for which the  maldi-tof ms species identification differed from the conventional phenotypical identification, 11 were sequenced. the sequencing data confirmed the maldi-tof ms result in ten cases and, for the remaining isolate, the sequencing data did not lead to the determination of the species, but only to that of the genus (bacteroides sp.). the discriminating power and identification accuracy of maldi-tof ms proved to be superior to that of biochemical testing for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides uniformis.

TI  == moxifloxacin resistance is prevalent among bacteroides and prevotella species in  greece.
AB  == objectives: moxifloxacin is recommended in the empirical treatment of infections  involving gram-negative anaerobes. however, current european data regarding its activity against anaerobic pathogens are limited. in order to evaluate its potency, we comparatively studied the activity of moxifloxacin against recently isolated gram-negative anaerobes. methods: four hundred and ninety-five gram-negative anaerobic clinical isolates (296 bacteroides fragilis group, 58 non-fragilis bacteroides spp. and 141 prevotella spp.) were prospectively recovered in six greek hospitals. moxifloxacin mics were determined in comparison with those of penicillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoxitin, imipenem, metronidazole and clindamycin. results: overall moxifloxacin mic(50) and mic(90)  were 2 and 32 mg/l, respectively. based on the current clsi breakpoints (susceptible, < or =2 mg/l; resistant, > or =8 mg/l), almost half of the total isolates (49%) were non-susceptible to moxifloxacin (32% resistant; 17% intermediate). this was more evident among the non-fragilis bacteroides species,  where 47% of the isolates were resistant and 14% intermediate to moxifloxacin. species variation was noticed, with the highest non-susceptible rates detected among prevotella oralis (90%), prevotella bivia (80%), bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (75%), bacteroides uniformis (70%) and bacteroides capillosus (67%) species. among the 19 (4%) isolates that were metronidazole non-susceptible (mic > or = 16 mg/l), only 4 (21%) were additionally non-susceptible to moxifloxacin. conclusions: high resistance rates to moxifloxacin among bacteroides and prevotella spp. were recorded, exceeding those previously reported in europe and contraindicating its use as monotherapy for infections involving gram-negative anaerobes without prior microbiological confirmation. for empirical usage, moxifloxacin should be combined with metronidazole in order to cover for these pathogens.

TI  == relative abundance of bacteroides spp. in stools and wastewaters as determined by hierarchical oligonucleotide primer extension.
AB  == a molecular method, termed hierarchical oligonucleotide primer extension (hope),  was used to determine the relative abundances of predominant bacteroides spp. present in fecal microbiota and wastewaters. for this analysis, genomic dna in feces of healthy human adults, bovines, and swine and in wastewaters was extracted and total bacterial 16s rrna genes were pcr amplified and used as the dna templates for hope. nineteen oligonucleotide primers were designed to detect  14 bacteroides spp. at different hierarchical levels (domain, order, cluster, and species) and were arranged into and used in six multiplex hope reaction mixtures. results showed that species like b. vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. caccae, b.  uniformis, b. fragilis, b. eggerthii, and b. massiliensis could be individually detected in human feces at abundances corresponding to as little as 0.1% of pcr-amplified 16s rrna genes. minor species like b. pyogenes, b. salyersiae, and  b. nordii were detected only collectively using a primer that targeted the b. fragilis subgroup (corresponding to approximately 0.2% of pcr-amplified 16s rrna  genes). furthermore, bac303-related targets (i.e., most bacteroidales) were observed to account for 28 to 44% of pcr-amplified 16s rrna genes from human fecal microbiota, and their abundances were higher than those detected in the bovine and swine fecal microbiota and in wastewaters by factors of five and two,  respectively. these results were comparable to those obtained by quantitative pcr and to those reported previously from studies using whole-cell fluorescence hybridization and 16s rrna clone library methods, supporting the conclusion that  hope can be a sensitive, specific, and rapid method to determine the relative abundances of bacteroides spp. predominant in fecal samples.

TI  == [bacteroides fragilis group in non-diarrheal human feces and its antimicrobial susceptibility].
AB  == bacteroides is a predominant anaerobic bacteria of the human colon. since the ten species of the bacteroides fragilis group are responsible for most anaerobic endogenous infections, the antimicrobial resistance of these bacteria is of great concern due to the role they can play in the dissemination of resistance. eighty  non-diarrheic human feces samples were analyzed. each sample was inoculated in bbe (bacteroides bile esculin) and kvlb (kanamycin, vancomycin, laked blood) agar plates and were incubated in anaerobic conditions for 48 h at 35 degrees c. for identification and antimicrobial sensitivity, miniaturized systems for anaerobic  bacteria (rapid id-32a and atb ana, biomerieux) were used. sixty-four (80%) of the samples were positive for at least one bacteroides fragilis species; b. uniformis and b. fragilis were the most frequent species (24.6% and 16.9%); b. stercoris and b. eggerthii were the least frequent (0.7 and 2.1%). the strains showed resistance to different penicillins (40.2-93.1%), some even in the presence of beta-lactamase inhibitors, to cephalosporins (31.0-52.1%) and to frequently used antibiotics against anaerobes, such as clindamycin (32.2%) and imipenem (10.3%). the most effective antimicrobials against bacteroides fragilis  were piperacillin and ticarcillin combined with beta-lactamase inhibitors, as well as chloramphenicol and metronidazole (>90% susceptibility). none of the b. fragilis group were resistant to clindamycin or metronidazole, but one-third of the imipenem-resistant strains belonged to this species. the most resistant species was b. distasonis, while b. vulgatus was the most susceptible. none of the tested antimicrobials were effective against all ten species; the majority of the species had some isolates that were resistant to imipenem, metronidazole or clindamycin. this resistance pattern suggests the presence of efficient transmission mechanisms among these endogenous bacteria.

TI  == [esbl-positive strains of the bacteroides fragilis group isolated from patients at the regional hospital center in plock (poland)].
AB  == the aim of this study was to confirm a presumptive qualification of clinical b. fragilis group strains isolated in plock as esbl-positive strains and to determine some properties of these strains. twenty four clinical strains belonging to the b. fragilis group, isolated first of all from surgical patients, were received for testing. identification of strains was performed in the automatic atb expression system (biomerieux sa, france) using biochemical api 20  a strips. strains were tested for the production of catalase (id color catalase test, biomerieux sa) and beta-lactamase (cefinase, bbl, becton dickinson, usa). susceptibility of strains to four antimicrobial agents: clindamycin, metronidazole, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and imipenem was determined by etest (ab biodisk, sweden). esbls were detected with the use of two disc diffusion methods: the double-disc synergy test (ddst) according to jarlier et al. and the  diagnostic disc (dd) test according to appleton. seventeen of examined strains belonged to the species bacteroides fragilis, three--to b. ovatus/thetaiotaomicron, two--to b. distasonis, one--to b. uniformis and one--to  b. stercoris/eggerthii. one strain (b. uniformis) did not produce catalase, whereas all strains produced beta-lactamases. examined strains were susceptible in vitro to metronidazole, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and imipenem. one clindamycin-resistant strain was detected (b. fragilis). occurrence of esbl-type  enzymes was confirmed in 22 strains of following species: b. fragilis (17 strains), b. ovatus/thetaiotaomicron (3), b. distasonis (1) and b. uniformis (1). clinical strains of the b. fragilis group with a new mechanism of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics appeared during last years in poland. they produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), so they are resistant to penicillins,  cephalosporins and monobactams. monitoring of infections caused by these threatening strains in hospital patients is very important.

TI  == virulence markers and antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria of the bacteroides fragilis group isolated from stool of children with diarrhea in sao paulo, brazil.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis has been isolated from several human and non-human monomicrobial and mixed infections. in this study, some virulence markers and the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria of the b. fragilis group isolated from children's stools were evaluated. all the 64 isolates showed the following characteristics: capsulated, beta-hemolytic, hydrophilic, and serum-resistant. only, 24 (37.5%) strains were resistant at 60 masculine c, for 30 min, and among  them, 12 (18.75%) were resistant at 60 masculine c, for 60 min. also, none strain was resistant at 100 masculine c. four strains were able to hemagglutinate erythrocytes and d-mannose, d-galactose, d-arabinose, and d-xylose inhibited hemagglutination in 2 b. fragilis strains (p76a, p76b). the hemagglutination in the strain b. uniformis p3-2 was inhibited by d-xylose and d-galactose. the bft gene detection and the enterotoxin production were observed only in 13 ef-enterotoxigenic species. fragilysin activity was confirmed on ht-29 cells. the antimicrobial determination confirmed that both imipenem and metronidazole were efficient against b. fragilis species; all the strains were resistant to lead and nickel. plasmids of 2.9, 4.4, 4.8, and 8.9 kb were observed in 6 tested strains.  these results show the values of the species identification from clinical infections, as well as of the periodic evaluation of the resistance patterns of the b. fragilis group at brazilian medical institutions.

TI  == rapid identification of the species of the bacteroides fragilis group by multiplex pcr assays using group- and species-specific primers.
AB  == we report a rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay to identify the 10 bacteroides fragilis group species - bacteroides caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. fragilis, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b. stercoris, b.  thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis and b. vulgatus. these 10 species were first divided into three subgroups by multiplex pcr-g, followed by three multiplex pcr  assays with three species-specific primer mixtures for identification to the species level. the primers were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s rrna, the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and part of the 23s rrna gene. the established two-step multiplex pcr identification scheme was applied to the identification of 155 clinical isolates of the b. fragilis group that were previously identified to the species level by phenotypic tests. the new scheme was more accurate than phenotypic identification, which was accurate only 84.5% of the time. the multiplex pcr scheme established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of the b. fragilis group species. this will permit more accurate assessment of the role of various b. fragilis group members in infections and of the degree of antimicrobial resistance in each of the group members.

AB  == using a microbroth method for aerobes and agar dilution for anaerobes, we studied the comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, three fluoroquinolones, two macrolides and two beta-lactams, against 207 aerobic and 162 anaerobic antral sinus puncture isolates. gemifloxacin was active at < or = 0.25 ug/ml against 198/207 [96%] aerobes and 127/162 [78%] anaerobes or 325/369 [88%] of all isolates and was the most active quinolone on a weight basis against gram-positive organisms. all haemophilus and moraxella species were susceptible to < or =0.06 ug/ml of gemifloxacin. thirty-five anaerobic isolates [35/162, 22%] required > or =0.5 ug/ml of gemifloxacin for inhibition, including all prevotella species [all except one strain of p. bivia were susceptible to < or = 2 ug/ml] and occasional strains of bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides fragilis, bilophila  wadsworthia, peptostreptococcus magnus, peptostreptococcus micros, propionibacterium acnes, and veillonella species. all fusobacteria were susceptible to < or =0.25 ug/ml of gemifloxacin. based on our in vitro study results, we conclude that gemifloxacin may offer a therapeutic alternative for sinus infections.

TI  == gyra mutations associated with quinolone resistance in bacteroides fragilis group strains.
AB  == mutations in the gyra gene contribute considerably to quinolone resistance in escherichia coli. mechanisms for quinolone resistance in anaerobic bacteria are less well studied. the bacteroides fragilis group are the anaerobic organisms most frequently isolated from patients with bacteremia and intraabdominal infections. forty-four clinafloxacin-resistant and-susceptible fecal and clinical isolates of the b. fragilis group (eight bacteroides fragilis, three bacteroides  ovatus, five bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, six bacteroides uniformis, and 22 bacteroides vulgatus) and six atcc strains of the b. fragilis group were analyzed as follows: (i) determination of susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and clinafloxacin by the agar dilution method and (ii) sequencing of the gyra quinolone resistance-determining region (qrdr) located between amino  acid residues equivalent to ala-67 through gln-106 in e. coli. amino acid substitutions were found at hotspots at positions 82 (n = 15) and 86 (n = 8). strains with ser82leu substitutions (n = 13) were highly resistant to all quinolones tested. mutations in other positions of gyra were also frequently found in quinolone-resistant and -susceptible isolates. eight clinical strains that lacked mutations in their qrdr were susceptible to at least two of the quinolones tested. although newer quinolones have good antimicrobial activity against the b. fragilis group, quinolone resistance in b. fragilis strains can be readily selected in vivo. mutational events in the qrdr of gyra seem to contribute to quinolone resistance in bacteroides species.

TI  == genetic variation in 16s-23s rdna internal transcribed spacer regions and the possible use of this genetic variation for molecular diagnosis of bacteroides species.
AB  == the structural variation in 16s-23s rdna internal transcribed spacer regions (its) among bacteroides species was assessed by pcr amplification and sequencing  analysis, and its possible use for molecular diagnosis of these species was evaluated. ninety strains of the genus bacteroides, including the species b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. fragilis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis and b. vulgatus, produced one to three its amplification products with  sizes ranging from 615 to 810 bp. some bacteroides strains could be differentiated at species level on the basis of its amplification patterns and restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis using a four-nucleotide-recognizing enzyme, msp i. the results of sequence analysis of its amplification products revealed genes for ile-trna and ala-trna in all strains tested. the nucleotide sequence, except for that in trna-coding regions,  was highly variable and characteristic for each species, but a common sequence among b. fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron and b. ovatus was observed. a digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotide probe (named fot1), which was designed from this conserved sequence, specifically hybridized to the its amplification products from b. fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron and b. ovatus. these results suggest that the its region is a useful target for the development of rapid and accurate techniques for identification of bacteroides species.

TI  == multicenter survey of the changing in vitro antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates of bacteroides fragilis group, prevotella, fusobacterium, porphyromonas, and peptostreptococcus species.
AB  == in vitro surveys of antimicrobial resistance among clinically important anaerobes are an important source of information that can be used for clinical decisions in the choice of empiric antimicrobial therapy. this study surveyed the susceptibilities of 556 clinical anaerobic isolates from four large medical centers using a broth microdilution method. piperacillin-tazobactam was the only  antimicrobial agent to which all the isolates were susceptible. similarly, imipenem, meropenem, and metronidazole were highly active (resistance, <0.5%), whereas the lowest susceptibility rates were noted for penicillin g, ciprofloxacin, and clindamycin. for most antibiotics, blood isolates were less susceptible than isolates from intra-abdominal, obstetric-gynecologic, and other  sources. all isolates of the bacteroides fragilis group were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam and metronidazole, while resistance to imipenem and meropenem was low (<2%). for these same isolates, resistance rates (intermediate  and resistant mics) to ampicillin-sulbactam, cefoxitin, trovafloxacin, and clindamycin were 11, 8, 7, and 29%, respectively. among the individual species of the b. fragilis group, the highest resistance rates were noted among the following organism-drug combinations: for clindamycin, bacteroides distasonis and bacteroides ovatus; for cefoxitin, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. distasonis, and bacteroides uniformis; for ampicillin-sulbactam, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, and b. uniformis; and for trovafloxacin, bacteroides vulgatus. for the carbapenens, imipenem resistance was noted among b. fragilis and meropenem resistance was seen among b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, and b. uniformis. with few exceptions all antimicrobial agents were highly active against isolates of prevotella, fusobacterium, porphyromonas, and peptostreptococcus. these data further establish and confirm that clinically important anaerobes can vary widely in their antimicrobial susceptibilities. fortunately most antimicrobial agents were active against the test isolates. however, concern is warranted for what appears to be a significant increases in resistance to ampicillin-sulbactam and clindamycin.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of abt-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of abt-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. mics at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for actinomyces spp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium spp., and porphyromonas spp. the mic(50)s and mic(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for eubacterium spp., lactobacillus spp., clostridium difficile, and clostridium ramosum. the mic(90) for bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides ureolyticus, and campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for prevotella bivia and other prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. the mic(90) for fusobacterium nucleatum was 8  microg/ml, and that for fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. the mic(90)s for the bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for b. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides distasonis, and bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. telithromycin mics for the b. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than abt-773 mics. for all strains, abt-773  was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.

TI  == tla-1: a new plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum beta-lactamase from escherichia coli.
AB  == escherichia coli r170, isolated from the urine of an infected patient, was resistant to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin but was susceptible to amikacin, cefotetan, and imipenem. this particular strain contained three different plasmids that encoded two beta-lactamases with pis of 7.0 and 9.0. resistance to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole was transferred by conjugation from e. coli r170 to e. coli j53-2. the transferred plasmid, rza92, which encoded a single beta-lactamase, was 150 kb in length. the cefotaxime resistance gene that  encodes the tla-1 beta-lactamase (pi 9.0) was cloned from the transconjugant by transformation to e. coli dh5alpha. sequencing of the bla(tla-1) gene revealed an open reading frame of 906 bp, which corresponded to 301 amino acid residues, including motifs common to class a beta-lactamases: (70)sxxk, (130)sdn, and (234)ktg. the amino acid sequence of tla-1 shared 50% identity with the cme-1 chromosomal class a beta-lactamase from chryseobacterium (flavobacterium) meningosepticum; 48.8% identity with the veb-1 class a beta-lactamase from e. coli; 40 to 42% identity with cbla of bacteroides uniformis, per-1 of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and per-2 of salmonella typhimurium; and 39% identity with cepa of bacteroides fragilis. the partially purified tla-1 beta-lactamase had a molecular mass of 31.4 kda and a pi of 9.0 and preferentially hydrolyzed cephaloridine, cefotaxime, cephalothin, benzylpenicillin, and ceftazidime. the enzyme was markedly inhibited by sulbactam, tazobactam, and clavulanic acid. tla-1 is a new  extended-spectrum beta-lactamase of ambler class a.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin (sb 265805) against anaerobes.
AB  == gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805), a new fluoronaphthyridone, was tested against  359 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella blood agar and an inoculum of 10(5) cfu/spot. comparative antimicrobials tested included trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin (du-6859a), penicillin g, amoxicillin clavulanate, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. the mic(50) and mic(90) (mics at which 50 and 90% of the isolates were inhibited) of gemifloxacin against various organisms (with the number of strains tested in parentheses) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): for bacteroides fragilis (28), 0.5 and 2; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (24), 1 and 16; for bacteroides caccae (12), 1 and 16; for bacteroides distasonis (12), 8 and >16; for bacteroides ovatus (12), 4 and >16; for bacteroides stercoris (12), 0.5 and 0.5; for bacteroides uniformis (12), 1 and 4; for bacteroides vulgatus (11), 4 and 4; for clostridium clostridioforme (15), 0.5 and 0.5; for clostridium difficile (15), 1 and >16; for clostridium innocuum (13), 0.125 and 2; for clostridium perfringens (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for  clostridium ramosum (14), 0.25 and 8; for fusobacterium nucleatum (12), 0.125 and 0.25; for fusobacterium necrophorum (11), 0.25 and 0.5; for fusobacterium varium  (13), 0.5 and 1; for fusobacterium spp. (12), 1 and 2; for peptostreptococcus anaerobius (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (13), 0.125 and 0.125; for peptostreptococcus magnus (14), 0.03 and 0.03; for peptostreptococcus micros (12), 0.06 and 0.06; for peptostreptococcus prevotii (14), 0.06 and 0.25; for porphyromonas asaccharolytica (11), 0.125 and 0.125; for prevotella bivia (10), 8 and 16; for prevotella buccae (10), 2 and 2; for prevotella intermedia (10), 0.5 and 0.5; and for prevotella melaninogenica (11),  1 and 1. gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805) was 1 to 4 dilutions more active than  trovafloxacin against fusobacteria and peptostreptococci, and the two drugs were  equivalent against clostridia and p. asaccharolytica. gemifloxacin was equivalent to sitafloxacin (du 6859a) against peptostreptococci, c. perfringens, and c. ramosum, and sitafloxacin was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against fusobacteria.  sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, and levofloxacin were generally less active than gemifloxacin against all anaerobes.

TI  == [activity of trovafloxacin and ten other antimicrobials against gram negative anaerobic bacilli].
AB  == as an increase in anaerobes resistant to a great variety of antimicrobials have been seen in the last few years, a search for new agents with activity against these microorganisms is needed. one of these agents is trovafloxacin. in our study, all strains were susceptible to imipenem, metronidazole, chloramphenicol and piperacillin/tazobactam. a total of 97% of the strains were inhibited with 2  mg/ml of trovafloxacin. the microorganisms bacteroides fragilis and b. uniformis  showed the least susceptibility against the antimicrobials studied, with a mic90  for trovafloxacin of 1 and 2 mg/ml, respectively. fusobacterium spp. were the most susceptible, with an mic90 for trovafloxacin of 0.5 mg/ml. trovafloxacin showed good activity against gram-negative anaerobe rods, and could therefore be  considered as an alternative in the treatment of the infections produced by these microorganisms.

TI  == detection of bacteroides fragilis enterotoxin gene by pcr.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis constitutes about 1% of the bacterial flora in intestines of normal humans. enterotoxigenic strains of b. fragilis have been associated with diarrheal diseases in humans and animals. the enterotoxin produced by these isolates induces fluid changes in ligated intestinal loops and an in vitro cytotoxic response in ht-29 cells. we developed a nested pcr to detect the enterotoxin gene of b. fragilis in stool specimens. after dna extraction, a 367-bp fragment was amplified with two outer primers. the amplicon from this reaction was subjected to a second round of amplification with a set of internal  primers. with these inner primers, a 290-bp dna fragment was obtained which was confirmed as part of the b. fragilis enterotoxin gene by southern blotting with a nonradioactive internal probe and a chemiluminescence system. by this approach, b. fragilis enterotoxin gene sequences were detected in eight known enterotoxigenic human isolates and nine enterotoxigenic horse isolates. no amplification products were obtained from dna extracted from 28 nonenterotoxigenic b. fragilis isolates or b. distasonis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, b. ovatus, escherichia coli, or clostridium difficile. the sensitivity of this assay allowed us to detect as little as 1 pg of enterotoxin dna sequences or 100 to 1,000 cells of enterotoxigenic b. fragilis/g of stool. enterotoxin production of all isolates was confirmed in vitro in ht-29 cells. a 100% correlation was obtained between enterotoxin detection by cytotoxin assay and the nested pcr assay. this rapid and sensitive assay can be used to identify enterotoxigenic b. fragilis and may be used clinically to determine the role of b. fragilis in diarrheal diseases.

TI  == stimulation of transforming growth factor beta1 by enteric bacteria in the pathogenesis of rat intestinal fibrosis.
AB  == background & aims: bacteria and their products stimulate inflammatory responses.  certain mediators, such as transforming growth factor beta1 (tgf-beta1), induce collagen synthesis. excess collagen deposition results in bowel strictures. the aim of this study was to investigate the role of bacteria and tgf-beta1 in the pathogenesis of intestinal fibrosis. methods: in rats with colitis, the effects of bowel decontamination with antibiotics on tgf-beta1, tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and collagen content in colonic tissue were studied. in normal rats, bacteria of the predominant flora were inoculated into the colonic wall. the effect of neutralizing antibody to tgf-beta1 on tissue collagen deposition was studied. results: rats with chronic colitis showed increased levels of tgf-beta1, tnf-alpha, and collagen in the tissue and a high rate of bowel strictures. antibiotic treatment significantly prevented the increase in tgf-beta1 and collagen and the formation of strictures. inoculation of bacterial  suspensions into the colonic wall increased tissue tgf-beta1 and collagen content. neutralizing antibody to tgf-beta1 prevented collagen deposition. colonic wall inoculations with single anaerobic strains (clostridium ramosum, bacteroides fragilis, and bacteroides uniformis), but not with aerobes, induced collagen deposition. conclusions: certain strains of the common flora stimulate tgf-beta1 and induce deposition of collagen in the colonic wall.

TI  == intestinal anaerobic bacteria hydrolyse sorivudine, producing the high blood concentration of 5-(e)-(2-bromovinyl)uracil that increases the level and toxicity of 5-fluorouracil.
AB  == sorivudine, 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosyl-5-(e)-(2-bromovinyl)uracil, is a potent antiviral agent against varicella-zoster virus and herpes simplex virus type 1. however, sorivudine should not be used in combination with anticancer drugs such  as 5-fluorouracil (5-fu) because (e)-5-(2-bromovinyl)uracil (bvu), a metabolite of sorivudine, inhibits the degradation of 5-fu, resulting in its accumulation in the blood and marked enhancement of the toxicity of 5-fu. since phosphorolytic enzymes generate bvu from sorivudine, we investigated the distribution of the enzyme activity in rats. high activity was found in the cecal and large intestinal contents, while very low or no detectable activity in the liver, kidney, stomach, cecum, large intestine, and the stomach and small intestinal contents. these results suggest that intestinal microflora play an important role in bvu production. therefore, we measured the phosphorylase activity in cell-free extracts from 23 aerobes, 16 anaerobes and a fungus. bacteroides species b. vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. fragilis, b. uniformis and b. eggerthii, dominant members of intestinal microflora, had high activity to convert sorivudine to bvu. to elucidate the contribution of intestinal microflora to bvu  production in vivo, we administered sorivudine to rats treated with several antibiotics and measured the bvu concentration in the serum of rats. when sorivudine was given to rats treated with ampicillin or a mixture of bacitracin,  neomycin and streptomycin, which decreased the numbers of viable aerobes and anaerobes, only a small amount of bvu was found in the serum. bvu concentration in the serum of rats treated with metronidazole to decrease the number of intestinal anaerobes was also very low. in contrast, bvu concentration in the serum of rats treated with kanamycin, which was used to decrease the number of aerobes selectively, was higher than that of non-treated rats. these results also suggest that bvu is produced by intestinal anaerobic bacteria especially bacteroides species in vivo.

TI  == characterization of saccharolytic bacteroides and prevotella isolates from infected dog and cat bite wounds in humans.
AB  == saccharolytic, nonpigmented, anaerobic gram-negative rods isolated from infected  dog and cat bite wounds in humans have been poorly characterized, and most are not included in the databases of kits used for anaerobic identification; thus, they are problematic for clinical laboratories to identify. fifty strains isolated from such wounds were characterized with commercial kits for preformed-enzyme detection, carbohydrate fermentation, and other biochemical tests. pcr fingerprinting was performed on these strains to further characterize  subgroups within these species. bacteroides tectum is a frequent isolate in bite  wounds and resembles prevotella bivia in colony morphology and saccharolytic activity, except that it grows in 20% bile and hydrolyzes esculin. profile numbers generated by various kits associate b. tectum with p. bivia, prevotella oralis group, or prevotella melaninogenica. pcr fingerprinting identified at least four subgroups and confirmed the heterogeneous nature of this species. prevotella heparinolytica was also frequently isolated from these bite wounds. it produces indole and generates a profile number in preformed-enzyme kits that is usually associated with bacteroides uniformis. however, it is bile sensitive and  quite distinct from the bacteroides fragilis group of anaerobes. the pcr fingerprint profiles generated by strains of p. heparinolytica were very similar  to that of the type strain and to each other. prevotella zoogleoformans, occasionally isolated from dog and cat bite wounds in humans, resembles p. heparinolytica except for a negative indole test. clinical laboratories should be aware of the characteristics of these animal species when identifying isolates from animal bite wounds in humans.

AB  == objective: to evaluate the use of a rapid identification system, rapid id 32a (biomerieux), for the identification of clinically important species in the b. fragilis group. methods: the use of rapid id 32a was validated on 249 clinical isolates, all of which were tested by conventional techniques, and in selected instances api 20a. rapid id 32a (and api 20a as appropriate) was then applied in  a central laboratory to the identification of 1289 b. fragilis group clinical isolates from 22 laboratories in 15 european countries. results: improvements in  the initial database permitted the accurate identification of isolates of b. fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron and b. vulgatus, but further tests, especially for  catalase production, were required to distinguish between b. ovatus and b. uniformis, while an identification of b. distasonis could be accepted only after  careful review of results. there were too few isolates of b. caccae, b. merdae and b. stercoris for us to reach satisfactory conclusions, but further tests are  clearly necessary. conclusions: the study emphasizes the importance of including  sufficient numbers of isolates of different species in the validation of identification methods. rapid id 32a is a reliable system for the identification  of the common species in the b. fragilis group, especially b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron.

TI  == purification and characterization of a fibrinogen-degrading protease in bacteroides fragilis strain ych46.
AB  == a novel fibrinogenolytic protease was purified from bacteroides fragilis strain ych46. the protease was extracted from cells by ultrasonic treatment and was purified 425-fold with a recovery of 2.1% by sequential procedures using azocasein as a substrate. the purified protease showed a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an estimated molecular weight of 100 kda, which was consistent with the value obtained by gel filtration, indicating a monomeric native structure. its optimal ph, km, and vmax for azocasein were 7.5, 0.2%, and 286 u/min/mg, respectively. the protease activity was completely inhibited by addition of 1 mm hg2+, cu2+, zn2+, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, n-ethylmaleimide or p-chloromercuribenzoate but not  by the inhibitors of metalloprotease or aspartic protease, suggesting that the enzyme is a serine-thiol-like protease. the protease hydrolyzed azocasein, casein, fibrinogen, gelatin, and azocoll, but not bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, fibrin, fibronectin, immunoglobulins, transferrin, hemoglobin or types i, iii, and iv collagen. the enzyme also hydrolyzed the chromogenic substrates alanyl-alanine p-nitroanilide, l-valyl-alanine p-nitroanilide, alanyl-alanyl-valyl-alanine p-nitroanilide, and glycyl-proline p-nitroanilide, but was inert toward l-alanine p-nitroanilide, alanyl-alanyl-alanine p-nitroanilide, and n-alpha-benzoyl-dl-arginine p-nitroanilide. the protease completely hydrolyzed the alpha-chain of fibrinogen at 37 c within 10 hr and at the same time the time required for clotting of protease-treated fibrinogen by thrombin was prolonged. the fibrinogenolytic activity of a crude extract of b. fragilis was stronger than that of other species of the bacteroides fragilis group tested: b. ovatus, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. uniformis, and b. thetaiotaomicron. these results suggest that the fibrinogenolytic protease is an  important biological factor in bacteroides infection.

TI  == cloning and expression of the bacteroides fragilis ych46 neuraminidase gene in escherichia coli and bacteroides uniformis.
AB  == a neuraminidase-encoding gene nanh of bacteroides fragilis strain ych46 was cloned into the cosmid vector phc79. the nanh gene was subcloned from the cosmid  and was located within a 2.2-kb xhoi-kpni fragment. southern hybridization experiments demonstrated that the gene was present as a single copy on the bacterial chromosome. neuraminidase activity expressed in the initial escherichia coli clone was approximately 3600-fold lower than that expressed in b. fragilis ych46. however, when nanh was transferred from e. coli to b. uniformis by mobilization of a shuttle plasmid, the transconjugant expressed 1100-fold higher  activity than the e. coli donor did. these results suggest that modes of nanh expression in e. coli and bacteroides are heterologous.

TI  == electrophoretic analysis of the lipopolysaccharides of bacteroides spp.
AB  == lipopolysaccharide (lps) extracts of reference strains and isolates of bacteroides spp. prepared by the proteinase k method were resolved by tricine-sodium-dodecyl-sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and located by silver staining. a considerable diversity of lps profiles was evident within the  bacteroides genus although profiles were essentially species-specific, with some  minor interstrain variations apparent among isolates of b. uniformis, b. ovatus,  b. eggerthii and b. thetaiotaomicron. the lps of most species consisted of a major rough lps component of 2-5 kda and a series of higher molecular weight bands which varied with species. b. vulgatus lps was distinctive in showing an extensive ladder of multiple repeating oligosaccharide units with molecular weights ranging from 4 to > 17 kda b. stercoris lps included a high molecular weight (> 17 kda) ladder of repeating oligosaccharide units. b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron differed from most other species in producing a short ladder of  repeating oligosaccharide units interspersing the rough lps and a 5.6 kda (b. fragilis) or 9 kda (b. thetaiotaomicron) yellow-staining component. the heterogeneity of lps profiles within the bacteroides genus may reflect the differences in pathogenicity among the species and prove useful for typing.

TI  == german multicentre study on the in vitro susceptibility of bacteroides species. the german bacteroides study group.
AB  == in 1990 the first german multicentre study on the in vitro susceptibility of bacteroides species was completed. employing a commercially prepared microbroth dilution assay, nine participating institutions evaluated approximately 100 consecutive isolates of bacteroides species from relevant clinical specimens. a total of 911 strains (449 bacteroides fragilis, 201 bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, 79 bacteroides ovatus, 78 bacteroides vulgatus, 77 bacteroides distasonis, 25 bacteroides uniformis, 2 others) were tested. most of the isolates came from surgical patients (72%); other sources included gynaecological patients (9%) and  medical patients (5%). seventy-eight percent of the anaerobes were found in mixed culture together with at least one aerobic organism (escherichia coli 36%, streptococci 15%, or enterococci 13%), while in 22% of the cases, the anaerobes were the only bacteria grown from the specimens. the results showed that many of  the strains were potent beta-lactamase producers (as judged by resistance to amoxicillin). however, all but one of the isolates demonstrated susceptibility in vitro when clavulanic acid was added to amoxicillin or ticarcillin. at the same time, 13% of the organisms were resistant to mezlocillin, 5% to cefoxitin and 4%  to clindamycin. three strains were reported resistant to imipenem and one strain  to metronidazole.

TI  == evidence for natural transfer of a tetracycline resistance gene between bacteria  from the human colon and bacteria from the bovine rumen.
AB  == previously, we demonstrated conjugal transfer of a specially constructed shuttle  vector, prdb5, from the human colonic anaerobe bacteroides uniformis to the ruminal anaerobe prevotella (bacteroides) ruminicola b(1)4. we have now shown that naturally occurring gene transfer elements in bacteroides species and prevotella ruminicola can also be transferred between these two genera. a self-transmissible chromosomal element originally found in a clinical isolate of  bacteroides fragilis (tcr emr 12256) was transferred from b. uniformis 0061 to p. ruminicola b(1)4 and from p. ruminicola b(1)4 back to b. uniformis or to another  human colonic species, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. similarly, a conjugative plasmid (prri4) originally found in p. ruminicola 223 was transferred from p. ruminicola b(1)4 to b. uniformis or b. thetaiotaomicron. prri4 could be transferred from the colonic bacteroides species only if the donor strain contained the tcr emr 12256 element in its chromosome. these results show that transfer of naturally occurring elements can be demonstrated under laboratory conditions. evidence that such transfers may actually have occurred in nature came from our finding that the tetracycline resistance (tcr) gene on the p. ruminicola plasmid prri4 hybridized on high-stringency southern blots with the tcr gene found on the bacteroides tcr elements. the presence of the same gene in  such distantly related genera of bacteria is most likely to have occurred as a result of horizontal transfer.

TI  == antibiotic sensitivity of the bacteroides fragilis group in europe. european study group.
AB  == rates of resistance to 12 antibiotics were determined for 1,289 isolates of bacteroides fragilis group submitted in 1988-1989 by 22 laboratories in 15 european countries. there was no resistance to metronidazole (breakpoint 8 mg/l)  and only one isolate was resistant to chloramphenicol (breakpoint 8 mg/l). resistance was uncommon for imipenem (0.3% at greater than 4 mg/l), amoxicillin/clavulanate (1% at greater than 8 mg/l), cefoxitin (3% at greater than 32 mg/l), mezlocillin (6% at greater than 64 mg/l) and clindamycin (9% at greater than 4 mg/l). resistance was the rule for ampicillin (93% at greater than 4 mg/l), ciprofloxacin (56% at greater than 4 mg/l) and tetracycline (64% at greater than 4 mg/l). bacteroides fragilis, the commonest species, was generally  the most sensitive: resistance of this organism was uncommon for cefotetan (4% at greater than 32 mg/l) and ceftazidime (12% at greater than 32 mg/l) to which the  other species were more often resistant. there were small but significant differences between laboratories and countries for many of the antibiotics. regionally the most striking differences were for clindamycin where resistance in bacteroides fragilis was most common in the south and for tetracycline where resistance in bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and bacteroides  uniformis was least common in the north.

TI  == recovery of bacteroides fragilis group from clinical specimens following antimicrobial therapy.
AB  == over a period of 14 years (1973-1987), 3165 specimens submitted to the microbiology laboratory demonstrated the recovery of anaerobic bacteria. a total  of 988 bacteroides fragilis group isolates were recovered (0.3 isolates per specimen). bacteroides fragilis accounted for 62% of the total of all b. fragilis group isolates, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron for 15%, bacteroides vulgatus for 8%, bacteroides ovatus for 7%, bacteroides distasonis for 6%, and bacteroides uniformis for 2%. of the 988 b. fragilis group isolates, 310 (31%) were recovered after the administration of antimicrobial therapy, and 129 (13%) were the single  isolate recovered from the infected site at that time. the recovery rate of all members of b. fragilis group after the administration of antimicrobial therapy, when isolated alone or when mixed with other bacteria, was similar. the data illustrate the equal ability of all members of the b. fragilis group to persist in and to contribute to the inflammatory process; and provide further support for their pathogenic role.

AB  == this study evaluated the ability of a rapid identification system for anaerobic bacteria, atb 32a, now renamed rapid id 32a (api-biomerieux uk ltd., basingstoke), to identify accurately 74 strains of the 'b. fragilis group'. atb 32a identified correctly 78.4% of strains to species level, without supplemental  tests. the percentage of strains identified to species level rose to 94.6% when a supplementary test (advised by biomerieux) for catalase production was used to differentiate between bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides uniformis. rapid id 32a  is a rapid, accurate method for the identification of members of the 'b. fragilis group' isolated within a routine clinical laboratory.

TI  == rapid differentiation of the species of the genus bacteroides sensu stricto by capillary gas chromatography of cellular carbohydrates.
AB  == whole-cell hydrolysates of bacteroides fragilis, the type species of the genus bacteroides castellani and chalmers 1919, and the genetical closely related species b. vulgatus, b. ovatus, b. eggerthii, b. distasonis, b. uniformis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. stercoris, b. merdae, and b. caccae were used to determine characteristic carbohydrate patterns by capillary gas chromatography. on the basis of the chemical derivatization of the carbohydrates seven characteristic peaks for peracetylated aldononitriles and nine characteristic peaks for peracetylated o-methyloximes were selected from the carbohydrate fingerprints of  the reference strains to prepare a dichotomous identification key. the classification of an unknown strain supposed to belong to the formerly called 'bacteroides fragilis group' is possible with this key. some of the advantages of the technique were that the identification of bacteroides fragilis-like strains requires only 4-5 h after primary isolation and that the bacteria can be exposed  to oxygen because viability of the organisms is not necessary. sophisticated anaerobic techniques can therefore be avoided for identification.

TI  == physiology and genetics of xylan degradation by gastrointestinal tract bacteria.
AB  == hemicelluloses or xylans are major components (35%) of plant materials. for ruminant animals, about 50% of the dietary xylans are degraded, but only small amounts of xylans are degraded in the lower gut of nonruminant animals and humans. in the rumen, the major xylanolytic species are butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and bacteroides ruminicola. in the human colon, bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides fragilis subspecies "a" are major xylanolytic bacteria. xylans are chemically complex, and their degradation requires multiple enzymes. expression of these enzymes by gut bacteria varies greatly among species. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens makes extracellular xylanases but bacteroides species have cell-bound xylanase activity. biochemical characterization of xylanolytic enzymes from gut bacteria has not been done. a xylosidase gene has been cloned from b. fibrosolvens 113. the data from dna hybridizations using a xylanase gene cloned from b. fibrisolvens 49 indicate this gene may be present in other b. fibrisolvens strains. a cloned xylanase from bact. ruminicola was transferred to  and highly expressed in bact. fragilis and bact. uniformis. arabinosidase and xylosidase genes from bact. ovatus have been cloned and both activities appear to be catalyzed by a single, bifunctional, novel enzyme. continued research in genetic and biochemical areas will provide knowledge and insights for manipulation of digestion at the gut level and improved understanding of colonic  fiber digestion.

TI  == beta-lactamase production, beta-lactam sensitivity and resistance to synergy with clavulanate of 737 bacteroides fragilis group organisms from thirty-three us centres.
AB  == beta-lactamase production and agar dilution sensitivities to amoxycillin, amoxycillin/clavulanate, ticarcillin, ticarcillin/clavulanate, cefoxitin, imipenem and metronidazole were determined for 737 bacteroides fragilis group strains isolated between 1986 and 1988 from 33 us centres. the strains comprised  441 b. fragilis, 114 b. thetaiotaomicron, 35 b. ovatus, 58 b. distasonis, 58 b. vulgatus, 26 b. uniformis and five b. caccae. overall, addition of clavulanate lowered the geometric mean mics of of amoxycillin from 46.7 to 0.6 mg/l, and of ticarcillin from 37.2 to 1.3 mg/l. addition of clavulanate increased the number of strains sensitive to amoxycillin from 9.5% to 90.0%, and to ticarcillin from 68.0% to 98.6%. however, synergy was not observed following addition of clavulanate to amoxycillin and ticarcillin for 48 strains (6.5%). these comprised 15 b. fragilis, two b. ovatus, 21 b. distasonis, six b. vulgatus and four b. uniformis strains. ten of the 15 non-synergic b. fragilis isolates had the features of b. fragilis homology group ii and were susceptible to amoxycillin alone; the other five strains were resistant to amoxycillin and ticarcillin. geometric mean mics (% susceptibility) of the non-synergic strains were as follows: amoxycillin, 6.2 mg/l (68.8); amoxycillin/clavulanate, 4.8 mg/l (72.9);  ticarcillin, 11.8 mg/l (75.0); ticarcillin/clavulanate, 9.4 mg/l (77.1). twenty-six strains (3.5% were resistant (greater than 32 mg/l) to cefoxitin, and  two strains (0.3%) were resistant (4 mg/l) to imipenem. all were susceptible to metronidazole. thus, on the basis of in-vitro activity, metronidazole, imipenem,  ticarcillin/clavulanate, cefoxitin and amoxycillin/clavulanate are indicated for  treatment of infections with b. fragilis strains. the clinical significance of the lack of synergy with clavulanate in the b. fragilis group is unclear; relatively low beta-lactam mics for most of these strains suggests that they may  be amenable to therapy with high doses of beta-lactams. results of this study indicate that it cannot be assumed that clavulanate will uniformly inhibit beta-lactamases in the b. fragilis group (especially b. distasonis) and indicate  the need for identification and susceptibility testing, especially in cases of serious infections with these strains.

TI  == plasmid transformation of bacteroides spp. by electroporation.
AB  == transformation of bacteroides spp. with a variety of plasmid dnas was accomplished using electroporation. the standard transformation assay system used to deduce the optimal electroporation parameters employed a 50-to 100-fold concentrated cell suspension of mid-logarithmic phase bacteroides fragilis strain 638 and the 5.4-kb clindamycin resistance (ccr) vector, pbi191. a variety of electroporation buffers were used successfully in transformation experiments but  of these, 1 mm mgcl2 in 10% glycerol was superior. the incorporation of mgcl2 was essential for optimum viability prior to electroporation and for optimum transformation. transformants were routinely obtained using 5-ms pulses over a range of field strengths from 5 to 12.5 kv/cm, with a maximum of greater than 10(6) micrograms-1 dna at 12.5 kv/cm. the number of transformants increased linearly with respect to dna concentration over the range 0.01-2 micrograms tested. recovery of transformants required an expression period of up to 2.5 h following exposure to the electric field. this period, however, was dependent on  the antibiotic resistance marker used for selection of transformants, with a significantly shorter incubation required when chloramphenicol rather than clindamycin was used in the selective medium. the effect of the dna source on transformation was tested using the shuttle vector pfd288. plasmid dna isolated from bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides ovatus, or bacteroides thetaiotaomicron transformed b. fragilis 638 at frequencies 7.5- to 12.5-fold less than those observed for controls with homologous dna. further reductions were seen with escherichia coli purified pfd288, which transformed at 1000-fold lower frequencies. finally, using homologous pfd288 or pbi191 isolated from strain 638, several strains of b. fragilis, b. uniformis, and b. ovatus were transformed successfully without modification of the standard assay system. two strains each  of b. thetaiotaomicron and bacteroides ruminicola were not transformed using the  methods described here.

TI  == pathogenicity of the bacteroides fragilis group.
AB  == the bacteroides fragilis group is one of the most important pathogens in polymicrobial infections. the distribution of the different members of the b. fragilis group in clinical infections varies. bacteroides fragilis accounts for 63 percent of all the group isolates, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron for 14 percent, bacteroides vulgatus and bacteroides ovatus for seven percent each, bacteroides distasonis for six percent and bacteroides uniformis for two percent. all members of the group induced bacteremia that was associated with an average mortality of 27 percent. the b. fragilis group resist beta lactam antibiotics by  producing the enzyme beta-lactamase. this enzyme can be detected in abscess fluid, and can interfere with the eradication of other bacteria that are susceptible to penicillins and cephalosporins. all members of the b. fragilis group can become encapsulated during an inflammatory process as was demonstrated  in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. non-encapsulated strains can become encapsulated with the assistance of their aerobic counterparts. these encapsulated strains are more virulent to the host than non-encapsulated strains. this increased virulence can be demonstrated by a higher rate of induction of bacteremia, and a greater enhancement of growth of other bacteria in mixed infection. antimicrobial therapy directed only at the eradication of the aerobic  bacteria did not prevent encapsulation, or reduce the number of bacteroides species. the virulence of all members of the b. fragilis group highlights the need to direct antimicrobial therapy against all members of this group.

TI  == annual incidence, epidemiology, and comparative in vitro susceptibilities to cefoxitin, cefotetan, cefmetazole, and ceftizoxime of recent community-acquired isolates of the bacteroides fragilis group.
AB  == the six species of the bacteroides fragilis group are potent pathogens and commonly have different susceptibility patterns. we determined the relative annual isolation rate of anaerobic bacteria and the susceptibility of b. fragilis group species isolated during 1987 at two community hospitals. the relative frequencies of isolation of 261 strains were as follows: b. fragilis, 61%; b. thetaiotaomicron, 17%; b. distasonis, 7%; b. vulgatus, 6%; b. ovatus, 5%; and b.  uniformis, 4%. a total of 234 recent clinical isolates were tested against cefmetazole, cefotetan, cefoxitin, ceftizoxime, clindamycin, imipenem, and piperacillin by a brucella agar dilution method. imipenem was the most active agent tested with all but three isolates (two b. vulgatus and one b. distasonis)  susceptible to less than 2 micrograms/ml. of the cephalosporins tested, cefoxitin, cefotetan, and cefmetazole were relatively equal against b. fragilis,  with 93 to 98% of strains susceptible to 32 micrograms/ml. ceftizoxime was less active, with an mic for 90% of strains tested of 128 micrograms/ml and only 75% of isolates susceptible to 32 micrograms/ml. against b. ovatus, b. vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, and b. uniformis, cefoxitin showed a two- to threefold-superior activity compared with that of cefotetan and cefmetazole. in general, ceftizoxime was much less active, except against b. distasonis, for which 78% of isolates were susceptible to 32 micrograms/ml compared with 68% for cefoxitin, 19% for cefmetazole, and 16% for cefotetan. clindamycin and piperacillin showed activity  similar to that of cefoxitin, except piperacillin was less active versus b. vulgatus and b. distasonis. we therefore suggest that clinical laboratories determine the species of b. fragilis group isolates as well as perform susceptibility studies on the isolates. clinicians should be aware that while b.  fragilis is the most frequent isolate, 38% of isolates are from other, more resistant b. fragilis group species.

AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to develop a serological procedure for rapid identification of the following five bacteroides species: bacteroides distasonis, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides uniformis, and  bacteroides vulgatus. the outer membrane fractions were assayed using sds-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoretic techniques. the species-specific protein band from each species as well as the group-specific protein were purified and used to develop an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect the species-specific and group-specific protein from the outer membrane of five reference species. the sensitivity and specificity of the procedure were evaluated by indirect elisa methodology using 506 clinical isolates of organisms  in this group, ten other species of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, and three species of aerobic gram-negative bacilli. each species evaluated yielded unique outer membrane protein patterns, suggesting the potential for development of a rapid, species-specific diagnostic procedure.

TI  == chromosomal dna probes for the identification of bacteroides species.
AB  == we compared 22 bacteroides species by dna-dna homology studies using the s1 endonuclease method. none of the currently defined species shared more than 30% dna homology with any other species examined with the exception of b. buccae and  b. capillus (which along with b. pentosaceus are now considered a single species), which shared 86% of their dna sequences. two clusters showed weak genetic relationships, with dna homology greater than 10%. the first cluster included b. coporis, b. disiens, b. bivius, b. intermedius and b. melaninogenicus. the second cluster included b. fragilis, b. eggerthii, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron and b. uniformis. five of the oral species, b. asaccharolyticus, b. gingivalis, b. loescheii, b. intermedius and b. melanogenicus, were chosen for study as whole chromosomal probes in dot blot assays. these were tested against 243 clinical strains biochemically identified as bacteroides species. the dna probes correctly identified 94% of the clinical strains. dna probe and biochemical identification was 100% for two of the five species. in contrast, only 86% of the strains biochemically identified as b. intermedius were identified by the dna probe. the dna probes gave a species identification to seven strains which could not be biochemically identified.

TI  == heparinase production by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the production of heparinase by a wide range of anaerobic bacteria isolated from  clinical specimens was investigated. none of the 29 strains of bacteroides fragilis produced heparinase. of 62 other bacteroides tested, only two of four strains of b ovatus, two of three strains of b thetaiotaomicron, and two of four  strains of b uniformis were heparinase producers. none of the 48 strains of fusobacteria or seven strains of veillonella produced heparinase. the anaerobic cocci (19 peptococci and seven peptostreptococci) were also negative for heparinase production as were 46 clostridium spp tested. it was concluded that heparinase production by anaerobic bacteria was unlikely to play a part in the regional thrombophlebitis that sometimes occurs in anaerobic infections.

TI  == regions in bacteroides plasmids pbftm10 and pb8-51 that allow escherichia coli-bacteroides shuttle vectors to be mobilized by incp plasmids and by a conjugative bacteroides tetracycline resistance element.
AB  == bacteroides-escherichia coli shuttle vectors containing a nonmobilizable pbr322 derivative and either pbftm10 (pdp1, pcg30) or pb8-51 (peg920) were mobilized by  incp plasmid r751 or prk231 (an ampicillin-sensitive derivative of rk2) between e. coli strains and from e. coli to bacteroides recipients. inci alpha r64 drd-ll transferred these vectors 1,000 times less efficiently than did the incp plasmids. pdp1, pcg30, and peg920 could be mobilized from b. uniformis donors to  both e. coli and bacteroides recipients by a conjugative bacteroides tcr (tcr erl) element which was originally found in a clinical bacteroides fragilis strain (b. fragilis erl). however, the shuttle vector pe5-2, which contains pb8-51 cloned in a restriction site that prevents its mobilization by incp or inci alpha plasmids, also was not mobilized at detectable frequencies from bacteroides donors by the tcr erl element. the mobilization frequencies of pcg30, pdp1, and peg920 by the tcr erl element in b. uniformis donors to e. coli recipients was about the same as those to isogenic b. uniformis recipients. transfer of the shuttle vectors from b. uniformis donors to e. coli occurred at the same frequencies when the matings were done aerobically or anaerobically. growth of the b. uniformis donors in tetracycline (1 microgram/ml) prior to conjugation increased the mobilization frequencies of the vectors to both e. coli and bacteroides recipients 50 to 100 times.

TI  == variations in the anaerobic faecal flora of ten healthy human volunteers with special reference to the bacteroides fragilis-group and clostridium difficile.
AB  == ninety nine stool specimens of ten healthy human volunteers were collected over a one year period, and processed anaerobically. the individual variations in intestinal colonization with bacteria of the bacteroides fragilis-group were detected, using the bacteroides bile esculin medium and an identification scheme  for bile-resistant bacteroides species. clostridium difficile agar supplemented with cycloserine/cefoxtin was used to detect the incidence of c. difficile in this group. the species of the b. fragilis-group most often detected were: b. vulgatus (in 31 samples from ten persons), b. uniformis (22/9), b. fragilis (19/7). c. difficile was never detected in this group. the mean total anaerobic cultural counts (log) of the ten volunteers varied between 9.94 and 10.91. this shows that interindividual variations in anaerobic cultural counts of about one log are common. in spite of these moderate interindividual variations, intraindividual variations in time of up to three log were detected. the mean bacteroides cultural counts showed a variation between 8.83 and 10.24. the mean dmccs of the ten volunteers were between 10.22 and 10.73. we conclude that at least a three to four log difference from the control samples will be required to establish a significant change in anaerobic cultural count due to antibiotic treatment.

TI  == comparative evaluation of the 2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole compounds dimetridazole,  metronidazole, secnidazole, ornidazole, tinidazole, carnidazole, and panidazole against bacteroides fragilis and other bacteria of the bacteroides fragilis group.
AB  == tube-dilution mics of seven 2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole compounds varying at the 1-substitution were determined against bacteroides fragilis. activities on a molar basis were ranked: tinidazole greater than panidazole greater than ornidazole greater than metronidazole greater than or equal to secnidazole greater than carnidazole greater than dimetridazole. geometric mean mics varied from 0.5 to 6.6 microm, and mics against individual strains varied up to 50-fold  between compounds. in general, the mic of each drug correlated with that of each  of the other drugs, but with tinidazole the correlation coefficients tended to be small and were not significant versus metronidazole and secnidazole. mics against 14 other bacteria of the b. fragilis group, including b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, and b. vulgatus, were within the range determined for b. fragilis.

TI  == transferable plasmid-linked chloramphenicol acetyltransferase conferring high-level resistance in bacteroides uniformis.
AB  == bacteroides uniformis ryc3373 resistant to 64 micrograms of chloramphenicol per ml was isolated from a peritoneal pelvic abscess of a patient not previously treated with this drug. chloramphenicol resistance was transferable at low frequency to a suitable bacteroides fragilis recipient. the acquisition of resistance was linked to the presence of a 39.5-kilobase plasmid (pryc3373), which was subsequently transferred to a secondary recipient. the transfer of cm resistance occurred by a conjugation-like process. donor and transconjugant strains produced chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constitutively. the km for chloramphenicol was 40 microm, and its inactivation by 5-5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) suggested its similarity to the type ii enterobacterial enzymes encoded by different conjugative plasmids and also to a previously described enzyme of b. fragilis f47 and f48. the specific activity and the resistance level in pryc3373-bearing strains were more than 10-fold higher than in the case of the enzyme from b. fragilis strains f47 and f48. the genetic  basis of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase synthesis in bacteroides spp. had not  been previously established.

TI  == evidence that the clindamycin-erythromycin resistance gene of bacteroides plasmid pbf4 is on a transposable element.
AB  == we constructed a shuttle vector, pe5-2, which can replicate in both bacteroides spp. and escherichia coli. pe5-2 contains a cryptic bacteroides plasmid (pb8-51), a 3.8-kilobase (kb) ecori-d fragment from the 41-kb bacteroides fragilis plasmid  pbf4, and rsf1010, an incq e. coli plasmid. pe5-2 was mobilized by r751, an incp  e. coli plasmid, between e. coli strains with a frequency of 5 x 10(-2) to 3.8 x  10(-1) transconjugants per recipient. r751 also mobilized pe5-2 from e. coli donors to bacteroides uniformis 0061rt and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 5482 with a frequency of 0.9 x 10(-6) to 2.5 x 10(-6). the bacteroides transconjugants contained only pe5-2 and were resistant to clindamycin and erythromycin. thus, the gene for clindamycin and erythromycin resistance must be located within the eco ri-d fragment of bf4. a second recombinant plasmid, pss-2, which contained 33 kb of pbf4 (including the ecori-d fragment and contiguous regions) could also be  mobilized by r751 between e. coli strains. in some transconjugants, a 5.5-kb (+/- 0.3 kb) segment of the pbf4 portion of pss2 was inserted into one of several sites on r751. in some other transconjugants this same 5.5-kb segment was integrated into the e. coli chromosome. this segment could transfer a second time onto r751. transfer was reca independent. the transferred segment included the entire ecori-d fragment, and thus the clindamycin-erythromycin resistance determinant, from pbf4.

TI  == dehydroxylation of cholic acid at c12 and epimerization at c5 and c7 by bacteroides species.
AB  == freshly isolated cultures (2060) of human intestinal bacteria of the predominant  flora, among them 1029 strains of saccharolytic bacteroides species, were tested  for cholic acid transformation. eight bacteroides strains reduced cholate to chenodeoxycholate, while 73 strains dehydroxylated at c7, producing deoxycholate. concurrent oxidation of hydroxyl groups, mainly at c7, was seen with many strains. no strain was able to dehydroxylate simultaneously at c7 and c12. one isolate, identified as a mixed culture of bacteroides fragilis and b. uniformis,  epimerized cholic acid at c5 and simultaneously epimerized, oxidized and dehydroxylated at c7. the following transformation products were identified: 3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-trihydroxy-5 alpha-cholanoic acid, 3 alpha,7 beta,12 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholanoic acid (ursocholic acid), 3 alpha,12 alpha-dihydroxy-7-keto-5 beta-cholanoic acid, 3 alpha,12 alpha-dihydroxy-5 alpha-cholanoic acid and a 3 alpha,12 alpha-dihydroxy-5 alpha-cholenoic acid. dehydroxylating and epimerizing abilities were detected when fresh isolates were  tested first for cholate transformation. they were no longer recognizable after some serial transfers. dehydroxylation at c12 of cholate could not be demonstrated with mixed fecal cultures. the possible intermediate, however, 3 alpha,7 alpha-dihydroxy-5 beta-chol-11-enoate, was abundantly hydrogenated by stool suspensions.

TI  == rapid glutamic acid decarboxylase test for identification of bacteroides and clostridium spp.
AB  == a rapid 4-h test for glutamic acid decarboxylase is described for the identification of certain anaerobic bacteria. the test substrate consisted of 1.0 g of l-glutamic acid, 0.3 ml of triton x-155, and 0.05 g of bromcresol green sodium salt in 1 liter of water. the substrate was dispensed in 0.5-ml amounts into test tubes, and a turbid suspension was made with the test organism. the test was then incubated aerobically at 35 degrees c for 4 h. the development of a blue color was considered positive. a total of 345 strains of clinically isolated anaerobic bacteria were tested. all isolates of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis. clostridium perfringens, and clostridium sordellii gave a positive reaction. some isolates of bacteroides distasonis and bacteroides vulgatus were also positive. the use of this rapid test in conjunction with other rapid methods, such as the spot indol test, will enable laboratory workers to report these pathogens on the same day on which an inoculum of pure culture growth on agar is available.

TI  == taxonomy of anaerobes: present state of the art.
AB  == results of nucleic acid studies, which indicate relationships among strains and species more clearly than do usual phenotypic tests, have led to new bacteriologic nomenclature. some major changes in bacteroides include the recognition of three species (bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides denticola, and bacteroides loescheii) formerly grouped in b. melaninogenicus subspecies melaninogenicus; two species (bacteroides intermedius with two closely related homology groups and bacteroides corporis) formerly grouped together as b. melaninogenicus subspecies intermedius; and two species (bacteroides buccae and bacteroides oris) formerly thought to be human isolates of bacteroides ruminicola subspecies brevis. former subspecies of bacteroides fragilis have been elevated to species rank; and bacteroides uniformis and an unnamed group ("3452a"), recognized. a new genus, capnocytophaga, with three species, is composed of strains formerly classified as bacteroides ochraceus or centers for disease control (cdc) group df-1. strains previously thought to be human isolates of "vibrio succinogenes" and related organisms that derive energy by reduction of fumarate or nitrate with formate or hydrogen have been reclassified in bacteroides (bacteroides gracilis), campylobacter (campylobacter concisus), or in a new genus, wolinella.

TI  == use of randomly cloned dna fragments for identification of bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.
AB  == randomly cloned fragments of dna from bacteroides thetaiotaomicron were used as hybridization probes for differentiation of b. thetaiotaomicron from closely related bacteroides species. hindiii digestion fragments of dna from b. thetaiotaomicron (type strain) were inserted into plasmid pbr322 and labeled with [alpha-32p]dctp by nick translation. these labeled plasmids were screened for hybridization to hindiii digests of chromosomal dna from type strains of the following human colonic bacteroides species: b. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus, reference strain 3452-a (formerly part of b. distasonis), bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides distasonis, bacteroides eggerthii, and reference strain b5-21 (formerly b. fragilis subsp. a). two of the five cloned fragments hybridized only to dna from b. thetaiotaomicron. each of these two fragments hybridized to the same dna restriction fragment in five strains of b. thetaiotaomicron other than the strain from which the dna was cloned. one of the cloned fragments (pbt2) was further tested for specificity by determining its ability to hybridize to dna from 65 additional strains of colonic bacteroides.

TI  == the beta-lactamases of genus bacteroides.
AB  == two hundred anaerobic isolates from clinical specimens were examined for beta-lactamase production by nitrocefin methodology. altogether, 77 strains were  beta-lactamase producers. organisms belonging to bacteroides melaninogenicus group, i.e., b. intermedius and b. bivius, were found to have a significant frequency of beta-lactamase production. substrate profile and sensitivity to the  beta-lactamase inhibitors, sulbactam, clavulanic acid, cloxacillin, and cefmetazole, a cephamycin derivative, were determined for these enzymes. all enzymes hydrolyzed cephalosporins more rapidly than penicillins. cefmetazole was  not hydrolyzed at all. strains of b. fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, b. ovatus and b. oralis produced beta-lactamases sensitive to all four inhibitors. strains of b. intermedius, b. bivius and b. disiens produced enzymes  of different nature which were inhibited only by cefmetazole. b. vulgatus enzyme  was inhibited by three of the four inhibitors. these results suggest that the beta-lactamases of the genus bacteroides may be classified by substrate profile and inhibitor pattern.

TI  == differences in susceptibilities of species of the bacteroides fragilis group to several beta-lactam antibiotics: indole production as an indicator of resistance.
AB  == clinical isolates of the members of the bacteroides fragilis group differ markedly in their susceptibilities to a variety of beta-lactam antibiotics, including cefoperazone, moxalactam, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, cefamandole, cephalothin, cefazolin, and carbenicillin, as determined by dilution techniques.  the minimum concentrations required to inhibit at least 50% of the strains tested (mic50) for the entire b. fragilis group were lowest with moxalactam and cefoxitin, 4 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively, whereas the mic90s of cefoperazone, cefotaxime, moxalactam, cefoxitin, and carbenicillin were equivalent (64 micrograms/ml); the mic90s of cefamandole, cephalothin, and cefazolin were higher. indole-positive members of the group (b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, and b. uniformis) were significantly more resistant to every antibiotic tested than were indole-negative members (b. fragilis, b. distasonis,  and b. vulgatus). in a 6-month survey of clinical laboratory data, indole-positive strains comprised 40% of the b. fragilis group isolates and 22% of all bacteroides isolates; b. fragilis was the most common species isolated (23%). the increased use of second-generation and the introduction of third-generation cephalosporins may dictate that clinical microbiology laboratories routinely identify members of the b. fragilis group as to species or, alternatively, test for indole production in addition to performing more extensive susceptibility testing.

TI  == the use of an anaerobic incubator for the isolation of anaerobes from clinical samples.
AB  == an anaerobic incubator was compared with a standard jar system for the isolation  of anaerobes from clinical material. seventy specimens were selected as likely to yield anaerobes: 342 different anaerobes were isolated in the incubator and 347 in anaebrobic jars. these included bacteroides spp (43%), peptococcus spp (26%),  peptostreptococcus spp (13%), veillonella spp (7%), fusobacterium spp (7%), clostridium spp (2%) and miscellaneous gram-positive nonsporing bacilli (2%). differences in isolation rates for each system were inconsistent and minor. sixteen anaerobes were chosen for quantitative tests at the beginning and end of  the study period. miles and misra counts showed a slight advantage of the incubator for f nucleatum, but no difference for b fragilis, b thetaiomicron, b uniformis, b bivius, b corrodens, f mortiferum, ps anaerobius, p prevotii or propionibacterium acnes. in almost all cases, colonies in anaerobic jars were slightly larger than those in the incubator. disc antibiotic sensitivity tests gave the same results in each system, at the beginning and end of the study period. the anaerobic incubator provides an effective means of isolation of anaerobes in a clinical laboratory. however, several design features of the prototype would require change if the system were introduced.

TI  == production of a fecal mutagen by bacteroides spp.
AB  == forty species of anaerobes were screened for the ability to produce an ether-extractable mutagen which is present in the feces of 15 to 20% of individuals in populations at high risk for colon cancer. this mutagen can be produced in vitro by incubating the feces of these individuals anaerobically or by supplementing anaerobic broths with methanol extracts of the feces and incubating them with a dilute fecal inoculum. of the anaerobes screened, strains  of five species of bacteroides (b. thetaiotaomicron, b. fragilis, b. ovatus, b. uniformis, and bacteroides group 3452a) were capable of producing five- to eightfold increases in the concentration of mutagen. for in vitro production in broth, all producers required bile and the methanol extract for feces from a person who excretes the mutagen. mutagen production appeared to be constitutive and occurred during the stationary phase of growth. cell-free extracts were active and produced mutagen considerably faster than did whole cells. our observations indicate that the excretion of this mutagen by certain people is dependent on the presence of some precursor of unknown origin. the mutagen-producing species of bacteria are among the most common of the intestinal microflora and were present in mutagen excreters and nonexcreters as well.

TI  == the role of bacteroides fragilis in the pathogenesis of acute appendicitis.
AB  == the predominant bacteria from 50 inflamed human appendices were isolated. anaerobic bacteria were isolated more frequently than aerobic bacteria ( 141 versus 96 isolates). e. coli was the most common aerobic genus (47 out of 50 patients). bacteria belonging to the b. fragilis groups (b. fragilis, b. ovatus,  b. distasonis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus and b. uniformis) were the most frequently isolated anaerobic microorganisms (87 of 141 strains), and b. fragilis predominated within this group (24 out of 87 strains). there were no significant  differences in the numbers and types of bacteria found in three patients groups (group a--19 phlegmonous; group b--19 gangrenous; and group c--12 perforative appendicitis cases). serological investigations of the humoral antibody responses (ifl) against the predominant bacteria in the three patient groups showed that a  doubling, or more, of the titer was observed in the following cases: against b. fragilis, 3 out of 8 patients (group a); 5 out of 7 patients (group b); and 7 out of 7 patients (group c). the corresponding figures for e. coli were 4 out of 18,  3 out of 17, and 5 out of 12 patients. only minor responses against the remaining aerobic and anaerobic isolates were measured. from the bacteriological and immunological results we conclude that (1) the b. fragilis group were the predominant bacteria in diseased appendices; (2) that significant antibody responses were only observed against b. fragilis; (3) that the response increased with the degree of organ destruction and the length of time elapsed from the onset of the symptoms; (4) that b. fragilis is likely to play an important role in the pathogenesis of acute appendicitis, provided that other predisposing factors, such as a deterioration of the blood circulation in the appendiceal wall, are present.

TI  == novel antibiotic resistance transfer in bacteroides.
AB  == resistance to tetracycline and lincosamide antibiotics was transferred en bloc from a strain of bacteroides fragilis (v503) to a plasmidless strain of bacteroides uniformis (v528) during in vitro filter matings. resistance transfer  was detected at frequencies of 10(-5) to 10(-6) drug-resistant progeny per input  donor cell and was dependent on cell-to-cell contact of donors and recipients. transfer was insensitive to dnase and was not mediated by chloroform- or filter-sterilized donor broth cultures. a determinant for resistance to cefoxitin in v503 was not transferred in this system. v503 contained a 3.7 x 10(6)-dalton plasmid (pva503). drug-resistant progeny of v503 x v528 matings usually contained pva503, but up to 20% of the total progeny of such crosses were plasmid free. filter blot dna hybridization studies (southern method) confirmed that pva503 was not integrated into the host chromosome of the plasmidless progeny. drug-resistant progeny from v503 x v528 matings (with or without pva503) conjugally transferred clindamycin resistance an tetracycline resistance to a suitable recipient strain. none of the drug resistance determinants of v503 were  affected by treatment with standard plasmid curing regimens, and methods designed to detect very large plasmid molecules failed to suggest the involvement of extrachromosomal dna in this resistance transfer system. the well-characterized bacteroides r plasmid, pbf4 (conferring clindamycin resistance), was found to share hybridizing sequences with bulk cellular v503 dna when examined by filter blot hybridization. similarly sized sequences were found in drug-resistant progeny recovered from matings. neither of the two pbf4 derivatives carrying deletions that abolished clindamycin resistance hybridized with v503 dna.

TI  == [in vitro effect of acylureido penicillins and mezlocillin on anaerobic sporeless gram-negative rods of genus bacteroides].
AB  == 313 anaerobic gram-negative rods of the bacteroides genus isolated from 295 clinical specimens were tested for their sensitivity to azlocillin and mezlocillin using the dilution method with agar plates. 25 mg/l of azlocillin inhibited 80.2% of the strains and the same concentration of mezlocillin inhibited 86.9%. the somewhat higher in vitro activity of mezlocillin is also seen by the lower mean minimal inhibitory concentration, which is approx. 23.6 mg/l for mezlocillin and 27.6 mg/l for azlocillin. the highest resistance for both drugs were found with b. distasonis (14 strains), followed by b. thetaiotaomicron (63 strains), b. fragilis (161 strains) and b. uniformis (7 strains). the good sensitivity of strains belonging to the b. melaninogenicus group corresponds to the well-known sensitivity of these micro-organisms to penicillins. on the basis of a "break point" of 25 mg/l, a decrease in the proportion of sensitive strains was found between 1974 and 1979. 50 mg/l, a concentration which can be maintained over a longer period of time if applied in  a suitable manner, will inhibit 97.4% (azlocillin) and 98.4% (mezlocillin) of the strains. thus in our opinion azlocillin and especially mezlocillin are suitable drugs for the initial therapy of pyogenous infections in which intestinal bacteroidaceae are of pathogenic significance.

TI  == neuraminidase production by bacteroidaceae.
AB  == the production of neuraminidase (ec 3.2.1.18) by 77 strains of bacteroidaceae was investigated by techniques previously used to study neuraminidase production by clostridia. conditions for culture and assay of bacteroides fragilis neuraminidase were characterised. the enzyme is predominantly cell associated; it is not calcium dependent and the ph optimum for its production is c. 4.5. most neuraminidase-positive bacteroides strains produced the enzyme well in the test media but a few strains failed to produce it consistently in one or other of the  media. because of these occasional variations, strains were grown and tested in at least two media before being defined as neuraminidase negative. within the b.  fragilis group of species, b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron and b. variabilis were neuraminidase positive while b. eggerthii, b. uniformis and b. splanchnicus were negative. two subspecies of b. melaninogenicus (ss. melaninogenicus and ss. levii) were positive but the other (ss. intermedius) was negative. strains of b. oralis and b. bivius produced the enzyme while b. ruminicola, b. disiens, b. asaccharolyticus and b. corrodens did  not. the microaerophilic b. ochraceus were also positive. none of the fusobacterium or leptotrichia species tested produced neuraminidase. our results  for neuraminidase production are consistent for all strains of each species examined and we suggest that tests for neuraminidase production would be a valuable addition to biochemical tests currently used in taxonomic studies of the bacteroidaceae.

AB  == beta-lactamases from five strains of bacteroides fragilis and two strains of bacteroides uniformis, all resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, were compared by means of isoelectric focusing and enzyme kinetic measurements. beta-lactamases from the five b. fragilis strains were identical, whereas those from the two b. uniformis strains were distinguished from each other and also from the b. fragilis enzymes. the two b. uniformis strains were relatively resistant to cefoxitin (minimal inhibitory concentration, 32 micrograms/ml), but only one of the strains, b. uniformis 2986, was found to rapidly inactivate cefoxitin. this apparently enzymatic inactivation of cefoxitin seemed to be of minor importance,  and the main factor for cefoxitin resistance was considered to be a decreased permeability of the drug. transfer of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics from  these beta-lactamase-producing strains of b. fragilis and b. uniformis to a non-beta-lactamase-producing strain of bacteroides distasonis was attempted, but  with these isolates no transfer of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was demonstrated.

AB  == quantitative studies were performed on fecal flora of three population groups consuming different diets. twenty rural black south africans and 22 japanese, representing groups at low risk for carcinoma of the colon, were compared with 41 north americans from a high-risk population. specimens taken immediately after defecation were mixed and processed under anaerobic conditions. after the initial incubation, roll tubes were shipped to the united states for final identification. bacterioides and bifidobacteria were present in lower numbers in  south african subjects, as were bacteroides uniformis (thought to be increased by conditions of fear and anger stress), compared with the other two groups. the number of b. vulgatus and b. distasonis and the "peptostreptococcus productus species complex," showed a positive correlation with the risk of colon cancer, while an inverse relationship was found with eubacterium aerofaciens ii, b. fragilis and escherichia coli. the percentage of fecal isolates stimulated by bile was slightly higher in populations with a high fat intake and a high risk of cancer of the colon.

TI  == encapsulated strains of bacteroides fragilis in clinical specimens.
AB  == studies were made of the presence of capsules in 294 strains of the bacteroides fragilis group of bacteria isolated from clinical infections and in 30 strains from the fecal flora using the indian ink and ruthenium red staining methods. a total of 77% of the b. fragilis strains were encapsulated; higher figures were observed in isolates from blood and wound infections. of the b. ovatus, b. distasonis, b. vulgatus, b. uniformis, and b. thetaiotaomicron isolates from clinical infections, 17% were encapsulated. the percentage of encapsulated bacteroides strains isolated from feces was approximately the same as in the strains isolated from clinical infections.

TI  == acute appendicitis and bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == bacteria belonging to the bacteroides fragilis group (b. fragilis, b. ovatus, b.  vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. thetaiotaomicron and b. uniformis) were cultured in quantities of less than or equal to 10(5) c.f.u./ml from the excised appendix from 30 patients. twenty-two patients (group i) had an acute purulent appendicitis (three with perforation), four were classified as slightly inflamed  cases (group 2) and four had a normal appendix (group 3). the b. fragilis group of bacteria dominated among the anaerobic isolates, but bifidobacteria, fusobacteri, clostridium perfringens, lactobacilli, leptotrichia and veillonella, in decreasing order, were isolated as well. among isolates of aerobic bacteria, e. coli was most frequently isolated (26/30 patients). no other genus was isolated from more than four of the appendices. serological investigations of the humoral antibody response to polysaccharide antigens from four of the bacteroides species showed that a doubling of the titer, or more, in paired serum samples could be observed as follows: against b. fragilis 6/22 patients (group 1), 3/8 patients (groups 2 and 3). the corresponding figures for b. ovatus were 11/22 and 2/8, b. vulgatus 3/22 and 0/8 and b. distasonis 4/22 and 0/8. sera from two patients with ruptured appendix, and b. fragilis cultivated, showed the highest titer increases against the b. fragilis antigen. the data from the bacteriological and immunological investigations make us conclude that (i) the b. fragilis group of bacteria is the most common anaerobic group of bacteria isolated from normal and diseased appendices, (ii) the mere isolation of b. fragilis, encapsulated or not, does not imply an etiological role in appendicitis since there was no obvious difference in titer increases against b. fragilis in sera from patients with or without an inflamed appendix, and (iii) high, and significant, titer increases against b. fragilis are seen in sera from patients with ruptured appendix.

TI  == identification of bacteroides fragilis by indirect immunofluorescence.
AB  == rabbit antiserum against live or heat-killed bacteroides fragilis nctc 9343 bacteria was titrated against hot phenol water-extracted polysaccharide antigens  from five different species of the 'b. fragilis group' of bacteria using an enzyme immunoassay and shown to be specific for the b. fragilis nctc 9343 polysaccharide. when the antiserum was used in indirect immunofluorescence, 97.1% of 244 b. fragilis strains were correctly identified. only 8 of the other 312 bacteroides strains were stained by the anti-b fragilis serum. the 'cross-reactive' bacteriodes strains all belonged to the "b. fragilis group" of bacteria (i.e., b; distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, and  b. vulgatus). none of the 425 aerobic enteric bacteria representing salmonella, e. coli, proteus, yersinia, shigella, klebsiella, enterobacter, citrobacter, and  pseudomonas were positive using the anti-b. fragilis serum. likewise, all the 59  gram-positive strains representing streptococcus, bacillus, peptostreptococcus, peptococcus, propionibacterium, lactobacillus, eubacterium, and clostridium did not stain. our data shows in accordance with other findings [11], that b. fragilis strains possess a species-specific cell envelope antigen(s) which promises to be important for production of antisera, making a rapid identification of the species possible.

TI  == factors affecting production of catalase by bacteroides.
AB  == several variables affected the production of catalase by members of the "bacteroides fragilis group" of anaerobic bacteria. both media yielded higher catalase levels than the respective agar media. addition of hemin to media after  autoclave sterilization, rather than before, significantly increased production of catalase. both of these variables could be related to the available hemin concentration present in the medium being tested. significantly higher amounts of hemin were required for catalase production than were required for growth. for catalase production by b. fragilis atcc 25285, 1 microgram of hemin per ml was required. of the various media tested, the use of chopped meat broth resulted in  the highest levels of catalase production (up to 50 to 60 u of catalase per mg of protein). of the various species and dna homology groups tested, strains of b. fragilis and bacteroides distasonis were catalase positive. strains of bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus, and bacteroides eggerthi possessed variable catalase activity. bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides uniformis, and dna homology groups "3452a" and "subsp. a" were catalase negative. a catalase well test, in which equal volumes of 3% h2o2 and chopped meat culture  are mixed, is described and recommended for routine catalase tests.
