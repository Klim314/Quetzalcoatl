TI  - Development and pyrosequencing analysis of an in-vitro oral biofilm model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dental caries and periodontal disease are the commonest bacterial diseases of man and can result in tooth loss. The principal method of prevention is the mechanical removal of dental plaque augmented by active agents incorporated into toothpastes and mouthrinses. In-vitro assays that include complex oral bacterial biofilms are required to accurately predict the efficacy of novel active agents in vivo. The aim of this study was to develop an oral biofilm model using the Calgary biofilm device (CBD) seeded with a natural saliva inoculum and analysed by next generation sequencing. The specific objectives were to determine the reproducibility and stability of the model by comparing the composition of the biofilms over time derived from (i) the same volunteers at different time points, and (ii) different panels of volunteers. RESULTS: Pyrosequencing yielded 280,093 sequences with a mean length of 432 bases after filtering. A mean of 320 and 250 OTUs were detected in pooled saliva and biofilm samples, respectively. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) plots based on community membership and structure showed that replicate biofilm samples were highly similar and clustered together. In addition, there were no significant differences between biofilms derived from the same panel at different times using analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). There were significant differences between biofilms from different panels (AMOVA, P < 0.002). PCoA revealed that there was a shift in biofilm composition between seven and 14 days (AMOVA, P < 0.001). Veillonella parvula, Veillonella atypica/dispar/parvula and Peptostreptococcus stomatis were the predominant OTUs detected in seven-day biofilms, whilst Prevotella oralis, V. parvula and Streptococcus constellatus were predominant in 14-day biofilms. CONCLUSIONS: Diverse oral biofilms were successfully grown and maintained using the CBD. Biofilms derived from the same panel of volunteers were highly reproducible. This model could be used to screen both antimicrobial-containing oral care products and also novel approaches aiming to modify plaque composition, such as pre- or probiotics.
TI  - The predominant bacteria isolated from radicular cysts.
AB  - PURPOSE: To detect predominant bacteria associated with radicular cysts and discuss in light of the literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical materials were obtained from 35 radicular cysts by aspiration. Cultures were made from clinical materials by modern laboratory techniques, they underwent microbiologic analysis. RESULTS: The following are microorganisms isolated from cultures: Streptococcus milleri Group (SMG) (23.8%) [Streptococcus constellatus (19.1%) and Streptococcus anginosus (4.7%)], Streptococcus sanguis (14.3%), Streptococcus mitis (4.7%), Streptococcus cremoris (4.7%), Peptostreptococcus pevotii (4.7%), Prevotella buccae (4.7%), Prevotella intermedia (4.7%), Actinomyces meyeri (4.7%), Actinomyces viscosus (4.7%), Propionibacterium propionicum (4.7%), Bacteroides capillosus (4.7%), Staphylococcus hominis (4.7%), Rothia denticariosa (4.7%), Gemella haemolysans (4.7%), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (4.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study demonstrated that radicular cysts show a great variety of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial flora. It was observed that all isolated microorganisms were the types commonly found in oral flora. Although no specific microorganism was found, Streptococcus spp. bacteria (47.5%) - especially SMG (23.8%) - were predominantly found in the microorganisms isolated. Furthermore, radicular cysts might be polymicrobial originated. Although radicular cyst is an inflammatory cyst, some radicular cyst fluids might be sterile.
TI  - Anaerobic oral flora in the North American black bear (Ursus americanus) in eastern North Carolina.
AB  - Microbial flora can provide insight into the ecology and natural history of wildlife in addition to improving understanding of health risks. This study examines the anaerobic oral flora of hunter killed black bears (Ursus americanus) in eastern North Carolina. Oral swabs from the buccal and lingual supragingival tooth surfaces of the first and second mandibular and maxillary molars of 22 black bears were inoculated onto Brucella Blood Agar plates supplemented with hemin and vitamin K after transport from the field using reduced oxoid nutrient broth. Sixteen anaerobic bacterial species, representing nine genera were identified using the RapID ANA II Micromethod Kit system and a number of organisms grown that could not be identified with the system. The most frequently identified anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Streptococcus constellatus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. The diversity in the anaerobic oral flora of black bear in eastern North Carolina suggests the importance of including these organisms in basic health risk assessment protocols and suggests a potential tool for assessment of bear/habitat interactions.
TI  - Impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (RP) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [GR]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM) analysis. METHODS: Individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or >3 sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GR (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after treatment. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM analysis. Significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: The majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. Species that increased or persisted in high frequency in RP but were significantly reduced in GR included Bacteroidetes sp., Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Tannerella forsythia, Dialister spp., Selenomonas spp., Catonella morbi, Eubacterium spp., Filifactor alocis, Parvimonas micra, Peptostreptococcus sp. OT113, Fusobacterium sp. OT203, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Streptococcus intermedius or Streptococcus constellatus, and Shuttlesworthia satelles. In contrast, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Gemella haemolysans, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Kingella oralis, Lautropia mirabilis, Neisseria elongata, Rothia dentocariosa, Streptococcus australis, and Veillonella spp. were more associated with therapeutic success. CONCLUSION: Persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.
TI  - Sudden onset proptosis secondary to cavernous sinus thrombosis from underlying mandibular dental infection.
AB  - The present report concerns a patient who presented with a 4-day history of left-sided facial pain arising from a pre-existing dental infection and progressive shortness of breath. The patient had a previous diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and was being treated with methotrexate. The rapid development of a right eye proptosis necessitated urgent decompression with a lateral canthotomy and cantholysis. Imaging revealed a left facial abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST), bilateral internal jugular thrombosis and multiple lung abscesses. Blood cultures yielded Streptococcus constellatus, a member of the Peptostreptococcus family. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure and septic shock. She was treated with intravenous meropenem and clindamycin, and anticoagulated. Despite early intervention, the patient developed a middle cerebral artery infarct. Over a 3-week period she was gradually weaned from vasopressor and ventilatory support.
TI  - Campylobacter species isolated from extra-oro-intestinal abscesses: a report of four cases and literature review.
AB  - Campylobacter species are frequently isolated from fecal specimens of patients with diarrheal illness. Several Campylobacter species are commonly isolated from the oral cavity. In contrast, Campylobacter species are rarely isolated from extra-oro-intestinal abscesses. Reported here are four cases of extra-oro-intestinal abscesses due to polymicrobial flora, including Campylobacter species. The first case is a 35-year-old woman who was diagnosed with a brain abscess caused by C. gracilis, Streptococcus constellatus, and anaerobic Gram-positive cocci. The second case is a 65-year-old man with a history of maxillary sinus carcinoma who developed a brain abscess due to polymicrobial flora, including C. concisus. The third case is a 24-year-old male who was diagnosed with a vertebral abscess caused by C. rectus, Eubacterium brachy, and Actinomyces species. The fourth case is a 74-year-old woman who presented with an intraorbital abscess due to C. showae and Micromonas (previously Peptostreptococcus) micros. The first two patients died from a cause directly related to their abscesses. All Campylobacter species involved in the four cases were isolated anaerobically. The isolation of oral Campylobacter species, e.g., C. rectus and C. showae, from abscesses suggests an oral source. A survey of the English literature was undertaken to identify reports of Campylobacter species isolated from extra-oro-intestinal abscesses.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological changes associated with the use of combined antimicrobial therapies to treat "refractory" periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present investigation examined clinical and microbial changes after a combined aggressive antimicrobial therapy in subjects identified as "refractory" to conventional periodontal therapy. METHOD: Fourteen subjects were identified as "refractory" based on full-mouth mean attachment loss and/or >3 sites with attachment loss > or =3 mm following scaling and root planing (SRP), periodontal surgery and systemic antibiotics. After baseline monitoring, subjects received SRP, locally delivered tetracycline at pockets > or =4 mm, systemically administered amoxicillin (500 mg, t.i.d. for 14 days)+metronidazole (250 mg, t.i.d. for 14 days) and professional removal of supragingival plaque weekly for 3 months. Subjects were monitored clinically every 3 months post-therapy for 2 years. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at the same time points from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Mean levels of each species were averaged within a subject at each visit. Significance of changes in clinical and microbiological parameters over time were evaluated using the Friedman or Wilcoxon signed ranks test. RESULTS: On average, subjects showed significant improvements in all clinical parameters after therapy. Mean (+/-SEM) full-mouth pocket depth reduction was 0.83+/-0.13 mm and mean attachment level "gain" was 0.44+/-0.12 at 24 months. Clinical improvement was accompanied by major reductions in multiple subgingival species during the first 3 months of active therapy that were maintained for most species to the last monitoring visit. Reductions occurred for three Actinomyces species, "orange complex" species including Campylobacter showae, Eubacterium nodatum, three Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella intermedia as well as the "Streptococcus milleri" group, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus intermedus. Subjects differed in their response to therapy; six modest response subjects exhibited less attachment level gain and were characterized by reductions in the microbiota from baseline to 3 months, but re-growth of many species thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: The combined antibacterial therapy was successful in controlling disease progression in 14 "refractory" periodontitis subjects for 2 years.
TI  - Deep neck infection: a present-day complication. A retrospective review of 83 cases (1998-2001).
AB  - Deep neck infections are less and less frequent today than in the past. Nevertheless, their complications are often life-threatening. The present study reviews the experience of the Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery of Padua with deep neck infections during the period from 1998 to 2001. Eighty-three patients (55 males and 28 females) were retrospectively considered. The site of origin of deep neck infection was identified in 76 patients (91%). The most common cause was dental infection, occurring in 35 cases (42%). In 12 cases (14%) deep neck infection was a complication of oropharyngeal infection. The relatively high incidence of Peptostreptococcus sp, Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus intermedius and constellatus isolation was consistent with the high rate of odontogenic cases. Surgery was advocated as the treatment for any infection of the deep neck spaces. The recent series has demonstrated that medical treatment did not seem to increase complication rates or mortality. Our tailored approach (medical or medical and surgical) based on clinical and radiological evidence was successful in 97% of the patients.
TI  - Bacteriology and antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive cocci isolated from pus specimens of orofacial odontogenic infections.
AB  - We recently reported the beta-lactamase production and antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic gram-negative rods isolated from pus specimens of 93 orofacial odontogenic infections. In this report, we determine the bacteriology and antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria other than anaerobic gram-negative rods, mainly gram-positive cocci, isolated from the same specimens. Streptococcus constellatus and Peptostreptococcus micros were frequent isolates from all types of infection examined. Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Corynebacterium species, and Eubacterium species were recovered only from dentoalveolar infections, while Gemella morbillorum was found more frequently in periodontitis than in the other infections. beta-Lactamase-positive strains were detected only in staphylococci. Ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefazolin, cefotaxime, imipenem, erythromycin, clindamycin and levofloxacin showed high susceptibility rates (> or = 77%) against viridans streptococci, Peptostreptococcus and Gemella. Minocycline showed a high MIC90 value against viridans streptococci (32 microg/ml), and metronidazole was effective against Peptostreptococcus and Gemella. These results provide useful information for the treatment of orofacial odontogenic infections.
TI  - Efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (II). Effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (Crest Complete) or power (Braun 3D Plaque Remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. METHODS: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. At baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. After random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. Clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. Significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the Quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. Streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while Streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. Mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. Major reductions occurred in both groups for A. naeslundii, A. israelii/gerencseriae, Peptostreptococcus micros, Veillonella parvula, Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, S. mitis/oralis/sanguis and S. constellatus/intermedius. All taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. The reductions in prevalence were greater for A. naeslundii, S. constellatus/intermedius, V. parvula, A. israelii/gerencseriae, S. mitis/oralis/sanguis, P. micros, Streptococcus mutans and P. intermedia/nigrescens. Mean prevalence was decreased more for Porphyromonas gingivalis, Campylobacter rectus/showae, Treponema denticola and Bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. CONCLUSIONS: The major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the subgingival microbiota. Counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. This reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. Further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.
TI  - A microbiological study of Papillon-Lefevre syndrome in two patients.
AB  - AIM: To analyse the microflora of subgingival plaque from patients with Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS), which is a very rare disease characterised by palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis with precocious periodontal destruction. METHODS: Bacterial isolates were identified using a combination of commercial identification kits, traditional laboratory tests, and gas liquid chromatography. Some isolates were also subjected to partial 16S rDNA sequencing. Plaque samples were also assayed for the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: The culture results showed that most isolates were capnophilic and facultatively anaerobic species-mainly Capnocytophaga spp and Streptococcus spp. The latter included S. constellatus, S. oralis, and S. sanguis. Other facultative bacteria belonged to the genera gemella, kingella, leuconostoc, and stomatococcus. The aerobic bacteria isolated were species of neisseria and bacillus. Anaerobic species included Prevotella intermedia, P. melaninogenica, and P. nigrescens, as well as Peptostreptococcus spp. ELISA detected P gingivalis in one patient in all sites sampled, whereas A. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only one site from the other patient. Prevotella intermedia was present in low numbers. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PLS have a very complex subgingival flora including recognised periodontal pathogens. However, no particular periodontopathogen is invariably associated with PLS.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  - A diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. To investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. Forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. Streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), Streptococcus mitis (66-65%), Prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), Eikenella corrodens (51-52%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), Capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), Actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and Prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. Several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella loescheii, Campylobacter gracilis, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter concisus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. The bacterial species Streptococcus constellatus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, E. corrodens and Fusobacterium nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas Streptococcus intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were associated with bleeding.
TI  - Microbiological parameters associated with IL-1 gene polymorphisms in periodontitis patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND, AIMS: Polymorphisms in the cluster of IL-1 genes have been significantly associated with the severity of adult periodontitis. The purpose of this study was to compare microbiological parameters in IL-1 genotype negative and positive adult subjects with a range of periodontitis severities. METHOD: The study included 108 subjects in good general health. Clinical parameters were recorded at 6 sites/tooth excluding 3rd molars and included: plaque accumulation, gingival erythema, bleeding on probing, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level. Subgingival plaque samples were collected from the mesiobuccal surface of up to 28 teeth in each subject (mean 25.3) providing a total of 2736 samples. The levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in each sample using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Fingerstick blood samples were collected for IL-1A (+4845) and IL-1B (+3954) genotyping using PCR-based methods. RESULTS: The proportion of IL-1 genotype positive subjects that exhibited mean counts of specific subgingival species above selected thresholds was significantly higher than the proportion of genotype negative subjects. Prominent among species that were detected at higher levels in genotype positive subjects were members of the "red" and "orange" complexes and included: Bacteroides forsythus, Treponema denticola, the Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, Fusobacterium periodonticum, Campylobacter gracilis, Campylobacter showae and Streptococcus constellatus. Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus gordonii and 3 Capnocytophaga species were also detected more frequently at high numbers in genotype positive subjects. Significantly higher mean counts of B. forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, T. denticola, the F. nucleatum subspecies, F. periodonticum, Campylobacter rectus, C. showae, Eubacterium nodatum, S. constellatus, S. gordonii, and S. intermedius were detected at periodontal pockets >6 mm in subjects who were genotype positive when compared with genotype negative subjects. The increase was due to increased numbers of cells of these species rather than a major shift in proportion. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that genotype positive subjects more frequently had higher levels of "red" and "orange" complex species that are known to be strongly associated with measures of periodontal inflammation.
TI  - Characterization of bacterial orofacial infections using a new murine model.
AB  - We devised a new murine orofacial infection model using bacteria from odontogenic infection origins and characterized the experimental infections. In this model, bacteria were injected into the submandible of mice. Streptococcus constellatus and Peptostreptococcus micros produced a single abscess at the injection site and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were low: the median abscess-forming dose (AF(50)) of S. constellatus and P. micros were 10(8.5-10.7)and 10(10.2-10.6)cfu/mouse, and their median lethal dose (LD(50)) were >11 and 10(10.6-11)cfu/mouse, respectively. Prevotella oralis and Fusobacterium nucleatum produced multiple abscesses and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were strong: AF(50)of P. oralis and F. nucleatum were 10(6.0-6.4)and 10(7. 0-8.7)cfu/mouse, and their LD(50)were 10(7.0-7.7)and 10(8.3-9. 9)cfu/mouse, respectively. LD(50)of P. intermedia and P. gingivalis were 10(9.4->11)and 10(8.9-9.1)cfu/mouse, respectively. Prevotella intermedia and Porphyromonas gingivalis generated a necrotizing lesion, which progressed rapidly. We conclude that this murine model could reflect human orofacial odontogenic infections and is useful to investigate the pathogenicity of causative bacteria of such infections.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  - Eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. The aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. Forty-one different microbial species were isolated. Gemella morbillorum and Peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while P. micros, Streptococcus intermedius, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella loeschei, P. melaninogenica and Selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. The bacterial species S. constellatus, G. morbillorum and P. magnus were isolated in greater numbers in incisors and P. micros, S. intermedius, Campylobacter concisus, Bacteroides egertheii, B. forsythus, P. oralis and S. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. Cluster I was predominated by S. constellatus, S. mitis, S. sanguis, G. morbillorum, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; cluster II was predominated by S. sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea and P. intermedia; cluster III was predominated by S. mitis, C. ochracea, F. nucleatum, P. loeschei, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; and finally cluster IV was predominated by S. sanguis, C. gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Campylobacter gracilis, F. nucleatum and P. intermedia. The bacterial species S. constellatus, P. micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Eikenella corrodens and F. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while S. intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.
TI  - Isolation of bacteria from cervical lymph nodes in patients with oral cancer.
AB  - Thirty patients with oral mucosal cancer were studied in relation to oral mucosal damage and bacterial translocation to the regional lymph nodes in the neck. All 30 patients (gingiva 11, tongue 13, cheek mucosa four, oral floor two) underwent extensive, clean-contaminated, head-and-neck surgery (including neck dissection) with free flap reconstruction. A total of 153 lymph nodes was harvested for microbial and histological examination. Viable bacteria were isolated from 70 lymph nodes (45.8%) from 25 patients (83.3%). Bacterial cells in the nodes were detected by scanning electron microscopy. Bacterial translocation was found more often in metastatic nodes (75.0%) than in uninvolved nodes (40.3%) (p = 0.015; chi2 test). Gingival carcinoma yielded 56.4% of bacterial growth in the regional lymph nodes compared to tongue (40.3%), oral floor (40.0%) and cheek mucosa (37.5%). As the gingival carcinoma group includes more T4 cases (11/11; 100%) than the other three groups (7/19; 36.8%), bacterial translocation in uninvolved nodes could be caused by the size and invasion of the primary oral tumor. Oral streptococci (Streptococcus intermedius, Strep. constellatus, Strep. oralis, Strep. mitis, Strep. sanguis, Strep. salivarius) were the most common isolates. Aerobic enteric bacteria (Enterococcus, Escherichia, Klebsiella etc.) were also found in the lymph nodes. Among the anaerobic bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from 12 patients. Damaged oral mucosa in patients with oral cancer might allow the new bacterial colonization on the surface and subsequently drain the bacteria into the regional lymph nodes as well as the general circulation.
TI  - Microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  - It has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. The purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. The presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. Similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. Community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. One complex consisted of the tightly related group: Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola. The 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the Fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Peptostreptococcus micros. Species associated with this group included: Eubacterium nodatum, Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter showae, Streptococcus constellatus and Campylobacter gracilis. The 3rd complex consisted of Streptococcus sanguis, S. oralis, S. mitis, S. gordonii and S. intermedius. The 4th complex was comprised of 3 Capnocytophaga species, Campylobacter concisus, Eikenella corrodens and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. The 5th complex consisted of Veillonella parvula and Actinomyces odontolyticus. A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, Selenomonas noxia and Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (A. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. The 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of cefmenoxime against recent fresh clinical isolates from patients in sinusitis].
AB  - In order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (CMX), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CMX and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates from patients of sinusitis that were obtained in our laboratory from October of 1993 to March of 1994. The results are summarized as follows; 1. CMX showed strong antimicrobial activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis that were 3 major aerobic bacteria from sinusitis. Antimicrobial activities of CMX against benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP) and PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) were stronger than those of ampicillin (ABPC), and these strong activities suggested that CMX might have strong antimicrobial activities against beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae and M. (B.) catarrhalis. 2. Antimicrobial activities of CMX against microaerophiles, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus intermedius and Gemella morbillorum and against Peptostreptococcus spp., from chronic sinusitis and odontogenic maxillary sinusitis, were stronger than those of most of the control drugs. 3. The MIC90's of CMX against isolates from patients of sinusitis were < or = 0.025-0.39 micrograms/ml. These values were lower than transitional concentrations in mucous membrane of maxillary sinus obtained when "1% CMX nasal solution" was used with nebulizer. It appears likely that sufficient concentrations exceeding MICs against main organisms would be obtained by nebulizer treatment using CMX nasal solution.
TI  - Recent taxonomic changes for anaerobic gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms.
AB  - The strains formerly classified as Streptococcus anginosus or "Streptococcus milleri" have now been recognized as three distinct species, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus intermedius. Streptococcus morbillorum has been transferred into the genus Gemella. Four new species within the genus Peptostreptococcus were recently named. A recent addition to the genus Clostridium is Clostridium argentinense, which includes Clostridium botulinum type G. Two new species of Actinomyces have been introduced: Actinomyces georgiae and Actinomyces gerencseriae. Arachnia propionica was shown to be related to propionibacteria and has been renamed Propionibacterium propionicum. Eubacterium yurii was named to contain "test-tube brush" bacteria found in subgingival plaque. Lactobacillus uli and Lactobacillus rimae are obligately anaerobic lactobacilli found in periodontal pockets. Bilophila is a new genus of gram-negative bacilli. Wolinella recta and Wolinella curva are now included in the genus Campylobacter. The taxonomic position of Mobiluncus, currently assigned to the family Bacteroidaceae, remains uncertain.
TI  - Immunobiological activities of bacteria isolated from the root canals of postendodontic teeth with persistent periapical lesions.
AB  - Although intraradicular bacteria are widely considered to be the primary etiological agents of periapical lesions, the immunobiological properties of the species in question are not adequately known. The aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the pathobiological properties of the 10 most frequently isolated endodontopathic bacterial species. Using cellular components of the pathogens obtained by sonic extraction, we have investigated their ability to induce monocyte migration, interleukin 1 production, mitogenic responses of lymphocytes, and the polyclonal activation of B lymphocytes. It was found that all of the tested species enhanced the migration of monocytes and induced mitogenesis in B lymphocytes. The polyclonal activation of B cells and the induction of interleukin 1 by monocytes were found to be stronger in Gram-negative anaerobes. Furthermore, all of the tested species excluding Bacteroides oralis were poor T cell mitogens. These findings show that a wide range of pathobiological properties are attributable to the most frequently isolated endodontic pathogens. It thus seems plausible that a battery of complex immunological responses induced by such microbes lead to the formation of persistent periapical lesions.
TI  - Pathogenicity of anaerobic gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The pathogenicity of 20 strains of facultative or anaerobic gram-positive cocci (AGPC) was investigated by injecting them alone or mixed with other flora into mice, utilizing the subcutaneous abscess model. Abscesses induced by a mixture of two organisms were uniformly larger than those induced by single organisms. The relationships among seven AGPC strains, eight aerobes, and two Bacteroides spp. were determined by treating the infected animals with antibiotics and observing the effect of therapy directed against one or both organisms present in the abscess. A total of 70 different combinations were tested. As judged by their responses to antimicrobial therapy, facultative cocci or AGPC were relatively more important than the other species in 6 combinations, equally important in 35 combinations, and less important in 29 combinations. The AGPC most often found to be equal to or more important than the other bacteria were Peptococcus magnus, Streptococcus constellatus, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus were frequently found to be of more importance than the AGPC.
