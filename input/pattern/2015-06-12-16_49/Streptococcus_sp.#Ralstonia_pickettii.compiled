TI  - Molecular investigation of bacterial communities on intravascular catheters: no longer just Staphylococcus.
AB  - Intravascular catheter-related bloodstream infections (IVC-BSIs) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Culture-independent molecular approaches can reveal and capture the composition of complex microbial communities, and are now being used to reveal "new" pathogens as well as the polymicrobial nature of some infections. Patients with concurrently sited arterial and central venous catheters who had clinically suspected IVC-BSIs, were examined by the high-throughput sequencing of microbial 16S rRNA. An average of 100 operational taxonomic units (OTUs, phylotypes) was observed on each IVC, indicating that IVCs were colonised by complex and diverse bacterial communities. Ralstonia (53 % of 16S rRNA sequences), Escherichia group (16 %), Propionibacterium (5 %), Staphylococcus (5 %), and Streptococcus (2 %) were the most abundant genera. There was no statistically significant difference in the bacterial communities examined from arterial and central venous catheters; from those with and without systemic antibiotic treatment; or from conventionally colonised and uncolonised IVCs. The genome of the predominant bacteria, R. pickettii AU12-08, was found to encode resistance to antimicrobial drugs of different classes. In addition, many encoded gene products are involved in quorum sensing and biofilm formation that would further contribute to increased antimicrobial drug resistance. Our results highlight the complex diversity of microbial ecosystems on vascular devices. High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA offers an insight into the pathogenesis of IVC-related infections, and opens up the scope for improving diagnosis and patient management.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of water in dental unit reservoirs.
AB  - The aim of this study was bacteriological assessment of water in dental unit reservoirs--concentration and composition of the aerobe and facultative anaerobe bacterial microflora. Reservoir water samples were taken from 25 units. Bacterial flora were determined with the plate culture method. Bacteria were identified with biochemical microtests: API 20E, API 20NE (bioMerieux, France) and GP2 MicroPlateTM (BIOLOG, USA). The concentration of total bacteria isolated from one site was 201,039 cfu/ml, on average; the minimum was 22,300 cfu/ml, and the maximum - 583,000 cfu/ml. The following bacteria were identified: Gram-negative bacteria--Brevundimonas vesicularis, Moraxella lacunata, Moraxella spp., Ralstonia pickettii, Sphingomonas paucimobilis, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; Gram-positive cocci--Micrococcus luteus, Micrococcus lylae, Staphylococcus cohnii, Staphylococcus hominis ss novobiosepticus, Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp.; actinomycetes--Streptomyces albus. The prevailing bacteria were: Ralstonia pickettii (96.46%), found in all the units. Sphingomonas paucimobilis (1.32%) and Brevundimonas vesicularis (1.07%) were the next most frequently occurring bacteria. Bacteria concentration in dental unit reservoirs reached excessive values, and the bacterial flora were composed of the bacteria characteristic for water supply systems, opportunistic pathogens, and bacteria of the oral cavity flora. Continuous microbiological monitoring of the DUWL water, including application of a disinfecting procedure, is necessary.
TI  - Bacterial decontamination of DUWL biofilm using Oxygenal 6.
AB  - The aim of this study was bacteriological assessment of the dental unit waterlines (DUWL) biofilm - concentration and composition of the aerobe and facultative anaerobe bacterial microflora, and evaluation of the influence of a disinfecting product, Oxygenal 6, on the biofilm composition. Tubing fragments were taken from 25 units twice, before and after disinfection, and bacterial suspension of the biofilm was obtained from the samples. The bacterial flora was determined with the plate culture method. Bacteria were identified with biochemical microtests: API 20E, API 20NE (bioMerieux, France) and GP2 MicroPlate(TM) (BIOLOG, USA). Before disinfection, the following bacteria were identified: Gram-negative bacteria - Ralstonia pickettii, Pseudomonas vesicularis, Sphingomonas paucimobilis, Xanthomonas maltophilia; Gram-positive cocci - Micrococcus luteus, Micrococcus lylae, Staphylococcus cohnii, Staphylococcus lentus, Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp.; Actinomycetes - Streptomyces albus. The prevailing bacteria were: Ralstonia pickettii (78.62%), found in all the units, and Sphingomonas paucimobilis (20.45%). After DUWL disinfection, Sphingomonas paucimobilis (88.79%) dominated in the biofilm, Staphylococcus spp. - 5.61% and Pseudomonas spp. - 3.74% were next most frequently occurring bacteria, and in more than a half of the biofilm samples 100% reduction of the bacterial microflora occurred. This study confirms effectiveness of Oxygenal 6 in bacterial decontamination of the DUWL biofilm.
