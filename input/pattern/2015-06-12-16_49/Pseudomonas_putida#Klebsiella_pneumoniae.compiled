TI  - Genetic characterization of caffeine degradation by bacteria and its potential applications.
AB  - The ability of bacteria to grow on caffeine as sole carbon and nitrogen source has been known for over 40 years. Extensive research into this subject has revealed two distinct pathways, N-demethylation and C-8 oxidation, for bacterial caffeine degradation. However, the enzymological and genetic basis for bacterial caffeine degradation has only recently been discovered. This review article discusses the recent discoveries of the genes responsible for both N-demethylation and C-8 oxidation. All of the genes for the N-demethylation pathway, encoding enzymes in the Rieske oxygenase family, reside on 13.2-kb genomic DNA fragment found in Pseudomonas putida CBB5. A nearly identical DNA fragment, with homologous genes in similar orientation, is found in Pseudomonas sp. CES. Similarly, genes for C-8 oxidation of caffeine have been located on a 25.2-kb genomic DNA fragment of Pseudomonas sp. CBB1. The C-8 oxidation genes encode enzymes similar to those found in the uric acid metabolic pathway of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Various biotechnological applications of these genes responsible for bacterial caffeine degradation, including bio-decaffeination, remediation of caffeine-contaminated environments, production of chemical and fuels and development of diagnostic tests have also been demonstrated.
TI  - Enhancement of protocatechuate decarboxylase activity for the effective production of muconate from lignin-related aromatic compounds.
AB  - The decarboxylation reaction of protocatechuate has been described as a bottleneck and a rate-limiting step in cis,cis-muconate (ccMA) bioproduction from renewable feedstocks such as sugar. Because sugars are already in high demand in the development of many bio-based products, our work focuses on improving protocatechuate decarboxylase (Pdc) activity and ccMA production in particular, from lignin-related aromatic compounds. We previously had transformed an Escherichia coli strain using aroY, which had been used as a protocatechuate decarboxylase encoding gene from Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae A170-40, and inserted other required genes from Pseudomonas putida KT2440, to allow the production of ccMA from vanillin. This recombinant strain produced ccMA from vanillin, however the Pdc reaction step remained a bottleneck during incubation. In the current study, we identify a way to increase protocatechuate decarboxylase activity in E. coli through enzyme production involving both aroY and kpdB; the latter which encodes for the B subunit of 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase. This permits expression of Pdc activity at a level approximately 14-fold greater than the strain with aroY only. The expression level of AroY increased, apparently as a function of the co-expression of AroY and KpdB. Our results also imply that ccMA may inhibit vanillate demethylation, a reaction step that is rate limiting for efficient ccMA production from lignin-related aromatic compounds, so even though ccMA production may be enhanced, other challenges to overcome vanilate demethylation inhibition still remain.
TI  - In vitro fermentation of lactulose by human gut bacteria.
AB  - Lactulose has been known as a prebiotic that can selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. Recent studies have indicated that Streptococcus mutans, Clostridium perfringens, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii are also able to utilize lactulose. However, the previous studies mainly focused on the utilization of lactulose by individual strains, and few studies were designed to identify the species that could utilize lactulose among gut microbiota. This study aimed to identify lactulose-metabolizing bacteria in the human gut, using in silico and traditional culture methods. The prediction results suggested that genes for the transporters and glycosidases of lactulose are well distributed in the genomes of 222 of 453 strains of gastrointestinal-tract bacteria. The screening assays identified 35 species with the ability to utilize lactulose, of which Cronobacter sakazakii, Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas putida were reported for the first time to be capable of utilizing lactulose. In addition, significant correlations between lactulose and galactooligosaccharide metabolism were found. Thus, more attention should be paid to bacteria besides bifidobacteria and lactobacilli to further investigate the relationship between functional oligosaccharides and gut bacteria.
TI  - A bioinformatics approach to the determination of genes involved in endophytic behavior in Burkholderia spp.
AB  - The vast majority of plants harbor endophytic bacteria that colonize a portion of the plant's interior tissues without harming the plant. Like plant pathogens, endophytes gain entry into their plants hosts through various mechanisms. Bacterial endophytes display a broad range of symbiotic interactions with their host plants. The molecular bases of these plant-endophyte interactions are currently not fully understood. In the present study, a set of genes possibly responsible for endophytic behavior for genus Burkholderia was predicted and then compared and contrasted with a number (nine endophytes from different genera) of endophytes by comparative genome analysis. The nine endophytes included Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN, Burkholderia spp. strain JK006, Azospirillum lipoferum 4B, Enterobacter cloacae ENHKU01, Klebsiella pneumoniae 342, Pseudomonas putida W619, Enterobacter spp. 638, Azoarcus spp. BH72, and Serratia proteamaculans 568. From the genomes of the analyzed bacterial strains, a set of bacterial genes orthologs was identified that are predicted to be involved in determining the endophytic behavior of Burkholderia spp. The genes and their possible functions were then investigated to establish a potential connection between their presence and the role they play in bacterial endophytic behavior. Nearly all of the genes identified by this bioinformatics procedure encode function previously suggested in other studies to be involved in endophytic behavior.
TI  - [Investigation of the presence of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) by PCR in carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates].
AB  - Bacteria producing New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) exhibit high level  resistance to beta-lactams including carbapenems. This broad-spectrum resistance limits treatment options for infections caused by NDM-1 producers. NDM-1 was first isolated from an Indian patient in Sweden; since then, NDM-1 producing isolates have been identified in many countries including Turkey. In this study, we investigated the presence of NDM-1 by PCR method in various gram-negative isolates recovered from clinical specimens in tertiary care hospitals in Samsun, Turkey. A total of 210 carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates (132 Acinetobacter baumannii, 54 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 Pseudomonas putida, 8 Enterobacter cloacae, 3 Enterobacter aerogenes, 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 Providencia rettgeri, 2 Escherichia coli and 1 Citrobacter freundii) were included in the study. Identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates were performed by using Vitek-2 Compact (bioMerieux, France) and BD Phoenix (BD Diagnostic Systems, MD) automated systems. The results of antibiotic susceptibility testing were interpreted according to the CLSI recommendations. In our study, NDM-1 gene was not detected in any of the clinical isolates by PCR. There was only one case study that reported the presence of NDM-1 in clinical isolates from Turkey [Poirel L et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2012;56:2784]. Our data, together with the others, indicated that the existence of NDM-1 in clinical isolates is not common in Turkey. However, since NDM-1 is a plasmid-encoded enzyme, there is always a risk of spread of this resistance through the bacterial strains in our country. Therefore, continuous surveillance and investigation of carbapenem-resistant isolates with resistance patterns suggestive of NDM-1 may enable to identify NDM-1 producing isolates. Meanwhile special care should be given on rational antibiotic use and establishment of appropriate infection control policies to prevent the spread of NDM-1 producers and other potential resistant strains.
TI  - [Treatment of urosepsis induced by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy: analysis of 4 cases].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the strategy for management of urosepsis after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). METHODS: The clinical data were analyzed in 4 cases of urosepsis caused by ESWL during the period from January, 2008 to October 2011. RESULTS: Two of the patients had kidney stones and two had ureteral stones. Analysis of urine bacterial culture revealed the presence of E. coli in 2 cases, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1 case and Pseudomonas putida combined E. coli in 1 case. All the 4 patients were monitored for ECG, blood pressure and oxygen saturation, and received fluid replacement and anti-inflammatory therapy. The vital signs of the patients became stable after 5-11 days (mean 6.75 days). Three patients underwent ureteroscopic lithotripsy, and 1 patient had emergency ureteral stent indwelling. All the 4 patients were cured and discharged. CONCLUSION: ESWL is more likely to cause urosepsis in patients with ureteral stones and urinary infection, for which early nonsurgical interventions should be administered immediately after the diagnosis is established.
TI  - Class 1 integron gene cassettes in multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in  southern China.
AB  - Non-duplicate multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (n=1447) isolated from January 2008 to December 2009 were investigated for the presence of integrons as well as characterisation of gene cassettes. Among 825 strains carrying the class 1 integrase gene intI1, 461 gene cassette-positive isolates were found. Thirty-eight distinct gene cassette arrays were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and DNA sequencing analyses. In addition, several novel gene cassette arrays detected in this study were reported for the first time in some species: one in Escherichia coli, six in Klebsiella pneumoniae, six in Enterobacter cloacae, three in Enterobacter aerogenes, one in Proteus mirabilis, one in Acinetobacter spp., one in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and one in Pseudomonas putida. Among them, three cassettes, including HAD-like, DeltaMFS-1 and qnrVC-like genes, were originally detected in integrons.
TI  - MhbT is a specific transporter for 3-hydroxybenzoate uptake by Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae M5a1 is capable of utilizing 3-hydroxybenzoate via gentisate, and the 6.3-kb gene cluster mhbRTDHIM conferred the ability to grow on 3-hydroxybenzoate to Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida PaW340. Four of the six genes (mhbDHIM) encode enzymes converting 3-hydroxybenzoate to pyruvate and fumarate via gentisate. MhbR is a gene activator, and MhbT is a hypothetical protein belonging to the transporter of the aromatic acid/H(+) symporter family. Since a transporter for 3-hydrxybenzoate uptake has not been characterized to date, we investigated whether MhbT is responsible for the uptake of 3-hydroxybenzoate, its metabolic intermediate gentisate, or both. The MhbT-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein was located on the cytoplasmic membrane. P. putida PaW340 containing mhbRDeltaTDHIM could not grow on 3-hydroxybenzoate; however, supplying mhbT in trans allowed the bacterium to grow on the substrate. K. pneumoniae M5a1 and P. putida PaW340 containing recombinant MhbT transported (14)C-labeled 3-hydroxybenzoate but not (14)C-labeled gentisate and benzoate into the cells. Site-directed mutagenesis of two conserved amino acid residues (Asp-82 and Asp-314) and a less-conserved residue (Val-311) among the members of the symporter family in the hydrophilic cytoplasmic loops resulted in the loss of 3-hydroxybenzoate uptake by P. putida PaW340 carrying the mutant proteins. Hence, we demonstrated that MhbT is a specific 3-hydroxybenzoate transporter.
TI  - Increased IgA and IgM responses against gut commensals in chronic depression: further evidence for increased bacterial translocation or leaky gut.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, we discovered that depression is accompanied by increased IgM and IgA responses directed against gram negative gut commensals. The aim of this study was to replicate these findings in a larger study group of depressed patients and to examine the associations between the IgA and IgM responses to gut commensals and staging of depression as well as the fatigue and somatic (F&S) symptoms of depression. METHODS: We measured serum concentrations of IgM and IgA against the LPS of gram-negative enterobacteria, i.e. Hafnia alvei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas putida, Citrobacter koseri, and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 112 depressed patients and 28 normal controls. The severity of F&S symptoms was measured using the Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Rating Scale. RESULTS: The prevalences and median values of serum IgM and IgA against LPS of these commensals were significantly higher in depressed patients than in controls. The IgM levels directed against the LPS of these commensal bacteria were significantly higher in patients with chronic depression than in those without. The immune responses directed against LPS were not associated with melancholia or recurrent depression. There was a significant correlation between the IgA response directed against LPS and gastro-intestinal symptoms. DISCUSSION: The results indicate that increased bacterial translocation with immune responses to the LPS of commensal bacteria may play a role in the pathophysiology of depression, particularly chronic depression. Bacterial translocation may a) occur secondary to systemic inflammation in depression and intensify and perpetuate the primary inflammatory response once the commensals are translocated; or b) be a primary trigger factor associated with the onset of depression in some vulnerable individuals. The findings suggest that "translocated" gut commensal bacteria activate immune cells to elicit IgA and IgM responses and that this phenomenon may play a role in the pathophysiology of (chronic) depression by causing progressive amplifications of immune pathways.
TI  - The oligomeric assembly of the novel haem-degrading protein HbpS is essential for interaction with its cognate two-component sensor kinase.
AB  - HbpS, a novel protein of previously unknown function from Streptomyces reticuli,  is up-regulated in response to haemin- and peroxide-based oxidative stress and interacts with the SenS/SenR two-component signal transduction system. In this study, we report the high-resolution crystal structures (2.2 and 1.6 A) of octomeric HbpS crystallized in the presence and in the absence of haem and demonstrate that iron binds to surface-exposed lysine residues of an octomeric assembly. Based on an analysis of the crystal structures, we propose that the iron atom originates from the haem group and report subsequent biochemical experiments that demonstrate that HbpS possesses haem-degrading activity in vitro. Further examination of the crystal structures has identified amino acids that are essential for assembly of the octomer. The role of these residues is confirmed by biophysical experiments. Additionally, we show that while the octomeric assembly state of HbpS is not essential for haem-degrading activity, the assembly of HbpS is required for its interaction with the cognate sensor kinase, SenS. Homologs of HbpS and SenS/SenR have been identified in a number of medically and ecologically relevant bacterial species (including Vibrio cholerae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Arthrobacter aurescens and Pseudomonas putida), suggesting the existence of a previously undescribed bacterial oxidative stress-response pathway common to Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Thus, the data presented provide the first insight into the function of a novel protein family and an example of an iron-mediated interaction between an accessory protein and its cognate two-component sensor kinase.
TI  - Dissemination of bla(IMP-1)-carrying integron In86 among Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates harboring a new trimethoprim resistance gene dfr23.
AB  - The genetic context of the bla(IMP-1) gene was evaluated in 9 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates recovered from 2 hospitals in Sao Paulo, Brazil. All isolates harbored a copy of In86 carrying bla(IMP-1), aac(6')-31, and aadA1. Eight strains from the same hospital also carried another class 1 integron harboring a new trimethoprim resistance gene (dfr23) that was chromosomally embedded. In86 was likely to be in a 30-kb nontransferable plasmid and was flanked upstream by a sequence identical to one identified in an IMP-1-producing Pseudomonas putida isolate. The bla(IMP-1)-carrying integron In86 was recently reported from nonfermentative bacilli isolated in Sao Paulo. These isolates appear to be the source of this integron now acquired by K. pneumoniae strains from different hospitals in the same city. Metallo-beta-lactamase production is still rare among Enterobacteriaceae isolates in Brazil, but the acquisition of genetic structures carrying these mobile resistance determinants is worrisome and could lead to an increase in the prevalence of these phenotypes of resistance.
TI  - Transfer of antibiotic multiresistant plasmid RP4 from escherichia coli to activated sludge bacteria.
AB  - In situ transfer of a self-transmissible, antibiotic-multiresistant plasmid RP4 from a laboratory Escherichia coli strain C600 to indigenous activated sludge bacteria was investigated using filter mating. The transfer frequency of RP4 from the donor E. coli to the bacteria that was sampled from two wastewater treatment plants was 5.1x10(-2) to 7.5x10(-1) and 4.6x10(-3) to 1.3x10(-2)/potential recipient. The isolated transconjugants showed resistance to Ap, Km, and Tc and the presence of a plasmid with a similar size to RP4. The traG gene on RP4 was also detected from all transconjugants. Reverse-transfer experiments from the transconjugants to E. coli HB101 indicated that RP4 maintained self-transmissibility in the transconjugants. The transconjugant strains were dominant bacteria in activated sludge including Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. putida, and Ochrobactrum anthropi and minor populations of enteric bacterial strains including Citrobacter freundii, E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, E. asburiae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae. The transconjugant strains K. pneumoniae ssp. pneumonia, E. cloacae, and E. asburiae had several naturally occurring plasmids. These results suggest that in situ transfer of plasmids and the exchange of antibiotic-resistant genes can occur between released and indigenous bacteria in activated sludge.
TI  - Biodiversity of chloramphenicol-resistant mesophilic heterotrophs from Southeast  Asian aquaculture environments.
AB  - In the present study, samples of pond water, sediment and farmed species were collected at 12 fish and shrimp farms in Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam to determine the biodiversity and environmental distribution of chloramphenicol-resistant (CmR) mesophilic heterotrophs in Southeast Asian aquaculture sites. Following isolation on Iso-Sensitest agar supplemented with 35mug ml(-1) Cm and dereplication using (GTG)(5)-PCR fingerprinting, 557 genotypically unique CmR strains were subjected to polyphasic identification. The 557 mesophilic heterotrophic CmR isolates represented 18 different genera largely dominated by the genera Escherichia (40.2%), Pseudomonas (11.7%), Acinetobacter (11.1%), Klebsiella (7.5%) and Bacillus (5.9%). A total of 439 CmR isolates were further assigned to 31 described species or species groups, mainly including organisms that have been associated with various human opportunistic infections such as Escherichia coli (n=219), Pseudomonas putida (n=47), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=38) and Acinetobacter baumannii (n=23). Strains of Escherichia, and most notably, of E. coli, were the only common group of CmR heterotrophs irrespective of country, sample type or farm type. Together with other predominant but less widespread groups such as acinetobacters and pseudomonads, the results of this biodiversity study suggest that E. coli can be regarded as a potential indicator of Cm resistance in Southeast Asian aquaculture environments.
TI  - Occurrence and diversity of integrons and beta-lactamase genes among ampicillin-resistant isolates from estuarine waters.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence and molecular diversity of beta-lactamase genes and integrons among Gram-negative ampicillin-resistant bacteria from Ria de Aveiro. Ampicillin-resistant isolates were selected and subjected to genotyping using REP-PCR. Representatives from each REP pattern were affiliated with the following taxa by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene: Aeromonas caviae, A. hydrophila, A. media, A. molluscorum, A. veronii, A. salmonicida, Aeromonas sp., Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas sp., Escherichia coli, Escherichia sp., Shigella sonnei, Shigella sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, R. planticola, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii and Enterobacter sp. Isolates affiliated with genera Escherichia or Shigella were identified as Escherichia coli using phenotypic-based tests. PCR was used to assess beta-lactamase encoding sequences (bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(CARB), bla(CTX-M), bla(IMP), bla(VIM), bla(CphA/IMIS), bla(OXA-A), bla(OXA-B), bla(OXA-C)), class 1 and class 2 integrases, and integron variable regions. Sequence analysis of PCR products was performed. beta-Lactamase genes were detected in 77.8% of the Enterobacteriaceae and in 10.5% of the Aeromonas. The most frequently detected gene was bla(TEM), followed by bla(SHV,)bla(OXA-B), bla(CphA/IMIS) and bla(CARB). Retrieved sequences shared high homology with previously described beta-lactamases. The intI1 gene was present in 29.6% of the Enterobacteriaceae and in 21% of the Aeromonas isolates. The intI2 gene was present in 4 isolates. A total of 13 cassettes included in 12 different cassette arrays were identified. The most frequently found resistance gene cassettes were aadA variants. Previous investigations based on cultivation-independent approaches revealed higher molecular diversity among beta-lactamase-encoding sequences in this estuary. This fact reinforces the hypothesis that cultivation-dependent approaches may underestimate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in environmental samples and may introduce bias in the recovery of their molecular variants.
TI  - Increased serum IgA and IgM against LPS of enterobacteria in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS): indication for the involvement of gram-negative enterobacteria in the etiology of CFS and for the presence of an increased gut-intestinal permeability.
AB  - There is now evidence that chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is accompanied by immune disorders and by increased oxidative stress. The present study has been designed in order to examine the serum concentrations of IgA and IgM to LPS of gram-negative enterobacteria, i.e. Hafnia alvei; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas putida, Citrobacter koseri, and Klebsiella pneumoniae in CFS patients, patients with partial CFS and normal controls. We found that the prevalences and median values for serum IgA against the LPS of enterobacteria are significantly greater in patients with CFS than in normal volunteers and patients with partial CFS. Serum IgA levels were significantly correlated to the severity of illness, as measured by the FibroFatigue scale and to symptoms, such as irritable bowel, muscular tension, fatigue, concentration difficulties, and failing memory. The results show that enterobacteria are involved in the etiology of CFS and that an increased gut-intestinal permeability has caused an immune response to the LPS of gram-negative enterobacteria. It is suggested that all patients with CFS should be checked by means of the IgA panel used in the present study and accordingly should be treated for increased gut permeability.
TI  - Transmembrane transcriptional control (surface signalling) of the Escherichia coli Fec type.
AB  - The ferric citrate transport system of Escherichia coli is the first example of a transcription initiation mechanism that starts at the cell surface. The inducer, ferric citrate, binds to an outer membrane transport protein, and without further transport elicits a signal that is transmitted across the outer membrane, the periplasm, and the cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm. Signal transfer across the three subcellular compartments is mediated by the outer membrane transport protein that interacts in the periplasm with a cytoplasmic transmembrane protein. The latter is required for activation of a sigma factor which belongs to the extracytoplasmic function sigma factor family. A similar kind of transcription regulation has been demonstrated in Pseudomonas putida, P. aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Aerobacter aerogenes, Bordetella pertussis, B. bronchseptica, B. avium, and Ralstonia solanacearum. The genomes of P. putida, P. aeruginosa, Nitrosomonas europaea, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Caulobacter crescentus predict the existence of many more such transcriptional regulatory devices.
TI  - Clinical experiences of bacteremia caused by metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative organisms.
AB  - The emergence of acquired metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) in gram-negative bacilli is regarded as a therapeutic challenge since such enzymes are capable of hydrolyzing all beta-lactams in vitro except the monobactams. The clinical characteristics and outcome of 8 episodes of gram-negative bacteremia caused by MBL-producing isolates from January 1997 through December 2000 (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 6 isolates; Pseudomonas stutzeri, 4; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1; and Pseudomonas putida, 1) were analyzed. The median age of the patients was 61 years (range, 2-95 years). Most patients (n = 6, 75%) had more than 1 comorbid illness or condition and 6 patients acquired bacteremia in the intensive care unit. The median time from admission to the first positive culture was 34.5 days (range, 1-99 days). Pneumonia was the most common site of infection. Five patients (62.5%) received a carbapenem to treat bacteremia. The median time to defervescence was 6 days (range, 2-12 days). No bacteriologic failure was noted during or after antimicrobial therapy. The overall mortality rate from bacteremia caused by gram-negative, MBL-producing organisms was nil at 14 or 28 days.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. Changes in CZOP susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Serratia liquefaciens, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter Iwoffii, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Bacteroides fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas. CZOP preserved its antibacterial activity against M. (B.) catarrhalis (MIC90: 4 micrograms/mL) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against H. influenzae (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli was preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), and imipenem (IPM). The MIC90 of CZOP against K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/mL, respectively. The MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. aerogenes was preferable (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activities of CZOP against S. marcescens and S. liquefaciens were relatively potent (MIC90: 0.5 and 0.25 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of CPR, CFPM, and carumonam. CZOP preserved comparable antibacterial activity to CPR against C. freundii and C. koseri (MIC90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/mL). The MIC90 of CZOP against P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, and M. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/mL, respectively. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Providencia spp. was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. aeruginosa was the most potent (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) among the test agents and comparable to those CFPM, IPM, and MEPM. CZOP had low activity against P. fluorescens and P. putida (MIC90: 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against A. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR and CFPM (MIC90: 32 micrograms/mL) and against A. lwoffii was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). Most of the test agents including CZOP had low antibacterial activity against B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, and B. fragilis group. The MIC90 of CZOP against Prevotella/Porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/mL. Bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. In non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and CFPM, CAZ, CPR, or IPM was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. In conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. cloacae possible decreased, but against other Gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. A total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabillis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobactor baumannii, Acinetobactor lwoffii, Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lwoffii throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in antibacterial activities of CZOP against B. cepacia, and H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - A comparison of the bacteria found on the hands of 'homemakers' and neonatal intensive care unit nurses.
AB  - This prevalence study was conducted to compare the counts, types and antimicrobial resistance profiles of bacterial flora on the hands of individuals in the community to that of nurses at a nearby university teaching hospital, with an intense hand hygiene regimen. Hand cultures were obtained from 204 individuals during a home visit and 119 nurses in two neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). The mean total log counts of organisms were 5.73 and 5.24 for the homemakers [defined as the person (usually the mother) who is the primary person responsible for arranging childcare, cooking, cleaning etc] and nurse hands, respectively (P<0.0001). Significantly more homemakers had Acinetobacter lwoffii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens/putida, and Staphylococcus aureus on their hands compared with the nurses (all P<0.05). However, significantly more nurses had Enterococcus faecalis, S. epidermidis, and S. warneri on their hands (P<0.05). Of note, the hands of nurses harboured significantly more S. epidermidis strains resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and oxacillin and S. warneri resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, and oxacillin (P<0.05). Surprisingly, significantly more trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant S. epidermidis and ciprofloxacin-resistant S. warneri was recovered from the hands of homemakers (P<0.05). This study demonstrates differences in prevalence, bacterial composition and antimicrobial resistance of hand flora of hospital personnel compared with homemakers. Moreover, the hands of homemakers may serve as community reservoirs for antimicrobial resistant strains of clinical importance.
TI  - Identification and broad dissemination of the CTX-M-14 beta-lactamase in different Escherichia coli strains in the northwest area of Spain.
AB  - During the course of a molecular epidemiology study of mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in the area served by our hospital (516,000 inhabitants), we isolated the gene encoding CTX-M-14 beta-lactamase. Thirty clinical strains (27 Escherichia coli and 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates) with a phenotype of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase were collected from January to October 2001 and studied for the presence of the CTX-M-14 beta- lactamase gene. By isoelectric point determination, PCR, and nucleotide sequencing, we detected the presence of this gene in 17 E. coli strains belonging to 15 different genotypes (REP-PCR) causing infections in 17 different patients. Epidemiological studies based on medical records did not suggest any relationship between the patients infected with these E. coli strains and, interestingly, 7 of 30 patients harboring strains with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases never had contact with the hospital environment before the clinical E. coli isolation. Conjugation experiments revealed that this gene was plasmid mediated in the 17 E. coli strains, and plasmid restriction fragment length polymorphisms showed 9 different patterns in the 17 E. coli strains. By PCR, the sequence of the tnpA transposase gene of the insert sequence ISEcp-1 was detected in all the plasmids harboring the CTX-M-14 gene. These results strongly suggest that plasmid dissemination between different E. coli strains in addition to a mobile element (transposon) around the beta-lactamase gene may be involved in the spreading of the CTX-M-14 gene. This study reinforces the hypothesis that the epidemiology of the prevalence of the beta-lactamase genes is changing and should alert the medical community to the increase in the emergence of the CTX-M beta-lactamases worldwide.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems. Thirty-two species 2,697 strains of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), Escherichia coli (n = 250), Citrobacter freundii (n = 153), Citrobacter koseri (n = 97), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), Serratia marcescens (n = 153), Proteus mirabillis (n = 103), Proteus vulgaris (n = 77), Morganella morganii (n = 141), Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii; n = 154), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), Pseudomonas putida (n = 49), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), Acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), Acinetobactor Iwoffii (n = 30), Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola; n = 124). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lowffii throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in the antibacterial activity of CZOP against H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. Changes in CZOP susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), Escherichia coli (n = 276), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 93), Serratia marcescens (n = 172), Serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), Citrobacter freundii (n = 177), Citrobacter koseri (n = 70), Proteus mirabilis (n = 113), Proteus vulgaris (n = 89), Morganella morganii (n = 116), Providencia spp. (n = 41), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), Pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), Pseudomonas putida (n = 63), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), Acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and Prevotella/Porphyromonas (n = 173). An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, and S. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against M.(B.) catarrhalis, C. koseri, and P. aeruginosa was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, and P. mirabilis increased year by year. The increase in MIC90 of CZOP against E. aerogenes and P. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. In contract, the susceptibility of E. cloacae to CZOP was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to CZOP. MIC90 of CZOP against C. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. Additionally, MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. fluorescens, P. putida, B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, B. fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. Changes in MIC90 of CZOP against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.
TI  - SHV-12, SHV-5, SHV-2a and VEB-1 extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in Gram-negative bacteria isolated in a university hospital in Thailand.
AB  - Sixty-one extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates were collected from Srinagarind Hospital, Thailand. These included 43 Enterobacteriaceae and 18 Pseudomonadaceae. The 43 Enterobacteriaceae were found to produce the following ESBLs: 26 (60.5%) SHV-12, 13 (30.2%) SHV-5, two (4.7%) SHV-2a, one (2.3%) VEB-1 and one (2.3%) unidentified. Twenty-four isolates (55.8%) also carried bla(TEM-1B), as well as bla(SHV) or bla(VEB-1). Plasmid DNA from transconjugants carrying the bla(SHV-12) gene showed various restriction patterns, indicating the distribution of the bla(SHV-12) gene among different antibiotic resistance plasmids. In contrast, bla(SHV-5) in 13 isolates was found on a single plasmid of c. 130 kb. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis of genomic DNA from these isolates revealed that nine of 11 Klebsiella pneumoniae gave the same pattern, indicating clonal spread of the strain within the hospital, together with the occasional spread of the plasmid to other strains. Among the pseudomonad isolates, 16 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one Pseudomonas putida had bla(VEB-like) and one P. aeruginosa had bla(SHV-12). Nine of the 16 isolates carrying bla(VEB-like) (56.3%) had identical PFGE patterns, suggesting the dissemination of this gene, also by clonal spread. At least six different bla(VEB-like-)containing integrons were found among the 18 isolates. This is the first report of bacteria producing SHV-12 and SHV-2a in Thailand and the first report of SHV-12 in P. aeruginosa, of VEB-1 in Citrobacter freundii and a VEB-1-like beta-lactamase in P. putida. These findings indicate that ESBL genes in the Far East are part of a gene pool capable of broad horizontal gene transfer, in that these genes can transfer between different families of Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Accumulation of methylglyoxal in anaerobically grown Escherichia coli and its detoxification by expression of the Pseudomonas putida glyoxalase I gene.
AB  - Anaerobic glycerol fermentation by Escherichia coli strains expressing genes from the Klebsiella pneumoniae dha regulon showed that cell growth and 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) production are significantly inhibited when 5 g/L or higher of glycerol is initially present. One reason for this inhibition may be methylglyoxal (MG) accumulation. Assays of both intracellular and extracellular MG levels indicated an accumulation of MG in anaerobic glycerol fermentation of transgenic E. coli. Pseudomonas putida glyoxalase I was expressed in the transgenic E. coli to enhance MG detoxification. The activity of glyoxalase I in the transgenic E. coli with the P. putida glyoxalase I under anaerobic conditions was 12-fold higher than that in the control cells. Compared to the control cells, the transgenic cells with the P. putida glyoxalase I displayed a reduction of 35-43% in intracellular MG and a decrease of 30% in extracellular MG. These decreases were statistically significant (P>94). Furthermore, the expression of the P. putida glyoxalase I in the transgenic E. coli markedly improved cell growth and resulted in a 50% increase in 1,3-PD production.
TI  - Primary pseudomonas meningitis in an adult, splenectomized, multitransfused thalassaemia major patient.
AB  - A 19-year-old splenectomized, multitransfused female patient with beta-thalassaemia major developed primary meningitis due to P. putida. Her blood cultures were negative. P. putida is an unusual nosocomial organism to cause primary meningitis. Infection due to this organism carries high mortality. However, owing to early diagnosis and energetic treatment this patient survived without any sequelae. A review of serious infections over the last 7 years in patients in our thalassaemia care centre revealed 11 serious infections among our splenectomized patients (n = 46) and none in the non-splenectomized group (n = 106). Surprisingly, all overwhelming infections (23.8% in the splenectomized group) were caused by Gram-negative bacilli like Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Aeromonas and Campylobacter species. As all our splenectomized patients had prior pneumococcal vaccination and oral penicillin prophylaxis, overwhelming septicaemia due to S. Pneumoniae was successfully prevented, but an increasing incidence of overwhelming sepsis due to Gram-negative bacilli, against which no vaccination or suitable prophylactic antibiotics are available, is now posing a new threat to this vulnerable group of patients.
TI  - Convenient test for screening metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria by using thiol compounds.
AB  - A simple disk diffusion test was constructed for detection of IMP-1-type metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria. Two Kirby-Bauer disks containing ceftazidime (CAZ) and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor were used in this test. Several IMP-1 inhibitors such as thiol compounds including 2-mercaptopropionic acid, heavy metal salts, and EDTA were evaluated for this test. Two CAZ disks were placed on a Mueller-Hinton agar plate on which a bacterial suspension was spread according to the method recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The distance between the disks was kept to about 4 to 5 cm, and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor was placed near one of the CAZ disks within a center-to-center distance of 1.0 to 2.5 cm. For IMP-1-producing strains, the growth-inhibitory zone between the two disks expanded, while no evident change in the shape of the growth-inhibitory zone was observed for CAZ-resistant strains producing serine beta-lactamases such as AmpC or SHV-12. As a result, 2 to 3 microliter of undiluted 2-mercaptopropionic acid or mercaptoacetic acid able to block IMP-1 activity gave the most reproducible and clearest results, and CAZ-resistant strains producing AmpC or extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were distinguishable from IMP-1 producers by this test. A similar observation was made with IMP-1-producing clinical isolates such as Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter spp., and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. The specificity and sensitivity of this test were comparable to those of PCR analysis using bla(IMP)-specific primers. Therefore, this convenient test would be valuable for daily use in clinical laboratories.
TI  - Phosphate starvation-independent 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid biodegradation in a  newly isolated strain of Pseudomonas putida, NG2.
AB  - A strain of Pseudomonas putida that utilized the biogenic organophosphonate 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid as sole carbon and energy, nitrogen and phosphorus source contained 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid: pyruvate aminotransferase and phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase (phosphonatase) activities which were inducible by the presence of 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid in the culture medium, regardless of the phosphate status of the cells. Neither of these activities were induced in their phosphate-free or phosphate-replete medium in the absence of 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid. Alkaline phosphatase activity was induced in phosphate limited medium, however, indicating a phosphate-starvation inducible response. In Enterobacter aerogenes IFO 12010, 2-aminoethylphosphonate: pyruvate aminotransferase and phosphonatase activities were induced only when cells were both phosphate limited and supplied with 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid as sole phosphorus source for growth. Neither enzyme activity was induced in phosphate-replete medium, or in medium where both 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid and inorganic phosphate were supplied as sources of phosphorus. The results point to the presence of a substrate inducible 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid biodegradation pathway in the isolated strain of Pseudomonas putida. Uniquely, therefore, the pathway is not under pho regulon control in this strain.
TI  - Formation of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) by PHA synthase from Ralstonia eutropha.
AB  - The acetoacetyl-CoA reductase and the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase from Ralstonia eutropha (formerly Alcaligenes eutrophus) were expressed in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, and PHA-negative mutants of R. eutropha and Pseudomonas putida. While expression in E. coli strains resulted in the accumulation of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [PHB], strains of R. eutropha, P. putida and K. aerogenes accumulated poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) [poly(3HB-co-3HHx)] when even chain fatty acids were provided as carbon source, and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) [poly(3HB-co-3HV)] when odd chain fatty acids were provided as carbon source. This suggests that fatty acid degradation can be directly accessed employing only the acetoacetyl-CoA reductase and the PHA synthase. This is also the first proof that the PHA synthase from R. eutropha can incorporate 3-hydroxyhexanoate (3HHx) into PHA and has, therefore, a broader substrate specificity than previously described.

TI  - Evidence for the bacterial origin of genes encoding fermentation enzymes of the amitochondriate protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica.
AB  - Entamoeba histolytica is an amitochondriate protozoan parasite with numerous bacterium-like fermentation enzymes including the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (POR), ferredoxin (FD), and alcohol dehydrogenase E (ADHE). The goal of this study was to determine whether the genes encoding these cytosolic E. histolytica fermentation enzymes might derive from a bacterium by horizontal transfer, as has previously been suggested for E. histolytica genes encoding heat shock protein 60, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase. In this study, the E. histolytica por gene and the adhE gene of a second amitochondriate protozoan parasite, Giardia lamblia, were sequenced, and their phylogenetic positions were estimated in relation to POR, ADHE, and FD cloned from eukaryotic and eubacterial organisms. The E. histolytica por gene encodes a 1,620-amino-acid peptide that contained conserved iron-sulfur- and thiamine pyrophosphate-binding sites. The predicted E. histolytica POR showed fewer positional identities to the POR of G. lamblia (34%) than to the POR of the enterobacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae (49%), the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. (44%), and the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis (46%), which targets its POR to anaerobic organelles called hydrogenosomes. Maximum-likelihood, neighbor-joining, and parsimony analyses also suggested as less likely E. histolytica POR sharing more recent common ancestry with G. lamblia POR than with POR of bacteria and the T. vaginalis hydrogenosome. The G. lamblia adhE encodes an 888-amino-acid fusion peptide with an aldehyde dehydrogenase at its amino half and an iron-dependent (class 3) ADH at its carboxy half. The predicted G. lamblia ADHE showed extensive positional identities to ADHE of Escherichia coli (49%), Clostridium acetobutylicum (44%), and E. histolytica (43%) and lesser identities to the class 3 ADH of eubacteria and yeast (19 to 36%). Phylogenetic analyses inferred a closer relationship of the E. histolytica ADHE to bacterial ADHE than to the G. lamblia ADHE. The 6-kDa FD of E. histolytica and G. lamblia were most similar to those of the archaebacterium Methanosarcina barkeri and the delta-purple bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, respectively, while the 12-kDa FD of the T. vaginalis hydrogenosome was most similar to the 12-kDa FD of gamma-purple bacterium Pseudomonas putida. E. histolytica genes (and probably G. lamblia genes) encoding fermentation enzymes therefore likely derive from bacteria by horizontal transfer, although it is not clear from which bacteria these amebic genes derive. These are the first nonorganellar fermentation enzymes of eukaryotes implicated to have derived from bacteria.
TI  - PCR detection of metallo-beta-lactamase gene (blaIMP) in gram-negative rods resistant to broad-spectrum beta-lactams.
AB  - We applied PCR to the rapid detection of the metallo-beta-lactamase gene, blaIMP, in clinically isolated gram-negative rods. A total of 54 high-level ceftazidime-resistant strains (MICs, > 128 micrograms/ml) were subjected to PCR analyses with the blaIMP-specific primers, since the blaIMP-bearing clinical isolates tested in our previous study always demonstrated high-level resistance to ceftazidime. Twenty-two blaIMP-positive strains including 9 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 9 Serratia marcescens, 2 Alcaligenes xylosoxidans, 1 Pseudomonas putida, and 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains were newly identified from 18 different hospitals in Japan. These strains were mostly isolated from urine samples and showed high-level resistance to almost every cephem, while their levels of resistance to carbapenems were diverse. The PCR analyses with novel integrase gene-specific (intI3) and acc(6')-Ib gene-specific primers suggested that the integron structure found in a large plasmid harbored by S. marcescens AK9373 was also well conserved among blaIMP-positive strains. These results imply that the blaIMP gene cassettes have been dispersing into various gram-negative rods with the help of the newly identified integron element. Thus, the PCR-aided rapid detection will be helpful for the early recognition of emerging blaIMP-positive clinical isolates which demonstrate consistent resistance to beta-lactams.
TI  - 2,4-dioxygenases catalyzing N-heterocyclic-ring cleavage and formation of carbon  monoxide. Purification and some properties of 1H-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinaldine 2,4-dioxygenase from Arthrobacter sp. Ru61a and comparison with 1H-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline 2,4-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida 33/1.
AB  - 1H-3-Hydroxy-4-oxoquinaldine 2,4-dioxygenase (MeQDO) was purified from quinaldine-grown Arthrobacter sp. Ru61a. It was enriched 59-fold in a yield of 22%, and its properties were compared with 1H-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline 2,4-dioxygenase (QDO) purified from Pseudomonas putida 33/1. The enzyme-catalyzed conversions were performed in an (18O)O2/(16O)O2 atmosphere. Two oxygen atoms of either (18O)O2 or (16O)O2 were incorporated at C2 and C4 of the respective substrates, indicating that these unusual enzymes, which catalyze the cleavage of two carbon-carbon bonds concomitant with CO formation, indeed are 2,4-dioxygenases. Both enzymes are small monomeric proteins of 32 kDa (MeQDO) and 30 kDa (QDO). The apparent K(m) values of MeQDO for 1H-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinaldine and QDO for 1H-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline were 30 microM and 24 microM, respectively. In both 2,4-dioxygenases, there was no spectral evidence for the presence of a chromophoric cofactor. EPR analyses of MeQDO did not reveal any signal that could be assigned to an organic radical species or to a metal, and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry of both enzymes did not show any metal present in stoichiometric amounts. Ethylxanthate, metal-chelating agents (tiron, alpha, alpha'-bipyridyl, 8-hydroxyquinoline, o-phenanthroline, EDTA, diphenylthiocarbazone, diethyldithiocarbamate), reagents that modify sulfhydryl groups (iodoacetamide, N-ethylmaleimide, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate), and reducing agents (sodium dithionite, dithiothreitol, mercaptoethanol) either did not affect 2,4-dioxygenolytic activities at all or inhibited at high concentrations only. With respect to the supposed lack of any cofactor and with respect to the inhibitors of dioxygenolytic activities, MeQDO and QDO resemble aci-reductone oxidase (CO-forming) from Klebsiella pneumoniae, which catalyzes 1,3-dioxygenolytic cleavage of 1,2-dihydroxy-3-keto-S-methylthiopentene anion (Wray, J. W. & Abeles, R. H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 21466-21469; Wray, J. W. & Abeles, R. H. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 3147-3153). 1H-3-Hydroxy-4-oxoquinaldine and 1H-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline were reactive towards molecular oxygen in the presence of the base catalyst potassium-tert.-butoxide in the aprotic solvent N,N-dimethylformamide. Base-catalyzed oxidation, yielding the same products as the enzyme-catalyzed conversions, provides a non-enzymic model reaction for 2,4-dioxygenolytic release of CO from 1H-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinaldine and 1H-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies to Pseudomonas pseudomallei and their potential for diagnosis of melioidosis.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for Pseudomonas pseudomallei antigens were  produced by immunizing BALB/c mice with a crude whole cell extract. Hybrids secreting MAbs specific for P. pseudomallei antigens were identified by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against a panel of crude whole cell extracts from P. pseudomallei, P. cepacia, P. aeruginosa, P. putida, P. alcaligenes, Xanthomonas maltophilia, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhi, S. krefeld, S. enteritidis, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Of the six specific clones, clone 5F8, which was IgM-producing and which reacted with all 56 P. pseudomallei isolates, was selected for further characterization and evaluation of its possible diagnostic potential. Results obtained from the indirect ELISA against various P. pseudomallei antigens, from direct bacterial agglutination, and from immunofluorescence tests suggested that 5F8 reacted with the surface envelope, and probably specifically with an epitope of the lipopolysaccharide. The antibody could be readily used to identify P. pseudomallei in primary culture or in a simulated hemoculture. The antibody was also used to prepare an affinity-purified antigen for use in an indirect ELISA that was highly sensitive and specific for the detection of circulating antibody in patients with acute septicemic melioidosis.
TI  - Pollution of modern metalworking fluids containing biocides by pathogenic bacteria in France. Reexamination of chemical treatments accuracy.
AB  - Pollution by pathogenic bacteria was examined in 150 French metalworking fluid samples. Gram-negative micro-organisms such as Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and Vibrio spp. as well as Gram-positive cocci were never isolated. Nevertheless opportunistic pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae still contaminated these fluids with an isolation frequency of 17% of samples for each. These two micro-organisms failed to grow or even survive in vitro in sterile cutting fluids protected by biocides. Preliminary growth of other micro-organisms such as Pseudomonas putida or Pseudomonas fluorescens, which are the major part of the indigenous microflora, seemed to be a prerequisite for their growth. These former two Pseudomonas could resist three different classes of biocides and, at least in the case of formaldehyde-releasers, adaptation was followed by biocide deterioration. Resistance magnification was observed in the presence of the three different types of biocides and, in the case of formaldehyde releasers the resistance and deterioration levels were close to those recommended by the manufacturers. This is probably the reason why the preliminary growth of Pseudomonas putida allowed in vitro differed growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Due to relatively high isolation frequencies of opportunistic pathogens (17% of samples) periodical microbiological examination of cutting fluids should be carried out in order to evaluate risks for human health. Wearing masks and gloves is still recommended, at least in France.
TI  - Precise deletions in large bacterial genomes by vector-mediated excision (VEX). The trfA gene of promiscuous plasmid RK2 is essential for replication in several gram-negative hosts.
AB  - We have developed a simple and efficient method of vector-mediated excision (VEX) for in vivo generation of precisely defined deletions in large bacterial genomes. The system uses homologous recombination with small cloned fragments on specialized pVEX plasmids to insert directly repeated bacteriophage P1 loxP sites at positions flanking the region to be deleted. In the presence of Cre recombinase, the loxP sites are efficiently recombined to produce the deletion. Deletion endpoints can be directed to specific nucleotides because they are defined by the termini of small homology-bearing fragments cloned into the pVEX plasmids. We have used VEX to delete trfA, the only known replication initiator gene of the 56.4 kb broad host-range plasmid RK2. The RK2 delta trfA mutant was found to be conjugation proficient, but unable to replicate in the RK2 hosts Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Caulobacter crescentus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Rhizobium meliloti, or Rhodobacter sphaeroides. These results show that trfA is essential for replication in these hosts and indicate that the broad host-range of RK2 does not involve multiple replicons.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefpirome in children].
AB  - Cefpirome (CPR, HR 810) was clinically evaluated for its efficacy and safety in 11 patients with ages from 4 months to 11 years with bacterial infection. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. CPR was administered to 6 patients with bronchopneumonia, a patient with pneumonia, a patient with tonsillitis, 2 patients with acute pharyngitis and a patient with suppurative parotitis at daily dosage levels ranging 55.5-91.7 mg/kg, divided into 3 using intravenous bolus injection or 30 minutes drip infusion. Clinical responses of the 11 patients were as follows: excellent; 8 patients, good; 2 patients, poor; 1 patient, hence the efficacy rate was 90.9%. 2. Neither clinical adverse reaction nor abnormal laboratory test value was observed except slight elevation of GOT and GPT in a patient and leukopenia in another. 3. MICs of CPR against 18 beta-lactamase producing strains isolated from patients were as follows. MIC against a strain of Staphylococcus aureus was 1.56 micrograms/ml, MICs against 3 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae were less than 0.025 microgram/ml, those against 3 out of 5 strains of Enterobacter cloacae were less than 0.025 microgram/ml and those against the remaining 2 strains were 0.05 and 0.20 micrograms/ml. MICs against 2 out of 3 strains Acinetobacter lwoffi were 1.56 micrograms/ml, and that of the remaining 1 strain was 0.39 microgram/ml. MICs against 2 strains of Pseudomonas cepacia were 1.56 micrograms/ml. MICs against a strain of Pseudomonas putida and a strain of Citrobacter diversus were 0.78 and less than 0.025 microgram/ml, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bradyrhizobium japonicum has two differentially regulated, functional homologs of the sigma 54 gene (rpoN).
AB  - Recognition of -24/-12-type promoters by RNA polymerase requires a special sigma  factor, sigma 54 (RpoN NtrA GlnF). In the nitrogen-fixing soybean symbiont Bradyrhizobium japonicum, two functional, highly conserved rpoN genes (rpoN1 and rpoN2) were identified and sequenced. The two predicted B. japonicum RpoN protein sequences were 87% identical, and both showed different levels of homology to the RpoN proteins of other bacteria. Downstream of rpoN2 (but not of rpoN1), two additional open reading frames were identified that corresponded to open reading frames located at similar positions in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas putida. Both B. japonicum rpoN genes complemented the succinate- and nitrate-negative phenotypes of a Rhizobium meliloti rpoN mutant. B. japonicum strains carrying single or double rpoN mutations were still able to utilize C4-dicarboxylates as a carbon source and histidine, proline, or arginine as a nitrogen source, whereas the ability to assimilate nitrate required expression of at least one of the two rpN genes. In symbiosis both rpoN genes could replace each other functionally. The rpoN1/2 double mutant induced about twice as many nodules on soybeans as did the wild type, and these nodules lacked nitrogen fixation activity completely. Transcription of a nifH'-'lacZ fusion was not activated in the rpoN1/2 mutant background, whereas expression of a fixR'-'lacZ fusion in this mutant was affected only marginally. By using rpoN'-'lacZ fusions, rpoN1 expression was shown to be activated at least sevenfold in microaerobiosis as compared with that in aerobiosis, and this type of regulation involved fixLJ. Expression of rpoN2 was observed under all conditions tested and was increased fivefold in an rpoN2 mutant. The data suggested that the rpoN1 gene was regulated in response to oxygen, whereas the rpoN2 gene was negatively autoregulated.
TI  - The role of microorganisms in psoriasis.
AB  - The microflora of 297 psoriasis patients was extensively examined. Throat, urine, and skin surfaces from scalp, ears, chest, face, axillary, submammary, umbilical, upper back, inguinal crease, gluteal-fold, perirectal, vaginal, pubis, penis, scrotal, leg, hands, feet, finger, and toenail areas were cultured for aerobic bacteria, yeast, and dermatophytes. Antibody levels to streptococcal enzymes were performed (streptolysin-O, DNAse-B, hyaluronidase, STREPTOZYME). Giemsa smears and KOH preparations were also used to determine yeast and dermatophyte presence. Associated organisms thought to provoke a psoriatic attack were as follows: streptococcal groups A, B, C, D, F, G, S viridans, S pneumoniae; Klebsiella pneumoniae, oxytoca; Escherichia coli; Enterobacter cloacae, E aerogenes, E agglomerans; Proteus mirabilis, P vulgaris; Citrobacter freundii, C diversus; Morganella morganii; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P maltiphilia, P putida; Serratia marcescens; Acinetobacter calbio aceticus, A luoffi; Flavobacterium specie; CDC groups Ve-1, Ve-2, E-o2; Bacillus subtilis, cereus; Staphylococcus aureus; Candida albicans, C parapsilosis; Torulopsis, glabrata; Rhodotorula and dermatophytes. One or more antistreptococal enzyme tests was positive in 50% of patients. Titers to hepatitis E were elevated in one patient and to HIV in two patients.
TI  - Transposon vectors containing non-antibiotic resistance selection markers for cloning and stable chromosomal insertion of foreign genes in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A simple procedure for cloning and stable insertion of foreign genes into the chromosomes of gram-negative eubacteria was developed by combining in two sets of plasmids (i) the transposition features of Tn10 and Tn5; (ii) the resistances to the herbicide bialaphos, to mercuric salts and organomercurial compounds, and to arsenite, and (iii) the suicide delivery properties of the R6K-based plasmid pGP704. The resulting constructions contained unique NotI or SfiI sites internal to either the Tn10 or the Tn5 inverted repeats. These sites were readily used for cloning DNA fragments with the help of two additional specialized cloning plasmids, pUC18Not and pUC18Sfi. The newly derived constructions could be maintained only in donor host strains that produce the R6K-specified pi protein, which is an essential replication protein for R6K and plasmids derived therefrom. Donor plasmids containing hybrid transposons were transformed into a specialized lambda pir lysogenic Escherichia coli strain with a chromosomally integrated RP4 that provided broad-host-range conjugal transfer functions. Delivery of the donor plasmids into selected host bacteria was accomplished through mating with the target strain. Transposition of the hybrid transposon from the delivered suicide plasmid to a replicon in the target cell was mediated by the cognate transposase encoded on the plasmid at a site external to the transposon. Since the transposase function was not maintained in target cells, such cells were not immune to further transposition rounds. Multiple insertions in the same strain are therefore only limited by the availability of distinct selection markers. The utility of the system was demonstrated with a kanamycin resistance gene as a model foreign insert into Pseudomonas putida and a melanin gene from Streptomyces antibioticus into Klebsiella pneumoniae. Because of the modular nature of the functional parts of the cloning vectors, they can be easily modified and further selection markers can be incorporated. The cloning system described here will be particularly useful for the construction of hybrid bacteria that stably maintain inserted genes, perhaps in competitive situations (e.g., in open systems and natural environments), and that do not carry antibiotic resistance markers characteristic of most available cloning vectors (as is currently required of live bacterial vaccines).
TI  - Sequence and analysis of the rpoN sigma factor gene of rhizobium sp. strain NGR234, a primary coregulator of symbiosis.
AB  - We report the nucleotide sequence of the rpoN gene from broad-host-range Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234 and analyze the encoded RPON protein, a sigma factor. Comparative analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of RPON from NGR234 with sequences from other gram-negative bacteria identified a perfectly conserved RPON box unique to RPON sigma factors. Symbiotic regulatory phenotypes were defined for a site-directed internal deletion within the coding sequence of the rpoN gene of Rhizobium strain NGR234: they included quantitative nodulation kinetics on Vigna unguiculata and microscopic analysis of the Fix- determinate nodules of V. unguiculata and Macroptilium atropurpureum. RPON was a primary coregulator of nodulation and was implicated in establishment or maintenance of the plant-synthesized peribacteroid membrane. Phenotypes of rpoN in Rhizobium strain NGR234 could be grouped as symbiosis related, rather than simply pleiotropically physiological as in free-living bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas putida.
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (III). Distribution of  bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in the Tohoku District of Japan].
AB  - The bacteriology of the isolates from the throat swab and the sputum respectively of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in Tohoku district of Japan during the period from January to April in 1989 was documented. Of the 2,539 patients, 1,694 had an acute upper respiratory infection, 609 had acute bronchitis, 46 had acute pneumonia, 84 had acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory infections and 106 had respiratory infections without diagnosis registered. 1887 (74.3%) strains of potential pathogens were recovered from 1507 (59.4%) of the 2539 cases. The rate of recovery of potential pathogens was very high in patients of the younger age. These patients had elevated body-temperature. There were statistically significant differences in recovery rate when classified by diagnosis, prefecture and the period of investigation. Of the 1,887 strains, 996 (52.8%) were gram-positive and 891 (47.2%) were gram-negative bacteria. The rate of recovery of gram-negative bacteria was high in patients who were less than 10 years old and more than 51 years old, in patients with pneumonia and chronic respiratory infections, and in patients with fever. Of the 1,887 strains, those which exceeded 100 were Staphylococcus aureus (481 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (340 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (329 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (117 strains) and Acinetobacter spp. (100 strains). Species other than those mentioned above had less than 100 strains. In this group there were 39 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 32 strains of Escherichia coli, 97 strains of Klebsiella spp., 40 strains of Enterobacter spp., 25 strains of Serratia spp., 12 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 43 strains of Pseudomonas putida. There was a remarkable difference in recovery rate of each species when classified by diagnosis, age class, prefecture and the period of investigation, respectively. The above results indicated that gram-positive bacteria are more frequent than gram-negative bacteria, that enterobacteriaceae and glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria are only rarely found in primary care clinics, and that the bacteriology in primary care clinic is different from that of medical school-affiliated hospitals.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the repressor for the histidine utilization genes of Klebsiella aerogenes.
AB  - The hutC gene of Klebsiella aerogenes encodes a repressor that regulates expression of the histidine utilization (hut) operons. The DNA sequence of a region known to contain hutC was determined and shown to contain two long rightward-reading open reading frames (ORFs). One of these ORFs was identified as the 3' portion of the hutG gene. The other ORF was the hutC gene. The repressor predicted from the hutC sequence contained a helix-turn-helix motif strongly similar to that seen in other DNA-binding proteins, such as lac repressor and the catabolite gene activator protein. This motif was located in the N-terminal portion of the protein, and this portion of the protein seemed to be sufficient to allow repression of the hutUH operon but insufficient to allow interaction with the inducer. The presence of a promoterlike sequence and a ribosome-binding site immediately upstream of the hutC gene explained the earlier observation that hutC can be transcribed independently of the other hut operon genes. The predicted amino acid sequence of hut repressor strongly resembled that of the corresponding protein from Pseudomonas putida (S. L. Allison and A. T. Phillips, J. Bacteriol. 172:5470-5476, 1990). An unexpected, leftward-reading ORF extending from about the middle of hutC into the preceding (hutG) gene was also detected. The deduced amino acid sequence of this leftward ORF was quite distinct from that of an unexpected ORF of similar size found immediately downstream of the P. putida hutC gene. The nonstandard codon usage of this leftward ORF and the expression of repressor activity from plasmids with deletions in this region made it unlikely that this ORF was necessary for repressor activity.
TI  - Electroporation and expression of plasmid pBR322 in Klebsiella aerogenes NCTC 418 and plasmid pRK2501 in Pseudomonas putida CYM 318.
AB  - Klebsiella aerogenes NCTC 418 and Pseudomonas putida CYM 318 were transformed via high-voltage electroporation with plasmids pBR322 and pRK2501, respectively. The number of transformants obtained was dependent on the applied voltage, capacitance, and cell recovery procedure. For example, 7.87 x 10(4) transformants/micrograms DNA were obtained at 2500 V, 25 muF when K. aerogenes cells were electroporated with pBR322 DNA. A lower voltage (1500) and capacitance (3 muF) yielded 2.4 x 10(3) transformants/micrograms DNA. P. putida CYM 318 required a 24 h outgrowth period to assist in the recovery of transformants containing pRK2501. Electroporation may be a useful protocol to transform bacterial strains that are not easily transformed by traditional methods.
TI  - Cloning and sequence analysis of the ntrA (rpoN) gene of Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The gene encoding a sigma factor NtrA (RpoN) was cloned from Pseudomonas putida by cross-hybridization with a probe containing a part of the corresponding Escherichia coli gene. The cloned gene complemented an ntrA mutation of E. coli in activation of xyl genes on the TOL plasmid. The predicted amino acid (aa) sequence of P. putida NtrA (497 aa; Mr 56,215) is highly homologous to NtrA proteins from Azotobacter vinelandii (81.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (52.6%), and Rhizobium meliloti (36.1%). There are two other open reading frames (ORF1, ORF3) upstream and downstream from the ntrA gene, respectively. These ntrA-flanking ORFs are also highly homologous to the corresponding ORFs of K. pneumoniae, A. vinelandii, and R. meliloti.
TI  - Mutations in genes downstream of the rpoN gene (encoding sigma 54) of Klebsiella  pneumoniae affect expression from sigma 54-dependent promoters.
AB  - Two open reading frames (ORFs), designated ORF95 and ORF162, downstream of the Klebsiella pneumoniae sigma 54 structural gene (rpoN) have been sequenced and shown to encode polypeptides of 12 kD and 16 kD, respectively. ORFs homologous to ORF95 are present downstream of four out of five rpoN genes sequenced to date from a range of Gram-negative bacteria, and ORF162 is also conserved, at least in Pseudomonas putida. Chromosomal mutations have been created in each gene using a kan cassette and both have the same phenotype, i.e. they cause an increase in the level of expression from sigma 54-dependent promoters. We propose that the products of both genes function to modulate the activity of E sigma 54, although a physiological role for these proteins has not yet been identified.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - 5-Carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenases of Escherichia coli  C and Klebsiella pneumoniae M5a1 show very high N-terminal sequence homology.
AB  - 5-Carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde (CHMS) dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli C and Klebsiella pneumoniae M5a1 have been purified and some of their properties studied. The apparent Km values for NAD and CHMS were 11.7 +/- 1.5 microM and 5.2 +/- 1.9 microM, respectively, for the K. pneumoniae enzyme, and 19.5 +/- 2.7 microM and 9.2 +/- 1.4 microM, respectively, for the E. coli enzyme. Both enzymes were optimally active at pH 7.5 in sodium phosphate buffer. They had subunit molecular weights of 52,000 (+/- 1000) and the native enzymes appeared to be dimers of identical subunits. The first 20 residues of their N-terminal amino acid sequences were 90% homologous. A degenerate oligonucleotide probe constructed to a six amino acid sequence common to both enzymes gave strong hybridization with DNA from E. coli strains B and W as well as with E. coli C and K. pneumoniae but little or no hybridization to DNA from E. coli K12 or Pseudomonas putida.
TI  - Extracellular product of Nocardia amarae induces bacterial cell flocculation.
AB  - The fact that Nocardia amarae YK1 produced a bacterial flocculation-inducing substance (designated as FIX) was discovered. FIX had a function of flocculating proliferous cells. FIX-induced flocculation was inhibited by making cells resting, but not completely by adding chloramphenicol. FIX worked widely on Gram-positive to -negative bacteria. In the presence of FIX, Achromobacter cycloclastus IAM1013, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus IAM1517, Bacillus subtilis IAM1069, Escherichia coli C600-1, E. coli IAM1239, Flavobacterium lutescens IAM1667, Klebsiella pneumoniae IAM1102, Micrococcus luteus IAM1313 and Pseudomonas putida IAM1002 formed flocs. B. cereus IAM1029, however, exhibited no flocculation.
TI  - Klebsiella pneumoniae origin of replication (oriC) is not active in Caulobacter crescentus, Pseudomonas putida, and Rhodobacter sphaeroides.
AB  - A DNA fragment carrying genes encoding the conjugal transfer system of the broad  host range plasmid RK2 was inserted into a plasmid carrying the chromosomal origin of replication (oriC) from Klebsiella pneumoniae. The resulting plasmid, pEON1, was readily transferred between gram-negative bacteria and carried two potential origins of replication: oriC and the replication origin from pBR322 (oriPBR). Although pEON1 could be transferred to Caulobacter crescentus, Pseudomonas putida, and Rhodobacter sphaeroides, pEON1 was not maintained in these strains. However, an oriC-containing plasmid was maintained in these nonenteric bacteria when an RK2 origin of replication was present on the plasmid. Thus, the inability of pEON1 to be established in a nonenteric bacterium represents a failure of oriC to function as an origin of replication rather than a toxic effect of oriC. The initiation potential of the chromosomal origin of replication from K. pneumoniae appears to be realized only in enteric bacteria.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the regulatory gene xylR of the TOL plasmid from Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the xylR gene for a transcriptional activator for the degradative pathway of aromatic hydrocarbons on the TOL plasmid from Pseudomonas putida. The 1698-bp sequence for a 566-amino acid (aa) protein (Mr 63741) was identified as the XylR-encoding sequence. Three regions in XylR show homology to Klebsiella pneumoniae NtrC and NifA, both of which are transcriptional activators for the ntr and nif genes involved in the nitrogen metabolism. The central region of XylR (aa 234-473) corresponds to the region that was proposed to interact with RNA polymerase having a sigma factor, NtrA [Drummond et al., EMBO J. 5 (1986) 441-447]. The C-terminal region (aa 515-558) has a putative DNA-binding structure. A short segment proximal to the central region (aa 211-229) is thought to be an interdomain linker. No amino acid homology was found in the N-terminal regions among these proteins. These findings suggest the interaction of XylR with an NtrA in the transcriptional activation of the degradative pathway.
TI  - Qualitative evidence for expression of Klebsiella pneumoniae nif in Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida MT20-3 carrying the Klebsiella pneumoniae nif plasmids pRD1 or pMF250 showed highly O2-sensitive aerobic acetylene reduction on low-N pyruvate or glucose agar. This finding confirms unequivocally that K. pneumoniae nif can be expressed in an obligate aerobe.
TI  - Catabolism of arginine, citrulline and ornithine by Pseudomonas and related bacteria.
AB  - The distribution of the arginine succinyltransferase pathway was examined in representative strains of Pseudomonas and related bacteria able to use arginine as the sole carbon and nitrogen source for growth. The arginine succinyltransferase pathway was induced in arginine-grown cells. The accumulation of succinylornithine following in vivo inhibition of succinylornithine transaminase activity by aminooxyacetic acid showed that this pathway is responsible for the dissimilation of the carbon skeleton of arginine. Catabolism of citrulline as a carbon source was restricted to relatively few of the organisms tested. In P. putida, P. cepacia and P. indigofera, ornithine was the main product of citrulline degradation. In most strains which possessed the arginine succinyltransferase pathway, the first step of ornithine utilization as a carbon source was the conversion of ornithine into succinylornithine through an ornithine succinyltransferase. However P. cepacia and P. putida used ornithine by a pathway which proceeded via proline as an intermediate and involved an ornithine cyclase activity.
TI  - [Ability to survive and interactions of selected bacterial species in activated carbon filters].
AB  - The survival and the interactions of selected, hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon filters was investigated. The numbers of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. putida increased in previously sterilized filters. After inoculation all bacteria (10(6] were adsorbed. During a period of 6-10 days the filter effluent contained no detectable bacteria. After that the colony numbers increased to a constant level of 10(4)-10(5) colony forming units (CFU)/ml effluent and 10(6)-10(7) CFU/g activated carbon. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis died off in the filter system. If the filters were inoculated simultaneously with two species, P. putida and P. aeruginosa remained at a constant level between 10(4) and 10(5) CFU/ml. E. coli was suppressed by P. aeruginosa and died off in the presence of P. putida. As in-vitro tests indicated, P. putida did not produce inhibitory substances against P. aeruginosa or E. coli. On the other hand, P. aeruginosa showed antagonistic activities against E. coli.
TI  - The xylS gene positive regulator of TOL plasmid pWWO: identification, sequence analysis and overproduction leading to constitutive expression of meta cleavage operon.
AB  - The Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid pWWO carries an operon that specifies a meta-cleavage pathway for the catabolism of benzoate and toluates whose transcription is positively regulated by the xylS gene product. Stimulation of transcription of the operon is thought to result from activation of this protein by pathway substrates/effectors. In the present study, overexpression of the xylS gene has led to identification of the regulator as a 33 kDa protein. Overexpression of xylS also resulted in partially constitutive, i.e. effector-independent expression of the meta-cleavage operon. Determination of the polynucleotide sequence of the xylS gene revealed amino acid sequence homology with several DNA binding proteins, particularly with the araC products of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium and with the nifA and ntrC products of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Homologous sequences were mainly located in an alpha-helix-turn-alpha-helix domain of the polypeptide. Interestingly, amino acid sequence homology was also found with sigma factors of E. coli (ntrA and htpR products) and Bacillus subtilis (spoIIG and phage SPOI Gp34 products) and other RNA polymerase core-interacting proteins, such as the E. coli nusA product.
TI  - Survival of selected bacterial species in sterilized activated carbon filters and biological activated carbon filters.
AB  - The survival of selected hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon (AC) filters on a bench scale was investigated. The results revealed that after inoculation of the test strains the previously sterilized AC absorbed all bacteria (10(6) to 10(7)). After a period of 6 to 13 days without countable bacteria in the effluent, the numbers of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas putida increased up to 10(4) to 10(5) CFU/ml of effluent and 10(6) to 10(7) CFU/g of AC. When Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis were used, no growth in filters could be observed. The numbers of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and P. putida, however, decreased immediately and showed no regrowth in nonsterile AC from a filter which had been continuously connected to running tap water for 2 months. Under these conditions an autochthonous microflora developed on the carbon surface which could be demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy and culturing methods (heterotrophic plate count). These bacteria reduced E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and P. putida densities in the effluent by a factor of more than 10(5) within 1 to 5 days. The hypothesis that antagonistic substances of the autochthonous microflora were responsible for the elimination of the artificial contamination could not be confirmed because less than 1% of the isolates of the autochthonous microflora were able to produce such substances as indicated by in vitro tests. Competition for limiting nutrients was thought to be the reason for the observed effects.
TI  - The xylABC promoter from the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid is activated by nitrogen regulatory genes in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The xylABC promoter (OP1), located on the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida contains sequences homologous to the conserved regions found in nitrogen fixation (nif) promoters and in other promoters subject to nitrogen control. XylA-lac fusions were constructed in order to monitor expression from the OP1 promoter in Escherichia coli. Transcription was activated in the presence of the heterologous regulatory genes ntrC or nifA from Klebsiella pneumoniae as well as by the homologous P. putida regulatory gene xylR. In all cases activation was also dependent on the ntrA gene, whose product has been implicated as a specific sigma factor for ntr activatable operons. The 5' ends of xylA mRNA, detected by S1 nuclease mapping of in vivo transcripts, were identical in strains containing xylR, ntrC or nifA as transcriptional activators. However, activation of the K. pneumoniae nifL or nifH promoters by xylR was not detected.
TI  - Identification of the promoter of the Pseudomonas gene coding for carboxypeptidase G2.
AB  - A 213-bp region of noncoding DNA upstream of the ATG start codon of the Pseudomonas carboxypeptidase G2 (CPG2) structural gene has been shown to contain the CPG2 promoter. The mRNA start point (+1) on the DNA sequence has been identified by mapping the 5' end of the CPG2 transcript. The identified promoter region contains a -10 region (TATAAG) that closely resembles the Escherichia coli consensus sequence (TATAAT), but has no easily recognisable -35 region. The lack of homology in the -35 region explains why this particular pseudomonad gene is poorly expressed in E. coli. Similar sequence differences may turn out to be the cause of the generally observed inefficient expression of Pseudomonas genes in E. coli. The promoter region also carries a sequence (CTGGCACTCGAATTGCT) that closely matches the consensus nif promoter sequence (CTGGPyAPyPuNNNNTTGCA) of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Rhizobium, and a similar sequence (ATGGCATGGCGGTTGCT) found in the promoter region of the xylABC operon of the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida.
TI  - Transposon Tn5 encodes streptomycin resistance in nonenteric bacteria.
AB  - Strains of Caulobacter crescentus, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Rhizobium meliloti, and Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides carrying the kanamycin resistance-encoding transposon Tn5 were 15 to 500 times more resistant to streptomycin than transposon-free strains. The streptomycin resistance determinant, which is separable from the kanamycin resistance determinant of Tn5, was not expressed in Escherichia coli or Klebsiella aerogenes.
TI  - D-Malic enzyme of Pseudomonas fluorescens.
AB  - By the enrichment culture technique 14 gram-negative bacteria and two yeast strains were isolated that used D(+)-malic acid as sole carbon source. The bacteria were identified as Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella aerogenes. In cell-free extracts of P. fluorescens and P. putida the presence of malate dehydrogenase, D-malic enzyme (NAD-dependent) and L-malic enzyme (NADP-dependent) was demonstrated. D-Malic enzyme from P. fluorescens was purified. Stabilization of the enzyme by 50 mM ammonium sulphate an 1 mM EDTA was essential. Preparation of D-malic enzyme that gave one band with disc gel electrophoresis showed a specific activity of 4-5 U/mg. D-Malic enzyme requires divalent cations. The Km values were for malate Km = 0.3 mM and for NAD Km = 0.08 mM. The pH optimum for the reaction was found to be in the range of pH 8.1 to pH 8.8. D-Malic enzyme is partially inhibited by oxaloacetic acid, meso-tartaric acid, D-lactic acid and ATP. Determined by gel filtration and gradient gel electrophoresis, the molecular weight was approximately 175 000.
TI  - Transfer of nitrogen fixation genes into Pseudomonas putida isolated from Finnish tundra soil.
AB  - The plasmid pRD1 containing the nif genes from Klebsiella pneumoniae was transferred by conjugation from Escherichia coli to Pseudomonas putida isolated from the tundra soil. 6-Cyanopurine, acetylene reduction and immunological tests showed that the nif genes were not expressed in P. putida. Existence of the nif genes in P. putida transconjugants was detected by transferring them to E. coli C600, which does not fix nitrogen. Existence of the nif genes in E. coli C600 transconjugants was detected immunologically and by acetylene reduction tests.
TI  - Purification of glutamine synthetase from a variety of bacteria.
AB  - We have developed two procedures which allow the very rapid purification of glutamine synthetase (GS) from a diverse variety of bacteria. The first procedure, based upon differential sedimentation, depends upon the association of GS with deoxyribonucleic acid in cell extracts. The second procedure, derived from the method of C. Gross et al (J. Bacteriol. 128:382-389, 1976) for purifying ribonucleic acid polymerase by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation, enabled us to obtain high yields of GS from either small or large quantities of cells. We used the PEG procedure to purify GS from Klebsiella aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Rhizobium sp. strain 32H1, R. meliloti, Azotobacter vinelandii, Pseudomonas putida, Caulobacter crescentus, and Rhodopseudomonas capsulata. The purity of the GS obtained, judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was high, and in many instances only a single protein band was detected.
TI  - Host factor for coliphage Q beta RNA replication: presence in procaryotes and association with the 30S ribosomal subunit in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The Host Factor required for in vitro coliphage Q beta RNA replication, a heat-stable RNA binding protein present in uninfected Escherichia coli, has been detected by both immunological and functional tests in Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. It was not detectable by these criteria in Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, Caulobacter crescentus, Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Rhodopseudomonas capsulata or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In Escherichia coli the Host Factor protein has been shown to be associated with ribosomes. It is demonstrated here that this association is specific for the 30S ribosomal subunit.
TI  - New mechanisms for the biosynthesis and metabolism of 2-keto-L-gulonic acid in bacteria.
AB  - L-Sorbose is oxidized to 2-keto-L-gulonic acid (KGA) via the following sequence of reactions which we call the "sorbosone pathway": L-sorbose in equilibrium L-sorbosone leads to KGA. The first step is reversible and is mediated by enzymes found in a soluble fraction obtained from Pseudomonas putida ATCC 21812. Although no cofactor requirements were found for the forward reaction, the reverse reaction clearly required NADH. Enzymes for this NADH-dependent synthesis of L-sorbose could be differentiated on the basis of molecular weights. The second step in the sorbosone pathway is catalyzed by a particulate enzyme found in extracts from P. putida and Gluconobacter melanogenus IFO 3293. The rate limiting reaction in the sorbosone pathway is the synthesis of L-sorbosone. In addition to P. putida, Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 27858) and Serratia marcescens (ATCC 27857) also contain the enzymes which catalyze the reactions of the sorbosone pathway. Two of the bacteria studied, P. putida and G. melanogenus, also contain an enzyme involved in the further metabolism of KGA to L-idonic acid. This enzyme, referred to as KGA-reductase, is found in the soluble fraction of cell-free extracts and is dependent on NADH or NADPH.
