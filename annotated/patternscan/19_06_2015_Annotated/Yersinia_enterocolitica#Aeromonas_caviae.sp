TI  == aerobic bacterial microbiota isolated from the cloaca of the european pond turtle (emys orbicularis) in poland.
AB  == we conducted a comparative analysis of the aerobic cloacal bacteria of european pond turtles (emys orbicularis) living in their natural environment and juvenile  turtles reared under controlled conditions in a breeding center. we included 130  turtles in the study. the aerobic bacteria isolated from the cloaca of the juvenile turtles were less diverse and more prevalent than the bacteria isolated  from free-living adults. we isolated 17 bacterial species from juvenile captive turtles, among which the dominant species were cellulomonas flavigena (77/96), enterococcus faecalis (96/96), escherichia coli (58/96), and proteus mirabilis (41/96). from the adult, free-living turtles, we isolated 36 bacterial species, some of which are a potential threat to public health (e.g., salmonella enterica  serovars newport, daytona, and braenderup; listeria monocytogenes; yersinia enterocolitica; yersinia ruckeri; klebsiella pneumoniae; vibrio fluvialis; and serratia marcescens), and pathogens that are etiologic agents of diseases of ectothermic animals (e.g., aeromonas sobria, aeromonas caviae, hafnia alvei, edwardsiella tarda, and citrobacter braakii; the last two species were isolated from both groups of animals). the cloacal bacterial biota of the european pond turtle was characterized by numerous species of bacteria, and its composition varied with turtle age and environmental conditions. the small number of isolated bacteria that are potential human pathogens may indicate that the european pond turtle is of relatively minor importance as a threat to public health.

TI  == [etiological aspects of acute gastroenteritis--a ten-year review (1.01. 2001-31.12.2010)].
AB  == acute gastroentritis is one of the most common diseases in humans, and continues  to be a significant cause of morbidity worldwide. aims: to determine the bacterial pathogens associated with gastroenteritis in patients admitted to the iasi infectious diseases hospital in the last ten years. material and methods: a  total of 40481 stool samples were examined using conventional methods. results: bacteria were found in 7.36% of cases, and parasites in 9.64%; 83% of the cases were viral, micotic, or disbiotic. the bacterial etiology was dominated by salmonella spp. (58.34%), shigella spp. (27.08%), yersinia enterocolitica 03 (8.53%), campylobacter spp. (1.31%), other bacterial pathogens (epec, aeromonas hydrophilla/caviae/sobria, plesiomonas shigelloides, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, etc) being detected in 3.74% of the cases. of the salmonella species, group b (51.99%) followed by group d (45.23%) were most common. shigella sonnei and shigella flexneri were found in almost the same proportion (49.45% and 49.70%, respectively); shigella boydii was isolated in only 0.85% of cases. the trend of gastroenteritis caused by bacterial pathogens is decreasing: from 355 cases in 2001 to 105 cases in 2010; three peaks have been recorded in 2002, 2005 (when salmonella typhi was isolated in a patient), and 2008 (469, 409, and 252 cases, respectively). bacterial gastroenteritis affected  both sexes almost equally (122 males and 118 females). the most affected age groups were: 0 - 4 years, 15 - 24 years, 5 - 14 years and 25 - 39 years. conclusions: laboratory investigations are essential in determining the etiology  of gastroenteritis. its unpredictable incidence justifies the human and material  efforts aimed at controlling the spread of potentially epidemic acute gastroenteritis.

TI  == rabbit meat as a source of bacterial foodborne pathogens.
AB  == even though worldwide production of rabbit meat is >1,000,000 tons, little information is available for rabbit meat microbiology. this study provides data on the prevalence of salmonella, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, listeria spp., motile aeromonas spp., and staphylococcus aureus on rabbit meat. a total of 24 rabbit carcasses from two abattoirs and 27 rabbit meat packages from supermarket displays were examined. in addition to culturing methods, associated virulence genes were investigated by pcr in suspect isolates  and samples. neither salmonella nor e. coli o157:h7 was detected. all samples were negative for virulence-associated inva, stx1, and stx2 genes. at one abattoir, two carcasses (3.9%) carried y. enterocolitica yst-, and two were positive for the yst gene, although viable y. enterocolitica cells were not recovered from these samples. seven samples (13.7%) were contaminated with listeria. of them, three were positive for hly and iap genes (listeria monocytogenes hly+ / iap+), two carried listeria seeligeri, one carried listeria  ivanovii, and one carried listeria innocua. for detectable motile aeromonas spp.  (average count, 1.77 +/- 0.62 log cfu/g), the contamination rate was 35.3%, although ca. 90% of the samples were positive for the aera and/or hlya genes. the majority of aeromonad isolates were aeromonas hydrophila aera+ / hlya+. aeromonas caviae, aeromonas popoffii, aeromonas schubertii, and the two biovars of aeromonas veronii were also isolated. the prevalence of s. aureus contamination (average count, 1.37 +/- 0.79 log cfu/g) was 52.9%. among 27 s. aureus isolates,  two harbored genes for staphylococcal enterotoxin b (seb), and two harbored genes for staphylococcal enterotoxin c (sec). the remaining isolates were negative for  sea, seb, sec, sed, and see.

TI  == survey for psychrotrophic bacterial pathogens in minimally processed lettuce.
AB  == a total of 120 minimally processed, cut and packaged lettuce samples were purchased from retail supermarkets or provided by a salad production facility over an 8-month period. the samples were tested for total aerobic plate counts and for the presence of potentially pathogenic species belonging to the genera of listeria, aeromonas and yersinia. the aerobic plate counts ranged from 103 to 109 colony forming units (cfu) g-1. most samples (76%) contained between 105 and 107  cfu g-1 total aerobic bacteria. listeria monocytogenes was isolated from three samples, aeromonas hydrophila or aeromonas caviae from 66 samples, and yersinia enterocolitica from 71 samples. the pathogenic potential of y. enterocolitica isolates was determined by screening for an array of biochemical, serological and genetic traits (heat-stable enterotoxin gene, the attachment and invasion gene locus, the invasin gene locus and the virulence plasmid). the y. enterocolitica isolates lacked many of the phenotypic and genetic markers associated with virulence in primary pathogenic strains. as the roles of the reputed virulence factors of aeromonas spp. in human infection are uncertain, the pathogenic potential of the aeromonas isolates in lettuce remains unclear.

TI  == some emerging food and water borne pathogens.
AB  == emerging pathogens are those infective organisms whose incidence has recently increased or is likely to increase during the next two decades due to changes in  demography, food habits, food technology, commerce, water sources and environmental factors. some important emerging food and water borne bacterial pathogens include listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli o157: h7, vibrio cholerae biotype e1 tor serotype 0139, vibrio parahaemolyticus and aeromonas hydrophila, a. sobria, and a. caviae. the prevalence, ecological relationships of these organisms, their transmission through food, water and other environmental sources, and role of their virulent factors in the pathogenesis of infections and their public health significance is discussed in this paper with special reference to the situation in india.

TI  == [sensitivity of enteropathogenic bacteria to furazolidone].
AB  == the sensitivity in vitro of 348 strains of 18 enteropathogen agents to furazolidone was investigated during the period of 1987-1989. all strains of shigella sonnei (17), s. flexneri (17), s. boydii (16), escherichia coli enteropathogen (40), e. coli enteroinvasive (20), campylobacter jejuni (50), vibrio cholerae 01 (5), vibrio cholerae non 01 (5), v. parahaemolyticus (5), v. alginolyticus (2), aeromonas hydrophila (5), a. caviae (5), a. sobria (5), and plesiomonas shigelloides (12) were sensitive (mic < or = 8 mg/l), except a strains of e. coli enteropathogen (mic 16 mg/l). the 15.5% of the 51 strains of salmonella enterica belonging to the type i isolated between 1987 and 1989 were resistant (mic > or = 16 mg/l). a similar degree of resistance was observed in 20 strains of this agent isolated between 1978 and 1980. the 30 strains of yersinia  (including 15 strains of y. enterocolitica 03) presented extreme values of mics of 8 and 16 mg/l.
