TI  == feed fermentation with reuteran- and levan-producing lactobacillus reuteri reduces colonization of weanling pigs with enterotoxigenic escherichia coli.
AB  == this study determined the effect of feed fermentation with lactobacillus reuteri  on growth performance and abundance of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) in weanling piglets. l. reuteri strains produced reuteran or levan, exopolysaccharides that inhibit etec adhesion to the mucosa, and feed fermentation was conducted to support exopolysaccharide formation, or not. diets  were chosen to assess the impact of organic acids, and the impact of viable l. reuteri. fecal samples were taken throughout three weeks of feeding; at the end of the 21 d feeding period, animals were euthanized to sample gut digesta. the feed intake was reduced in pigs fed diets containing exopolysaccharides; however, feed efficiency did not differ among diets. quantification of l. reuteri by qpcr  detected the two strains used for feed fermentation throughout the intestinal tract. quantification of e. coli and etec virulence factors by qpcr demonstrated  that fermented diets containing reuteran significantly (0.05) reduced fecal e. coli and fecal gene copy numbers of the heat stable enterotoxin when compared to  the control diet. any fermented feed significantly (p<0.05) reduced the abundance of e. coli and the heat stable enterotoxin in colonic digesta at 21d; reuteran containing diets reduced gene copy numbers of e. coli and the heat stable enterotoxin below the detection limit in samples from the ileum, the caecum, and  the colon. in conclusion, feed fermentation with l. reuteri reduced colonization  of weaning piglets with etec, and feed fermentation supplied concentrations of reuteran that may specifically contribute to the effect on etec.

TI  == characterization of the 4,6-alpha-glucanotransferase gtfb enzyme of lactobacillus reuteri 121 isolated from inclusion bodies.
AB  == background: the gtfb enzyme of the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus reuteri 121  is a 4,6-alpha-glucanotransferase of glycoside hydrolase family 70 (gh70; http://www.cazy.org ). contrary to the glucansucrases in gh70, gtfb is unable to  use sucrose as substrate, but instead converts malto-oligosaccharides and starch  into isomalto-/malto- polymers that may find application as prebiotics and dietary fibers. the gtfb enzyme expresses well in escherichia coli bl21 star (de3), but mostly accumulates in inclusion bodies (ibs) which generally contain wrongly folded protein and inactive enzyme. methods: denaturation followed by refolding, as well as ncib preparation were used for isolation of active gtfb protein from inclusion bodies. soluble, refolded and ncib gtfb were compared using activity assays, secondary structure analysis by ft-ir, and product analyses by nmr, hpaec and sec. results: expression of gtfb in e. coli yielded >  100 mg/l relatively pure and active but mostly insoluble gtfb protein in ibs, regardless of the expression conditions used. following denaturing, refolding of  gtfb protein was most efficient in double distilled h2o. also, gtfb ncibs were active, with approx. 10 % of hydrolysis activity compared to the soluble protein. when expressed as units of activity obtained per liter e. coli culture, the total amount of ncib gtfb expressed possessed around 180 % hydrolysis activity and 100  % transferase activity compared to the amount of soluble gtfb enzyme obtained from one liter culture. the product profiles obtained for the three gtfb enzyme preparations were similar when analyzed by hpaec and nmr. sec investigation also  showed that these 3 enzyme preparations yielded products with similar size distributions. ft-ir analysis revealed extended beta-sheet formation in ncib gtfb providing an explanation at the molecular level for reduced gtfb activity in ncibs. the thermostability of ncib gtfb was relatively high compared to the soluble and refolded gtfb. conclusion: in view of their relatively high yield, activity and high thermostability, both refolded and ncib gtfb derived from ibs in e. coli may find industrial application in the synthesis of modified starches.

TI  == the production of omega-hydroxy palmitic acid using fatty acid metabolism and cofactor optimization in escherichia coli.
AB  == hydroxylated fatty acids (hfas) are used as important precursors for bulk and fine chemicals in the chemical industry. here, to overproduce long-chain (c16-c18) fatty acids and hydroxy fatty acid, their biosynthetic pathways including thioesterase (lreu_0335) from lactobacillus reuteri dsm20016, beta-hydroxyacyl-acp dehydratase (fabz) from escherichia coli, and a p450 system  (i.e., cyp153a from marinobacter aquaeolei vt8 and cama/camb from pseudomonas putida atcc17453) were overexpressed. acyl-coa synthase (fadd) involved in fatty  acid degradation by beta-oxidation was also deleted in e. coli bw25113. the engineered e. coli ffa4 strain without the p450 system could produce 503.0 mg/l of palmitic (c16) and 508.4 mg/l of stearic (c18) acids, of which the amounts are ca. 1.6- and 2.3-fold higher than those of the wild type. on the other hand, the  e. coli hfa4 strain including the p450 system for omega-hydroxylation could produce 211.7 mg/l of omega-hydroxy palmitic acid, which was 42.1 +/- 0.1 % of the generated palmitic acid, indicating that the hydroxylation reaction was the rate-determining step for the hfa production. for the maximum production of omega-hydroxy palmitic acid, nadh, i.e., an essential cofactor for p450 reaction, was overproduced by the integration of nad+-dependent formate dehydrogenase (fdh) from candida boidinii into e. coli chromosome and the deletion of alcohol dehydrogenase (adh). finally, the nadh-level-optimized e. coli strain produced 610 mg/l of omega-hydroxy palmitic acid (omega-hpa), which was almost a threefold increase in its yield compared to the same strain without nadh overproduction.

TI  == a novel method for screening of potential probiotics for high adhesion capability.
AB  == to screen for potential probiotics with high adhesion capability, a chemostat model-based cultured human feces and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis methods were applied, and the adhesion capability of the isolates was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. lactobacillus plantarum (hm218749), lactobacillus reuteri (eu547310), and enterococcus faecalis (hm218543) were isolated from the slime on  the chemostat wall, as these organisms could grow better at 37 degrees c in an anaerobic environment and could resist harsh conditions (ph 1.5 and 0.30% bile salt). lactobacillus plantarum, l. reuteri, and e. faecalis could adhere to ht-29 cells and reduce the adhesion of shigella dysenteriae 2457, staphylococcus cowan1, enterobacter sakazakii 45401, and escherichia coli 44102 to ht-29 cells.  moreover, the animal experiment showed that l. plantarum could adhere to mice intestine, increasing the number of lactobacilli and decreasing the number of enterococci.

TI  == effects of lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus reuteri on gut barrier function and heat shock proteins in intestinal porcine epithelial cells.
AB  == heat shock proteins (hsps) are a set of highly conserved proteins that can serve  as intestinal gate keepers in gut homeostasis. here, effects of a probiotic, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), and two novel porcine isolates, lactobacillus johnsonii strain p47-hy and lactobacillus reuteri strain p43-huv, on cytoprotective hsp expression and gut barrier function, were investigated in a porcine ipec-j2 intestinal epithelial cell line model. the ipec-j2 cells polarized on a permeable filter exhibited villus-like cell phenotype with development of apical microvilli. western blot analysis detected hsp expression in ipec-j2 and revealed that l. johnsonii and l. reuteri strains were able to significantly induce hsp27, despite high basal expression in ipec-j2, whereas lgg did not. for hsp72, only the supernatant of l. reuteri induced the expression, which was comparable to the heat shock treatment, which indicated that hsp72 expression was more stimulus specific. the protective effect of lactobacilli was  further studied in ipec-j2 under an enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) challenge. etec caused intestinal barrier destruction, as reflected by loss of cell-cell contact, reduced ipec-j2 cell viability and transepithelial electrical  resistance, and disruption of tight junction protein zonula occludens-1. in contrast, the l. reuteri treatment substantially counteracted these detrimental effects and preserved the barrier function. l. johnsonii and lgg also achieved barrier protection, partly by directly inhibiting etec attachment. together, the  results indicate that specific strains of lactobacillus can enhance gut barrier function through cytoprotective hsp induction and fortify the cell protection against etec challenge through tight junction protein modulation and direct interaction with pathogens.

TI  == one-step high-efficiency crispr/cas9-mediated genome editing in streptomyces.
AB  == the rna-guided dna editing technology crisprs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/cas9 had been used to introduce double-stranded breaks into genomes and to direct subsequent site-specific insertions/deletions or the replacement of genetic material in bacteria, such as escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumonia, and lactobacillus reuteri. in this study, we established a high-efficiency crispr/cas9 genome editing plasmid pkccas9do for use in streptomyces genetic manipulation, which comprises a target-specific guide rna, a codon-optimized cas9, and two homology-directed repair templates. by delivering pkccas9do series editing plasmids into the model strain streptomyces coelicolor m145, through one-step intergeneric transfer, we achieved the genome editing at different levels with high efficiencies of 60%-100%, including single gene deletion, such as actii-orf4, redd, and glnr, and single large-size gene cluster  deletion, such as the antibiotic biosynthetic clusters of actinorhodin (act) (21.3 kb), undecylprodigiosin (red) (31.6 kb), and ca(2+)-dependent antibiotic (82.8 kb). furthermore, we also realized simultaneous deletions of actii-orf4 and redd, and of the act and red biosynthetic gene clusters with high efficiencies of 54% and 45%, respectively. finally, we applied this system to introduce nucleotide point mutations into the rpsl gene, which conferred the mutants with resistance to streptomycin. notably, using this system, the time required for one round of genome modification is reduced by one-third or one-half of those for conventional methods. these results clearly indicate that the established crispr/cas9 genome editing system substantially improves the genome editing efficiency compared with the currently existing methods in streptomyces, and it has promise for application to genome modification in other actinomyces species.

TI  == probiotics and gut health in infants: a preliminary case-control observational study about early treatment with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938.
AB  == aims: we performed this case-control observational study to evaluate the effects  of early administration of lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 on microbial composition in infants' gastrointestinal tract. methods: early fecal microbiota composition was analyzed by using selective and differential cultural methods. genomic dna from positive escherichia coli and cronobacter sakazakii colonies was extracted and dna was processed by multiplex pcr assay. results: fecal samples of 30 hospitalized infants who previously received probiotics and 30 not receiving probiotics were analyzed. we find that the two groups showed differences in gut microbial strains composition and richness. infant treated with probiotics have a lower total anaerobic gram negative counts (p=0.03) and a higher total anaerobic  gram-positive counts (p=0.02). enterobacteriaceae and enterococci were significantly higher (p=0.04) in the control group. no significant differences were observed for total aerobic counts, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. c. sakazaki was found only in one infant recruited in the control group. infants not previously treated with probiotics showed a higher colonization by diarrheagenic  e. coli (epec) (p=0.04). conclusions: our findings enhanced our understanding of  the effects of probiotics on gut health in pediatric subjects. early administration of l. reuteri in infancy could improve gut health by reducing pathogens colonization.

TI  == production of 3-hydroxypropionic acid from 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde by recombinant escherichia coli co-expressing lactobacillus reuteri propanediol utilization enzymes.
AB  == 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-hp) is an important platform chemical for the biobased chemical industry. lactobacillus reuteri produces 3-hp from glycerol via 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-hpa) through a coa-dependent propanediol utilization  (pdu) pathway. this study was performed to verify and evaluate the pathway comprising propionaldehyde dehydrogenase (pdup), phosphotransacylase (pdul), and  propionate kinase (pduw) for formation of 3-hp from 3-hpa. the pathway was confirmed using recombinant escherichia coli co-expressing pdup, pdul and pduw of l. reuteri dsm 20016 and mutants lacking expression of either enzyme. growing and resting cells of the recombinant strain produced 3-hp with a yield of 0.3mol/mol  and 1mol/mol, respectively, from 3-hpa. 3-hp was the sole product with resting cells, while growing cells produced 1,3-propanediol as co-product. 3-hp production from glycerol was achieved with a yield of 0.68mol/mol by feeding recombinant e. coli with 3-hpa produced by l. reuteri and recovered using bisulfite-functionalized resin.

TI  == efficient poly(3-hydroxypropionate) production from glycerol using lactobacillus  reuteri and recombinant escherichia coli harboring l. reuteri propionaldehyde dehydrogenase and chromobacterium sp. pha synthase genes.
AB  == poly(3-hydroxypropionate), p(3hp), is a polymer combining good biodegradability with favorable material properties. in the present study, a production system for p(3hp) was designed, comprising conversion of glycerol to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3hpa) as equilibrium mixture with 3hpa-hydrate and -dimer in aqueous system (reuterin) using resting cells of native lactobacillus reuteri in a first stage followed by transformation of the 3hpa to p(3hp) using recombinant escherichia coli strain co-expressing highly active coenzyme a-acylating propionaldehyde dehydrogenase (pdup) from l. reuteri and polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase (phaccs) from chromobacterium sp. p(3hp) content of up to 40% (w/w) cell dry weight was reached, and the yield with respect to the reuterin consumed by the cells was 78%. short biotransformation period (4.5h), lack of additives or expensive cofactors, and use of a cheap medium for cultivation of the recombinant strain, provides a new efficient and potentially economical system for p(3hp) production.

TI  == effects of the probiotic enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 on selected lactic acid bacteria and enterobacteria in co-culture.
AB  == enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 is used as a probiotic for piglets and has been  shown to modify the porcine intestinal microbiota. however, the mode of action of this probiotic modification is still unclear. one possible explanation is the direct growth inhibiting or stimulating effect of the probiotic on other indigenous bacteria. therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the growth interactions of the probiotic with different indigenous porcine bacteria in vitro. reference strains were cultivated with the probiotic e. faecium strain  ncimb10415 (sf68) in a checkerboard assay with 102 to 105 cells/ml inoculum per strain. growth kinetics were recorded for 8 h and used to determine specific growth of the co-cultures. additionally, total dna was extracted from the co-cultures at the end of the incubation to verify which strain in the co-culture was affected. co-cultivation with eight enterococcus spp. tester strains showed strain-specific growth differences. three of four e. faecium strains were not influenced by the probiotic strain. pcr results showed reduced growth of the probiotic strain in co-culture with e. faecium dsm 6177. three of four enterococcus faecalis strains showed reduced specific growth in co-culture with the probiotic strain. however, e. faecalis dsm 20478 impaired growth of the probiotic e. faecium strain. the growth of lactobacillus johnsonii dsm 10533 and  lactobacillus reuteri dsm 20016 was enhanced in co-culture with the probiotic strain, but co-cultivations with lactobacillus mucosae dsm13345 or lactobacillus  amylovorus dsm10533 showed no differences. co-cultures with the probiotic e. faecium showed no impact on the growth rate of four different enterobacterial reference strains (2 strains of salmonella enterica and 2 strains of escherichia  coli), but pcr results showed reduced cell numbers for a pathogenic e. coli isolate at higher concentration of the probiotic strain. as the in vitro effect of the probiotic e. faecium on enterococci was strain specific and the growth of  certain lactobacillus spp. was enhanced by the probiotic, these results indicate  a direct effect of the probiotic on certain members of the porcine gastro intestinal microbiota.

TI  == thiouracil-forming bacteria identified and characterized upon porcine in vitro digestion of brassicaceae feed.
AB  == in recent years, the frequent detection of the banned thyreostat thiouracil (tu)  in livestock urine has been related to endogenous tu formation following digestion of glucosinolate-rich brassicaceae crops. recently, it was demonstrated that, upon in vitro digestion of brassicaceae, fecal bacteria induce tu detection in livestock (porcine livestock > bovines). therefore, the present study was intended to isolate and identify bacteria involved in this intestinal tu formation upon brassicaceae digestion and to gain more insight into the underlying mechanism in porcine livestock. twenty porcine fecal inocula (gilts and multiparous sows) were assessed through static in vitro colonic-digestion simulations with rapeseed. after derivatization and extraction of the fecal suspensions, tu was analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (lc-ms(2)). on average, lower tu concentrations were observed in fecal colonic simulations in gilts (8.35 ng g(-1) rapeseed +/- 3.42 [mean +/- standard deviation]) than in multiparous sows (52.63 ng g(-1) +/- 16.17), which correlates with maturation of the gut microbial population with age. further exploration of  the mechanism showed cell-dependent activity of the microbial conversion and sustained tu-forming activity after subjection of the fecal inoculum to moderate  heat over a time span of up to 30 min. finally, nine tu-producing bacterial species were successfully isolated and identified by a combination of biochemical and molecular techniques as escherichia coli (n = 5), lactobacillus reuteri (n =  2), enterococcus faecium (n = 1), and salmonella enterica subsp. arizonae (n = 1). this report demonstrates that endogenous formation of tu is brassicaceae induced and occurs under colonic conditions most likely through myrosinase-like enzyme activity expressed by different common intestinal bacterial species.

TI  == precision genome engineering in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == innovative new genome engineering technologies for manipulating chromosomes have  appeared in the last decade. one of these technologies, recombination mediated genetic engineering (recombineering) allows for precision dna engineering of chromosomes and plasmids in escherichia coli. single-stranded dna recombineering  (ssdr) allows for the generation of subtle mutations without the need for selection and without leaving behind any foreign dna. in this review we discuss the application of ssdr technology in lactic acid bacteria, with an emphasis on key factors that were critical to move this technology from e. coli into lactobacillus reuteri and lactococcus lactis. we also provide a blueprint for how to proceed if one is attempting to establish ssdr technology in a lactic acid bacterium. the emergence of crispr-cas technology in genome engineering and its potential application to enhancing ssdr in lactic acid bacteria is discussed. the ability to perform precision genome engineering in medically and industrially important lactic acid bacteria will allow for the genetic improvement of strains  without compromising safety.

TI  == short communication: combined antimicrobial activity of reuterin and diacetyl against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == reuterin (beta-hydroxypropionialdehyde) is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial substance produced by some strains of lactobacillus reuteri during anaerobic fermentation of glycerol. some of these strains are able to survive and produce reuterin in cheese and yogurt when added as adjuncts to the starter. similarly, in fermented dairy foods, other inhibitory compounds such as lactic acid and diacetyl are produced during fermentation. in this work, we studied the combined  effect of reuterin and diacetyl under different ph conditions against escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enteritidis, and listeria monocytogenes. results from agar spot assays showed that the antimicrobial activity of reuterin-producing strains against the gram-negative bacteria tested was enhanced as the concentration of diacetyl increased to 50 mg/kg, and was higher under acidic conditions (ph 5.0) for the 3 pathogenic strains. the combination of reuterin and diacetyl had an additive effect against l. monocytogenes only at diacetyl concentrations of 50 mg/kg and ph 5.0. in addition, growth kinetics studies showed that the combination of 1 activity unit (au)/ml of reuterin with 100mg/kg  diacetyl increased the lag time of the 3 pathogens. in milk, synergistic antimicrobial activity was observed with the combination of 1 au/ml reuterin and  50 or 100 mg/kg of diacetyl on the gram-negative strains tested, and with 1 au/ml reuterin and 100 mg/kg of diacetyl on l. monocytogenes. the greatest inhibition of the 3 pathogens was achieved in acidified milk at ph 5.0 with reuterin (1 au/ml) and diacetyl (100 mg/kg). based on these results, the combination of reuterin and diacetyl in acidified dairy products could be a promising strategy to control food pathogens in these products.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of reuterin produced by lactobacillus reuteri on listeria  monocytogenes in cold-smoked salmon.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri inia p579 was used for the production and purification of reuterin. the purity of reuterin was assessed by high resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (hresims) and nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy. after purification, reuterin concentration obtained was 1.3 m. the  inhibitory activity using escherichia coli k12 as indicator strain was estimated  to be 510 au/ml. survival curves in tryptic soy broth revealed that reuterin required to inhibit the growth of three listeria monocytogenes strains was in the range of 2-4 au/ml. purified reuterin (10 au/g) significantly reduced the growth  of l. monocytogenes in cold-smoked salmon kept under moderate or strong temperature abuse conditions. after 15 d at 8 degrees c, cold-smoked salmon with  added reuterin exhibited l. monocytogenes counts 2.0 log cfu/g lower than control smoked salmon with no reuterin added. at 30 degrees c, reuterin also controlled the growth of the pathogen, with counts 1.4 and 0.9 log cfu/g lower than those observed in control smoked salmon after 24 and 48 h, respectively. the addition of purified reuterin might be used as a hurdle technology to improve the safety and extend the shelf-life of lightly preserved seafood products such as cold-smoked salmon.

TI  == coexpression and secretion of endoglucanase and phytase genes in lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == a multifunctional transgenic lactobacillus with probiotic characteristics and an  ability to degrade beta-glucan and phytic acid (phytate) was engineered to improve nutrient utilization, increase production performance and decrease digestive diseases in broiler chickens. the bacillus subtilis wl001 endoglucanase gene (celw) and aspergillus fumigatus wl002 phytase gene (phyw) mature peptide (phywm) were cloned into an expression vector with the lactate dehydrogenase promoter of lactobacillus casei and the secretion signal peptide of the lactococcus lactis usp45 gene. this construct was then transformed into lactobacillus reuteri xc1 that had been isolated from the gastrointestinal tract  of broilers. heterologous enzyme production and feed effectiveness of this genetically modified l. reuteri strain were investigated and evaluated. sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed that the molecular mass of phywm and celw was approximately 48.2 and 55 kda, respectively, consistent with their predicted molecular weights. endoglucanase and phytase activities in the extracellular fraction of the transformed l. reuteri culture were 0.68 and 0.42 u/ml, respectively. transformed l. reuteri improved the feed conversion ratio of broilers from 21 to 42 days of age and over the whole feeding period. however, there was no effect on body weight gain and feed intake of chicks. transformed l. reuteri supplementation improved levels of ash, calcium and phosphorus in tibiae at day 21 and of phosphorus at day 42. in addition, populations of escherichia coli, veillonella spp. and bacteroides vulgatus were decreased, while populations of bifidobacterium genus and lactobacillus spp. were increased in the cecum at day 21.

TI  == exopolysaccharides synthesized by lactobacillus reuteri protect against enterotoxigenic escherichia coli in piglets.
AB  == enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) is a major cause of diarrhea in piglets;  etec cells colonize the intestinal mucosa with adhesins and deliver toxins that cause fluid loss. this study determined the antiadhesive properties of bacterial  exopolysaccharides (reuteran and levan) and related glycans (dextran and inulin)  in a small intestinal segment perfusion (sisp) model. the sisp model used 10 jejunal segments from 5-week-old piglets. five segments were infected with etec expressing k88 fimbriae (etec k88), while five segments were treated with saline. every two segments (etec and non-etec infected) were infused with 65 ml of 10 g liter(-1) of glycans or saline (control) for 8 h. high-resolution melting-curve (hrm) quantitative pcr (qpcr) indicated that e. coli is the dominant bacterium in infected segments, while other bacteria were predominant in noninfected segments. infection by etec k88 was also verified by qpcr; gene copy numbers of k88 fimbriae and the heat-labile toxin (lt) in mucosal scrapings and outflow fluid of infected segments were significantly higher than those in noninfected segments. genes coding for k88 fimbriae and lt were also detected in noninfected segments.  lt amplicons from infected and noninfected segments were 99% identical over 481 bp, demonstrating the presence of autochthonous etec k88. all glycans reduced fluid loss caused by etec k88 infection. reuteran tended (p = 0.06) to decrease etec k88 levels in mucosal scraping sample, as judged by qpcr. fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that reuteran significantly (p = 0.012)  decreased levels of adherent etec k88. overall, reuteran may prevent piglet diarrhea by reducing adhesion of etec k88.

TI  == influence of bovine lactoferrin on the growth of selected probiotic bacteria under aerobic conditions.
AB  == bovine lactoferrin (blf) is a natural glycoprotein, and it shows broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. however, reports on the influences of blf on probiotic bacteria have been mixed. we examined the effects of apo-blf (between 0.25 and 128 mg/ml) on both aerobic and anaerobic cultures of probiotics. we found that blf had similar effects on the growth of probiotics under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, and that it actively and significantly (at concentrations of >0.25 mg/ml) retarded the growth rate of bifidobacterium bifidum (atcc 29521), b. longum (atcc 15707), b. lactis (bcrc 17394), b. infantis (atcc 15697), lactobacillus reuteri (atcc 23272), l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103), and l. coryniformis (atcc 25602) in a dose-dependent manner. otherwise, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were 128 or >128 mg/ml against b. bifidum, b. longum, b. lactis, l. reuteri, and l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103). with regard to mics, blf showed at least four-fold lower inhibitory effect on probiotics than on pathogens. intriguingly, blf (>0.25 mg/ml) significantly enhanced the growth of rhamnosus (atcc 7469) and l. acidophilus (bcrc 14065) by approximately 40-200 %,  during their late periods of growth. supernatants produced from aerobic but not anaerobic cultures of l. acidophilus reduced the growth of escherichia coli by about 20 %. thus, blf displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the growth  of most probiotic strains under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. an antibacterial supernatant prepared from the aerobic cultures may have significant practical use.

TI  == treating infant colic with the probiotic lactobacillus reuteri: double blind, placebo controlled randomised trial.
AB  == objective: to determine whether the probiotic lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 reduces crying or fussing in a broad community based sample of breastfed infants  and formula fed infants with colic aged less than 3 months. design: double blind, placebo controlled randomised trial. setting: community based sample (primary and secondary level care centres) in melbourne, australia. participants: 167 breastfed infants or formula fed infants aged less than 3 months meeting wessel's criteria for crying or fussing: 85 were randomised to receive probiotic and 82 to receive placebo. interventions: oral daily l reuteri (1 x 10(8) colony forming units) versus placebo for one month. main outcomes measures: the primary outcome  was daily duration of cry or fuss at 1 month. secondary outcomes were duration of cry or fuss; number of cry or fuss episodes; sleep duration of infant at 7, 14, and 21 days, and 1 and 6 months; maternal mental health (edinburgh postnatal depression subscale); family functioning (paediatric quality of life inventory),  parent quality adjusted life years (assessment of quality of life) at 1 and 6 months; infant functioning (paediatric quality of life inventory) at 6 months; infant faecal microbiota (microbial diversity, colonisation with escherichia coli), and calprotectin levels at 1 month. in intention to treat analyses the two groups were compared using regression models adjusted for potential confounders.  results: of 167 infants randomised from august 2011 to august 2012, 127 (76%) were retained to primary outcome; of these, a subset was analysed for faecal microbial diversity, e coli colonisation, and calprotectin levels. adherence was  high. mean daily cry or fuss time fell steadily in both groups. at 1 month, the probiotic group cried or fussed 49 minutes more than the placebo group (95% confidence interval 8 to 90 minutes, p=0.02); this mainly reflected more fussing, especially for formula fed infants. the groups were similar on all secondary outcomes. no study related adverse events occurred. conclusions: l reuteri dsm 17938 did not benefit a community sample of breastfed infants and formula fed infants with colic. these findings differ from previous smaller trials of selected populations and do not support a general recommendation for the use of probiotics to treat colic in infants. trial registration: current controlled trials isrctn95287767.

AB  == doxycycline has been proposed for the treatment of malnourished children in developing countries, and its use has been associated with weight gain in healthy volunteers. no previous studies have assessed abnormal weight gain as a putative  side effect of long-term doxycycline treatment; thus, the objective of the present study was to characterize this phenomenon. we also analyzed the role of the gut microbiota in this effect. we assessed changes in the body mass index in  q fever endocarditis patients treated with doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine and healthy individuals with no antibiotic treatment. abnormal weight gain was defined as a gain in weight above that of the controls. the fecal samples were examined using molecular assays for methanobrevibacter smithii, bacteroidetes, firmicutes, escherichia coli, lactobacillus, lactobacillus reuteri, and total bacterial concentrations. we examined 82 patients, including 48 patients with q fever endocarditis and 34 controls. approximately 23% of the treated patients showed abnormal weight gain (p = 0.001). patients treated with doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine presented significantly lower concentrations of bacteroidetes  (p = 0.002), firmicutes (p = 0.01), and lactobacillus (p = 0.02). the linear regression analysis revealed that the duration of treatment was significantly associated with a decrease in bacteroidetes (p = 0.0001), firmicutes (p = 0.002), and total bacteria (p < 0.00001). abnormal weight gain is a side effect of long-term doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine treatment. gut microbiota modifications at the phylum level could play an instrumental role in this effect. we highlight the need for specific nutritional care in patients undergoing long-term antibiotic treatment, particularly treatment involving the use of doxycycline.

TI  == investigation into in vitro and in vivo models using intestinal epithelial ipec-j2 cells and caenorhabditis elegans for selecting probiotic candidates to control porcine enterotoxigenic escherichia coli.
AB  == aims: to identify a fast, economic and reliable method for preselecting lactic acid-producing bacterial (lab) isolates to control enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec). methods and results: two assays with porcine intestinal epithelial ipec-j2 cells or caenorhabditis elegans for selecting effective probiotic candidates were compared. both assays were based on measuring death of cells or worms caused by etec strain jg280. six of 13 lab isolates showed >/=50% protection in each assay, among which only four isolates (>/=50% protection) were consistently selected by both assays. isolate cl9 (lactobacillus reuteri) was further studied. it reduced gene expression of esta, estb and elt in jg280 in both assays. furthermore, the isolate protected ipec-j2 and c. elegans from cell  and worm death caused by sta, stb or lt enterotoxin expressed in e. coli dh5alpha. cl9 also promoted host defensive responses by decreasing il-8 and increasing il-10 production in ipec-j2 cells and expression of antimicrobial peptide genes clec-60, clec-85 in c. elegans. conclusions: caenorhabditis elegans is useful for preselecting probiotic candidates to control etec after initial screening with ipec-j2 cells. significance and impact of the study: a combination of ipec-j2 cell and c. elegans assays can improve the effectiveness in preselecting probiotic candidates.

TI  == l-arabinose isomerase and d-xylose isomerase from lactobacillus reuteri: characterization, coexpression in the food grade host lactobacillus plantarum, and application in the conversion of d-galactose and d-glucose.
AB  == the l-arabinose isomerase (l-ai) and the d-xylose isomerase (d-xi) encoding genes from lactobacillus reuteri (dsmz 17509) were cloned and overexpressed in escherichia coli bl21 (de3). the proteins were purified to homogeneity by one-step affinity chromatography and characterized biochemically. l-ai displayed  maximum activity at 65 degrees c and ph 6.0, whereas d-xi showed maximum activity at 65 degrees c and ph 5.0. both enzymes require divalent metal ions. the genes were also ligated into the inducible lactobacillal expression vectors psip409 and psip609, the latter containing a food grade auxotrophy marker instead of an antibiotic resistance marker, and the l-ai- and d-xi-encoding sequences/genes were coexpressed in the food grade host lactobacillus plantarum . the recombinant enzymes were tested for applications in carbohydrate conversion reactions of industrial relevance. the purified l-ai converted d-galactose to d-tagatose with  a maximum conversion rate of 35%, and the d-xi isomerized d-glucose to d-fructose with a maximum conversion rate of 48% at 60 degrees c.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the safety and probiotic properties of lactobacilli isolated from chicken and calves.
AB  == a total of 73 chicken and calves isolates were diagnosed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms). after a preliminary subtractive screening based on the high acid tolerance at ph  2.5 and bile resistance at 0.3% oxgall, twenty isolates belonging to the species  lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus agilis, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus murinus and lactobacillus amylovorus were in vitro screened for the safety assessment and probiotic properties, including antibiotics susceptibility  patterns, biochemical activity and potential for competitive exclusion of biofilm producing pathogens determined by crystal violet and/or quantitative fluorescent  in situ hybridisation (fish) assays utilizing 5'cy 3 labelled probe enter1432 for enteric group. antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed according to the iso norm 10932. the sixteen strains were susceptible to certain antimicrobial agents, except for two chicken (l. salivarius 12k, l. agilis 13k) and two calves  (l. reuteri l10/1, l. murinus l9) isolates with the presence non wild-type ecoffs (epidemiological cut-off) for gentamicin (>/=256 mug ml(-1)), tetracycline (>/=128 mug ml(-1)), kanamycin (>/=256 mug ml(-1)) and streptomycin (>/=96 mug ml(-1)). the two referenced chicken isolates gave positive aac(6')ie-aph(2'')ia and tet(l) pcr results. the wild-type ecoffs isolates were subjected to the apizym analysis for enzyme profile evaluation and amino acid decarboxylase activities determined by qualitative plate method and multiplex pcr for the detection of four genes involved in the production of histamine (histidine decarboxylase, hdc), tyramine (tyrosine decarboxylase, tyrdc) and putrescine (via eithers ornithine decarboxylase, odc, or agmatine deiminase, agdi). from examined strains only two chicken isolates (l. reuteri 14k; l. salivarius 15k) had no harmful beta-glucuronidase, beta-glucosidase activities connected with detrimental effects in the gastrointestinal tract and together no amino acid decarboxylase activities and no genes associated with biogenic amines production  though only chicken l. salivarius 15k whole cells and acid supernatants shown strong suppressive potential against biofilm-forming klebsiella and escherichia coli. our results highlight that above-mentioned isolate l. salivarius 15k fulfils the principle requirements of a qualified probiotic and may be seen as a  reliable candidate for further validation studies in chicken.

TI  == lactobacillus reuteri and escherichia coli in the human gut microbiota may predict weight gain associated with vancomycin treatment.
AB  == background: antibiotics, used for 60 years to promote weight gain in animals, have been linked to obesity in adults and in children when administered during early infancy. lactobacillus reuteri has been linked to obesity and weight gain in children affected with kwashiorkor using ready-to-use therapeutic food. in contrast, escherichia coli has been linked with the absence of obesity. both of these bacteria are resistant to vancomycin. objectives and methods: we assessed vancomycin-associated weight and gut microbiota changes, and tested whether bacterial species previously linked with body mass index (bmi) predict weight gain at 1 year. all endocarditis patients treated with vancomycin or amoxicillin  in our center were included from january 2008 to december 2010. bacteroidetes, firmicutes, lactobacillus and methanobrevibacter smithii were quantified using real-time pcr on samples obtained during the 4-6 weeks antibiotic regimen. l. reuteri, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, bifidobacterium animalis and e. coli were quantified on stool samples obtained during the first week of antibiotics. results: of the193 patients included in the study, 102 were treated with vancomycin and 91 with amoxicillin. vancomycin was associated with a 10% bmi increase (odds ratio (or) 14.1; 95% confidence interval (ci; 1.03-194); p=0.047)  and acquired obesity (4/41 versus 0/56, p=0.01). in patients treated with vancomycin, firmicutes, bacteroidetes and lactobacillus increased, whereas m. smithii decreased (p<0.05). the absence of e. coli was an independent predictor of weight gain (or=10.7; 95% ci (1.4-82.0); p=0.02). strikingly, a patient with an 18% bmi increase showed a dramatic increase of l. reuteri but no increase of e. coli. conclusion: the acquired obesity observed in patients treated with vancomycin may be related to a modulation of the gut microbiota rather than a direct antibiotic effect. l. reuteri, which is resistant to vancomycin and produces broad bacteriocins, may have an instrumental role in this effect.

TI  == coenzyme a-acylating propionaldehyde dehydrogenase (pdup) from lactobacillus reuteri: kinetic characterization and molecular modeling.
AB  == 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-hp), an important c3 chemical for a bio-based industry, is natively produced by lactobacillus reuteri from glycerol. conversion of glycerol occurs via the intermediate 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-hpa), followed by an atp-producing pathway initiated by the coa-acylating propionaldehyde dehydrogenase (pdup). the pdup gene of l. reuteri was cloned and  expressed in escherichia coli and the recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity for characterization of its activity and properties. kinetic studies  with propionaldehyde as substrate showed a maximum specific activity of 28.9 u/mg, which is 80-fold higher than that reported previously. maximum activity of  18 u/mg was obtained at 3-hpa concentration of 7 mm, above which substrate inhibition was observed. substrate inhibition was also seen with coenzyme a at a  concentration above 0.5mm and with nadp(+) above 9 mm. a structure of pdup is proposed based on homology modeling. in silico docking of the co-factors coenzyme a and nad(+), respectively, showed a common binding site consisting of amino acids thr145, ile275, cys277 and ser417, which through site-directed mutagenesis  to alanine and kinetic studies, were confirmed as essential for the catalytic activity of pdup.

TI  == supplementation of direct-fed microbials as an alternative to antibiotic on growth performance, immune response, cecal microbial population, and ileal morphology of broiler chickens.
AB  == an experiment was conducted to investigate the supplementation of direct-fed microbials (dfm) as an alternative to antibiotics on growth performance, immune response, cecal microbial population, and ileal morphology of broiler chickens. a total of 800 one-day-old male broiler chicks (ross x ross) were randomly allotted to 4 dietary treatments with 4 replicate pens per treatment (50 birds/replicate pen). the 4 dietary treatments fed for 35 d were a corn-soybean meal basal diet (control); control plus 0.1% virginiamycin, as an antibiotic growth promoter (agp); control plus 0.1% direct-fed microbials that contained lactobacillus reuteri (dfm 1); and control plus 0.1% direct-fed microbials that contained a mixture of l. reuteri, bacillus subtilis, and saccharomyces cerevisiae (dfm 2). results showed that dietary agp and dfm supplementation significantly increased (p < 0.05) the bw gain of broilers during 0 to 21 d. the feed intake was reduced, whereas the feed conversion was improved significantly when birds were fed dfm 2  at 0 to 7 d of age. the white blood cell and monocyte levels were significantly higher in the dfm 2 group compared with the control. in addition, feeding dfm significantly (p < 0.05) increased the plasma immunoglobulin levels where a higher level was observed in dfm 2 compared with those of the other treatments. neither dfm nor agp treatments affected the cecal lactobacillus and salmonella content; however, cecal escherichia coli content significantly decreased in broiler chickens fed dfm and agp. the ileal villus height, and width and total thickness of muscularis externa were significantly increased when birds were fed  dfm compared with agp and control. these results indicate that the dietary supplementation of dfm increases the growth performance of birds at an early age, stimulates the immune response, decreases the number of e. coli, and improves the ileal morphology of broiler chickens. thus, dfm that contained a mixture of several beneficial microorganisms could be a viable alternative to antibiotics in the broiler diets.

TI  == adhesive ability means inhibition activities for lactobacillus against pathogens  and s-layer protein plays an important role in adhesion.
AB  == eighty-five strains of lactobacillus were isolated from the pig intestine and identified by sequencing analysis based on 16s rrna gene, from which five lactobacillus strains with high adhesive ability were selected. the inhibition ability of the five lactobacillus strains with or without s-layer proteins against adherence of escherichia coli k88 and salmonella enteritidis 50335 to caco-2 was evaluated in vitro with lactobacillus rhamnosus gg strain (lgg) as a positive control. in addition, tolerance of lactobacilli to heat, acid, bile, zn(2+) and cu(2+) were assessed. all five selected strains, lactobacillus salivarius zj614 (jn981856), lactobacillus reuteri zj616 (jn981858), l. reuteri zj617 (jn981859), l. reuteri zj621 (jn981863) and l. reuteri zj623 (jn981865), showed inhibition against the two pathogens, e. coli k88 and s. enteritidis 50335. l. reuteri zj621 showed higher inhibition ability than the others to s. enteritidis 50335 (p < 0.05). sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) analysis indicated that all five strains had abundant  bands with molecular weight ranging from 34 to 130 kda as well as had a common band of approximately 42 kda. after treatment with 5 m licl to remove s-layer protein, the inhibition activities of the lactobacilli against pathogens decreased significantly (p < 0.05). the results showed that higher adhesive ability means higher inhibition activity for lactobacillus against pathogen, in which s-layer proteins plays an important role.

TI  == in vitro assessment of functional properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from faecal microbiota of healthy dogs for potential use as probiotics.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified in the faeces of chinese crested and yorkshire terrier pups and their probiotic features were investigated in vitro. thirty seven isolates were identified as lactobacillus or enterococcus. out of these isolates, 31 were lactic acid bacteria (lab) and belonged to the species lactobacillus reuteri (16/37; 43.3%), lactobacillus animalis (7/37; 18.9%), lactobacillus acidophilus (3/37; 8.1%), lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (2/37; 5.4%), lactobacillus murinus (2/37; 5.4%), and lactobacillus paraplantarum (1/37; 2.7%), while six other lab isolates were enterococcus spp. (6/37; 16.2%).  strains were tested for resistance to gastric acidity (ph 2.5 for 3 h) and bile salts (0.3% ox gall), cell surface hydrophobicity by microbial adhesion to solvents, antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes), production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotic susceptibility. thirty four strains were highly resistant to acidic conditions with slight (18 strains) to moderate (16 strains) growth inhibition by bile salts. seven isolates had highly hydrophobic cellular surfaces and 28 strains exhibited strong antagonism against the bacterial pathogens tested, although 8 isolates tested against leptospira interrogans had no effect on pathogen growth. all isolates produced low rates of  hydrogen peroxide. based on these results, two lactobacillus strains showed promising probiotic-related features and merit investigation as probiotics for dogs.

TI  == correlation between body mass index and gut concentrations of lactobacillus reuteri, bifidobacterium animalis, methanobrevibacter smithii and escherichia coli.
AB  == background: genus and species level analysis is the best way to characterize alterations in the human gut microbiota that are associated with obesity, because the clustering of obese and lean microbiotas increases with the taxonomic depth of the analysis. bifidobacterium genus members have been associated with a lean status, whereas different lactobacillus species are associated both with a lean and an obese status. objectives and methods: we analyzed the fecal concentrations of bacteroidetes, firmicutes, methanobrevibacter smithii, the genus lactobacillus, five other lactobacillus species previously linked with lean or obese populations, escherichia coli and bifidobacterium animalis in 263 individuals, including 134 obese, 38 overweight, 76 lean and 15 anorexic subjects to test for the correlation between bacterial concentration and body mass index (bmi). of these subjects, 137 were used in our previous study. findings: firmicutes were found in >98.5%, bacteroidetes in 67%, m. smithii in 64%, e. coli in 51%, lactobacillus species between 17 and 25% and b. animalis in 11% of individuals. the fecal concentration of lactobacillus reuteri was positively correlated with bmi (coefficient=0.85; 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.12-0.58; p=0.02) in agreement with what was reported for lactobacillus sakei. as reported, b. animalis (coefficient=-0.84; 95% ci -1.61 to -0.07; p=0.03) and m. smithii (coefficient=-0.43, 95% ci -0.90 to 0.05; p=0.08) were negatively associated with the bmi. unexpectedly, e. coli was found here for the first time to negatively correlate with the bmi (coefficient=-1.05; 95% ci -1.60 to -0.50; p<0.001). conclusion: our findings confirm the specificity of the obese microbiota and emphasize the correlation between the concentration of certain lactobacillus species and obesity.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == differences in tlr9-dependent inhibitory effects of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and nf-kappa b/i kappa b-alpha system activation by genomic dna from five lactobacillus species.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) show anti-inflammatory effects, and their genomic dna  was identified as one of the anti-inflammatory components. despite the differences in anti-inflammatory effects between live lab dependent not only on genus but also species, this effect has not been compared at the genomic dna level. we compared the anti-inflammatory effects of the genomic dna from five lactobacillus species-lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus reuteri-using caco-2 cells. to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects, decreases in h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation were examined. all lab genomic dnas dose-dependently decreased h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibited h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation. comparison of these effects between lactobacillus species showed that the anti-inflammatory effects of l. acidophilus genomic dna are lower than those of the other species. furthermore, suppression of toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9), a specific receptor of bacterial dna, expression by rnai abolished the decrease of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation by lab genomic dna. our results demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effects of genomic dna differ between lactobacillus species and tlr9 is one of the major pathways responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of lab genomic dna.

TI  == characterization of a small cryptic plasmid pk50-2 isolated from lactobacillus reuteri k50.
AB  == the complete nucleotide sequence of a cryptic plasmid, pk50-2, from lactobacillus reuteri k50 had been determined. it consisted of an 1866 bp circular molecule with a g+c content of 35%, from which two putative open reading frames (orfs) could be predicted. based on sequence similarity, the orf1 was not homologous to  any known protein, while the n-terminus of the orf2 shared 56% and 64% identities with repb proteins of plasmid par141 and an unnamed plasmid in l. reuteri strain  pa-16, members of the rolling-circle replication (rcr) pmv158 family, respectively. downstream of orf2, a sequence containing two conserved regions (i.e., bind and nick), possibly involved in the binding and nicking of rep protein, similar to the dso (double strand origin) of rcr-pmv158 family was also  identified. furthermore, a sequence capable of forming the characteristic secondary structure of ssot (single-strand origin type t) was subsequently determined upstream of the orf2 gene. thus, the three elements essential for a rcr plasmid (i.e., dso, sso, and rep gene) were all deducible in the pk50-2. noteworthy was that a conserved alpha helix-turn-alpha helix (hth) motif, thus far only seen in theta-type plasmids, was for the first time identified in rep protein of rcr plasmid, pk50-2. to estimate the pk50-2 could be an expression vector to deliver exogenous antigens, a shuttle vector pk50-s containing both pk50-2 and pue80 (-) was used to analyze the segregational stability and copy-number, which were shown that pk50-s in l. reuteri dsm 20016 were estimated  to be 98%, 77%, and 75% after 36, 72, and 100 generations and about 50 copies per chromosome equivalent by real-time pcr.

TI  == effects of potato fiber and potato-resistant starch on biomarkers of colonic health in rats fed diets containing red meat.
AB  == the effects of red meat consumption with and without fermentable carbohydrates on indices of large bowel health in rats were examined. sprague-dawley rats were fed cellulose, potato fiber, or potato-resistant starch diets containing 12% casein for 2 wk, then similar diets containing 25% cooked beef for 6 wk. after week 8, cecal and colonic microbiota composition, fermentation end-products, colon structure, and colonocyte dna damage were analyzed. rats fed potato fiber had lower bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas group compared to other diet groups. colonic bifidobacterium spp. and/or lactobacillus spp. were higher in potato fiber and potato-resistant starch diets than in the cellulose diet. beneficial changes were observed in short-chain fatty acid concentrations (acetic, butyric,  and propionic acids) in rats fed potato fiber compared with rats fed cellulose. phenol and p-cresol concentrations were lower in the cecum and colon of rats fed  potato fiber. an increase in goblet cells per crypt and longer crypts were found  in the colon of rats fed potato fiber and potato-resistant starch diets. fermentable carbohydrates had no effect on colonic dna damage. dietary combinations of red meat with potato fiber or potato-resistant starch have distinctive effects in the large bowel. future studies are essential to examine the efficacy of different types of nondigestible carbohydrates in maintaining colonic health during long-term consumption of high-protein diets. practical application: improved understanding of interactions between the food consumed and gut microbiota provides knowledge needed to make healthier food choices for large bowel health. the impact of red meat on large bowel health may be ameliorated by  consuming with fermentable dietary fiber, a colonic energy source that produces less harmful by-products than the microbial breakdown of colonic protein for energy. developing functional red meat products with fermentable dietary fiber could be one way to promote a healthy and balanced macronutrient diet.

AB  == this study examined the effects of three lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains on the nematode caenorhabditis elegans. lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, and pediococcus acidilactici were found to inhibit the development and growth of the worm. compared to escherichia coli used as the control, l. reuteri  and p. acidilactici reduced the lifespan of wild-type and short-lived daf-16 worms. on the contrary, l. salivarius extended the lifespan of daf-16 worms when  used live, but reduced it as uv-killed bacteria. the three lab induced the expression of genes involved in pathogen response and inhibited the growth of tumor-like germ cells, without affecting daf16 localization or increasing corpse  cells. our results suggest the possible use of c. elegans as a model for studying the antitumor attributes of lab. the negative effects of these lab strains on the nematode also indicate their potential use against parasitic nematodes.

AB  == modulation of the immune response is an established feature of certain lactobacilli. cxcl8 is an inflammatory chemokine released by the urinary tract mucosa after contact with uropathogenic escherichia coli during urinary tract infection and is crucial for proper infiltration of immune cells. nevertheless, persistently high levels of cxcl8 are associated with pathogenicity and malignancy. in this study, we tested twelve lactobacillus strains for their ability to influence cxcl8 release from urothelial cells. we evaluated how strains from different lactobacillus species could regulate cxcl8 in human 5637 urothelial cells, either resting cells or cells concomitantly challenged with heat-killed e. coli. a majority of the tested species altered cxcl8 release from  the urothelial cells after 24 hours of stimulation. most species increased cxcl8  release, whereas a few lactobacilli efficiently suppressed cxcl8 secretion from e. coli-challenged cells. while strong cxcl8 modulators such as lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus delbrueckii were unable to degrade cxcl8 in the extracellular environment, effects on il8 transcription were evident for selected lactobacilli. although il8 transcription was affected by lactobacilli, the influence on mrna transcript did not correlate to the impact on cxcl8 release. phylogenetic analysis based on a 16s rrna dendrogram of the tested lactobacilli and their effect on cxcl8 revealed some linkage to specific lactobacillus groups. testing the immunomodulatory nature of lactobacilli can prove important when selecting new probiotic microbes. moreover, we believe that phylogenetic and phenotypic similarities could be used to analyse the traits governing such modulation.

TI  == functional properties of free and encapsulated lactobacillus reuteri dpc16 during and after passage through a simulated gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri dpc16 is a probiotic bacterium that has strong antimicrobial activities on pathogens, mainly due to its ability to produce reuterin, an antimicrobial compound. the objective of this study was to examine the ability of an encapsulation technique to protect the functional properties of cells of l. reuteri dpc16 during passage through a simulated gi tract. the functional properties of the cells were studied before and after passage through  the tract. an alginate-skim milk encapsulation system was used to deliver the probiotic bacterium through the simulated gi tract, allowing for the release of the cells into the simulated colonic fluid. the cells were then isolated and cultured. the recovered cells showed no diminution in functional properties, including their growth kinetics, ability to adhere to epithelial cells and ability to inhibit the adhesion of e. coli to epithelial cells. the bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of the recovered cells against some pathogens were significantly greater (p < 0.05) than those of the original cells. production of reuterin by the recovered cells was significantly greater than that of the original cells when cultured in mrs medium in the absence of its metabolic precursor, glycerol. the results demonstrate significant consequences for the application of the encapsulation technique to protect and/or enhance the functional properties of the probiotic cells.

TI  == lactobacilli vs antibiotics to prevent urinary tract infections: a randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trial in postmenopausal women.
AB  == background: growing antibiotic resistance warrants studying nonantibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent urinary tract infections (utis). use of lactobacilli appears to be promising. methods: between january 2005 and august 2007, we randomized 252 postmenopausal women with recurrent utis taking part in a double-blind noninferiority trial to receive 12 months of prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 480 mg, once daily or oral capsules containing 109 colony-forming units of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 twice daily. primary end points were the mean number of symptomatic utis, proportion of participants with at least 1 uti during 12 months, time to first uti, and development of antibiotic resistance by escherichia coli. results: the mean number of symptomatic utis in the year preceding randomization was 7.0 in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group and 6.8 in the lactobacilli group. in the intention-to-treat analysis, after 12 months of prophylaxis, these numbers were 2.9 and 3.3, respectively. the between-treatment difference of 0.4 utis per year  (95% ci, -0.4 to 1.5) was outside our noninferiority margin. at least 1 symptomatic uti occurred in 69.3% and 79.1% of the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  and lactobacilli participants, respectively; median times to the first uti were 6 and 3 months, respectively. after 1 month of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis, resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and amoxicillin had increased from approximately 20% to 40% to approximately 80% to 95% in e coli from the feces and urine of asymptomatic women and among e coli causing a uti. during the 3 months after trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole discontinuation, resistance levels gradually decreased. resistance did not increase during lactobacilli prophylaxis. conclusions: in postmenopausal women with recurrent utis, l rhamnosus gr-1 and l reuteri rc-14 do not meet the noninferiority criteria in the prevention of utis when compared with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. however, unlike trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, lactobacilli do not increase antibiotic resistance. trial registration isrctn.org identifier: isrctn50717094.

TI  == exploring optimization parameters to increase ssdna recombineering in lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == single-stranded dna (ssdna) recombineering is a technology which is used to make  subtle changes in the chromosome of several bacterial genera. cells which express a single-stranded dna binding protein (rect or bet) are transformed with an oligonucleotide which is incorporated via an annealing and replication-dependent  mechanism. by in silico analysis we identified ssdna binding protein homologs in  the genus lactobacillus and lactococcus lactis. to assess whether we could further improve the recombineering efficiency in lactobacillus reuteri atcc pta 6475 we expressed several rect homologs in this strain. rect derived from enterococcus faecalis crmen 19 yielded comparable efficiencies compared with a native rect protein, but none of the other proteins further increased the recombineering efficiency. we successfully improved recombineering efficiency 10-fold in l. lactis by increasing oligonucleotide concentration combined with the use of oligonucleotides containing phosphorothioate-linkages (ptos). surprisingly, neither increased oligonucleotide concentration nor pto linkages enhanced recombineering in l. reuteri 6475. to emphasize the utility of this technology in improving probiotic features we modified six bases in a transcriptional regulatory element region of the pdu-operon of l. reuteri 6475, yielding a 3-fold increase in the production of the antimicrobial compound reuterin. directed genetic modification of lactic acid bacteria through ssdna recombineering will simplify strain improvement in a way that, when mutating a single base, is genetically indistinguishable from strains obtained through directed evolution.

TI  == isolation and identification of new lactobacilli from goatling stomach and investigation of reuterin production in lactobacillus reuteri strains.
AB  == five new strains of lactobacilli isolated from goatling's stomach were identified by molecular-biological approaches. profiles of fermentable saccharides, gram staining, and cell morphology were also determined. they were identified as lactobacillus reuteri (strains ko4b, ko4m, ko5) and as lactobacillus plantarum (strains kg1z, kg4). in dna samples of all newly isolated l. reuteri strains as well as in l. reuteri e (lreu e; originated from lamb), the part of gldc gene, coding large subunit of glycerol dehydratase, that is necessary for 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-hpa; reuterin) production, was amplified using two designed primer sets. however, the 3-hpa production was revealed only in the strain lreu e. it produced five- or ten-fold lower amount of 3-hpa in comparison  with probiotic l. reuteri atcc 55730 in aerobic or anaerobic conditions, respectively. moreover, lreu e completely lost its production ability after ca. five passages in mrs medium. the co-incubation of lreu e, but not other l. reuteri isolates, with escherichia coli re-induced 3-hpa production. in the case  of l. reuteri atcc 55730, the 3-hpa production increased more than four times after co-incubation with e. coli.

TI  == inhibitory potential of lactobacilli against escherichia coli internalization by  ht 29 cells.
AB  == a quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization method was employed to evaluate  the competitive inhibitory effect of three lactobacillus strains (lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus plantarum) against escherichia  coli internalization in a model system of ht 29 cells. furthermore, aggregation and adhesion abilities of the lactobacillus strains were examined. all lactobacilli were able to attach to the ht 29 cells and aggregate with pathogens; however, the adhesion and aggregation degree was strain-dependent. l. reuteri possessed a high capacity of adhesion (6.80 +/- 0.63; log cfu +/- sem per well),  whereas lower capacities were expressed by l. gasseri (4.52 +/- 0.55) and l. plantarum (4.90 +/- 0.98). additionally, l. reuteri showed the rapid or normal ability to aggregate with selected e. coli in comparison with remaining two lactobacilli, which showed only slow or negative aggregative reaction. internalization of e. coli into the cell lines was markedly suppressed by l. reuteri, while l. gasseri and l. plantarum caused only a minimum anti-invasion effect. the fact that l. reuteri in our experiments showed an outstanding potential for adhering to the colon epithelial cell line, compared with the rest  strains, suggested that one of the possible mechanisms of preventing pathogen adhesion and invasion is simple competitions at certain receptors and capability  to block receptor binding sites, or that an avid interaction between l. reuteri and the host cell might be modulating intracellular events responsible for the e. coli internalization. moreover, l. reuteri exhibited a strong ability to aggregate with e. coli, which could be another limiting factor of pathogen invasion.

TI  == high efficiency recombineering in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the ability to efficiently generate targeted point mutations in the chromosome without the need for antibiotics, or other means of selection, is a powerful strategy for genome engineering. although oligonucleotide-mediated recombineering (ssdna recombineering) has been utilized in escherichia coli for over a decade, the successful adaptation of ssdna recombineering to gram-positive bacteria has not been reported. here we describe the development and application of ssdna recombineering in lactic acid bacteria. mutations were incorporated in the chromosome of lactobacillus reuteri and lactococcus lactis without selection at frequencies ranging between 0.4% and 19%. whole genome sequence analysis showed that ssdna recombineering is specific and not hypermutagenic. to highlight the utility of ssdna recombineering we reduced the intrinsic vancomymycin resistance  of l. reuteri >100-fold. by creating a single amino acid change in the d-ala-d-ala ligase enzyme we reduced the minimum inhibitory concentration for vancomycin from >256 to 1.5 microg/ml, well below the clinically relevant minimum inhibitory concentration. recombineering thus allows high efficiency mutagenesis  in lactobacilli and lactococci, and may be used to further enhance beneficial properties and safety of strains used in medicine and industry. we expect that this work will serve as a blueprint for the adaptation of ssdna recombineering to other gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == structural characterization of linear isomalto-/malto-oligomer products synthesized by the novel gtfb 4,6-alpha-glucanotransferase enzyme from lactobacillus reuteri 121.
AB  == recently, a novel glucansucrase (gs)-like gene (gtfb) was isolated from the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus reuteri 121 and expressed in escherichia coli.  the purified recombinant gtfb enzyme was characterized and turned out to be inactive with sucrose, the natural gs substrate. instead, gtfb acted on malto-oligosaccharides (moss), thereby yielding elongated gluco-oligomers/polymers containing besides (alpha1 --> 4) also (alpha1 --> 6) glycosidic linkages, and it was classified as a 4,6-alpha-glucanotransferase. to  gain more insight into its reaction specificity, incubations of the gtfb enzyme with a series of moss and their corresponding alditols [degree of polymerization, dp2(-ol)-dp7(-ol)] were carried out, and (purified) products were structurally analyzed with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and one-/two-dimensional (1)h and (13)c nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. with each of the tested malto-oligomers, the gtfb enzyme yielded series of novel linear isomalto-/malto-oligomers, in the case of dp7 up to dp >35.

AB  == the pcb42 plasmid from leuconostoc citreum cb2567, a strain isolated from kimchi, was characterized, and a shuttle vector for escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (lab) was constructed. the pcb42 plasmid has a circular structure of 4312bp, a low g+c content, and no single-stranded dna intermediates during replication, which indicates that pcb42 replicates via the theta-type replication mechanism. in silico analysis of this plasmid revealed 6 open reading frames: 1 transposase gene, 1 dna-binding gene, 2 putative replication genes, and 2 unknown genes. the fragment encompassing orf5 contains a functional plasmid replicon. this plasmid was capable of replicating in various lab, including l. citreum, l.  mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, lb. reuteri, lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, weissella confusa, and oenococcus oeni. the lab-e. coli shuttle vector was constructed by ligating pcb42 and pek104, and the resulting shuttle vector, pleucm42, showed a high segregational stability in l. citreum cb2567 after 100 generations of cell division. by using this shuttle vector, the beta-gal gene from lb. plantarum was successfully expressed in the host strain, l. citreum cb2567. the pleucm42 shuttle vector can serve as a useful gene-delivery and expression tool for the genetic study or metabolic engineering  of various strains of lab.

TI  == glycerol conversion to 1, 3-propanediol is enhanced by the expression of a heterologous alcohol dehydrogenase gene in lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == in this work, lactobacillus reuteri has been metabolically engineered for improving 1, 3-propanediol (1, 3-pd) production by the expression of an escherichia coli alcohol dehydrogenase, yqhd, that is known to efficiently convert the precursor 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-hpa) to 1, 3-pd. the engineered strain exhibited significantly altered formation rates for the product and other  metabolites during the fermentation. an increase in the 1, 3-pd specific productivity of 34% and molar yield by 13% was achieved in the clone, relative to the native strain. a concomitant decrease in the levels of toxic intermediate, 3-hpa, was observed, with the specific productivity levels being 25% lesser than  that of the native strain. interestingly, the recombinant strain exhibited elevated rates of lactate and ethanol formation as well as reduced rate of acetate production, compared to the native strain. the preferential utilization of nadph by yqhd with a possible decrease in the native 1, 3-pd oxidoreductase (nadh-dependent) activity, could have resulted in the diversion of surplus nadh towards increased lactate and ethanol productivities.

TI  == structure-function relationships of the antibacterial activity of phenolic acids  and their metabolism by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: to determine structure-function relationships of antibacterial phenolic acids and their metabolites produced by lactic acid bacteria (lab). methods and results: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 6 hydroxybenzoic and 6 hydroxycinnamic acids were determined with lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus hammesii, escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis as indicator strains. the antibacterial activity of phenolic acids increased at lower ph. a decreasing number of hydroxyl groups enhanced the activity of hydroxybenzoic acids, but had  minor effects on hydroxycinnamic acids. substitution of hydroxyl groups with methoxy groups increased the activity of hydroxybenzoic, but not of hydroxycinnamic, acid. metabolism of chlorogenic, caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, protocatechuic or p-hydroxybenzoic acids by l. plantarum, l. hammesii, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus reuteri was analysed by lc-dad-ms. furthermore, mics of substrates and metabolites were compared. decarboxylated and/or reduced metabolites of phenolic acids had a lower activity than the substrates. strain-specific metabolism of phenolic acids generally corresponded to resistance. conclusions: the influence of lipophilicity on the antibacterial activity of hydroxybenzoic acids is stronger than that of hydroxycinnamic acids.  metabolism of phenolic acids by lab detoxifies phenolic acids. significance and impact of the study: results allow the targeted selection of plant extracts for food preservation, and selection of starter cultures for fermented products.

AB  == lactobacillus reuteri atcc 55730 (l. reuteri atcc 55730) and l. reuteri l22 were  studied for their probiotic potential. these two strains were able to produce an  antimicrobial substance, termed reuterin, the maximum production of reuterin by these two strains was detected in the late logarithmic growth phase (16 h in mrs  and 20 h in lb broths). these two strains could significantly reduce the growth of salmonella pullorum atcc 9120 in mrs broth, l. reuteri atcc 55730 with a reduction of 48.2+/-4.15% (in 5 log) and 89.7+/-2.59% (in 4 log) respectively, at the same time, l. reuteri l22 was 69.4+/-3.48% (in 5 log) and 80.4+/-3.22% respectively. l. reuteri atcc 55730 was active against the majority of the pathogenic species, including s. pullorum atcc 9120 and escherichia coli o(78), while l. reuteri l22 was not as effective as l. reuteri atcc 55730. the two potential strains were found to survive variably at ph 2.5 and were unaffected by bile salts, while neither of the strains was haemolytic. moreover, l. reuteri atcc 55730 exhibited variable susceptibility towards commonly used antibiotics; but l. reuteri l22 showed resistant to most antibiotics in this study. l. reuteri atcc 55730 consequently was found to significantly increase survival rate in a salmonella-induced pullorum disease model in chick. to conclude, strain l. reuteri atcc 55730 possesses desirable probiotic properties, such as antimicrobial activity and immunomodulation in vitro, which were confirmed in vivo by the use of animal models.

TI  == expression of integrins and toll-like receptors in cervical cancer: effect of infectious agents.
AB  == we hypothesized that development of cervical cancer is associated with alterations in the expression of innate immune receptors, i.e. integrins and tlrs, and that these alterations can be induced by infectious agents. we have studied the expression of these proteins in cervical biopsy tissues and cervical  cancer-derived cell lines hela, caski, siha, c-33 a, and me180. immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated an increase in integrin alphav, beta3, beta4, and beta6 expression in the epithelium during the development of cervical  cancer. a clear trend towards higher expression of integrin beta6 in cell lines harbouring human papillomavirus (hpv) genetic material, compared to hpv-negative  c-33 a, was observed. to investigate whether bacterial infection can alter the expression of tlrs and integrins, we infected hela cells by two pathogens, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, using a common bacterium of the female genital tract, lactobacillus reuteri, as a control. infection with e. coli or p. aeruginosa, but not with l. reuteri, significantly altered the expression of tlr and integrins, particularly of tlr4 and integrin beta6. considering that both integrin beta6 and tlr4 play important roles in tumorigenesis, our data suggest that bacterial infection may trigger cancer development in hpv-infected cervical epithelium.

TI  == probiotic lactobacillus reuteri ameliorates disease due to enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli in germfree mice.
AB  == strains of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) are a group of shiga toxin-producing food-borne pathogens that cause severe hemorrhagic colitis and can lead to hemolytic-uremic syndrome (hus), a life-threatening condition that principally affects children and for which there is no effective treatment. we used a germfree mouse model of renal and enteric disease due to ehec to determine if probiotic lactobacillus reuteri atcc pta 6475 is effective in suppressing disease symptoms caused by ehec. when germfree swiss webster mice are monocolonized with ehec, they develop disease characterized by weight loss, cecal luminal fluid accumulation, and renal tubular necrosis. when l. reuteri was administered 1 day prior to ehec challenge and every other day thereafter, ehec colonization was suppressed and mice were significantly protected from the manifestations of disease. protection from disease did not require the induction  of the antimicrobial compound reuterin in l. reuteri prior to treatment. the twice-daily administration of l. reuteri appeared more effective than every-other-day administration. these data indicated that l. reuteri partially protects mice from disease manifestations of ehec.

TI  == unraveling the hydroxypropionaldehyde (hpa) system: an active antimicrobial agent against human pathogens.
AB  == the hydroxypropionaldehyde (hpa) system is a natural defense system synthesized by the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus reuteri. to elucidate which of the molecules composing the hpa system (3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-hpa), reuterin (hpa dimer), and hpa hydrate) is responsible for the potent antimicrobial activity in biological systems, a combination of biochemical, genetic, and proteomic assays was used. the hpa system reacts with sulfhydryl-containing compounds such as cysteine and reduced glutathione (gsh) in solution. in situ, gsh knock-out escherichia coli is significantly more susceptible to hpa-mediated  cell death than e. coli wild type; gsh supplementation protects either bacteria from hpa attack. proteomic analysis of hpa-treated bacteria ( haemophilus influenzae ) revealed induction of redox- and heat shock-related proteins. a new  antimicrobial mechanism of hpa is proposed, whereby the activity of hpa leads to  depletion of free sh- groups in gsh and proteins through the action of 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde, causing an imbalance of the cellular redox status, ultimately resulting in cell death.

AB  == plaa-som is a thai fermented fish prepared from freshwater fish and various ingredients. in this study, two strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from natural plaa-som fermentation were used as starter cultures: lactobacillus plantarum ifrpd p15 and lactobacillus reuteri ifrpd p17. these strains were used  as a mixed starter culture for plaa-som using an air-drying method (laminar airflow) with sterilized rice grains as the filler. this method produced a suitable starter culture, which was maintained at 4 degrees c for more than 20 weeks. lab were the dominant bacteria in the starter culture and produced high acidity from 24h until the end of fermentation. this resulted in decreased ph in  plaa-som. l. plantarum ifrpd p15 was dominant as an acidity producer, whereas l.  reuteri ifrpd p17 showed an ability to suppress and eliminate pathogenic bacteria such as escherichia coli within 24h. the use of a single starter culture for plaa-som resulted in incomplete suppression of pathogenic bacteria and elimination of e. coli. thus, l. plantarum ifrpd p15 and l. reuteri ifrpd p17 have great potential for use as a mixed starter culture in plaa-som fermentation  and may possibly help to reduce fermentation time.

TI  == effect of size, quaternary structure and translational error on the static and dynamic heterogeneity of beta-galactosidase and measurement of electrophoretic dynamic heterogeneity.
AB  == single enzyme molecule assays were performed using capillary electrophoresis-based protocols on beta-galactosidase from lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus helveticus and bacillus circulans. the enzyme was found to show static heterogeneity with respect to catalytic rate and the variance in rate increased with protein size. this is consistent with the proposal that random errors in translation may be an important underlying component of enzyme heterogeneity. additionally these enzymes were found to show static heterogeneity with respect to electrophoretic mobility. comparison of wild-type and rpsl e. coli beta-galactosidase expressed in the presence and absence of streptomycin suggested that increases in error do  not result in detectable increases in the dynamic heterogeneity of activity with  increasing temperature. finally, a method was developed to measure the dynamic heterogeneity in electrophoretic mobility.

TI  == [cloning and expression of lactobaceillus reuteri glycerol dehydratase gene in escherichia coil].
AB  == there is growing interest in biodiesel and this results in the accumulation of glycerol. the exploitation and application of glycerol has attracted more and more attention. in the current study, glycerol was biotransformed to produce 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde by genetic engineering bacteria. it is known that 3-hydroxypopionaldehyde has been widely used as an important intermediate for chemicals, effective antimicrobial agent, and fix agent for tissues. a pair of primers was designed on the basis of the sequence of both nh2-terminus and the amino acid sequence of glycerol dehydratase reported by ncbi, and a fragment about 1.6 kb was obtained by pcr amplification using the total genome dna of lactobacillus reuteri as template, then the fragment was cloned to the pmd18-t vector and sequenced. two specific primers were designed according to the obtained sequence, and a fragment with length of 1674 bp was amplified using pcr  with these two specific primers. consequently, the resulting products were digested with ecor i and hind iii and ligated using t4 dna ligase to the pet28b vector digested with the same enzymes. the recombinant plasmid, named pet28b-dhab, was transformed into e. coli bl21. the positive clones were induced  with iptg and the expression products were further analyzed by sds-page, indicating that protein with a molecule weight of around 65 kd was obtained. furthermore, the glycerol dehydratase activity was evaluated and compared with the wild type strain as well.

TI  == lactobacillus by-products inhibit the growth and virulence of uropathogenic escherichia coli.
AB  == uropathogenic strains of escherichia coli (upec) can colonize the vagina and cause infections within the entire urogenital tract, including those associated with urinary tract devices. lactobacilli typically dominate the vaginal microbiota in healthy women, and studies have shown that they can inhibit upec growth and vaginal colonization. however, little is known regarding the mechanisms behind these effects. using a luciferase-based reporter construct, gradients of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide and spent culture supernatants (scs)  from urogenital probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14 were examined for their effects on growth and virulence factor expression in upec isolate c1212. in a dose- and ph- dependent manner, lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide and lactobacillus scs all strongly inhibited upec c1212 growth and increased the promoter activity of outer membrane proteins (omps) a and x, two porins normally upregulated in response to upec membrane stress. lactic acid and  the culture supernatants also downregulated the promoter activity of the major subunits of type 1 and p fimbriae, critical adherence factors within the urogenital tract. our findings indicate that compounds secreted by lactobacilli likely protect the urogenital tract from upec colonization and infection by inhibiting growth, inducing stress and downregulating proteins critical for host  attachment.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic activities of animal intestinal strains against swine-associated pathogens.
AB  == a wide range of enteropathogens cause costly diarrhoeal diseases in fattening piglets and account for food-related infections in humans. the objective of this  study was to screen beneficial bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract  of various animal sources for antagonistic activity against diverse pathogens associated with hazardous pig production times. using agar spot assays, 15 well-characterized strains belonging to lactobacillus, enterococcus, bifidobacterium and bacillus were studied for inhibition of clostridium perfringens type a, various serovars of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, as well as brachyspira pilosicoli. strong antagonists were further analyzed by studying their cell-free supernatants with and without ph neutralization, proteinase k and catalase treatment. enterobacteriaceae were effectively inhibited by lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus reuteri strains, independent from the animal source, and on a lower level by single strains belonging to lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus amylovorus and bifidobacterium thermophilum, due to organic acid production. the bacillus subtilis strain was found to produce an anti-clostridial and anti-brachyspira metabolite of proteinaceous nature. homofermentative lactobacilli and b. thermophilum could suppress the growth of b. pilosicoli, the causative agent of intestinal spirochaetosis, whereas heterofermentative strains belonging to l. reuteri and l. mucosae had no effect. the lactic acid bacteria exerted their activity primarily by organic acid release, except one enterococcus faecium and l. amylovorus strain, which exhibited antagonism through joint activity of lactate and hydrogen peroxide. the findings of this study provide a basis for further in vitro studies and encourage feeding studies to evaluate the antagonistic potential of promising strains in pig production.

TI  == the antimicrobial compound reuterin (3-hydroxypropionaldehyde) induces oxidative  stress via interaction with thiol groups.
AB  == reuterin is an antimicrobial compound produced by lactobacillus reuteri, and has  been proposed to mediate, in part, the probiotic health benefits ascribed to this micro-organism. despite 20 years of investigation, the mechanism of action by which reuterin exerts its antimicrobial effects has remained elusive. here we provide evidence that reuterin induces oxidative stress in cells, most likely by  modifying thiol groups in proteins and small molecules. escherichia coli cells subjected to sublethal levels of reuterin expressed a set of genes that overlapped with the set of genes composing the oxyr regulon, which senses and responds to various forms of oxidative stress. e. coli cells mutated for oxyr were more sensitive to reuterin compared with wild-type cells, further supporting a role for reuterin in exerting oxidative stress. the addition of cysteine to e.  coli or clostridium difficile growth media prior to exposure to reuterin suppressed the antimicrobial effect of reuterin on these bacteria. interestingly, interaction with e. coli stimulated reuterin production or secretion by l. reuteri, indicating that contact with other microbes in the gut increases reuterin output. thus, reuterin inhibits bacterial growth by modifying thiol groups, which indicates that reuterin negatively affects a large number of cellular targets.

AB  == a novel type ii nucleoside 2'-deoxyribosyltransferase from lactobacillus reuteri  (lrndt) has been cloned and overexpressed in escherichia coli. the recombinant lrndt has been structural and functionally characterized. sedimentation equilibrium analysis revealed a homohexameric molecule of 114 kda. circular dichroism studies have showed a secondary structure containing 55% alpha-helix, 10% beta-strand, 16% beta-sheet, and 19% random coil. lrndt was thermostable with a melting temperature (t(m)) of 64 degrees c determined by fluorescence, circular dichroism, and differential scanning calorimetric studies. the enzyme showed high activity in a broad ph range (4.6 to 7.9) and was also very stable between ph 4 and 7.9. the optimal temperature for activity was 40 degrees c. the recombinant lrndt was able to synthesize natural and nonnatural nucleoside analogues, improving activities described in the literature, and remarkably, exhibited unexpected new arabinosyltransferase activity, which had not been described so far in this kind of enzyme. furthermore, synthesis of new arabinonucleosides and  2'-fluorodeoxyribonucleosides was carried out.

TI  == probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics.
AB  == according to the german definition, probiotics are defined viable microorganisms, sufficient amounts of which reach the intestine in an active state and thus exert positive health effects. numerous probiotic microorganisms (e.g. lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri, bifidobacteria and certain strains of l. casei or the l. acidophilus-group) are used in probiotic food, particularly fermented milk products, or have been investigated--as well as escherichia coli strain nissle 1917, certain enterococci (enterococcus faecium sf68) and the probiotic yeast saccharomyces boulardii--with regard to their medicinal use. among the numerous purported health benefits attributed to probiotic bacteria, the (transient) modulation of the intestinal microflora of the host and the capacity to interact  with the immune system directly or mediated by the autochthonous microflora, are  basic mechanisms. they are supported by an increasing number of in vitro and in vivo experiments using conventional and molecular biologic methods. in addition to these, a limited number of randomized, well-controlled human intervention trials have been reported. well-established probiotic effects are: 1. prevention  and/or reduction of duration and complaints of rotavirus-induced or antibiotic-associated diarrhea as well as alleviation of complaints due to lactose intolerance. 2. reduction of the concentration of cancer-promoting enzymes and/or putrefactive (bacterial) metabolites in the gut. 3. prevention and alleviation of unspecific and irregular complaints of the gastrointestinal tracts in healthy people. 4. beneficial effects on microbial aberrancies, inflammation and other complaints in connection with: inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, helicobacter pylori infection or bacterial overgrowth. 5. normalization of passing stool and stool consistency in subjects suffering from obstipation or an irritable colon. 6. prevention or alleviation of allergies and  atopic diseases in infants. 7. prevention of respiratory tract infections (common cold, influenza) and other infectious diseases as well as treatment of urogenital infections. insufficient or at most preliminary evidence exists with respect to cancer prevention, a so-called hypocholesterolemic effect, improvement of the mouth flora and caries prevention or prevention or therapy of ischemic heart diseases or amelioration of autoimmune diseases (e.g. arthritis). a prebiotic is  "a selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity in the gastrointestinal microflora that confers benefits upon host well being and health", whereas synergistic combinations of pro- and prebiotics are called synbiotics. today, only bifidogenic, non-digestible oligosaccharides (particularly inulin, its hydrolysis product oligofructose, and (trans)galactooligosaccharides), fulfill all the criteria for  prebiotic classification. they are dietary fibers with a well-established positive impact on the intestinal microflora. other health effects of prebiotics  (prevention of diarrhoea or obstipation, modulation of the metabolism of the intestinal flora, cancer prevention, positive effects on lipid metabolism, stimulation of mineral adsorption and immunomodulatory properties) are indirect,  i.e. mediated by the intestinal microflora, and therefore less-well proven. in the last years, successful attempts have been reported to make infant formula more breast milk-like by the addition of fructo- and (primarily) galactooligosaccharides.

TI  == human-derived probiotic lactobacillus reuteri demonstrate antimicrobial activities targeting diverse enteric bacterial pathogens.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri is a commensal-derived anaerobic probiotic that resides in  the human gastrointestinal tract. l. reuteri converts glycerol into a potent broad-spectrum antimicrobial compound, reuterin, which inhibits the growth of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. in this study, we compared four human-derived l. reuteri isolates (atcc 55730, atcc pta 6475, atcc pta 4659 and atcc pta 5289) in their ability to produce reuterin and to inhibit the growth of  different enteric pathogens in vitro. reuterin was produced by each of the four l. reuteri strains and assessed for biological activity. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of reuterin derived from each strain was determined for the following enteric pathogens: enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic  e. coli, salmonella enterica, shigella sonnei and vibrio cholerae. we also analyzed the relative abilities of l. reuteri to inhibit enteric pathogens in a pathogen overlay assay. the magnitude of reuterin production did not directly correlate with the relative ability of l. reuteri to suppress the proliferation of enteric pathogens. additional antimicrobial factors may be produced by l. reuteri, and multiple factors may act synergistically with reuterin to inhibit enteric pathogens.

TI  == the effect of probiotics and organic acids on shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in shiga-toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for stec. shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and  hemolytic uremic syndrome. stec possesses shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and shiga toxin 2  (stx2), both of which have a and b subunits. although stec containing both stx1 and stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. thus, the effect of lactobacillus, pediococcus, and bifidobacterium strains on stx2a expression levels in stec was investigated. lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included l. rhamnosus gg, l. curvatus, l. plantarum, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. reuteri, p. acidilactici, p. cerevisiae, p. pentosaceus, b. thermophilum, b. boum, b. suis and b. animalis. e. coli o157:h7 (edl 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. following rna extraction and cdna synthesis, relative stx2a mrna levels were determined according to a comparative  critical threshold (ct) real-time pcr. data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and the level of stx2a expression between treated and untreated stec was compared. observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2a was down-regulated, when compared to the control  culture. probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in  ph, influenced stx2a gene expression.

TI  == glycerol induces reuterin production and decreases escherichia coli population in an in vitro model of colonic fermentation with immobilized human feces.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri atcc 55730 is a probiotic strain that produces, in the presence of glycerol, reuterin, a broad-spectrum antimicrobial substance. this strain has been shown to prevent intestinal infections in vivo; however, its mechanisms of action, and more specifically whether reuterin production occurs within the intestinal tract, are not known. in this study, the effects of l. reuteri atcc 55730 on intestinal microbiota and its capacity to secrete reuterin  from glycerol in a novel in vitro colonic fermentation model were tested. two reactors were inoculated with adult immobilized fecal microbiota and the effects  of daily addition of l. reuteri into one of the reactors (c.10(8) cfu ml(-1)) without or with glycerol were tested on major bacterial populations and compared  with addition of glycerol or reuterin alone. the addition of glycerol alone or with l. reuteri increased numbers of the lactobacillus-enterococcus group and decreased escherichia coli. the addition of reuterin significantly and selectively decreased e. coli without affecting other bacterial populations. the  observed decrease in e. coli concentration during the addition of glycerol (in presence or absence of l. reuteri) could be due to in situ reuterin production because 1,3-propanediol, a typical product of glycerol fermentation, was detected during the addition of glycerol.

TI  == inhibitory activity spectrum of reuterin produced by lactobacillus reuteri against intestinal bacteria.
AB  == background: reuterin produced from glycerol by lactobacillus reuteri, a normal inhabitant of the human intestine, is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent. it has been postulated that reuterin could play a role in the probiotic effects of lb. reuteri. reuterin is active toward enteropathogens, yeasts, fungi, protozoa and viruses, but its effect on commensal intestinal bacteria is unknown. moreover reuterin's mode of action has not yet been elucidated. glutathione, a powerful antioxidant, which also plays a key role in detoxifying reactive aldehydes, protects certain bacteria from oxidative stress, and could also be implicated in  resistance to reuterin. the aim of this work was to test the activity of reuterin against a representative panel of intestinal bacteria and to study a possible correlation between intracellular low molecular weight thiols (lmw-sh) such as glutathione, hydrogen peroxide and/or reuterin sensitivity. reuterin was produced by lb. reuteri sd2112 in pure glycerol solution, purified and used to test the minimal inhibitory (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc). hydrogen  peroxide sensitivity and intracellular lmw-sh concentration were also analysed. results: our data showed that most tested intestinal bacteria showed mic below that for a sensitive indicator escherichia coli (7.5-15 mm). lactobacilli and clostridium clostridioforme were more resistant with mic ranging from 15 to 50 mm. no correlation between bacterial intracellular concentrations of lmw-sh, including glutathione, and reuterin or hydrogen peroxide sensitivities were found. conclusion: our data showed that intestinal bacteria were very sensitive to reuterin and that their intracellular concentration of lmw-sh was not directly linked to their capacity to resist reuterin or hydrogen peroxide. this suggests that detoxification by lmw-sh such as glutathione is not a general mechanism and  that other mechanisms are probably involved in bacterial tolerance to reuterin and hydrogene peroxide.

AB  == chronic active colitis (including inflammatory bowel disease - ibd) is maintained by a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators. certain intestinal bacterial strains  may induce colitis, whereas some strains (e.g. lactobacillus spp.) show a protective effect in colitis owing to their anti-inflammatory activity. in this study, we have examined the production of selected inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ros), nitric oxide (no) and the expression of haeme oxygenase-1 (ho-1) by murine peritoneal macrophages stimulated in vitro by the intestinal bacterial strains, isolated from mice with colitis. lactobacillus strains (lactobacillus reuteri, l. johnsonii, l. animalis/murinus) and two potentially pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis) induced the production of substantial amounts of cytokines with a strain specific profile. despite some interstrain differences, all lactobacilli induced production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (il-10(high), il-6(low), il-12p70(low)). conversely, e. faecalis and e. coli induced the production of proinflammatory cytokines (tnf-alpha, il-12p70), the cytokines essential for chronic ibd. macrophages released comparably substantial amounts of ros in response to all lactobacillus strains tested, while e. coli and e. faecalis ability to induce generation of ros was negligible. in contrast to ros, the production of no/no(2) (-) by macrophages activated with all bacterial strains tested was similar. moreover, for the first time, it has been shown that intestinal bacteria differed in their ability to induce expression of ho-1, a stress-inducible enzyme with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. the beneficial immunoregulatory properties of candidate probiotic bacteria for the treatment of ibd are discussed.

TI  == specific bifidobacterium strains isolated from elderly subjects inhibit growth of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == cell-free, ph-controlled supernatants of thirty-eight bifidobacterium strains isolated from healthy elderly subjects were subjected to antimicrobial activity assay. bioluminescent indicator strains staphylococcus aureus rn4220, escherichia coli k-12, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 14028 were used as targets of antimicrobial activity. the effect of nutrient depletion on the inhibition was eliminated with spent-culture controls. three out of thirty-eight  bifidobacterium strains were capable of inhibiting the growth of s. aureus. the inhibition was equal to 23.2+/-19.1% to 50.4+/-26.7% of the inhibition caused by  50 iu/ml nisin. reuterin-producing positive strain lactobacillus reuteri sd2112 was capable of 86.0+/-24.6% inhibition, but bifidobacterium lactis bb-12, a known probiotic strain, showed no inhibition. none of the strains was capable of inhibiting the growth of e. coli or s. enterica. the observed inhibition by bifidobacteria was related to hydrogen peroxide formation and possible production of heat-stable proteinaceous compounds. the results suggest that production of antimicrobial substances other than organic acids is not common among bifidobacterium strains typical of elderly subjects. however, specific strains were identified which showed considerable inhibitory activity against s. aureus.

TI  == cloning and expression of the beta-galactosidase genes from lactobacillus reuteri in escherichia coli.
AB  == heterodimeric beta-galactosidase of lactobacillus reuteri l103 is encoded by two  overlapping genes, lacl and lacm. the lacl (1887bp) and lacm (960bp) genes encode polypeptides with calculated molecular masses of 73,620 and 35,682da, respectively. the deduced amino acid sequences of lacl and lacm show significant  identity with the sequences of beta-galactosidases from other lactobacilli and escherichia coli. the coding regions of the laclm genes were cloned and successfully overexpressed in e. coli using an expression system based on the t7  rna polymerase promoter. expression of lacl alone and coexpression of lacl and lacm as well as activity staining of both native and recombinant beta-galactosidases suggested a translational coupling between lacl and lacm, indicating that the formation of a functional beta-galactosidase requires both genes. recombinant beta-galactosidase was purified to apparent homogeneity, characterized and compared with the native beta-galactosidase from l. reuteri l103.

TI  == probiotics and prebiotics: effects on diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics have preventive as well as curative effects on several types of diarrhea of different etiologies. prevention and therapy (or alleviation) of diarrhea have been successfully investigated for numerous dietary probiotics to establish probiotic properties and to justify health claims (the medicinal use of probiotic food and the therapy of gastrointestinal diseases itself may not be advertised under current food laws). other probiotic microorganisms (e.g., lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri, certain strains of l. casei, l. acidophilus, escherichia coli strain nissle 1917, and certain bifidobacteria and  enterococci (enterococcus faecium sf68) as well as the probiotic yeast saccharomyces boulardii have been investigated with regard to their medicinal use, either as single strains or in mixed-culture probiotics. however, the effects on humans have been assessed mainly in smaller (n<100) randomized, controlled clinical studies or in open label trials, but large intervention studies and epidemiological investigations of long-term probiotic effects are largely missing. perhaps with the exception of nosocomial diarrhea or antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the results of these studies are not yet sufficient to give specific recommendations for the clinical use of probiotics in the treatment of diarrhea.

TI  == the effect of calcium ions on adhesion and competitive exclusion of lactobacillus ssp. and e. coli o138.
AB  == the adhesion abilities of 11 strains of lactobacillus were determined in vitro using the ipec-j2 cell line as a model system. bacteria cultures included the probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri atcc 55730, l. johnsonii ncc 533 and l. reuteri dsm 12246, and new isolates of lactobacillus ssp. adhesion was quantified by scintillation counting of radiolabelled bound bacteria. the highest adhesion of 38%, was determined for l. reuteri dsm 12246 followed by l. plantarum q47 with an adhesion level of 24%. other strains showed moderate to low binding of less than 16%. competitive adhesion experiments on ipec-j2 cells demonstrated  that strongly adhesive strains, as l. reuteri dsm 12246 and l. plantarum q47, significantly reduced the attachment of the less adhesive strains, such as l. rhamnosus gg and l. johnsonii ncc 533, both under condition of co-incubation and  in displacement assays, indicating that bacteria may share the same binding sites for attachment to intestinal cells. furthermore, it was revealed that calcium ions significantly increased the binding of tested lactobacilli to ipec-j2 cells; and therefore, added calcium may be useful in enhancing the adhesion of normally  weakly adhesive probiotic cultures. in contrast, no significant change in adhesion of lactobacilli was observed in the presence of mg and zn ions. displacement assays performed with pathogenic e. coli o138 showed that all tested lactobacillus strains reduced the attachment of e. coli o138 to ipec-j2 by more than 2-fold both in the presence and the absence of calcium ions. the strains of  lactobacillus did not differ significantly in the extent of their inhibition of e. coli o138 adhesion, indicating that the reduced adhesion of e. coli o138 was due to steric hindrance of the binding sites rather than to specific interactions.

AB  == escherichia coli o157:h7 is capable of surviving the rigorous processing steps during the manufacture of dry fermented sausages. the effect of adding two probiotic organisms, lactobacillus reuteri and bifidobacterium longum as co-cultures with the meat starter cultures pediococcus pentosaceus and staphylococcus carnosus on the viability of e. coli o157:h7 in dry fermented sausages was studied. a 5 strain cocktail of e. coli o157:h7 was added at 7.4 log cfu/g to the sausage batter and challenged with either or both lb. reuteri or b.  longum before or after they were micro-encapsulated. sausages were fermented at < or = 26 degrees c and 88% relative humidity (rh) followed by drying at 75% rh and 13 degrees c for 25 d. the ph, water activity (aw), protein, moisture, and numbers of all inoculated organisms were monitored during processing. the ph and  aw decreased from 5.7 and 0.98 to 4.9 and 0.88 at the end of fermentation and drying, respectively. these processes reduced e. coli o157:h7 by 1.0 and 0.7 log  cfu/g at the end of fermentation and drying, respectively. unencapsulated lb. reuteri with or without b. longum reduced e. coli o157:h7 by 3.0 log cfu/g and b. longum caused a 1.9 log cfu/g reduction. while micro-encapsulation increased survival of lb. reuteri and b. longum, it reduced their inhibitory action against e. coli o157:h7.

TI  == antagonistic activity against pathogenic bacteria by human vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  == this study attempted to isolate lactobacilli strains from healthy vaginal ecosystem to search for a new effective antibacterial probiotic strain. the strains were identified and characterized for their probiotic properties including bile salt and acid tolerance, growth at acidic ph, their ability to utilize protein, starch, and lipid, the production of hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocin as well as their antibiotic resistance patterns. the antibacterial activity of the culture supernatant of these strains were tested against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae. salmonella typhi, and salmonella typhimurium. none of the strains inhibited the growth of gram-negative bacteria. contrastly, the culture supernatant of strain l 22, identified as lactobacillus reuteri, significantly inhibited all of the clinical  isolates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). the antibacterial effect of the selected strain l 22 was further investigated. in the presence of l 22, the bacterial growth was assessed in vitro by viable bacterial counting. the numbers  of viable cells were significantly lower in l 22-containing broth than those in the control by 6h. this finding clearly demonstrates that strain l 22 can produce an anti-mrsa effect. the antibacterial ability of the strain l 22 was fundamentally attributed to their bacteriocin production which can cause both cell inhibition and cell death.

TI  == role of asparagine 1134 in glucosidic bond and transglycosylation specificity of  reuteransucrase from lactobacillus reuteri 121.
AB  == glucansucrases from lactic acid bacteria convert sucrose into various alpha-glucans that differ greatly with respect to the glucosidic bonds present (e.g. dextran, mutan, alternan and reuteran). this study aimed to identify the structural features of the reuteransucrase from lactobacillus reuteri 121 (gtfa)  that determine its reaction specificity. we here report a detailed mutational analysis of a conserved region immediately next to the catalytic asp1133 (putative transition-state stabilizing) residue in gtfa. the data show that asn1134 is the main determinant of glucosidic bond product specificity in this reuteransucrase. furthermore, mutations at this position greatly influenced the hydrolysis/transglycosylation ratio. changes in this amino acid expands the range of glucan and gluco-oligosaccharide products synthesized from sucrose by mutant gtfa enzymes.

AB  == genistein, a radioprotective soy isoflavone and protein kinase inhibitor, blocks  the invasion of pathogenic bacteria in mammalian epithelial cells. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the direct effect of genistein on the survival and growth of the probiotic lactobacillus reuteri and selected opportunistic bacteria in vitro as a prelude to in vivo use for managing postirradiation sepsis. we evaluated the opportunistic bacterial enteropathogens escherichia coli, shigella  sonnei, and staphylococcus aureus as well as klebsiella pneumoniae and the non-pathogenic organism, bacillus anthracis (sterne). the latter two bacteria are found in the environment and may be of concern in irradiated individuals. a standard in vitro test was employed to evaluate the direct effect of genistein on the bacteria. this test involved determining bacterial colony forming unit (cfu)  counts at a single concentration of genistein. in the cfu assays, significant reductions in cfus were found for s. aureus and b. anthracis when cultured in the presence of 100 mum genistein. however, l. reuteri, e. coli, s. sonnei, and k. pneumoniae were not altered by in vitro culturing in the presence of 100 mum genistein. these results demonstrate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of genistein. furthermore, the use of genistein in combination with probiotics may augment the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapies currently used in the management of infections, including those induced by ionizing irradiation.

AB  == the nisin-controlled gene expression (nice) system, which was discovered in lactococcus lactis, was adapted to lactobacillus reuteri by ligating nisa promoter (pnisa) and nisrk dna fragments into the escherichia coli-lb. reuteri shuttle vector pste32. this chimerical plasmid (pnice) was capable of expressing  the heterologous amylase gene (amyl) under nisin induction. optimization of induction factors for this lb. reuteri/pnice system, including nisin concentration (viz. 50 ng/ml), growth phase of culture at which nisin be added (viz. at the early exponential phase), and the best time for analyzing the gene product after inoculation (viz. at the 3rd h), allowed the amylase product to be  expressed in high amounts, constituting up to about 18% of the total intracellular protein. furthermore, the signal peptide (sp) of amyl gene (spamyl) from bacillus licheniformis was ligated to the downstream of pnisa in pnice, upgrading this vector to a nice-secretion (nies) level, which was then designated pnies (sec+, secretion positive). characterization of pnies using an amyl-spdelta gene (amyl gene lacking its sp) as a reporter revealed the 3rd h after induction  as the secretion peak of this system, at which the secretion efficiency and the amount of alpha-amylase being secreted into the culture supernatant were estimated to reach 77.6% and 27.75 mg/l. expression and secretion of amyl products by pnies in lb. reuteri was also confirmed by sds-page and immunoblotting analysis.

AB  == lactobacillus reuteri strain atcc 55730 (lb bio) was isolated as a pure culture from a reuteri tablet purchased from the biogaia company. this probiotic strain produces a soluble glucan (reuteran), in which the majority of the linkages are of the alpha-(1-->4) glucosidic type ( approximately 70%). this reuteran also contains alpha-(1-->6)- linked glucosyl units and 4,6-disubstituted alpha-glucosyl units at the branching points. the lb bio glucansucrase gene (gtfo) was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli, and the gtfo enzyme was purified. the recombinant gtfo enzyme and the lb bio culture supernatants synthesized identical glucan polymers with respect to linkage type and size distribution. gtfo thus is a reuteransucrase, responsible for synthesis of this reuteran polymer in lb bio. the preference of gtfo for synthesizing alpha-(1-->4) linkages is also evident from the oligosaccharides produced from sucrose with different acceptor substrates, e.g., isopanose from isomaltose. gtfo has a relatively high hydrolysis/transferase activity ratio. complete conversion of 100 mm sucrose by gtfo nevertheless yielded large amounts of reuteran, although more  than 50% of sucrose was converted into glucose. this is only the second example of the isolation and characterization of a reuteransucrase and its reuteran product, both found in different l. reuteri strains. gtfo synthesizes a reuteran  with the highest amount of alpha-(1-->4) linkages reported to date.

TI  == expression of a heterologous manganese superoxide dismutase gene in intestinal lactobacilli provides protection against hydrogen peroxide toxicity.
AB  == in living organisms, exposure to oxygen provokes oxidative stress. a widespread mechanism for protection against oxidative stress is provided by the antioxidant  enzymes: superoxide dismutases (sods) and hydroperoxidases. generally, these enzymes are not present in lactobacillus spp. in this study, we examined the potential advantages of providing a heterologous sod to some of the intestinal lactobacilli. thus, the gene encoding the manganese-containing sod (soda) was cloned from streptococcus thermophilus ao54 and expressed in four intestinal lactobacilli. a 1.2-kb pcr product containing the soda gene was cloned into the shuttle vector ptrk563, to yield psoda, which was functionally expressed and complemented an escherichia coli strain deficient in mn and fesods. the plasmid,  psoda, was subsequently introduced and expressed in lactobacillus gasseri nck334, lactobacillus johnsonii nck89, lactobacillus acidophilus nck56, and lactobacillus reuteri nck932. molecular and biochemical analyses confirmed the presence of the  gene (soda) and the expression of an active gene product (mnsod) in these strains of lactobacilli. the specific activities of mnsod were 6.7, 3.8, 5.8, and 60.7 u/mg of protein for l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. reuteri, respectively. the expression of s. thermophilus mnsod in l. gasseri and l. acidophilus provided protection against hydrogen peroxide stress. the data show that mnsod protects cells against hydrogen peroxide by removing o(2)(.-) and preventing the redox cycling of iron. to our best knowledge, this is the first report of a soda from s. thermophilus being expressed in other lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == biochemical and molecular characterization of a levansucrase from lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri strain 121 employs a fructosyltransferase (ftf) to synthesize a fructose polymer [a fructan of the levan type, with beta(2-->6) linkages] from sucrose or raffinose. purification of this ftf (a levansucrase), and identification of peptide amino acid sequences, allowed isolation of the first lactobacillus levansucrase gene (lev), encoding a protein (lev) consisting  of 804 amino acids. lev showed highest similarity with an inulosucrase of l. reuteri 121 [inu; producing an inulin polymer with beta(2-->1)-linked fructosyl units] and with ftfs from streptococci. expression of lev in escherichia coli resulted in an active ftf (lev delta 773his) that produced the same levan polymer [with only 2-3 % beta(2-->1-->6) branching points] as l. reuteri 121 cells grown  on raffinose. the low degree of branching of the l. reuteri levan is very different from bacterial levans known up to now, such as that of streptococcus salivarius, having up to 30 % branches. although lev is unusual in showing a higher hydrolysis than transferase activity, significant amounts of levan polymer are produced both in vivo and in vitro. lev is strongly dependent on ca(2+) ions  for activity. unique properties of l. reuteri lev together with inu are: (i) the  presence of a c-terminal cell-wall-anchoring motif causing similar expression problems in escherichia coli, (ii) a relatively high optimum temperature for activity for ftf enzymes, and (iii) at 50 degrees c, kinetics that are best described by the hill equation.

AB  == aims: to investigate the effect of various carbon sources on the production of extracellular antagonistic compounds against two escherichia coli strains and salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium by three canine-derived lactobacilli strains. methods and materials: cell-free preparations, ph neutralized, were used in antibiotic disc experiments as an initial screening. the bacteria/carbohydrate combinations that showed inhibition of the growth of those pathogens, were further investigated in batch co-culture experiments. the cell-free supernatants  of the cultures, that decreased the population number of the pathogens in the co-culture experiments to log cfu ml-1 <or= 4, were tested for inhibition of the  pathogens in pure cultures at neutral and acidic ph. conclusions: the results showed that the substrate seems to affect the production of antimicrobial compounds and this effect could not just be ascribed to the ability of the bacteria to grow in the various carbon sources. l. mucosae, l. acidophilus and l. reuteri, when grown in sugar mixtures consisting of alpha-glucosides (degree of polymerization (dp) 1-4) could produce antimicrobial compounds active against all three pathogens in vitro. this effect could not be attributed to a single ingredient of those sugar mixtures and was synergistic. this inhibition had a dose-response characteristic and was more active at acidic ph. significance and impact of the study: knowledge of the effect that the carbon source has on the production of antimicrobial compounds by gut-associated lactobacilli allows the rational design of prebiotic/probiotic combinations to combat gastrointestinal pathogens.

AB  == nowadays. there is a growing interest in probiotics as a safe way of changing the intestinal bacterial flora. probiotics may have potential in several gastroenterological conditions, especially when the intestinal flora has been disturbed. most scientific evidence is available for diarrhoea patients treated with lactobacillus gg, lactobacillus reuteri or saccharomyces boulardii. meta-analyses have shown an overall reduction in the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea during treatment with probiotics, and benefits have also been demonstrated for patients with rota-virus-associated diarrhoea. patients with inflammatory bowel disease, an inflammatory disorder characterized  by a change in the intestinal flora, are another important target group for which probiotics may be beneficial. it has been claimed that in ulcerative colitis and  crohn disease patients, lactobacilli, s. boulardii and escherichia coli reduce relapses. but most studies were not placebo-controlled. a reduction in relapses has also been demonstrated in pouchitis patients treated with a multispecies probiotic. irritable bowel syndrome might be another clinical indication for probiotic therapy, but results of clinical trials performed in these patients are inconsistent. additionally, probiotics may improve lactose absorption. helicobacter pylori eradication and constipation. finally, in animal models of colorectal cancer, treatment with probiotics reduces the prevalence of this disease, and in humans the amount of genotoxic substances in faeces has been reduced. in conclusion, the results of studies on the effects of probiotics in gastrointestinal conditions are encouraging. but well-designed placebo-controlled studies are warranted before recommendations for therapeutic or preventive use can be given. many issues still have to be resolved, including optimal dose and duration of treatment, selection of and differences between the several available probiotic strains, and, importantly, their mechanisms of actions have to be elucidated.

TI  == bactericidal effects of lactobacillus reuteri and allyl isothiocyanate on escherichia coli o157:h7 in refrigerated ground beef.
AB  == two naturally occurring antimicrobial agents were tested in packages of refrigerated ground beef for their ability to reduce the viability of escherichia coli o157:h7 during storage. allyl isothiocyanate (aitc) and lactobacillus reuteri were tested separately and together for their action against a cocktail of five strains of e. coli o157:h7 in ground beef held at 4 degrees c for 25 days. ground beef prepared from whole, raw inside round beef roasts was inoculated with low (3 log cfu/g) or high (6 log cfu/g) levels of the e. coli o157:h7 mixture. the beef was treated with aitc (about 1,300 ppm), l. reuteri, or both, along with 250 mm of glycerol per kg of meat at two levels (3 and 6 log cfu/g) and according to a design that yielded 8 controls plus 10 different treatments. samples were analyzed for e. coli o157:h7 survivors, numbers of total bacteria, and lactic acid bacteria on days 0 to 25 at 5-day intervals. l. reuteri at both input levels with glycerol killed e. coli o157:h7 at both inoculated levels before day 20. aitc completely eliminated e. coli o157:h7 at the low-inoculum level (3 log cfu/g) and reduced viability >4.5 log cfu/g at the high-inoculum level (6 log cfu/g) by the end of the storage period. the combination of l. reuteri and aitc did not yield an additive effect against e. coli o157:h7 viability. l. reuteri in the presence of glycerol was highly effective against e. coli o157:h7 in ground beef during refrigerated storage (4 degrees c) in modified atmosphere packages. sensory testing is planned to evaluate effects of treatments.

TI  == lactobacillus reuteri crl1098 produces cobalamin.
AB  == we found that lactobacillus reuteri crl1098, a lactic acid bacterium isolated from sourdough, is able to produce cobalamin. the sugar-glycerol cofermentation in vitamin b(12)-free medium showed that this strain was able to reduce glycerol  through a well-known cobalamin-dependent reaction with the formation of 1,3-propanediol as a final product. the cell extract of l. reuteri corrected the  coenzyme b12 requirement of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis atcc 7830 and allowed the growth of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (mete cbib) and escherichia coli (mete) in minimal medium. preliminary genetic studies of cobalamin biosynthesis genes from l. reuteri allowed the identification of cob genes which encode the coba, cbij, and cbik enzymes involved in the cobalamin pathway. the cobamide produced by l. reuteri, isolated in its cyanide form by using reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, showed a uv-visible spectrum identical to that of standard cyanocobalamin (vitamin b12).

TI  == characterization of a novel fructosyltransferase from lactobacillus reuteri that  synthesizes high-molecular-weight inulin and inulin oligosaccharides.
AB  == fructosyltransferase (ftf) enzymes produce fructose polymers (fructans) from sucrose. here, we report the isolation and characterization of an ftf-encoding gene from lactobacillus reuteri strain 121. a c-terminally truncated version of the ftf gene was successfully expressed in escherichia coli. when incubated with  sucrose, the purified recombinant ftf enzyme produced large amounts of fructo-oligosaccharides (fos) with beta-(2-->1)-linked fructosyl units, plus a high-molecular-weight fructan polymer (>10(7)) with beta-(2-->1) linkages (an inulin). fos, but not inulin, was found in supernatants of l. reuteri strain 121  cultures grown on medium containing sucrose. bacterial inulin production has been reported for only streptococcus mutans strains. fos production has been reported  for a few bacterial strains. this paper reports the first-time isolation and molecular characterization of (i) a lactobacillus ftf gene, (ii) an inulosucrase  associated with a generally regarded as safe bacterium, (iii) an ftf enzyme synthesizing both a high molecular weight inulin and fos, and (iv) an ftf protein containing a cell wall-anchoring lpxtg motif. the biological relevance and potential health benefits of an inulosucrase associated with an l. reuteri strain remain to be established.

TI  == molecular characterization of a novel glucosyltransferase from lactobacillus reuteri strain 121 synthesizing a unique, highly branched glucan with alpha-(1-->4) and alpha-(1-->6) glucosidic bonds.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri strain 121 produces a unique, highly branched, soluble glucan in which the majority of the linkages are of the alpha-(1-->4) glucosidic  type. the glucan also contains alpha-(1-->6)-linked glucosyl units and 4,6-disubstituted alpha-glucosyl units at the branching points. using degenerate  primers, based on the amino acid sequences of conserved regions from known glucosyltransferase (gtf) genes from lactic acid bacteria, the l. reuteri strain  121 glucosyltransferase gene (gtfa) was isolated. the gtfa open reading frame (orf) was 5,343 bp, and it encodes a protein of 1,781 amino acids with a deduced  m(r) of 198,637. the deduced amino acid sequence of gtfa revealed clear similarities with other glucosyltransferases. gtfa has a relatively large variable n-terminal domain (702 amino acids) with five unique repeats and a relatively short c-terminal domain (267 amino acids). the gtfa gene was expressed in escherichia coli, yielding an active gtfa enzyme. with respect to binding type and size distribution, the recombinant gtfa enzyme and the l. reuteri strain 121  culture supernatants synthesized identical glucan polymers. furthermore, the deduced amino acid sequence of the gtfa orf and the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the glucosyltransferase isolated from culture supernatants of l. reuteri strain 121 were the same. gtfa is thus responsible for the synthesis of the unique glucan polymer in l. reuteri strain 121. this is the first report on the molecular characterization of a glucosyltransferase from a lactobacillus strain.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis induces inflammatory bowel disease in interleukin-10 knockout mice.
AB  == germ-free interleukin-10 knockout (il-10 ko) mice developed inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) after they were colonized with a pure culture of enterococcus faecalis. e. faecalis not only induced ibd (primarily in colon and rectum) but rectal dysplasia and adenocarcinoma was also found in the il-10 ko mice. conventional (complex-intestinal flora) il-10 ko mice developed ibd within 10 to  15 weeks of age and showed more pathology in the cecum (typhlitis) than we observed with e. faecalis-induced ibd in gnotobiotic il-10 ko mice. conversely, neither germ-free il-10 mice nor il-10 ko mice colonized as adults, with a pure culture of candida albicans, escherichia coli, lactobacillus casei, l. reuteri, l. acidophilus, a bifidobacterium sp., lactococcus lactis, or a bacillus sp. developed ibd during the 25- to 30-week study. e. faecalis is a common intestinal microbe of man and animals that can trigger ibd, dysplasia, and carcinoma in a genetically susceptible murine host.

TI  == reduction of sulfide, ammonia compounds, and adhesion properties of lactobacillus casei strain ke99 in vitro.
AB  == the ability of lactobacillus casei strain ke99 to reduce sulfide, ammonia, and to adhere to bio-surfaces was characterized and compared with three lactobacillus reference strains. sulfide reduction by strain ke99 in mrs broth increased exponentially after 10-h growth and reached a maximum (>300 ppm reduction) within 48 h. ke99 demonstrated a maximum reduction of sulfide under anaerobic (341 ppm)  growth conditions at ph 6.0-8.0 range. maximum anaerobic reduction of sulfide was demonstrated by l. casei 393 at ph 7.0 (272 ppm); l. rhamnosus at ph 8.0 (277 ppm); and l. reuteri at ph 7.0 (244 ppm). ke99 reduced sulfide more (p < 0.0001)  in mrs broth spiked with na2s (374 ppm) than (nh4)2s (340 ppm) salts. ammonia reduction by strain ke99 and the three lactobacillus reference strains in mrs broth was low. ammonia reduction reached a maximum within 36 h and remained unchanged over extended incubations of 48 h to 72 h or further. ke99 reduced ammonium sulfate (37 ppm) more readily than the nitrate (31 ppm), hypophosphate (29 ppm), or chloride (20 ppm) salts of ammonia. ke99 and the three reference strains of lactobacilli demonstrated avid binding to bio-coat (cn type-i, cn type-iv, laminin, fibronectin), matrigel, and caco-2 cell monolayers in vitro. the number of lactobacilli binding to caco-2 was estimated at 74/cell with strain ke99, which was significantly higher compared with 40/cell (p < 0.0001), 26/cell  (0.0001), and 64/cell (p < 0.002) with l. casei 393, l. reuteri, and l. rhamnosus, respectively. the interaction of ke99 to immobilized cn type-i was saturable and reached an equilibrium within 1 h at room temperature. ke99 binding to cn type-i occurred at a wide ph range and was biphasic with maximum binding at ph 5.5 and 7.5. inhibition and binding-displacement experiments with different salts and sugars suggested that the ke99 binding to immobilized cn type-i may involve a combination of electrostatic and lectin-type interactions. ke99 effectively detached the cn-adherent e. coli o157:h7 in the range of 55% (atcc43895) to 76% (atcc43894). the binding-displacement values for l. casei 393, l. reuteri and l. rhamnosus to detach cn-adherent e. coli o157:h7 (atcc43894) were 66 +/- 4%, 59 +/- 2%, and 64 +/- 2%, respectively. also, a reconstituted solution of the freeze-dried ke99 preparation effectively detached the cn-adherent e. coli o157:h7 in a dose-dependent manner that reached a binding-displacement equilibrium of 85% at a 1% wt/vol ke99 concentration.

TI  == inhibition of adhesion of food-borne pathogens to caco-2 cells by lactobacillus strains.
AB  == aims: to select adhesive strains among strains of lactobacillus and to apply them to inhibit adhesion of food-borne pathogens. methods and results: twelve lactobacillus strains (10 from intestine) were examined for adhesion using caco-2 cell cultures. the two most adhesive strains, lactobacillus crispatus jcm 8779 and lact. reuteri jcm 1081, were used to test antiadhesion activity against enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium and enterococcus faecalis strains. adhesion of the pathogens was inhibited by both lactobacillus strains. adhesion of ent. faecalis was especially strongly inhibited by jcm 8779. although antimicrobial activity was not detected in the culture supernatant fluid by agar well diffusion assay, the supernatant fluid obtained from the harvested jcm 8779 cell suspension showed bactericidal activity against ent. faecalis. conclusion: the strong antiadhesion activity of jcm 8779 against ent. faecalis appears to be due to the combined effect of both bactericidal activity and competition for attachment site. significance and impact of the study: this is the first report that lact. crispatus produces a bactericidal substance.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of intraurethrally administered probiotic lactobacillus casei in a murine model of escherichia coli urinary tract infection.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of the intraurethrally administered probiotic lactobacillus casei strain shirota against escherichia coli in a murine urinary tract infection (uti) model was examined. uti was induced by intraurethral administration of escherichia coli strain hu-1 (a clinical isolate from a uti patient, positive for type 1 and p fimbriae), at a dose of 1 x 10(6) to 2 x 10(6) cfu in 20 microl of saline, into a c3h/hen mouse bladder which had been traumatized with 0.1 n hcl followed immediately by neutralization with 0.1 n naoh 24 h before the challenge infection. chronic infection with the pathogen at 10(6) cfu in the urinary tract (bladder and kidneys) was maintained for more than 3 weeks after the challenge, and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and myeloperoxidase activity in the urine were markedly elevated during the infection period. a single administration of l. casei shirota at a dose of 10(8) cfu 24 h before the challenge infection dramatically inhibited e. coli growth and inflammatory responses in the urinary tract. multiple daily treatments with l. casei shirota during the postinfection period also showed antimicrobial activity  in this uti model. a heat-killed preparation of l. casei shirota exerted significant antimicrobial effects not only with a single pretreatment (100 microg/mouse) but also with multiple daily treatments during the postinfection period. the other lactobacillus strains tested, i.e., l. fermentum atcc 14931(t), l. jensenii atcc 25258(t), l. plantarum atcc 14917(t), and l. reuteri jcm 1112(t), had no significant antimicrobial activity. taken together, these results suggest that the probiotic l. casei strain shirota is a potent therapeutic agent  for uti.

AB  == the promoter-like sequence p15 that was previously cloned from the chromosome of  lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 is active in lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and escherichia coli, but not in lactococcus lactis. n-methyl-n-nitroso-n-guanidine (mnng) mutagenesis of p15 was used to select for a promoter active in l. lactis mg1363. molecular analysis  of the mutated promoter (designated p16) revealed a 90 bp deletion and a t-->a transversion. this deletion, in combination with the addition to the transversion, created a promoter with putative -35 and -10 hexamers identical to  the consensus promoter sequence found in e. coli and bacillus subtilis vegetative promoters. the activity of p16 was measured by its ability to promote chloramphenicol resistance in different bacteria when inserted in the promoter-probe plasmid pbv5030 (designated pla16). the mic of chloramphenicol in  l. lactis, l. reuteri, l. plantarum, e. coli, and l. acidophilus harbouring pla16 were 30, 170, 180, > 500, and 3 micrograms/ml, respectively. this represents an increase in promoter activity compared to p15 in l. reuteri of 3-fold, in l. plantarum of 9-fold, and in e. coli of at least 2.5-fold, but a decrease in l. acidophilus of 7-fold.

TI  == characterization of reutericyclin produced by lactobacillus reuteri lth2584.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri lth2584 exhibits antimicrobial activity that can be attributed neither to bacteriocins nor to the production of reuterin or organic acids. we have purified the active compound, named reutericyclin, to homogeneity  and characterized its antimicrobial activity. reutericyclin exhibited a broad inhibitory spectrum including lactobacillus spp., bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria innocua. it did not affect the growth of gram-negative bacteria; however, the growth of lipopolysaccharide mutant strains of escherichia coli was inhibited. reutericyclin exhibited a bactericidal mode of action against lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, staphylococcus aureus, and b. subtilis and triggered the lysis  of cells of l. sanfranciscensis in a dose-dependent manner. germination of spores of b. subtilis was inhibited, but the spores remained unaffected under conditions that do not permit germination. the fatty acid supply of the growth media had a strong effect on reutericyclin production and its distribution between producer cells and the culture supernatant. reutericyclin was purified from cell extracts  and culture supernatant of l. reuteri lth2584 cultures grown in mmrs by solvent extraction, gel filtration, rp-c(8) chromatography, and anion-exchange chromatography, followed by rechromatography by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. reutericyclin was characterized as a negatively charged, highly hydrophobic molecule with a molecular mass of 349 da. structural characterization (a. holtzel, m. g. ganzle, g. j. nicholson, w. p. hammes, and g. jung, angew. chem. int. ed. 39:2766-2768, 2000) revealed that reutericyclin is a  novel tetramic acid derivative. the inhibitory activity of culture supernatant of l. reuteri lth2584 corresponded to that of purified as well as synthetic reutericyclin.

TI  == cloning of erythromycin-resistance determinants and replication origins from indigenous plasmids of lactobacillus reuteri for potential use in construction of cloning vectors.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri l1 and n16 strains contain a 7.0-kb plasmid (pte80) and a 15-kb plasmid (pte15), respectively, encoding resistance to erythromycin (em(r)). physical maps of both plasmids were established. nucleotide sequences of the genetic determinants encoding em(r) on pte80 and pte15 revealed the existence of  a very similar (ca. 99% nucleotide sequence and ca. 98% amino acid sequence identity) open reading frame for an em(r) transmethylase gene (erm) in both plasmids. these structural erm genes, 753 and 750 bp in length, respectively, were highly related (ca. 98% nucleotide sequence and ca. 97% amino acid sequence  identity) to the erm gene of l. fermentum plasmid plem3. sequence analysis showed that these two erm genes from pte80 and pte15 could be categorized under the ermb (ermam) class. these are the first members of the ermb (ermam) class of em(r) determinant from l. reuteri to be characterized at the nucleotide sequence level. the em(r) gene from pte80 (erm80) was then ligated into puc18/19 to construct replication origin (ro)-screening vectors pue80(+) and pue80(-) (pue80(+/-)). these plasmids contain the puc18/19-derived multiple cloning site, ampicillin-resistance trait, and the lacz' gene, which enable direct screening for recombinants in escherichia coli. once the recombinant contains a ro from l.  reuteri, the em(r) trait of erm80 is used as a selection marker for the replication of the chimeric plasmid as it is transformed into l. reuteri using the cloned ro as a replicon. replication regions from pte80 and pte15 were successfully cloned into the constructed vector pue80(-). the ro cloned from pte80 was further identified as being highly stable in l. reuteri and also bearing a relatively narrow host range compared with that of pte15. the em(r) determinant (erm80) and ro cloned from pte80 could be used in the future construction of derivatives of cloning vectors for this microbe. moreover, the pue80(+/-) and pte80-ro constructed in this study have the potential to be developed as a suicide vector and an e. coli-l. reuteri shuttle vector, respectively.

TI  == the bspa locus of lactobacillus fermentum br11 encodes an l-cystine uptake system.
AB  == bspa is a basic surface-exposed protein from lactobacillus fermentum br11. sequence comparisons have shown that it is a member of family iii of the solute binding proteins. it is 89% identical to the collagen binding protein, cnb, from  lactobacillus reuteri. compared with the database of escherichia coli proteins, bspa is most similar to the l-cystine binding protein fliy. to investigate the function of bspa, mutants depleted for bspa were generated by homologous recombination with a temperature-sensitive plasmid. these mutants were significantly impaired in their abilities to take up l-cystine. uptake rates of l-glutamine, l-histidine, and l-lysine, which are substrates for other binding proteins with similarity to bspa, were unaffected. evidence was obtained that bspa is necessary for maximal resistance to oxidative stress. specifically, inactivation of bspa causes defective growth in the presence of oxygen and sensitivity to paraquat. measurements of sulfhydryl levels showed that incubation of l. fermentum br11 with l-cystine resulted in increased levels of sulfhydryl groups both inside and outside the cell; however, this was not the case with a bspa mutant. the role of bspa as an extracellular matrix protein adhesin was also addressed. l. fermentum br11 does not bind to immobilized type i collagen or laminin above background levels but does bind immobilized fibronectin. inactivation of bspa did not significantly affect fibronectin binding; therefore, we have not found evidence to support the notion that bspa is an extracellular matrix protein binding adhesin. as bspa is most probably not a lipoprotein, this  report provides evidence that gram-positive bacterial solute binding proteins do  not necessarily have to be anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane to function in solute uptake.

TI  == application of reuterin produced by lactobacillus reuteri 12002 for meat decontamination and preservation.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri strain 12002 was used for reuterin production in the two-step fermentation process. a batch culture fermentation was used to produce a maximum biomass of l. reuteri. then cells were harvested, resuspended in a glycerol-water solution, and anaerobically incubated to produce reuterin. the lyophilized supernatants (approximately 4000 activity units (au) of reuterin per  ml) were diluted in distilled water for decontamination and preservation trials.  the mic values of reuterin for escherichia coli o157:h7 and listeria monocytogenes were 4 and 8 au/ml, respectively. in meat decontamination experiments, the surface of cooked pork was inoculated with either l. monocytogenes or e. coli o157:h7 at a level of approximately log10 5 cfu/cm2, incubated for 30 min at 7 degrees c, and decontaminated by exposure to reuterin (500 au/ml). the bactericidal effect of reuterin was analyzed 15 s and 24 h after exposure at 7 degrees c. after 15 s of exposure to reuterin, viable numbers decreased by 0.45 and 0.3 log10 cfu/cm2 for e. coli o157:h7 and l. monocytogenes, respectively. after 24 h the numbers decreased by 2.7 log10 cfu/cm2 for e. coli o157:h7 and by 0.63 log10 cfu/cm2 for l. monocytogenes. in the same experiment, the combined effect of reuterin and lactic acid was also investigated. adding lactic acid (5%, vol/vol) to reuterin significantly enhanced (p < or = 0.05) the  efficacy of reuterin. no additional effect (p < or = 0.05) was found when ethanol (40%) was added to the mixture of reuterin and lactic acid. to evaluate the preservative effect of reuterin during meat storage, reuterin was added to raw ground pork contaminated with e. coli o157:h7 or l. monocytogenes. reuterin at a  concentration of 100 au/g resulted in a 5.0-log10 reduction of the viability of e. coli o157:h7 after 1 day of storage at 7 degrees c. reuterin at a concentration of 250 au/g reduced the number of the viable cells of l. monocytogenes by log10 3.0 cycles after 1 week of storage at 7 degrees c.

TI  == the effect of reuterin on listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli o157:h7 in  milk and cottage cheese.
AB  == a broad-spectrum reuterin produced during anaerobic fermentation of glycerol by lactobacillus reuteri strain 12002 was found to be inhibitory and bactericidal for listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli o157:h7. lyophilized reuterin was prepared by a two-step fermentation process. a batch fermentation in a 15-liter fermentor was applied to produce a maximum biomass of l. reuteri using a modified mrs broth at ph 4.3. further, harvested cells were used to ferment glycerol (250  mm) under anaerobic conditions. the sensitivity to reuterin of 10 strains of listeria spp., including 6 strains of l. monocytogenes, and 6 strains of e. coli, including one enterotoxigenic e. coli strains and two enterohemorrhagic e. coli strains, was estimated. strains of l. monocytogenes were more resistant to reuterin than e. coli strains. in cottage cheese, ph 5.4, l. monocytogenes increased by 0.4 log while e. coli o157:h7 decreased by 0.5 log in 21 days at 7 degrees c; addition of reuterin (50 to 250 units per g) to the cottage cheese reduced the viability of both organisms. the inactivation rate was more pronounced (p < or = 0.05) with e. coli o157:h7 than l. monocytogenes and it was  dependent on reuterin concentration. the rate of e. coli o157:h7 population reduction reached to 2, 3, and 6 log cycles by day 7 for reuterin concentrations  of 50, 100, and 150 units per g of creamed cottage cheese, respectively. while, 100, 150, and 250 units of reuterin per g caused reductions in l. monocytogenes counts by 2, 5, and greater than 5 log cycles, respectively. in uht skim milk with 150 units of reuterin per ml, stored at 7 degrees c, the decline in the numbers of l. monocytogenes cells was higher than that in cottage cheese. milk fat in the range of 0.5 to 3% did not affect the reuterin activity (p < or = 0.05). addition of 3% salt enhanced the lethal effect of reuterin and diminished  the initial population of l. monocytogenes by 4.5 log cycles in three days at 7 degrees c.

AB  == three eia methods (direct, indirect and sandwich eia) were studied to quantify spirosin in lactobacillus reuteri and escherichia coli cultured under various conditions in an attempt to get some insight into the function of spirosome. both direct and indirect eia were suited well for the quantitation of l. reuteri spirosin while direct eia was appropriate for spirosin of e. coli. sandwich eia could not be applied successfully in either case. by use of these methods, the amounts of spirosin produced by e. coli were determined to be 1.4, 36.2 and 46.5  micrograms per mg protein of the cell lysate under aerobic, standing and anaerobic culture conditions, respectively. since the production profile of spirosin coincided entirely with that of alcohol dehydrogenase, these findings supported the identity of spirosin to alcohol dehydrogenase in e. coli. in the same way, l. reuteri spirosin was quantified to be 73.5 and 65.4 micrograms/ mg protein of the lysate in standing and anaerobic culture, respectively. the production pattern of spirosin did not parallel that of alcohol dehydrogenase among three strains of l. reuteri, suggesting that spirosin might not be identical to alcohol dehydrogenase.

TI  == principles of ex ovo competitive exclusion and in ovo administration of lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == the data that have been presented indicate that the in ovo use of competitive exclusion (ce) agents is feasible for both chickens and turkeys. however, there are many pitfalls that await the use of in ovo application of ce agents, including the use of nonspecies-specific intestinal microbes and the use of harmful proteolytic, gas-producing and toxin-producing intestinal microbes. of the potential ce agents that have posthatch application, only lactobacillus reuteri has been shown to be safe and effective in terms of not affecting hatchability and in having a prolonged effect in the hatched chick or poult. lactobacillus reuteri administration in ovo increases its rate of intestinal colonization and decreases the colonization of salmonella and escherichia coli in both chicks and poults. additionally, mortality due to in-hatcher exposure to e.  coli or salmonella is reduced with in ovo l. reuteri. use of antibiotics in ovo may preclude the use of co-administered ce agents, but gentamicin and l. reuteri  are a compatible mixture when administered in ovo in separate compartments. nevertheless, the intestinal morphology can be affected by both the ce agent and  by antibiotics. lactobacillus reuteri both in ovo and ex ovo will increase villus height and crypt depth, and gentamicin in ovo causes a shortening and blunting of the villus. both gentamicin and l. reuteri in ovo suppress potentially pathogenic enteric microbes, but with diminished antibiotic effects shortening and blunting  of the intestinal villi does not correct itself. goblet cell numbers increase significantly on the ileum villus of chicks treated with gentamicin in ovo, and this is presumably due to the increase in potentially pathogenic bacteria in the  intestinal tract. diminishing antibiotic effects posthatch would then negatively  affect the absorption of nutrients and reduce growth at least in a transitory manner. thus, l reuteri administration in ovo singly or in combination with gentamicin followed by l reuteri via drinking water or feed appears to have potential to control many enteric pathogens in poultry. additional work in the use of in ovo ce cultures is mandated because there is a world-wide movement to reduce antibiotic use in poultry due to increased microbial resistance to antibiotics. use of naturally occurring intestinal bacterial cultures, either in  mixed culture or as single well-defined cultures, has potential for immediate use in the poultry industry.

TI  == aggregation-promoting factor in pig intestinal lactobacillus strains.
AB  == autoaggregation was frequently encountered among intestinal lactobacilli isolated from weaned pigs. the aggregation mechanism was shown to be mediated by the production of a proteinaceous aggregation-promoting factor in two strains of lactobacillus reuteri. a 32 kda aggregation-promoting protein was detected in these strains by cross-reaction with rabbit polyclonal antibodies for aggregation-promoting factor produced by the human isolate lact. plantarum 4b2. coaggregation reactions of lact. reuteri strains with pathogenic and non-pathogenic escherichia coli were detected.

TI  == the role of oral administration of oatmeal fermented by lactobacillus reuteri r2lc on bacterial translocation after acute liver failure induced by subtotal liver resection in the rat.
AB  == background: previous experimental studies showed that a disturbed ecology of the  enteric bacterial population might contribute to the occurrence of bacterial translocation from the gut in acute liver failure (alf). methods: in the present  study the effects of oral administration of exogenous lactobacillus reuteri r2lc  and oat fiber on bacterial overgrowth and translocation and on enterocyte protein contents were investigated in rats with alf induced by subtotal liver resection.  the oatmeal soup base was anaerobically inoculated with l. reuteri r2lc and fermented for 15 h. the animals were then fed with fermented or unfermented oatmeal or saline daily for 6 days before the experimental procedure. results: the incidence of bacterial translocation to the systemic circulation was nil and  17% in rats subjected to sham operation with saline or 90% hepatectomy with fermented oatmeal, respectively, and 80-90% and 34-50% in rats subjected to hepatectomy with saline or unfermented oatmeal. one rat treated with fermented oatmeal had positive bacterial growth in mesenteric lymph nodes (mln), which was  significantly lower than in hepatectomized rats with saline or unfermented oatmeal (80-100% and 50-67%). no significant differences was demonstrable between hepatectomized animals with oral administration of fermented or unfermented oatmeal as compared with sham-operated rats. the number of anaerobic bacteria, gram-negative anaerobes, and lactobacillus decreased significantly, and the number of escherichia coli increased in the distal small intestine and colon in hepatectomized animals with saline or unfermented oatmeal, as compared with animals subjected to sham operation or hepatectomy with fermented oatmeal. conclusions: the occurrence of bacterial translocation from the gut in 90% hepatectomy-induced alf could be prevented by fermented oatmeal, which implies possibilities for biologically balancing the enteric bacterial ecology.

TI  == cloning of promoter-like sequences from lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei  cg11 and their expression in escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis, and lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == fragments of chromosomal dna from lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei cg11 (formerly lactobacillus casei cg11) capable of functioning as promoters were isolated using the broad host range, promoter-probe vector pgkv210. five such fragments designated p61, p79, p80, p116, and p144 were completely sequenced and  analyzed. fragment p61 had the highest transcriptional efficiency in escherichia  coli and lactobacillus reuteri whereas p80 was the most active in lactococcus lactis. in general, the orders of the transcriptional strengths were almost identical in e. coli and lactobacillus reuteri but different from that in lactococcus lactis. mapping of the 5' end of cat mrna showed that different regions of fragments p79 and p144 were used as promoters in lactococcus lactis than in e. coli and lactobacillus reuteri. analysis of these dna sequences revealed that the putative -35 and -10 hexanucleotides resembled those of e. coli, bacillus subtilis, and lactococci. the spacing between these two hexanucleotides and between the putative -10 hexanucleotide and the transcriptional start point (a residues predominated) ranged from 17 to 18 base pairs and from 5 to 7 base pairs, respectively. each of the cloned lactobacillus  paracasei cg11 promoter-like fragments contained an at-rich sequence upstream of  the putative -35 region (from 60 to 73%).

TI  == purification of collagen-binding proteins of lactobacillus reuteri ncib 11951.
AB  == collagen type-i-binding proteins of lactobacillus reuteri ncib 11951 were purified. the cell surface proteins were affinity purified on collagen sepharose  and eluted with an nacl gradient. two protein bands were eluted from the column (29 kda and 31 kda), and both bound radio-labeled collagen type i. rabbit antisera raised against the 29 kda and 31 kda protein reacted with the affinity-purified proteins in a western blot with whole-cell extract used as antigen. the n-terminal sequence of the 29-kda and 31-kda proteins demonstrated the closest homologies with internal sequences from an escherichia coli trigger factor protein (tig.ecoli). out of nine other lactobacilli, the antisera reacted  only with the l. reuteri and not with the other species tested.

TI  == molecular characterization of a plasmid-borne (pgt633) erythromycin resistance determinant (ermgt) from lactobacillus reuteri 100-63.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri 100-63 contains a 9.8 kb plasmid (pgt633) encoding resistance to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (mls) type b antibiotics. the restriction endonucleases acci, bamhi, bcli, ecori, ecorv, hhai, hindii, hpai, kpni, sali, and sspi were employed to establish a physical map of pgt633. next, genetic transfer experiments were conducted to establish the host range of  pgt633. the results revealed that pgt633 replicated autonomously and encoded constitutive resistance to erythromycin in a variety of bacterial hosts, including bacillus subtilis bd170, streptococcus sanguis dl1, staphylococcus aureus rn4220, and enterococcus faecalis 19433, as well as several lactobacillus  spp. a 2.2 kb bamhi fragment of pgt633 containing the genetic determinant (ermgt) encoding resistance to erythromycin was cloned into escherichia coli. determination of the nucleotide sequence of ermgt revealed a methylase gene 731 bp in length that was highly related (ca. 81% nucleotide and ca. 78% amino acid identity) to the ermc gene from s. aureus plasmid pe194. the leader sequences of  ermgt and ermc were identical except for a single base change at nt 51.

TI  == single-stranded dna plasmid, vector construction and cloning of bacillus stearothermophilus alpha-amylase in lactobacillus.
AB  == vector plasmids were constructed by ligating chloramphenicol and erythromycin resistance genes to taqi-digested dna of a cryptic plasmid from lactobacillus plantarum. the minimal region of lactobacillus plasmid dna that was required for  dna replication was defined and a single-stranded dna intermediate replication system was observed. homologies with other origins of replication of plasmids from gram-positive bacteria, replicating via rolling circle mechanism, were found. it was shown that the constructed vectors, named ppsc20 and ppsc22, were transformable into l. plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli. using plasmid ppsc22, the alpha-amylase gene of bacillus stearothermophilus was cloned and expressed in several lactobacillus species.

TI  == characterization of gram-positive broad host-range plasmids carrying a thermophilic replicon.
AB  == the cryptic plasmid pbc1 (1.6 kb) isolated from bacillus coagulans zu1961 was genetically marked with the genes for chloramphenicol and ampicillin resistance (cmr and apr) from the escherichia coli plasmid pjh101. the recombinant vector obtained (pcp49, 7.0 kb) replicated and expressed cmr in b. subtilis and cmr and  apr in e. coli. different shuttle vectors for gram+ bacteria were also constructed by inserting pbc1 into the staphylococcus aureus plasmid pc194. the smallest of these, plm6 (2.8 kb), containing essentially pbc1 and the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene from pc194, replicated in b. subtilis at  a copy number of 60. by electroporation, these plasmids were introduced and stably maintained in b. subtilis, b. amyloliquefaciens, s. aureus, s. carnosus and lactobacillus reuteri.

TI  == identification and cloning of a plasmid-encoded erythromycin resistance determinant from lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == plasmid analysis, plasmid curing, cloning, and hybridization experiments were used to study four lactobacillus reuteri strains showing high resistance to erythromycin. plasmid curing with acriflavine resulted in a loss of erythromycin  resistance in a frequency of 1-10%. for three of the strains this was accompanied by a loss of a 6.9-mda plasmid, which was shown to be identical for the different strains and designated plul631. the erythromycin (erm) gene was located on a 5.5-mda plasmid in the fourth strain. a restriction map of plul631 was constructed and the location of the erm gene on the plasmid was identified by cloning in escherichia coli. by using a streptococcus lactis-e. coli shuttle vector, the erm gene was also transformed to s. lactis and expressed. the erm gene from l. reuteri was shown to be related to the erm gene from pip501 (streptococcus agalactiae) by dna-dna hybridization.

TI  == chitosan-colloidal gold complexes as polycationic probes for the detection of anionic sites by transmission and scanning electron microscopy.
AB  == a new cationic colloidal gold complex has been developed for ultrastructural localization of cell surface anionic sites by transmission and scanning electron  microscopy. the marker is prepared by labelling gold particles of suitable sizes  (6 to 70 nm in diameter) with chitosan, a polymer of beta (1----4)-linked d-glucosamine. using human red blood cells as a model, chitosan-gold complexes were shown to be specific for anionic sites and at ph 2 for sialic acid residues. the binding capacity of complexes of different sizes with carboxymethyl and phosphorylated celluloses was examined as a function of ph and ionic strength. the results indicated that these complexes can be used under acidic conditions as well as in physiological buffers. the complexes were further tested by transmission and scanning electron microscopy in detecting anionic sites on cells of various origins such as escherichia coli, lactobacillus maltaromicus, lactobacillus reuteri, saccharomyces cerevisiae, saccharomyces rouxii, schizosaccharomyces pombe, fusarium oxysporum, catharantus roseus.
