TI  - Smoking-related cotinine levels and host responses in chronic periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Smoking has been reported to increase the risk of periodontal disease by disrupting the balance of immune responses and tissue repair processes; however, this risk varies among smokers. Cotinine levels in saliva are routinely used to measure the level of smoking, and reflect the quantity of nicotine, and other smoking-related xenobiotics that challenge host systems. This study delineated characteristics of inflammatory mediators in saliva and serum antibody responses to both periodontal pathogens and commensal bacteria in smokers as they related to cotinine levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This case-control study (n = 279) examined salivary inflammatory mediator responses [interleukin (IL)-1ss, IL-10, prostaglandin E2, myeloperoxidase and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1], and serum IgG antibody responses to three periodontal pathogens (Aggregatibacter actinomyce-temcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola) and five commensal oral microorganisms (Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus sanguis, Prevotella loescheii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Capnocytophaga ochracea). RESULTS: The patients were stratified into health (n = 30), gingivitis (n = 55) and periodontitis (n = 184); cotinine levels correlated with reported smoking habits in health, less so with gingivitis, and were not correlated in periodontitis. Of the inflammatory mediators/acute phase proteins, only IL-1ss levels were positively associated (p < 0.001) with the pack years and cotinine levels. As might be predicted, patients with periodontitis smoked more (p < 0.001) and had higher levels of cotinine. IL-1ss and antibody to A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis and T. denticola were significantly higher in the patients with periodontitis than either patients with gingivitis or who were healthy. CONCLUSIONS: Generally, antibody to the pathogens and commensals was lower with decreased cotinine levels. Smoking exacerbated differences in both inflammatory mediators and three antibody in periodontal disease compared to healthy subjects.
TI  - The association between detectable plasmatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load and different subgingival microorganisms in Brazilian adults with HIV: a multilevel analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study investigates the association between detectable plasmatic  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load (HVL) and high levels of periodontal- and non-periodontal-related microorganisms in the subgingival microbiota of individuals with HIV. METHODS: Thirty-seven individuals with HIV were divided into two groups: 1) detectable HVL (n = 15); and 2) undetectable HVL (n = 22). Subgingival biofilm samples were obtained, and the levels of 35 microbial species were determined by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. Periodontal clinical measures and laboratory and sociodemographic data were also registered. chi(2) test, Fisher exact test, and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare groups. Multilevel ordinal regression models were used to test the association between HVL and the levels of 35 microbial species in subgingival biofilm, adjusted for confounders. RESULTS: Of the 35 species studied, 11 (31.4%) showed higher mean levels in the detectable HVL group than undetectable HVL group (P <0.001). These species included Actinomyces naeslundii II, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Veillonella parvula, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter concisus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Candida albicans. Significant associations between detectable HVL and high levels of microorganisms, adjusted for confounders, were observed for A. naeslundii I, Actinomyces gerencseriae, C. gingivalis, E. corrodens, C. concisus, Prevotella nigrescens, T. forsythia, and Dialister pneumosintes. CONCLUSION: Detectable plasmatic HVL in individuals with HIV was associated with elevated levels of known periodontal pathogens, such as P. nigrescens, T. forsythia, and E. corrodens, as well as C. concisus, C. gingivalis, and D. pneumosintes in the subgingival biofilm.
TI  - Distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in dogs and their owners.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Presently, a large number of individuals consider their companion animals as family members and have close contact with them in daily life. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in oral specimens taken from dogs and their owners. DESIGN: Dental plaque specimens were collected from 66 dogs and 81 members of 64 families who came to an animal clinic or dog training school in Okayama, Japan, in 2011. Bacterial DNA was extracted from each specimen and PCR analyses using primers specific for 11 periodontopathic species, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas gulae, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, and Eikenella corrodens were performed. RESULTS: P. gulae (71.2%), T. forsythia (77.3%), and C. rectus (66.7%) were frequently found in the dogs, whereas the detection rates of those species in humans were less frequent at 16.0%, 30.9%, and 21.0%, respectively. P. gulae was identified in 13 human subjects and each of their dogs was also positive for the species. Furthermore, E. corrodens and T. denticola in specimens obtained from dogs were correlated with their presence in specimens from owners who had close contact with them. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that several periodontopathic species could be transmitted between humans and their companion dogs, though the distribution of periodontopathic species in both is generally different.
TI  - Molecular detection of human periodontal pathogens in oral swab specimens from dogs in Japan.
AB  - Periodontal diseases are known to be major diseases in humans, and are also common in dogs. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution of periodontitis-related bacterial species using oral swab specimens collected from 26 pet dogs. The distribution of an animal gingival organism Porphyromonas gulae, in addition to 10 human periodontitis-related bacterial species, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, and Eikenella corrodens, were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction with species-specific sets of primers. Porphyromonas gulae, Tannerella forsythia and Campylobacter rectus were detected in almost all dogs analyzed, all of which should be regarded as common members of oral flora in dogs. Then, isolation and identification of the Porphyromonas species in swab specimens were performed. There were 35 strains isolated from 22 dogs, and broad-range polymerase chain reaction and sequencing methods revealed that approximately 70% of them were Porphyromonas gulae. In contrast, the frequency of Porphyromonas gingivalis was extremely low. These findings indicate the presence of specific periodontitis-related pathogens in pet dogs, especially Porphyromonas gulae.
TI  - Short-term periodontal and microbiological changes following orthognathic surgery.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of orthognathic surgery on the development of periodontal and microbiological changes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen consecutively treated patients with a mean age of 24.9+/-7.7 years receiving orthognathic surgery were included in the present study. Plaque index (PI) and concentrations of 11 periodonto-pathogenic bacteria were recorded one day prior to surgery (t(0)) and one week (t(1)) and six weeks (t(2)) post-surgery. In addition, a complete periodontal examination including pocket probing depth (PPD), gingival recession (GR), clinical attachment level (CAL), bleeding on probing (BOP) and width of keratinized gingiva (WKG) was conducted at t(0) and t(2). For statistical analysis, general linear model and paired t-test were applied. RESULTS: A significant increase of PI (t(0)-t(1), p=0.037) was followed by a significant decrease (t(1)-t(2), p=0.017). Apart from Eikenella corrodens (p=0.036), no significant microbiological changes were recorded. PPD significantly increased on oral sites (p=0.045) and GR especially on buccal sites (p=0.001). In the incision area the development of GR was significantly higher on the test (buccal) than on the control sites (oral). Both gingival biotypes were affected by GR. CONCLUSIONS: Orthognathic surgery causes statistically significant changes of periodontal parameters, but these changes do not necessarily impair the aesthetic appearance of the gingival margin.
TI  - Clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  - It has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. It is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. To investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the DNA-DNA hybridization technique. Actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. Factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for T. forsythia, Campylobacter rectus, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, Parvimonas micra, and Treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of A. oris, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Eikenella corrodens, Streptococcus intermedius, Selenomonas noxia, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Veillonella parvula. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while Fusobacterium nucleatum loaded on both. These findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.
TI  - IL6 -174 genotype associated with Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in Indians.
AB  - AIM: Genetic factors have recently been associated with presence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans subgingivally in populations living in industrialized countries. The aim of this study was to analyse associations between Interleukin-6 (IL6) single nucleotide polymorphisms and presence and levels of A. actinomycetemcomitans and other subgingival microbes in a rural Indian population. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 251 individuals from a rural village in India with a periodontal phenotype ranging from healthy to severe periodontitis were included. Checkerboard DNA-DNA analysis was performed to detect 40 periodontal taxa in subgingival plaque samples. Genomic DNA was extracted to genotype five polymorphisms in the IL6 promoter region. RESULTS: The IL6-74 GG genotype was associated with high (above median) counts of A. actinomycetemcomitans (both in all subjects and in periodontally healthy only) and with presence and counts of Capnocytophaga sputigena. Differences in detection of several other bacteria were noted between periodontitis and healthy subjects. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the influence of genetic factors on the subgingival microbiota.
TI  - Distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in Japanese children with developmental disabilities.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent developments in molecular biological techniques have enabled rapid detection of periodontopathic bacterial species in clinical specimens. Accumulated evidence suggests that detection of specific bacterial species enables identification of subjects at high risk for the onset of periodontitis. We investigated the distribution of 10 selected periodontopathic bacterial species in dental plaque specimens obtained from children with disabilities who were attending daycare centers. METHODS: A total of 187 children (136 boys, 51 girls) aged 1-6 years old and diagnosed with such disabilities as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and autism, participated in the study. Subgingival dental plaque specimens were collected from the buccal side of the maxillary left second primary molar after a clinical examination. Bacterial DNA was extracted from the specimens and PCR analyses were carried out to detect 10 selected periodontopathic species using specific primers for each. In addition, statistical analyses were performed to analyze the correlations among clinical parameters and the detected species. RESULTS: The most frequently detected species was Capnocytophaga sputigena (28.3%), followed by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (20.9%) and Campylobacter rectus (18.2%). Eikenella corrodens, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and Prevotella nigrescence were detected in approximately 10% of the specimens, whereas Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, and Prevotella intermedia were rarely found, and Porphyromonas gingivalis was not detected in any of the subjects. The total numbers of detected species were positively correlated with the age of the subjects. There were 10 subjects with positive reactions for T. denticola and/or T. forsythia, in whom the total number of bacterial species was significantly higher as compared to the other subjects. Furthermore, subjects possessing C. rectus showed significantly greater values for periodontal pocket depth, gingival index, and total number of species. CONCLUSION: We found that approximately one-fourth of the present subjects with disabilities who possessed at least one of T. denticola, T. forsythia, and C. rectus were at possible risk for periodontitis. Follow-up examinations as well as preventive approaches should be utilized for such individuals.
TI  - Comparison between polymerase chain reaction-based and checkerboard DNA hybridization techniques for microbial assessment of subgingival plaque samples.
AB  - AIM: To compare polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with subsequent reverse hybridization (micro-IDent test) and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization for the identification of 13 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples were taken using paper points and curettes from two sites each with pocket depth <4, 4-6 and >6 mm at baseline and 3 months in 25 periodontitis subjects and two sites in 25 periodontally healthy subjects. Samples were analysed for their content of 13 bacterial species using both assays. Similarities for each species between techniques were determined using regression analysis. Differences between health and periodontitis were determined using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty samples were evaluated using both techniques. Regression analysis indicated that 10/13 test species showed significant positive correlations between the counts determined by checkerboard analysis and levels determined by the PCR-based test after adjusting for 13 comparisons. The highest rank correlations of 0.58, 0.49 and 0.46 were seen for Treponema denticola, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Eubacterium nodatum, respectively (p<0.0001). Both tests could distinguish samples from healthy and periodontitis subjects. CONCLUSION: Detection patterns of 10/13 test species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis and healthy subjects were similar using the two molecular techniques.
TI  - Are putative periodontal pathogens reliable diagnostic markers?
AB  - Periodontitis is one of the most common chronic inflammatory diseases. A number of putative bacterial pathogens have been associated with the disease and are used as diagnostic markers. In the present study, we compared the prevalence of oral bacterial species in the subgingival biofilm of generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAP) (n = 44) and chronic periodontitis (CP) (n = 46) patients with that of a periodontitis-resistant control group (PR) (n = 21). The control group consisted of subjects at least 65 years of age with only minimal or no periodontitis and no history of periodontal treatment. A total of 555 samples from 111 subjects were included in this study. The samples were analyzed by PCR of 16S rRNA gene fragments and subsequent dot blot hybridization using oligonucleotide probes specific for Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, a Treponema denticola-like phylogroup (Treponema phylogroup II), Treponema lecithinolyticum, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium spp., and Fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as Capnocytophaga ochracea. Our data confirm a high prevalence of the putative periodontal pathogens P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, and T. forsythia in the periodontitis groups. However, these species were also frequently detected in the PR group. For most of the species tested, the prevalence was more associated with increased probing depth than with the subject group. T. lecithinolyticum was the only periodontopathogenic species showing significant differences both between GAP and CP patients and between GAP patients and PR subjects. C. ochracea was associated with the PR subjects, regardless of the probing depth. These results indicate that T. lecithinolyticum may be a diagnostic marker for GAP and C. ochracea for periodontal health. They also suggest that current presumptions of the association of specific bacteria with periodontal health and disease require further evaluation.
TI  - Does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. METHODS: Bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (BOP) was recorded at sites sampled at the four time points. RESULTS: The mean BOP at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. The corresponding mean BOP at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). Total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (P <0.01). Increased bacterial counts over time were found for Neisseria mucosa (P <0.001). Lower counts (P <0.001) were found for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. No changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. Counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola did not change. Counts of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. P. gingivalis and T. forsythia counts were associated with BOP at week 12. A decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. Only counts of N. mucosa increased.
TI  - Photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested a potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in the treatment of periodontitis. However, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of PDT in the treatment of periodontitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic effects of the adjunctive use of PDT to non-surgical periodontal treatment. METHODS: Twenty-four subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly treated with scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of PDT (test) or scaling and root planing alone (control). Full-mouth plaque score (FMPS), full-mouth bleeding score (FMBS), probing depth (PD), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (CAL) were measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months after therapy. Primary outcome variables were changes in PD and CAL. Microbiologic evaluation of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Treponema denticola, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Eubacterium nodatum, Eikenella corrodens, and Capnocytophaga spp. was performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months following therapy by using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. RESULTS: At 3 and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to CAL, PD, FMPS, or microbiologic changes. At 3 and 6 months, a statistically significantly greater improvement in FMBS was found in the test group. CONCLUSION: The additional application of a single episode of PDT to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of PD reduction and CAL gain, but it resulted in a significantly higher reduction in bleeding scores compared to scaling and root planing alone.
TI  - Photodynamic therapy as adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment in patients on periodontal maintenance: a randomized controlled clinical trial.
AB  - Recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested the potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in the treatment of periodontitis. However, currently, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of PDT in the treatment of periodontitis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of the adjunctive use of PDT in non-surgical periodontal treatment in patients receiving supportive periodontal therapy. Twenty-four patients receiving regularly supportive periodontal therapy were randomly treated with either subgingival scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of PDT (test) or subgingival scaling and root planing alone (control). The following parameters were evaluated at baseline and at 3 months and 6 months after therapy: full mouth plaque score (FMPS), full mouth bleeding score (FMBS), bleeding on probing (BOP) at experimental sites, probing pocket depth (PPD), gingival recession (REC), and clinical attachment level (CAL). Primary outcome variables were changes in PPD and CAL. Microbiological evaluation of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.), Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g.), Prevotella intermedia (P.i.), Tannerella forsythensis (T.f.), Treponema denticola (T.d.), Peptostreptococcus micros (P.m.), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F.n.), Campylobacter rectus (C.r.), Eubacterium nodatum (E.n.), Eikenella corrodens (E.c.), and Capnocytophaga species (C.s.) was also performed at baseline and at 3 months and 6 months after therapy, using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. No differences in any of the investigated parameters were observed at baseline between the two groups. At 3 months and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of PPD, CAL and FMPS. At 3 months and 6 months, a statistically significantly higher improvement of BOP was found in the test group. At 3 months after therapy, the microbiological analysis showed a statistically significant reduction of F.n. and E.n. in the test group. At 6 months, statistically significantly higher numbers of E.c. and C.s. were detected in the test group. The additional application of a single episode of PDT to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of PPD reduction and CAL gain, but it resulted in significantly higher reduction of bleeding scores than following scaling and root planing alone.
TI  - Colonization pattern of periodontal bacteria in Japanese children and their mothers.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the time of  infection by anaerobic gram-negative rods associated with periodontal disease, and to clarify their transmission from mother to child. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-eight Japanese children (including 10 siblings), aged from 3 to 9 years, and 68 mothers, were enrolled in this study. Colonization by 11 periodontal bacterial species was determined using polymerase chain reaction amplification of samples of subgingival plaque obtained from the children and their mothers. RESULTS: The detection rates of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis and Treponema denticola increased in children after the age of 6 years. We found a high consistency in colonization by P. gingivalis, T. denticola, Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens in 9 of the 10 siblings. The average number of bacterial species in plaque samples harboring Fusobacterium nucleatum and/or Fusobacterium periodonticum was significantly greater than in those without, in both children and mothers. Kappa statistical analysis revealed that the detection of Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Campylobacter rectus and T. denticola in children was consistent with that in the mother. CONCLUSION: Periodontal bacterial colonization in Japanese children increased with age and was associated with F. nucleatum and/or periodonticum, and the bacterial flora in children was similar to that in their mothers.
TI  - Microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue after plaque accumulation: an experimental study in humans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect  of the absence of tongue hygiene on the microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue. METHODS: Ten volunteers (aged 19 to 22 years) entered the study at baseline and were instructed to abstain from tongue cleaning for 7 days, followed by a period of 3 days without any kind of oral hygiene. Subsequently, a period of 21 days of washout was employed, and this protocol was repeated three times. Microbiological samples were obtained from the dorsum of the tongue at baseline and at the end of the period of coating accumulation and analyzed using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: The species found in highest mean counts at baseline and day 10 were Prevotella melaninogenica and Veillonella parvula. The mean bacterial total counts enhanced significantly during the study (from 17.1x10(6) to 33.7x10(6)). Proportions of red and blue complexes and levels of 18 species also increased after the period of coating accumulation, including several periodontal pathogens, such as Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus constellatus, Tannerella forsythensis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and P. melaninogenica. CONCLUSION: The tongue surface could be an important reservoir for periodontal pathogens and may play a role in the recolonization of tooth surfaces and in the etiology of oral halitosis.
TI  - Distribution of 10 periodontal bacteria in saliva samples from Japanese children  and their mothers.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the distribution of 10 periodontal bacteria species (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, and Treponema denticola) in children, and then compared their distribution in those children and their mothers, with special attention given to three of the species known as the red complex (P. gingivalis, T. forsythensis, and T. denticola) whose presence has been shown to be associated with conditions related to periodontal diseases. METHODS: One hundred thirteen pairs of children and their mothers were randomly selected from patients treated at the Pedodontic Clinic of Osaka University Dental Hospital. Saliva samples were taken at the second visit prior to receiving professional tooth brushing instruction. Genomic DNA was extracted from each saliva sample, followed by a polymerase chain reaction assay with species-specific sets of primers. RESULTS: A. actinomycetemcomitans was the most frequently detected species in the mothers, followed by C. sputigena, P. gingivalis, and T. forsythensis, while C. sputigena had the highest detection rate, followed by A. actinomycetemcomitans and T. denticola in the children. The detection rate of the red complex species in children whose mothers possessed the same species was significantly higher than in those whose mothers did not possess them. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a correlation between the presence of periodontal bacteria in children and their mothers, while the presence of red complex bacteria in children was highly associated with that in their mothers.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota of chronic periodontitis subjects from different geographic locations.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most clinical studies assume that the subgingival microbiota is similar from one geographic location to another. The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the composition of the subgingival microbiota in chronic periodontitis subjects from four countries. METHOD: Subjects with chronic periodontitis (N, Sweden=101; USA=115; Brazil=58; Chile=26) were recruited. Subjects were measured at baseline for plaque, gingivitis, bleeding on probing (BOP), suppuration, pocket depth (PD) and attachment level (AL) at six sites per tooth. Subgingival plaque samples taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth at baseline were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (total samples=6036). % DNA probe counts comprised by each species was determined for each site and averaged across sites in each subject. Significance of differences in proportions of each species among countries was determined using ancova adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking status. p-Values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: On average, all species were detected in samples from subjects in the four countries. Thirteen species differed significantly in adjusted mean proportions among countries even after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Porphyromonas gingivalis, one species that differed in proportions among countries, comprised adjusted means of 7.5, 11.9, 1.6 and 6.6% of the microbiota in subjects from Brazil, Chile, Sweden and USA (p<0.001), while mean proportions of Treponema denticola were 6.7, 4.2, 0.8 and 2.3, respectively (p<0.001). In contrast, a key periodontal pathogen, Tannerella forsythensis, exhibited mean proportions ranging from 6.2-8.5% and did not differ significantly among countries. Besides these species, prominent species in Brazil were Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 (8.4%, 7.2%) and Prevotella intermedia (6.5%); in Chile, Prevotella melaninogenica (6.4%) and Neisseria mucosa (5.3%); in Sweden A. naeslundii genospecies 2 (8.4%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (7.1%) and Peptostreptococcus micros (5.0%); in USA A. naeslundii genospecies 2 (7.5%), P. intermedia (6.8%) and C. gingivalis (6.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The microbial profiles of subgingival plaque samples from chronic periodontitis subjects in four countries showed surprisingly marked differences. These differences persisted after adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking status.
TI  - Occurrence of periodontal bacteria in healthy children: a 2-year longitudinal study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the occurrence of specific periodontal bacteria in children and adolescents. METHODS: Ten putative periodontal bacteria were longitudinally examined in plaque and saliva samples from 119 periodontally healthy children (2-15 years old) using a polymerase chain reaction method. RESULTS: Capnocytophaga ochracea, C. sputigena, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were frequently found in saliva, and tended to persist in saliva for the remainder of the study, whereas Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and Prevotella intermedia were rarely detected. P. nigrescens was more frequently detected in plaque and its prevalence increased with age. Eikenella corrodens and Campylobacter rectus were sometimes detected in both plaque and saliva, while Tannerella forsythensis was occasionally detected in saliva. CONCLUSION: A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. ochracea, C. sputigena, P. nigrescens, C. rectus, and E. corrodens are common members of the oral microbial flora of healthy children, whereas P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, and T. denticola appear to be transient organisms.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult Sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  - Little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. We assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult Sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. A pooled subgingival plaque sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. Whole genomic DNA probes and the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. Using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold, between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. The percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. Miswak users harbored significantly higher Streptococcus intermedius, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Veillonella parvula, Actinomyces israelii, and Capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower Selenomonas sputigena, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. Probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and V. parvula than those 4-5 mm. Our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.
TI  - Microbiological, immunological and genetic factors in family members with periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic disease, associated with hematological disorders.
AB  - The microflora, immunological profiles of host defence functions, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) findings are reported for a mother, son and daughter who were diagnosed as having 'periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic diseases, associated with hematological disorders'. Examinations were made of the bacterial flora from the periodontal pocket, neutrophil chemotaxis, neutrophil phagocytosis, and the genotypes (DQB1) and serotypes (DR locus) of HLA class II antigens. Phenotypic analyses of the peripheral lymphocytes were also conducted. The subgingival microflora from the mother was dominated by Gram-negative rods, especially Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia/Prevotella nigrescens and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Subgingival microflora samples from the son and daughter were dominated by Gram-positive cocci and Gram-positive rods. Through the use of polymerase chain reaction, Campylobacter rectus and Capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in all subjects, whereas Porphyromonas gingivalis, P. intermedia, and Treponema denticola were not detected in any subjects. All three subjects showed a remarkable level of depressed neutrophil chemotaxis to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, although their phagocyte function levels were normal, in comparison to healthy control subjects. Each subject had the same genotype, HLA-DQB1*0601, while the mother had HLA-DR2 and HLA-DR8, and the son and daughter had HLA-DR2 only. In summary, the members of this family showed a similar predisposition to periodontitis with regard to certain host defence functions. It is suggested that the depressed neutrophil chemotaxis that was identified here could be a significant risk factor for periodontitis in this family.
TI  - Periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little information is available on periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood. We assessed the prevalence by age of 10 putative periodontopathic microorganisms in periodontally healthy children using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. METHODS: Plaque samples were collected from the buccal-mesial sulcus of the first molar or second primary molar in the right upper quadrant of 144 children (2 to 13 years old, 12 subjects from each year of age) who showed negligible periodontal inflammation. Using species-specific primers of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, and Treponema denticola, PCR amplification was performed with bacterial genomic DNA from plaque samples. RESULTS: The results indicated that C. rectus, E. corrodens, A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. ochracea, and C. sputigena were found in about 50% of the plaque samples from all age groups, while B. forsythus and P. intermedia were detected less frequently, and P. gingivalis and T. denticola were not found. In contrast, the percentage of P. nigrescens-positive subjects increased with age in primary dentition, and reached about 50% at 7 years of age and older. Subject-based analyses suggested that the number of bacterial species in the plaque samples increased gradually with age until 5 years old, and then reached a plateau after the mixed dentition period. CONCLUSIONS: The colonization of many putative periodontopathic microorganisms can occur quite early in childhood without clinical signs of periodontal disease. However, colonization by P. gingivalis and T. denticola was not detected in periodontally healthy children.
TI  - Clinical periodontal findings and microflora profiles in children with chronic neutropenia under supervised oral hygiene.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This is the first known case report that used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method to help identify the oral microflora in patients with chronic neutropenia. In this study, we report clinical periodontal findings and microflora profiles of 2 children, 1 with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN, Kostmann type) and 1 with cyclic neutropenia (CN). METHODS: The SCN patient had severe gingivitis, whereas the patient with CN had mild gingivitis in the gingival margins. Monthly oral cleaning instruction and review were performed without subsequent periodontal therapy. Oral hygiene conditions remained satisfactory and visible plaque was scarce, despite the persistence of mild gingivitis. Under supervised oral hygiene, we examined the presence of periodontal pathogens from patient plaque samples. RESULTS: By a PCR-based method, Prevotella nigrescens, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter rectus, and Capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in the SCN patient and P. intermedia, C. rectus, C. gingivalis, and C. sputigena in the CN patient, suggesting the existence of periodontal pathogens. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and C. ochracea were not found in either patient. CONCLUSIONS: Use of 1% povidone iodine solution and local antibiotic application under supervised oral hygiene were helpful to improve gingival conditions in patients with chronic neutropenia.
TI  - Change in subgingival microbial profiles in adult periodontitis subjects receiving either systemically-administered amoxicillin or metronidazole.
AB  - AIM: The current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions of 40  bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples during, immediately after and up to 1 year after metronidazole or amoxicillin therapy combined with SRP. METHOD: After baseline clinical and microbiological monitoring, 17 adult periodontitis subjects received full mouth SRP and 14 days systemic administration of either metronidazole (250 mg, TID, n=8) or amoxicillin (500 mg, TID, n=9). Clinical measurements including % of sites with plaque, gingival redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration, pocket depth (PD) and attachment level (AL) were made at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth in each subject at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days and from 2 randomly selected posterior teeth at 3, 7, and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. Counts of 40 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Significance of differences over time was determined using the Quade test and between groups using ANCOVA. RESULTS: Mean PD was reduced from 3.22+/-0.12 at baseline to 2.81+/-0.16 (p<0.01) at 360 days and from 3.38+/-0.23 mm to 2.80+/-0.14 mm (p<0.01) in the amoxicillin and metronidazole treated subjects respectively. Corresponding values for mean AL were 3.21+/-0.30 to 2.76+/-0.32 (p<0.05) and 3.23+/-0.28 mm to 2.94+/-0.23 mm (p<0.01). Levels and proportions of Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola were markedly reduced during antibiotic administration and were lower than baseline levels at 360 days. Counts (x10(5), +/-SEM) of B. forsythus fell from baseline levels of 0.66+/-0.16 to 0.04+/-0.02, 0.13+/-0.04, 0.10+/-0.03 and 0.42+/-0.19 in the amoxicillin group at 14, 90, 180 and 360 days respectively (p<0.001). Corresponding values for metronidazole treated subjects were: 1.69+/-0.28 to 0.02+/-0.01, 0.20+/-0.08, 0.22+/-0.06 and 0.22+/-0.08 (p<0.001). Counts of Campylobacter species, Eubacterium nodatum, Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, F. periodonticum and Prevotella nigrescens were also detected at lower mean levels during and immediately after therapy, but gradually increased after withdrawal of the antibiotics. Members of the genera Actinomyces, Streptococcus and Capnocytophaga were minimally affected by metronidazole. However, amoxicillin decreased the counts and proportions of Actinomyces species during and after therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that metronidazole and amoxicillin are useful in rapidly lowering counts of putative periodontal pathogens, but must be accompanied by other procedures to bring about periodontal stability.
TI  - Relationship of periodontopathic bacteria with early-onset periodontitis in Down's syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Down's syndrome (DS) patients often develop severe early-onset marginal periodontitis in early adulthood; however, there is little information available on the microbiology of DS periodontitis. METHODS: Subgingival plaque specimens were taken from 67 DS young adults and 41 age-matched systemically healthy individuals with mental disabilities (MD). The prevalence of 10 possible periodontopathic bacterial species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Treponema denticola, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Campylobacter rectus, and Eikenella corrodens, were investigated in their subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction method. The detection of P. gingivalis fimA genotypes was also performed in P. gingivalis-positive samples. RESULTS: Although DS subjects generally develop an earlier and more extensive periodontal breakdown than those with MD, no significant differences were observed in the bacterial profiles. The profiles of subjects with periodontitis were significant in DS, but not in MD. The prevalence of P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, and P. intermedia were significant in the DS periodontitis group, compared to DS gingivitis group. Moreover, the occurrence of P. gingivalis with the type II fimA gene was significantly related to periodontitis in both DS and MD, with odds ratios of 6.32 and 12.03, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that early-onset periodontitis in DS is mainly due to the more susceptible host for the causative microbial agents including P. gingivalis with type II fimA.
TI  - Assessment of periradicular microbiota by DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - In the present study the "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. Thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. In Group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in Group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. The gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. Bacterial DNA was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. The mean number (+/- SD) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in Group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in Group 2 (P < 0.001). The majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from Group 1 than from Group 2. The differences were most notable for Campylobacter gracilis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Propionibacterium acnes, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, Streptococcus constellatus and Actinomyces naeslundii I. Bacterial species such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. Also, P. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. The data supported the idea that following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. The study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. The detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.
TI  - Microbiological parameters associated with IL-1 gene polymorphisms in periodontitis patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND, AIMS: Polymorphisms in the cluster of IL-1 genes have been significantly associated with the severity of adult periodontitis. The purpose of this study was to compare microbiological parameters in IL-1 genotype negative and positive adult subjects with a range of periodontitis severities. METHOD: The study included 108 subjects in good general health. Clinical parameters were recorded at 6 sites/tooth excluding 3rd molars and included: plaque accumulation, gingival erythema, bleeding on probing, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level. Subgingival plaque samples were collected from the mesiobuccal surface of up to 28 teeth in each subject (mean 25.3) providing a total of 2736 samples. The levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in each sample using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Fingerstick blood samples were collected for IL-1A (+4845) and IL-1B (+3954) genotyping using PCR-based methods. RESULTS: The proportion of IL-1 genotype positive subjects that exhibited mean counts of specific subgingival species above selected thresholds was significantly higher than the proportion of genotype negative subjects. Prominent among species that were detected at higher levels in genotype positive subjects were members of the "red" and "orange" complexes and included: Bacteroides forsythus, Treponema denticola, the Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, Fusobacterium periodonticum, Campylobacter gracilis, Campylobacter showae and Streptococcus constellatus. Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus gordonii and 3 Capnocytophaga species were also detected more frequently at high numbers in genotype positive subjects. Significantly higher mean counts of B. forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, T. denticola, the F. nucleatum subspecies, F. periodonticum, Campylobacter rectus, C. showae, Eubacterium nodatum, S. constellatus, S. gordonii, and S. intermedius were detected at periodontal pockets >6 mm in subjects who were genotype positive when compared with genotype negative subjects. The increase was due to increased numbers of cells of these species rather than a major shift in proportion. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that genotype positive subjects more frequently had higher levels of "red" and "orange" complex species that are known to be strongly associated with measures of periodontal inflammation.
TI  - "Checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum IgG responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. METHODS: One hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). Smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject; 2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic DNA probes. Serum IgG antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. RESULTS: Cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. Corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. Heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). Higher levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella melaninogenica, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola, Eubacterium nodatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of Eikenella corrodens, Veillonella parvula, and Actinomyces naeslundii in controls. Cases displayed higher IgG levels against P. gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against F. nucleatum, T. denticola, E. nodatum, and Capnocytophaga ochracea. Positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. In cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species out of which only one was positive (V. parvula). Both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. A logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. Smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. CONCLUSION: A combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.
TI  - Periodontopathic bacteria in children with Down syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is widely known that individuals with Down syndrome (DS) often develop severe early-onset periodontal diseases. In this study, we examined the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in DS children to determine if specific pathogens are acquired in their childhood. METHODS: The subjects were 60 DS children (2 to 13 years old, 5 in each age bracket) and 60 age-matched controls. Ten pathogens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Treponema denticola, Prevotella intermedia, P nigrescens, Capnocytophaga ochracea, C. sputigena, Campyrobacter rectus, and Eikenella corrodens were surveyed in subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction. Periodontal status was evaluated by probing depth, bleeding on probing, and gingival index. RESULTS: No significant difference in periodontal status was observed between the DS and control groups, however, all of the pathogens were detected with greater frequency in the DS children. B. forsythus, T. denticola, P. nigrescens, and C. rectus were significantly prevalent throughout all age brackets of the DS children (P <0.01 or 0.05). The occurrence of P. gingivalis was also significant in the DS subjects over 5 years old. A cluster analysis of the microbial profiles of the DS subjects showed that gingivitis severity was associated with increased varieties of the harboring pathogens and the distribution of P. gingivalis. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that various periodontopathogens can colonize in the very early childhood of DS patients and maturation of subgingival components, including P. gingivalis, plays an important role in the initiation of gingival inflammation.
TI  - Microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  - It has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. The purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. The presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. Similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. Community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. One complex consisted of the tightly related group: Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola. The 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the Fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Peptostreptococcus micros. Species associated with this group included: Eubacterium nodatum, Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter showae, Streptococcus constellatus and Campylobacter gracilis. The 3rd complex consisted of Streptococcus sanguis, S. oralis, S. mitis, S. gordonii and S. intermedius. The 4th complex was comprised of 3 Capnocytophaga species, Campylobacter concisus, Eikenella corrodens and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. The 5th complex consisted of Veillonella parvula and Actinomyces odontolyticus. A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, Selenomonas noxia and Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (A. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. The 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.
TI  - Oral food consumption and subgingival microorganisms: subgingival microbiota of gastrostomy tube-fed children and healthy controls.
AB  - This study examined the effect of oral food consumption on the prevalence and levels of subgingival bacteria and yeasts in 20 gastrostomy tube-fed children and 24 healthy controls. Microbial identification was carried out using anaerobic culture and 16S rRNA-based PCR identification methods. Streptococcal and Actinomyces species were recovered from 100% and 76% of all subjects and averaged 66% and 11% of total cultivable organisms, respectively. In decreasing order of prevalence, Fusobacterium, enteric rods, Prevotella intermedia/Prevotella nigrescens, Capnocytophaga, Propionibacterium, yeasts, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Campylobacter rectus, Bacteroides forsythus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in 48% to 2% of the study subjects. The cultivable levels of these species varied widely among subjects. PCR detection showed C. rectus and Eikenella corrodens both to occur in 93% of the study subjects and to be the most prevalent putative periodontal pathogens examined. In decreasing order of prevalence, PCR identified Treponema denticola, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. nigrescens, P. intermedia, B. forsythus, and P. gingivalis in 38% to 21% of the subjects studied. Tube-fed children and healthy controls exhibited similar subgingival microbial compositions. It appears from this study that oral food consumption is not a major determinant for the establishment of subgingival microbiota in children.
TI  - Characterization of protease activities in Capnocytophaga spp., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Treponema denticola and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Protease activities in cell sonicates of defined bacterial strains were examined  using peptide substrates and class-specific inhibitors. Capnocytophaga spp. all produced serine dipeptidyl peptidase activity and arginine/lysine, elastase- and chymotrypsin-like enzymes with some metalloprotease characteristics. The elastase-like activity was strongest in Capnocytophaga sputigena, but the others were greatest in Capnocytophaga gingivalis. The latter also had a separate arginine-specific enzyme which appeared not to be present in the other two species. Porphyromonas gingivalis showed serine dipeptidyl peptidase activity and very strong arginine and lysine cysteine protease activities. Prevotella spp. had inhibitor-resistant dipeptidyl peptidase activity and arginine cysteine protease activity that was much weaker but biochemically similar to P. gingivalis. Treponema denticola possessed a strong trypsin-like serine protease activity as well as very weak dipeptidyl peptidase and chymotrypsin-like activities that were sensitive to some cysteine protease reagents. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans showed a novel alanine- and lysine-specific activity, but its nature was unclear.
TI  - Degradation of host protease inhibitors and activation of plasminogen by proteolytic enzymes from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola.
AB  - Bacterial proteases may participate in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases through their action on host proteins. In the present study, the ability of selected periodontopathogens, as well as two proteases isolated from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola, to degrade host protease inhibitors was evaluated. The activation of human plasminogen by the two bacterial proteases was also investigated. Proteolytic breakdown of host protease inhibitors (alpha-1-antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, antithrombin III, antiplasmin and cystatin C) was evaluated by SDS-PAGE. The 80 kDa trypsin-like protease of P. gingivalis completely digested the six protease inhibitors under investigation, whereas the 95 kDa chymotrypsin-like protease of T. denticola was slightly less active, more particularly on alpha 2-macroglobulin and cystatin C. When whole cells from a number of oral bacterial species were tested, the most significant degradation was obtained with P. gingivalis, T. denticola, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Capnocytophaga spp. Peptostreptococcus micros and Propionibacterium acnes had only some degradative activity on selected inhibitors, whereas three bacterial species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus and Fusobacterium nucleatum, had no effect on the protease inhibitors. The 80 kDa protease of P. gingivalis demonstrated strong plasminogen activation, whereas no such activity was associated with the 95 kDa protease of T. denticola. This study indicates the high potential of some periodontal pathogens to destroy protease inhibitors and activate plasminogen. This may result in an uncontrolled degradation of periodontal tissues and a rapid progression of the disease.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Treponema denticola detection in oral plaque samples using the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Detection of putative pathogens is critical for delineating the etiology and progression of periodontitis. In the present study, we have used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay utilizing primers specific for the lkt A gene of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, the fimbrial gene of Porphyromonas gingivalis, and tdp A gene of Treponema denticola in order to determine the presence of these pathogens in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites. These gene specific primers were also used to assess the detection of different strains of bacteria in the PCR assays. Primers for P. gingivalis detected P. gingivalis strain 33277, but no product was detected when primers were used with extracts from 4 species of Capnocytophaga, 3 species of Prevotella, 2 species of Porphyromonas other than P. gingivalis, Bacteroides levii, Escherichia coli, 3 strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans and 3 strains of T. denticola. PCR analysis using primers for the lkt A gene of A. actinomycetemcomitans also did not result in a product with any of these bacteria with the exception of a positive result with 3 different strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans. Primers selected from the tdp A gene of T. denticola did not identify any of the bacteria strains tested except T. denticola serovars a, b, and c. Thus, these primers were shown to amplify gene segments that are specific to either P. gingivalis (33277), A. actinomycetemcomitans (33384, 43717 and 43718) or T. denticola (35405, 33521 and 35404). The PCR assay may be used to rapidly detect the presence of periodontal pathogens in the future.
TI  - Comparison of host tissue and bacterial dipeptidyl peptidases in human gingival crevicular fluid by analytical isoelectric focusing.
AB  - Earlier work has shown that gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) contains dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) activities that resemble those in host tissue. Here, further comparisons were made with enzymes from suspected periodontal pathogens. Gingival tissue and GCF were collected from patients with chronic periodontitis. DPP II and DPP IV fractions with acid and alkaline pH optima, respectively, were separated from crude tissue extracts by gel-filtration chromatography. Bacterial cell sonicates were prepared from broth cultures of reference strains. There was moderate to strong DPP activity with Capnocytophaga spp., Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella spp., very weak activity with Treponema denticola and no detectable activity with Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or Fusobacterium nucleatum. Banding patterns in GCF, tissue and bacterial samples were compared on substrate-impregnated overlay membranes applied to isoelectric focusing gels. In gels washed with acid buffer, GCF had bands corresponding to tissue DPP II. Use of an alkaline washing buffer showed GCF activity which closely matched tissue DPP IV that had been pretreated with neuraminidase, an enzyme found by others in the gingival crevice. P. Gingivalis gave multiple bands and several of these had counterparts in GCF. The apparent presence in GCF of the DPP from P. gingivalis is consistent with the association of this organism with destructive periodontitis.
TI  - Effect of proteolytic enzymes on the lysis and growth of oral bacteria.
AB  - Previous studies have shown increased levels of proteolytic enzymes in affected periodontal sites. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of proteolytic environments on the lysis and growth of selected oral bacteria associated with either healthy or diseased periodontal sites. The effect of trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K on cell lysis was determined following incubation with bacteria, whereas the effect of the same proteolytic enzymes on bacterial growth was tested using a disc-plate technique. Overall, gram-positive bacteria appeared to be more resistant to lysis than gram-negative bacteria. The most susceptible bacteria were Actinomyces spp., Eubacterium saburreum, Prevotella intermedia, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella loescheii, Treponema denticola and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. The disc-plate procedure indicated that the growth of Actinomyces spp., E. saburreum, C. ochracea, P. intermedia, P. loescheii, Porphyromonas gingivalis and T. denticola were the most affected, more particularly by chymotrypsin and proteinase K. Interestingly, the growth of F. nucleatum was rather stimulated by proteolytic enzymes. The observations reported in this investigation indicate that specific and general proteolytic activities have the ability to lyse some oral bacterial species and to interfere with their growth. It is suggested that such effects could represent new mechanisms by which the bacterial ecology of subgingival sites may be affected.
TI  - Detection of Porphyromonas gingivalis in gingival exudate by a dipeptide-enhanced trypsin-like activity.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque is an important risk factor for future periodontal attachment loss in susceptible adults. The elimination of P. gingivalis is usually concomitant with a healing process. Therefore, it should be valuable to have an easy chairside method to follow the effect of periodontal treatment on P. gingivalis detection as well as on its eventual reappearance during the maintenance period. We have previously reported the stimulation of amidolytic activity of P. gingivalis by the addition of glycyl-glycine to the assay buffer. In this study we determined the proportions of P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Capnocytophaga spp, Campylobacter rectus, and Eikenella corrodens by cultivation technique and the amidolytic activity, using N-benzoyl-L-arginine-p-nitroanilide (BAPNA) as substrate, in gingival exudate before and during a 3-year treatment and maintenance period. P. gingivalis was the only species yielding a high and persistent correlation to stimulated amidolytic activity (P values < or = 0.0001) on both site (r = 0.5) and subject (r = 0.8) level. Testing pure cultures of suggested periodontal pathogens for effect of glycyl-glycine on amidolytic activity, we found that of P. gingivalis to be 5.9-fold increased. The amidolytic activity of Treponema denticola was only slightly stimulated (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 1.2) and that of Capnocytophaga slightly inhibited (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 0.8). The outcome of this study has the potential to be used for the development of a simple, rapid, and inexpensive assay for a qualitative and quantitative determination of P. gingivalis in gingival crevicular fluid.
TI  - The effects of Acacia arabica gum on the in vitro growth and protease activities  of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of acacia gum was assessed using fresh isolates and reference strains of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga spp., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Treponema denticola. A fine aqueous suspension of gum was produced by sonication and then a soluble fraction isolated by centrifugation and membrane filtration. These preparations were incorporated into columbia agar at doubling concentrations. Growth of P. gingivalis and P. intermedia cultures on the agar was inhibited by whole gum sonicate at concentrations of 0.5-1.0% w/v. Both species showed reduced susceptibility when horse blood was present in the agar. The gum soluble fraction did not inhibit growth of any bacterial culture. The effect of acacia on bacterial proteases was examined with cell sonicates from log phase broth cultures. Enzyme activities were determined by fluorimetric assay with various synthetic peptide substrates. Most protease activities reduced in the presence of 0.5% w/v gum sonicate, with the trypsin-like activities of P. gingivalis and P. intermedia proving most sensitive. The gum soluble fraction was nearly always less inhibitory than the sonicate. The action of acacia gum against suspected periodontal pathogens and their enzymes suggests that it may be of clinical value.
