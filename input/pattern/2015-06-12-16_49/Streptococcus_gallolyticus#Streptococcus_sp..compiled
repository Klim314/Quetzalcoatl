TI  - Streptococcus gallolyticus Pil3 pilus is required for adhesion to colonic mucus and for colonization of mouse distal colon.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus is an increasing cause of bacteremia and infective endocarditis in the elderly. Several epidemiological studies have associated the presence of this bacterium with colorectal cancer (CRC). We have studied the interaction of S. gallolyticus with human colonic cells. S. gallolyticus strain UCN34 adhered better to mucus producing cells such as HT-29-MTX than to the parental HT-29 cells. Attachment to colonic mucus is dependent on the pil3 pilus operon, which is heterogeneously expressed in the wild-type UCN34 population. We constructed a pil3 deletion mutant in a Pil3 overexpressing variant (Pil3+) and were able to demonstrate the role of Pil3 pilus in binding to colonic mucus. Importantly, we showed that pil3 deletion mutant was unable to colonize mice colon as compared to the isogenic Pil3+ variant. Our findings establish for the first time a murine model of intestinal colonization by S. gallolyticus.
TI  - Potential Transmission Pathways of Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus), a member of group D streptococci, is an inhabitant of the animal and human gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, it is a facultative pathogen which causes e.g. endocarditis, septicemia and mastitis. S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus may be transmitted either directly or indirectly between animals and humans. However, the transmission routes are an unsolved issue. In this study, we present systematic analyses of an S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolate of an infective endocarditis patient in relation to isolates of his laying hen flock. Isolates from pooled droppings of laying hens, pooled dust samples and human blood culture were characterized by using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and DNA fingerprinting. MLST revealed the same allelic profile of isolates from the human blood culture and from the droppings of laying hens. In addition, these isolates showed clonal identity regarding a similar DNA fingerprinting pattern. For the first time, we received a hint that transmission of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus between poultry and humans may occur. This raises the question about the zoonotic potential of isolates from poultry and should be considered in future studies.
TI  - Draft Genome Sequence of Erythromycin-Resistant Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus NTS 31106099 Isolated from a Patient with Infective Endocarditis and Colorectal Cancer.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is known for its close association with infective endocarditis and colorectal cancer in humans. Here, we report the draft genome sequence of highly erythromycin-resistant strain NTS 31106099 isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis and colorectal cancer.

TI  - Mycoplasma columbinum Isolated From a Racing Pigeon ( Columba livia ) With Arthritis.
AB  - A juvenile racing pigeon ( Columba livia ) was presented with drooping of the wing and inability to fly. On physical examination, the right shoulder joint was swollen. The pigeon was euthanatized and submitted for necropsy. An excessive amount of fibrin was present in the canalis triosseus with severe arthritis of the affected shoulder joint. A pure growth of Mycoplasma-like colonies was obtained on microbiological culture of the shoulder joint. A 16S ribosomal RNA gene-specific polymerase chain reaction assay was performed on the isolate and revealed 100% similarity with Mycoplasma columbinum . Although infectious arthritis in homing pigeons is primarily associated with paratyphoid and Streptococcus gallolyticus infection, clinical practitioners should consider the potential role of Mycoplasma columbinum in arthritis in pigeons.

TI  - Quantitative profiling of colorectal cancer-associated bacteria reveals associations between fusobacterium spp., enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) and clinicopathological features of colorectal cancer.
AB  - Various studies have presented clinical or in vitro evidence linking bacteria to  colorectal cancer, but these bacteria have not previously been concurrently quantified by qPCR in a single cohort. We quantify these bacteria (Fusobacterium spp., Streptococcus gallolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF), Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), and afaC- or pks-positive E. coli) in paired tumour and normal tissue samples from 55 colorectal cancer patients. We further investigate the relationship between a) the presence and b) the level of colonisation of each bacterial species with site and stage of disease, age, gender, ethnicity and MSI-status. With the exception of S. gallolyticus, we detected all bacteria profiled here in both tumour and normal samples at varying frequencies. ETBF (FDR = 0.001 and 0.002 for normal and tumour samples) and afaC-positive E. coli (FDR = 0.03, normal samples) were significantly enriched in the colon compared to the rectum. ETBF (FDR = 0.04 and 0.002 for normal and tumour samples, respectively) and Fusobacterium spp. (FDR = 0.03 tumour samples) levels were significantly higher in late stage (III/IV) colorectal cancers. Fusobacterium was by far the most common bacteria detected, occurring in 82% and 81% of paired tumour and normal samples. Fusobacterium was also the only bacterium that was significantly higher in tumour compared to normal samples (p = 6e-5). We also identified significant associations between high-level colonisation by Fusobacterium and MSI-H (FDR = 0.05), age (FDR = 0.03) or pks-positive E. coli (FDR = 0.01). Furthermore, we exclusively identified atypical EPEC in our cohort, which has not been previously reported in association with colorectal cancer. By quantifying colorectal cancer-associated bacteria across a single cohort, we uncovered inter- and intra-individual patterns of colonization not previously recognized, as well as important associations with clinicopathological features, especially in the case of Fusobacterium and ETBF.
TI  - Neonatal invasive Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus infection with delayed central nervous system complications.
AB  - Group D streptococci are known to cause newborn septicemia and meningitis, but the Streptococcus bovis group strains rarely cause serious neonatal infections in Korea. Central nervous system (CNS) complications of neonatal S. bovis group infection have rarely been reported. In adults, S. bovis group strains cause bacteremia and endocarditis, and are associated with gastrointestinal malignancy. However, only a few studies have reported meningitis and septicemia in infants. Here, we describe a case of bacteremia and meningitis due to Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus with a delayed CNS complication in an infant. A 28-day-old male infant was admitted to the hospital with a 1-day history of fever. Cultures of blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine showed the presence of S. bovis group strain-S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus. He was discharged after 21 days of intravenous ampicillin and cefotaxime administration. Two weeks later, he was readmitted with a fever and short episodes of tonic-clonic movements. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed marked bilateral frontal subdural effusion. He was discharged after 31 days of antibiotic therapy, and no neurological sequelae were observed at the 9-month follow-up. In conclusion, we present a rare case of neonatal S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus infection causing urinary tract infection, septicemia, meningitis, and delayed CNS complications. This case emphasizes the need for physicians to be aware of S. bovis infection in infants.
TI  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus infection in twin infants.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, previously known as Streptococcus bovis biotype II.2, is an uncommon pathogen in neonates. Nevertheless, it can cause severe neonatal sepsis and meningitis often clinically indistinguishable from those caused by group B streptococci and has been associated with considerable morbidity. We report the first known cases of S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus infection in twin infants.
TI  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus from human and animal origins: genetic diversity, antimicrobial susceptibility, and characterization of a vancomycin-resistant calf isolate carrying a vanA-Tn1546-like element.
AB  - The aim of this work was to characterize the antibiotic susceptibility and genetic diversity of 41 Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates: 18 isolates obtained from animals and 23 human clinical isolates. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by the semiautomatic Wider system and genetic diversity by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with SmaI. Animal isolates grouped separately in the PFGE analysis, but no statistical differences in antimicrobial resistance were found between the two groups. The LMG 17956 sequence type 28 (ST28) strain recovered from the feces of a calf exhibited high levels of resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin (MIC, >/=256 mg/liter). Its glycopeptide resistance mechanism was characterized by Southern blot hybridization and a primer-walking strategy, and finally its genome, determined by whole-genome sequencing, was compared with four closely related S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus genomes. Hybridization experiments demonstrated that a Tn1546-like element was integrated into the bacterial chromosome. In agreement with this finding, whole-genome sequencing confirmed a partial deletion of the vanY-vanZ region and partial duplication of the vanH gene. The comparative genomic analyses revealed that the LMG 17956 ST28 strain had acquired an unusually high number of transposable elements and had experienced extensive chromosomal rearrangements, as well as gene gain and loss events. In conclusion, S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates from animals seem to belong to lineages separate from those infecting humans. In addition, we report a glycopeptide-resistant isolate from a calf carrying a Tn1546-like element integrated into its chromosome.
TI  - Is Streptococcus bovis a urinary pathogen?
AB  - The Streptococcus bovis group (SBG) comprises several microorganisms associated with human infections. They have been associated with bacteremia, endocarditis, biliary tract infection, meningitis, and colorectal cancer, but their role as urinary pathogens is not well known. The objective of this investigation was to discover the incidence and clinical significance of the bacteriuria associated with this complex. A retrospective analysis of all adult patients with bacteriuria caused by SBG during the period 1995-2012 was carried out. During the study period, SBG was isolated in 153 adult patients, who had a mean age of 67 years, most of them being women (80%). Most of our patients (65%) had some underlying disease, with urologic disease being the most common (37%), followed by diabetes mellitus (27%) and neurologic disease (25%). Among the 88 patients in whom we were able to correctly assess symptoms, 45% had asymptomatic bacteriuria, 35% had lower urinary tract infection, and 20% had upper urinary tract infection. In 14 cases (9%), SBG was also isolated in blood cultures. Most of the isolates of SBG (72%) were S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, 98% to nitrofurantoin, and 77% to fosfomycin. Although SBG bacteriuria is uncommon, it should not always be taken as a contaminant, mainly when S. pasteurianus is isolated, because it may cause urinary tract infections and, occasionally, sepsis, whereas when S. gallolyticus is isolated from urine, it may be a marker of underlying endocarditis and colorectal cancer.
TI  - Genetic and biochemical approaches towards unravelling the degradation of gallotannins by Streptococcus gallolyticus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Herbivores have developed mechanisms to overcome adverse effects of dietary tannins through the presence of tannin-resistant bacteria. Tannin degradation is an unusual characteristic among bacteria. Streptococcus gallolyticus is a common tannin-degrader inhabitant of the gut of herbivores where plant tannins are abundant. The biochemical pathway for tannin degradation followed by S. gallolyticus implies the action of tannase and gallate decarboxylase enzymes to produce pyrogallol, as final product. From these proteins, only a tannase (TanBSg) has been characterized so far, remaining still unknown relevant proteins involved in the degradation of tannins. RESULTS: In addition to TanBSg, genome analysis of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strains revealed the presence of an additional protein similar to tannases, TanASg (GALLO_0933). Interestingly, this analysis also indicated that only S. gallolyticus strains belonging to the subspecies "gallolyticus" possessed tannase copies. This observation was confirmed by PCR on representative strains from different subspecies. In S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus the genes encoding gallate decarboxylase are clustered together and close to TanBSg, however, TanASg is not located in the vicinity of other genes involved in tannin metabolism. The expression of the genes enconding gallate decarboxylase and the two tannases was induced upon methyl gallate exposure. As TanBSg has been previously characterized, in this work the tannase activity of TanASg was demonstrated in presence of phenolic acid esters. TanASg showed optimum activity at pH 6.0 and 37 degrees C. As compared to the tannin-degrader Lactobacillus plantarum strains, S. gallolyticus presented several advantages for tannin degradation. Most of the L. plantarum strains possessed only one tannase enzyme (TanBLp), whereas all the S. gallolytcius subsp. gallolyticus strains analyzed possesses both TanASg and TanBSg proteins. More interestingly, upon methyl gallate induction, only the tanB Lp gene was induced from the L. plantarum tannases; in contrast, both tannase genes were highly induced in S. gallolyticus. Finally, both S. gallolyticus tannase proteins presented higher activity than their L. plantarum counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: The specific features showed by S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus in relation to tannin degradation indicated that strains from this subspecies could be considered so far the best bacterial cellular factories for tannin degradation.
TI  - Complementarity between targeted real-time specific PCR and conventional broad-range 16S rDNA PCR in the syndrome-driven diagnosis of infectious diseases.
AB  - Molecular tools have shown an added value in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, in particular for those caused by fastidious intracellular microorganisms, or in patients receiving antibiotics before sampling. If 16S rDNA amplification had been gradually implemented in microbiology laboratories, specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) would have permitted an increase in the sensitivity of molecular methods and a reduction of contamination. Herein, we report our experience in the diagnosis of infectious diseases over two years, during which 32,948 clinical samples from 18,056 patients were received from France and abroad. Among these samples, 81,476 PCRs were performed, of which 1,192 were positive. Molecular techniques detected intracellular microorganisms in 31.3 % of respiratory samples, 27.8 % of endocarditis samples and 51.9 % of adenitis samples. Excluding intracellular bacteria, 25 % of the positive samples in this series were sterile in culture. Conventional broad-range PCR permitted the identification of fastidious and anaerobic microorganisms, but specific real-time PCR showed a significant superiority in the diagnosis of osteoarticular infections, in particular for those caused by Kingella kingae and Staphylococcus aureus, and for endocarditis diagnosis, specifically when Streptococcus gallolyticus and Staphylococcus aureus were involved. The sensitivity of conventional broad-range PCR was 62.9 % concerning overall diagnoses for which both techniques had been performed. These findings should lead microbiologists to focus on targeted specific real-time PCR regarding the clinical syndrome. Finally, syndrome-driven diagnosis, which consists of testing a panel of microorganisms commonly involved for each syndrome, permitted the establishment of 31 incidental diagnoses.
TI  - Genomics, evolution, and molecular epidemiology of the Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC).
AB  - The Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC) is a group of human and animal derived streptococci that are commensals (rumen and gastrointestinal tract), opportunistic pathogens or food fermentation associates. The classification of SBSEC has undergone massive changes and currently comprises 7 (sub)species grouped into four branches based on sequences identities: the Streptococcus gallolyticus, the Streptococcus equinus, the Streptococcus infantarius and the Streptococcus alactolyticus branch. In animals, SBSEC are causative agents for ruminal acidosis, potentially laminitis and infective endocarditis (IE). In humans, a strong association was established between bacteraemia, IE and colorectal cancer. Especially the SBSEC-species S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is an emerging pathogen for IE and prosthetic joint infections. S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus and the S. infantarius branch are further associated with biliary and urinary tract infections. Knowledge on pathogenic mechanisms is so far limited to colonization factors such as pili and biofilm formation. Certain strain variants of S. gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus and S. infantarius subsp. infantarius are associated with traditional dairy and plant-based food fermentations and display traits suggesting safety. However, due to their close relationship to virulent strains, their use in food fermentation has to be critically assessed. Additionally, implementing accurate and up-to-date taxonomy is critical to enable appropriate treatment of patients and risk assessment of species and strains via recently developed multilocus sequence typing schemes to enable comparative global epidemiology. Comparative genomics revealed that SBSEC strains harbour genomics islands (GI) that seem acquired from other streptococci by horizontal gene transfer. In case of virulent strains these GI frequently encode putative virulence factors, in strains from food fermentation the GI encode functions that are pivotal for strain performance during fermentation. Comparative genomics is a powerful tool to identify acquired pathogenic functions, but there is still an urgent need for more physiological and epidemiological data to understand SBSEC-specific traits.

TI  - [A case of Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus infective endocarditis  with colon adenoma].
AB  - An 80-year-old Japanese man had a fall presented with a 3-week history of right lumbago exacerbated by body movement as well as a 1-week history of anomalous behavior and appetite loss. He visited our hospital complaining of difficulty in standing up. He had a history of mitral prolapse due to an unknown rupture of the chordae tendineae 3 years earlier, which resulted in moderate mitral valve regurgitation and atrial fibrillation. Upon visiting the hospital, he had petechial hemorrhage and jaundice of the conjunctiva, a systolic murmur (Levine II/VI) at the apex and 4th interspace of the left sternal border, and a positive right straight leg raising test result. Moderate bilirubinemia and disseminated intravascular coagulation which were considered to have been produced secondarily were observed. Infective endocarditis was suspected, and 3 sets of blood culture were extracted. The patient was admitted on the same day. Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (6/6) on the following day. Transesophagela echocardiography was carried out on the same day, and vegetation with a diameter of 4mm was observed in the anterior mitral leaflet; the patient was subsequently diagnosed as having infective endocarditis. Colonic endoscopy was performed after hospitalization. Twelve colonic adenomata were found, and endoscopic mucosal resection was performed on one polyp. The bacterium found in the culture was classified as Streptococcus bovis type I, which causes infective endocarditis and bacteremia. Furthermore, this bacteria is a relatively rare causative organism of infective endocarditis. Tolerance to macrolide and tetracycline are reported in the literature. Moreover, the cell wall of this bacterium may have low pathogenicity as well as cause chronic inflammation in the large intestine mucous membrane, colonic polyps, and colorectal cancer. Several colonic adenomata and a partial shift to a malignant pathology were observed in this case. When this bacterium is detected, searching for a pathological change in the large intestine is believed to be indispensable.
TI  - Childhood meningitis caused by Streptococcus bovis group: clinical and biologic data during a 12-year period in France.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial meningitis (BM) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Sporadic cases of Streptococcus bovis have been described in neonates and infants. To assess the epidemiologic, clinical and biologic characteristics of this meningitis, we used the French Surveillance Network for BM in children. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-seven pediatric wards working with 168 microbiology departments throughout France were asked to report all cases of BM in patients <18 years. Diagnosis was based on a combination of fever, meningeal signs and a positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture and/or a positive polymerase chain reaction in the CSF and/or positive blood culture associated with pleiocytosis. RESULTS: Among 4806 cases of BM recorded in 12 years (2001-2012), 23 cases were caused by S. bovis (0.5%). All were infants. Among them, 15 cases (65.2%) occurred in the neonatal period. The majority occurred in premature infants (73.9%). In 21 cases, the diagnosis was based on a positive CSF culture. Blood culture was positive in 17 children. When S. bovis subtype was identified, it was type 2 (Streptococcus gallolyticus pasteurianus) in 80% of cases. All infants received antibiotic therapy with parenteral penicillin and/or third-generation cephalosporin combined with an aminoglycoside. The duration of treatment ranged from 10 to 25 days. Of the 23 patients, 17 (73.9%) had a second lumbar puncture and in all those cases, the CSF was sterile. No deaths or neurologic complications were reported. CONCLUSION: BM due to S. bovis is rare and primarily affects infants, particularly premature infants. Antibiotic treatment is effective with low morbidity and mortality.
TI  - Acute septicemia caused by Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus in turkey poults.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus, previously known as Streptococcus bovis biotypes I and II/2, is a well-known cause of sepsis and meningitis in humans and birds. The present case report describes an outbreak of fatal septicemia associated with S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (S. bovis biotype II/2) in 11 turkey flocks in Pennsylvania between 2010 and 2013. Affected poults were 2-3 wk of age. Major clinical observation was sudden increase in mortality among turkey poults without any premonitory clinical signs. Postmortem examination findings revealed acute septicemia with lesions such as fibrinous pericarditis, meningitis, splenic multifocal fibrinoid necrosis, hepatitis, osteochondritis, myositis, and airsacculitis. Gram-positive cocci were isolated from several organs by routine bacterial culture. Biotyping identified bacteria as streptococci, whereas 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing identified them as S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus. Antibiotic susceptibility profiles revealed that all the strains isolated were sensitive to penicillin and erythromycin with different sensitivity profiles for other antibacterial agents tested. The present study reports the first confirmed case of acute septicemia in turkey poults caused by S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus.
TI  - [Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection of a apheresis platelet concentrate  with Streptococcus gallolyticus: Analysis of one case].
AB  - Bacterial infections are uncommon complications of the blood products transfusion but they are potentially serious. Many advances have been done over the past few years to guarantee the microbiological security of blood products as the donors selection with a medical talk, the derivation of the first 30 millilitres blood during the donation, the deleucocytation of blood products... But in spite of these advances, cases of bacterial infection always remain. The purpose of this study was to point out the platelet concentrate's transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection with Streptococcus gallolyticus and the unusual consequence for the donor by uncovering an asymptomatic rectal neoplastic tumor. This study as raised as to whether the usefulness of systematic bacterial inactivation in the platelets concentrates.
TI  - Infective endocarditis caused by Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus and colon cancer.
AB  - A 56-year-old man presented to our department with a 2-month history of fever and chills. He had received a mitral valvuloplasty 3 years ago. He had been administered levofloxacin for 2 months. We discontinued levofloxacin and repeated the blood cultures. Bacterial blood cultures were positive and transoesophageal echocardiography revealed vegetation attached to the posterior mitral leaflet. We started the patient on intravenous antibiotic therapy for infectious endocarditis by Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus. A colonoscopic screening revealed adenomatoid intracellular carcinoma. Previous studies have reported a weak association between colorectal cancer and Streptococcus bovis biotype II/2, which includes S gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus; however, the rate is notably higher than the rate of colorectal cancer as indicated by positive faecal occult-blood test results. We conclude that colonoscopies should be routine while scanning for colorectal cancer in all patients with S bovis bacteraemia, regardless of the subspecies.
TI  - Development and application of a multilocus sequence typing scheme for Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (formerly known as S. bovis biotype I) is a commensal of the gastrointestinal tract in animals and in up to 15% of healthy humans. Furthermore, it is a facultative pathogen that can cause infectious endocarditis, mastitis, and septicemia. The number of infections is increasing, but the transmission routes and zoonotic potential remain unknown. To assess the zoonotic potential and characterize the epidemiological structure of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, we established a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme. We amplified and sequenced internal fragments of seven housekeeping genes. The resulting sequences were analyzed with BioNumerics software 6.6 by using the unweighted-pair group method using average linkages algorithm. A total of 101 S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strains isolated from animals, humans, and environmental samples were analyzed and divided into 50 sequence types. Our first results highlight the importance of this MLST scheme for investigating the epidemiology, transmission patterns, and infection chains of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus.
TI  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus meningitis in an infant.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus was formerly classified as S. bovis biotype II/2, which is recognized as a rare cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis. Since the taxonomy classification change, there have not been many reports of meningitis due to S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus. Moreover, the pathogenesis of late onset S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus meningitis in infants is unclear. Here we report a case of meningitis in a 5-week-old infant with preceding diarrhea. S. bovis biotype II/2 was isolated from the blood, cerebrospinal fluid and stool, and then was identified as S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Isolates from all three sample types had identical profiles on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The intestinal tract was thought to be the source of the infection.
TI  - Comparative genomics of the dairy isolate Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198 against related members of the Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Within the genus Streptococcus, only Streptococcus thermophilus is used as a starter culture in food fermentations. Streptococcus macedonicus though, which belongs to the Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC), is also frequently isolated from fermented foods mainly of dairy origin. Members of the SBSEC have been implicated in human endocarditis and colon cancer. Here we compare the genome sequence of the dairy isolate S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198 to the other SBSEC genomes in order to assess in silico its potential adaptation to milk and its pathogenicity status. RESULTS: Despite the fact that the SBSEC species were found tightly related based on whole genome phylogeny of streptococci, two distinct patterns of evolution were identified among them. Streptococcus macedonicus, Streptococcus infantarius CJ18 and Streptococcus pasteurianus ATCC 43144 seem to have undergone reductive evolution resulting in significantly diminished genome sizes and increased percentages of potential pseudogenes when compared to Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. In addition, the three species seem to have lost genes for catabolizing complex plant carbohydrates and for detoxifying toxic substances previously linked to the ability of S. gallolyticus to survive in the rumen. Analysis of the S. macedonicus genome revealed features that could support adaptation to milk, including an extra gene cluster for lactose and galactose metabolism, a proteolytic system for casein hydrolysis, auxotrophy for several vitamins, an increased ability to resist bacteriophages and horizontal gene transfer events with the dairy Lactococcus lactis and S. thermophilus as potential donors. In addition, S. macedonicus lacks several pathogenicity-related genes found in S. gallolyticus. For example, S. macedonicus has retained only one (i.e. the pil3) of the three pilus gene clusters which may mediate the binding of S. gallolyticus to the extracellular matrix. Unexpectedly, similar findings were obtained not only for the dairy S. infantarius CJ18, but also for the blood isolate S. pasteurianus ATCC 43144. CONCLUSIONS: Our whole genome analyses suggest traits of adaptation of S. macedonicus to the nutrient-rich dairy environment. During this process the bacterium gained genes presumably important for this new ecological niche. Finally, S. macedonicus carries a reduced number of putative SBSEC virulence factors, which suggests a diminished pathogenic potential.

TI  - Bacteraemia due to Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus is associated with digestive tract malignancies and resistance to macrolides and clindamycin.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was intended to delineate the association between digestive tract malignancies and bacteraemia due to Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records and microbiological results of patients with bacteraemia due to Streptococcus bovis during the period 2000-2012. Species and subspecies identification of isolates originally classified as S. bovis was confirmed by 16S rRNA sequencing and PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assays. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of antimicrobial agents were determined by the broth microdilution method. RESULTS: Of the 172 S. bovis complex isolates obtained from 172 patients (age range, <1-94 years, median age, 66) with bacteraemia, 31 isolates were identified to be S. gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus, 126 were S. gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus, and 15 were shown to be Streptococcus infantarius. The majority (n = 104, 60%) of patients were male and had underlying malignancies (n = 87, 51%). Bacteraemia due to S. gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus was significantly associated with endocarditis while S. gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus was more likely to be associated with malignancies of the digestive tract, including gastric, pancreatic, hepatobiliary and colorectal cancers. Septic shock at presentation was the only factor associated with mortality among patients with bacteraemia due to either subspecies of S. bovis. Isolates of S. gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus had higher rates of resistance to macrolides and clindamycin than isolates of S. gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus. CONCLUSION: Extensive diagnostic work-up for digestive tract malignancies and trans-esophageal echocardiogram should be investigated in patients with bacteraemia caused by S. gallolyticus.
TI  - Characterization of a bacterial tannase from Streptococcus gallolyticus UCN34 suitable for tannin biodegradation.
AB  - The gene in the locus GALLO_1609 from Streptococcus gallolyticus UCN34 was cloned and expressed as an active protein in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The protein was named TanSg1 since it shows similarity to bacterial tannases previously described. The recombinant strain produced His-tagged TanSg1 which was purified by affinity chromatography. Purified TanSg1 protein showed tannase activity, having a specific activity of 577 U/mg which is 41 % higher than the activity of Lactobacillus plantarum tannase. Remarkably, TanSg1 displayed optimum catalytic activity at pH 6-8 and 50-70 degrees C and showed high stability over a broad range of temperatures. It retained 25 % of its relative activity after prolonged incubation at 45 degrees C. The specific activity of TanSg1 is enhanced by the divalent cation Ca(2+) and is dramatically reduced by Zn(2+) and Hg(2+). The enzyme was highly specific for gallate and protocatechuate esters and showed no catalytic activity against other phenolic esters. The protein TanSg1 hydrolyzes efficiently tannic acid, a complex and polymeric gallotanin, allowing its complete conversion to gallic acid, a potent antioxidant. From its biochemical properties, TanSg1 is a tannase with potential industrial interest regarding the biodegradation of tannin waste or its bioconversion into biologically active products.
TI  - Single cell stochastic regulation of pilus phase variation by an attenuation-like mechanism.
AB  - The molecular triggers leading to virulence of a number of human-adapted commensal bacteria such as Streptococcus gallolyticus are largely unknown. This opportunistic pathogen is responsible for endocarditis in the elderly and associated with colorectal cancer. Colonization of damaged host tissues with exposed collagen, such as cardiac valves and pre-cancerous polyps, is mediated by appendages referred to as Pil1 pili. Populations of S. gallolyticus are heterogeneous with the majority of cells weakly piliated while a smaller fraction is hyper piliated. We provide genetic evidences that heterogeneous pil1 expression depends on a phase variation mechanism involving addition/deletion of GCAGA repeats that modifies the length of an upstream leader peptide. Synthesis of longer leader peptides potentiates the transcription of the pil1 genes through ribosome-induced destabilization of a premature stem-loop transcription terminator. This study describes, at the molecular level, a new regulatory mechanism combining phase variation in a leader peptide-encoding gene and transcription attenuation. This simple and robust mechanism controls a stochastic heterogeneous pilus expression, which is important for evading the host immune system while ensuring optimal tissue colonization.
TI  - Characteristics and natural history of patients with colorectal cancer complicated by infectious endocarditis. Case control study of 25 patients.
AB  - Association between streptococcal endocarditis and gastrointestinal disease has been well-documented in the literature. However oncological impact of this complicated presentation has not yet been reported. We have conducted to our knowledgethe first case-control study on this subject. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two groups of five patients with colorectal cancer and either active endocarditis (CRC E+), or without endocarditis (CRC, n=20) were matched 1:4 for age, sex, and location of colorectal tumor. RESULTS: All 25 patients were male, with a median age of 63 (range: 53-85) years. Twenty (80%) had colon cancer and 5 (20%) rectal cancer. There was no post-operative mortality in this population. The overall morbidity was 28% (n=7). The overall 3-year survival and recurrence rates were similar in both groups 80% and 95%; 0% and 30% for group CRC E+ and CRC (p=0.4603). CONCLUSION: This is the first case-control study demonstrating that during the first two years of follow-up, occurrence of endocarditis did not alter the prognosis of patients with CRC.
TI  - [Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus isolated from cerebrospinal fluid in a pediatric patient].
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus is known to cause bacterial meningitis in adults, and most of the few pediatric cases observed occurred in neonates. We report the case of a 9-month old boy with a history of repeated hospitalizations due to respiratory diseases, who presented meningitis and bacteremia by Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasterianus. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case in Santa Fe to this date.

TI  - Novel real-time PCR assays using TaqMan minor groove binder probes for identification of fecal carriage of Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex from rectal swab specimens.
AB  - Real-time PCR based on the recN and gyrB genes was developed to detect four Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBEC) subspecies from rectal swab specimens. The overall prevalence was 35.2%: Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (11.1%), S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (13%), Streptococcus infantarius subsp. coli (20.4%), and S. infantarius subsp. infantarius (11.1%). To conclude, these real-time PCR assays provide a reliable molecular method to detect SBEC pathogenic subspecies from rectal swab specimens.
TI  - Streptococcus gallolyticus bacteraemia in hepatobiliary-pancreatic and colonic pathologies.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus gallolyticus bacteraemia has been associated with several pathologies, including bacterial endocarditis and colorectal cancer. AIMS: In this study, we have analysed whether Streptococcus gallolyticus bacteraemia is associated with an increased risk of hepatobiliary and colonic pathology. The association with other pathologies and the antibiotic sensitivities of Streptococcus gallolyticus were also analysed. DESIGN: Observational retrospective study. METHODS: The case notes of patients with documented Streptococcus gallolyticus bacteraemia between 2007 and 2012 at Mater Dei hospital (Malta) were reviewed. Demographic and clinical data, including co-morbidities, clinical investigations, antibiotic sensitivities and mortality were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 42 patients (33 males, 9 females) were recruited. Two patients were pre-term infants and were therefore excluded from the study. Mean age of the cohort population studied was 72 years (SD +/- 14). One-year survival rate was 62%. Gastrointestinal (colonic and hepatobiliary-pancreatic) pathologies were present in 59.5% of patients with 16% of this group having more than one gastrointestinal pathology. High incidence rates of underlying diabetes mellitus (28.6%), valvular heart disease (21.4%) and malignancies (21.4%) were noted in this study. Furthermore, we observed that 14.3% of patients had an underlying respiratory pathology. Streptococcus gallolyticus was 100% sensitive to cefotaxime and vancomycin but was highly resistant to clindamycin, erythromycin and tetracycline. CONCLUSION: Streptococcus gallolyticus bacteraemia is commoner in the elderly and in those with multiple underlying co-morbidities. The high incidence of gastrointestinal pathologies among patients with Streptococcus gallolyticus bacteraemia (59.5%) suggests that a thorough work-up for colonic and hepatobiliary/pancreatic pathology should be carried out in these patients.
TI  - Effect of feeding tannin degrading bacterial culture (Streptococcus gallolyticus  strain TDGB 406) on nutrient utilization, urinary purine derivatives and growth performance of goats fed on Quercus semicarpifolia leaves.
AB  - To study the effect of supplementation of tannin degrading bacterial culture (Streptococcus gallolyticus strain TDGB 406) on growth performance, nutrient utilization and urinary purine derivatives of goats fed on oak (Quercus semicarpifolia) leaves. For growth study, eighteen billy goats (4 month old, average body weight 9.50 +/- 1.50 kg) were distributed into three groups of six animals each. The animals of group 1 served as control while animals of groups 2 (T1) and 3 (T2) were given (@ 5 ml/kg live weight) autoclaved and live culture of isolate TDGB 406 (10(6) cells/ml) respectively. The animals were fed measured quantity of dry oak leaves as the main roughage source and ad libitum maize hay along with fixed quantity of concentrate mixture. The feeding of live culture of isolate TDGB 406 (probiotic) did not affect dry matter intake and digestibility of nutrients except that of dry matter and crude protein, which was higher in T2 group as compared to control. All the animals were in positive nitrogen balance. There was no significant effect of feeding isolate TDGB 406 on urinary purine derivatives (microbial protein production) in goats. The body weight gain and average live weight gain was significantly higher (p = 0.071) in T2 group as compared to control. Feed conversion efficiency was also better in the goats fed on live culture of TDGB 406 (T2). The feeding of tannin degrading bacterial isolate TDGB 406 as probiotic resulted in improved growth performance and feed conversion ratio in goats fed on oak leaves as one of the main roughage source.
TI  - Construction of isogenic mutants in Streptococcus gallolyticus based on the development of new mobilizable vectors.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus is an emerging cause of infective endocarditis that has been epidemiologically linked to colorectal cancer. S. gallolyticus is poorly transformable using electroporation and no defined mutant has been published yet. Hence, we used mobilization to introduce plasmid DNA from Streptococcus agalactiae into S. gallolyticus using the transfer origin of the conjugative element TnGBS1 (oriTTnGBS1), followed by a classical homologous recombination technique. Two isogenic mutants of S. gallolyticus UCN34, one deleted for the pil1 pilus operon and another for the sortase A gene, were constructed and characterized. This genetic tool should help in unravelling virulence mechanisms of this bacterium.
TI  - Streptococcus gallolyticus infective endocarditis in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus: a three-dimensional echocardiography evaluation.
AB  - A 42 year-old woman was referred to our hospital with a history of fever and poor general status for the last 30 days. She presented tachycardia and a systolic apical murmur. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis of 13,100/mL, hemoglobin of 8.4g/dL and positive systemic lupus erythematosus antibodies (anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB, anticardiolipin, and antinuclear antibodies); blood culture was positive for Streptococcus gallolyticus. Three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography was performed and revealed multiple mitral valve vegetations, with leaflet perforation and important mitral regurgitation, as well as large aortic vegetation, with cusp perforation and severe regurgitation. Additionally, a small vegetation was observed on the tricuspid valve, which presented moderate regurgitation. Threedimensional transesophageal echocardiography provides appropriate visualization of complications resulting from infectious endocarditis.
TI  - Development of a multilocus sequence typing scheme for Streptococcus gallolyticus.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus is often found as a member of the normal gut microflora in various animals. However, it has been reported to cause mastitis in cattle, septicaemia in pigeons, and meningitis, septicaemia and endocarditis in humans. However, little is known about the epidemiology and crucial virulence factors of S. gallolyticus. To help address these issues, we developed a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme for S. gallolyticus. Seven housekeeping gene fragments were sequenced from each of 58 S. gallolyticus isolates collected from diverse origins and sources. The MLST scheme had good discriminatory ability. The 63 strains, including the 5 whole genome sequenced strains examined, resolved into 57 sequence types (STs), with 52 STs represented by only a single strain. With respect to the identification of S. gallolyticus subspecies (i.e. S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus and S. gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus), the results of biochemical tests and DNA-DNA hybridization were in high concordance with those of the MLST scheme. The MLST scheme developed in this study may be a useful tool capable of replacing the conventional methods used for S. gallolyticus subspecies identification. The results of this study suggest that the biology and virulence of two pathogenic S. gallolyticus subspecies (i.e. S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus and S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus) are very different. The MLST scheme offers researchers a valuable typing tool that will promote further investigation of the epidemiology of S. gallolyticus.
TI  - Prevalence and comparison of Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius and Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus in raw and fermented dairy products from East and West Africa.
AB  - Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius (Sii) and Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus are members of the Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC) associated with human infections. SBSEC-related endocarditis was furthermore associated with rural residency in Southern Europe. SBSEC members are increasingly isolated as predominant species from fermented dairy products in Europe, Asia and Africa. African variants of Sii displayed dairy adaptations to lactose metabolism paralleling those of Streptococcus thermophilus including genome decay. In this study, the aim was to assess the prevalence of Sii and possibly other SBSEC members in dairy products of East and West Africa in order to identify their habitat, estimate their importance in dairy fermentation processes and determine geographic areas affected by this potential health risk. Presumptive SBSEC members were isolated on semi-selective M17 and SM agar media. Subsequent genotypic identification of isolates was based on rep-PCR fingerprinting and SBSEC-specific16S rRNA gene PCR assay. Detailed identification was achieved through application of novel primers enhancing the binding stringency in partial groES/groEL gene amplification and subsequent DNA sequencing. The presence of S. thermophilus-like lacS and lacZ genes in the SBSEC isolates was determined to elucidate the prevalence of this dairy adaptation. Isolates (n = 754) were obtained from 72 raw and 95 fermented milk samples from Cote d'Ivoire and Kenya on semi-selective agar media. Colonies of Sii were not detected from raw milk despite high microbial titers of approximately 10(6)CFU/mL on M17 agar medium. However, after spontaneous milk fermentation Sii was genotypically identified in 94.1% of Kenyan samples and 60.8% of Kenyan isolates. Sii prevalence in Cote d'Ivoire displayed seasonal variations in samples from 32.3% (June) to 40.0% (Dec/Jan) and isolates from 20.5% (June) to 27.7% (Dec/Jan) present at titers of 10(6)-10(8)CFU/mL. lacS and lacZ genes were detected in all Kenyan and 25.8% (June) to 65.4% (Dec/Jan) of Ivorian Sii isolates. Regional differences in prevalence of Sii and dairy adaptations were observed, but no clear effect of dairy animal, fermentation procedure and climate was revealed. Conclusively, the high prevalence of Sii in Kenya, Cote d'Ivoire in addition to Somalia, Sudan and Mali strongly indicates a pivotal role of Sii in traditional African dairy fermentations potentially paralleling that of typical western dairy species S. thermophilus. Putative health risks associated with the consumption of high amounts of live Sii and potential different degrees of evolutionary adaptation or ecological colonization require further epidemiologic and genomic investigations, particularly in Africa.
TI  - SmbFT, a putative ABC transporter complex, confers protection against the lantibiotic Smb in Streptococci.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans, a dental pathogen, secretes different kinds of lantibiotic  and nonlantibiotic bacteriocins. For self-protection, a bacteriocin producer strain must possess one or more cognate immunity mechanisms. We report here the identification of one such immunity complex in S. mutans strain GS-5 that confers protection against Smb, a two-component lantibiotic. The immunity complex that we identified is an ABC transporter composed of two proteins: SmbF (the ATPase component) and SmbT (the permease component). Both of the protein-encoding genes are located within the smb locus. We show that GS-5 becomes sensitized to Smb upon deletion of smbT, which makes the ABC transporter nonfunctional. To establish the role SmbFT in providing immunity, we heterologously expressed this ABC transporter complex in four different sensitive streptococcal species and demonstrated that it can confer resistance against Smb. To explore the specificity of SmbFT in conferring resistance, we tested mutacin IV (a nonlantibiotic), nisin (a single peptide lantibiotics), and three peptide antibiotics (bacitracin, polymyxin B, and vancomycin). We found that SmbFT does not recognize these structurally different peptides. We then tested whether SmbFT can confer protection against haloduracin, another two-component lantibiotic that is structurally similar to Smb; SmbFT indeed conferred protection against haloduracin. SmbFT can also confer protection against an uncharacterized but structurally similar lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus gallolyticus. Our data suggest that SmbFT truly displays immunity function and confer protection against Smb and structurally similar lantibiotics.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis group and biliary tract infections: an analysis of 51 cases.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis is a well-known cause of endocarditis, but its role in other  infections has not been well described. We analysed prospectively all patients with biliary tract infections caused by S. bovis group during the period 1988-2011. We selected those cases associated with cholangitis and cholecystitis, defined according to Tokyo guidelines. Identification of the strains was performed using the API 20 Strep and the GP card of the Vitek 2 system, and was confirmed by molecular methods. Our series included 51 cases (30 cholangitis and 21 cholecystitis). The associated microorganisms were: Streptococcus infantarius (biotype II/1) 29 cases (57%), Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (biotype II/2) 20 cases (39%) and Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (biotype I) two cases (4%). The only difference found between S. infantarius and S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus was a greater association of the first with malignant strictures of the bile ducts: 48% (14/29) versus 5% (1/20), p <0.001. Thirty-seven of the cases also had bacteraemia, causing 20% (37/185) of all S. bovis bacteraemia, with differences between S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (2/112; 2%) and the other two microorganisms: S. infantarius and S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (35/73; 48%; p <0.001). The vast majority of biliary tract infections due to S. bovis group are caused by S. infantarius and S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (S. bovis biotype II), and nearly half of the bacteraemia due to these two species has a biliary source (43% of the S. infantarius and 56% of S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus).
TI  - Splenic abscess caused by Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus as presentation of a pancreatic cancer.
AB  - Splenic abscesses caused by Streptococcus bovis are rarely reported in the literature and are mainly seen in patients with endocarditis and associated colonic neoplasia/carcinoma. We report the first case of splenic abscess caused by Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (Streptococcus bovis biotype II/2) as presentation of a pancreatic cancer.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Streptococcus gallolyticus isolated from humans and animals.
AB  - Susceptibilities to some antimicrobial agents and distribution of genes associated with resistance were examined in a total of 66 Streptococcus gallolyticus isolates and reference strains from various sources. All the tested bacteria were susceptible to vancomycin, penicillin G, and ampicillin. Most of the erythromycin-resistant isolates were observed in human clinical samples. Tetracycline and doxycycline resistance was prevalent in the isolates from human patients, diseased animals, and healthy broiler chickens, while the prevalence was significantly lower in the isolates from healthy mammals. All the isolates resistant to tetracycline possessed tet(M) and/or tet(L) and/or tet(O) genes. However, most isolates from healthy animals, which were susceptible to tetracycline, possessed the above-cited resistance genes, implying the potential ability for resistance under exposure to the corresponding antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Intrauterine infection and post-partum bacteraemia due to Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus.
AB  - The case is presented of a woman with intrauterine infection and post-partum bacteraemia due to Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, who delivered an infant via Caesarean section. Furthermore, we comment on the possibility of vaginal colonization of this organism as a portal of entry in cases of maternal and neonatal infections.
TI  - Correlation among Streptococcus bovis, endocarditis and septicemia in a patient with advanced colon cancer: a case report.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: One of the bacterial agents that has been found to be associated with colorectal cancer is Streptococcus bovis, with 13% of infective endocarditis cases caused by this pathogenic species. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 57-year-old Caucasian man with infiltrating and ulcerating metastatic adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon. The patient was receiving second-line chemotherapy treatment and, on the eighth day of the second cycle, he developed a grade IV pancytopenia. We diagnosed a severe sepsis with positive blood cultures for Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus with a secondary endocarditis. CONCLUSIONS: A recent study suggests that the majority of patients affected by colonic cancer have a Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus colonization that becomes apparent as an overt infection only when immunosystem disorders or cardiac valve lesions occur. This correlation is important for involving more specialists in a correct and early diagnosis of this rare, but potentially fatal, complication.
TI  - The itinerary of Streptococcus gallolyticus infection in patients with colonic malignant disease.
AB  - Bacteria constitute about 90% of all cells in the human body. The densest and most complex bacterial community is in the large intestine. This population is quite stable in healthy intestines, but intestinal disease distorts the ecological balance and induces dysbiosis. Results of studies have indicated that the epithelial and metabolic changes that occur with colorectal cancer provide a competitive advantage to a subset of intestinal bacteria. Strikingly, however, Streptococcus gallolyticus gallolyticus (previously known as Streptococcus bovis biotype I) is one of the very few opportunistic pathogens that has been clinically linked to colonic malignant diseases. In this Personal View we describe how S. gallolyticus gallolyticus exploits its unique range of virulence features to cause infections in patients with colorectal cancer. We postulate that distinct virulence factors on one hand enable this bacterium to establish a symptomatic infection in susceptible individuals, and on the other hand make its ability to do this dependent on pre-existing colonic abnormalities. We believe that our current reconstruction of this route of infection aids understanding of how S. gallolyticus gallolyticus infections can be best exploited for early detection of colorectal cancer.
TI  - Dynamics of fecal microbial communities in children with diarrhea of unknown etiology and genomic analysis of associated Streptococcus lutetiensis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The sequences of the 16S rRNA genes extracted from fecal samples provide insights into the dynamics of fecal microflora. This potentially gives valuable etiological information for patients whose conditions have been ascribed to unknown pathogens, which cannot be accomplished using routine culture methods. We studied 33 children with diarrhea who were admitted to the Children's Hospital in Shanxi Province during 2006. RESULTS: Nineteen of 33 children with diarrhea could not be etiologically diagnosed by routine culture and polymerase chain reaction methods. Eleven of 19 children with diarrhea of unknown etiology had Streptococcus as the most dominant fecal bacterial genus at admission. Eight of nine children whom three consecutive fecal samples were collected had Streptococcus as the dominant fecal bacterial genus, including three in the Streptococcus bovis group and three Streptococcus sp., which was reduced during and after recovery. We isolated strains that were possibly from the S. bovis group from feces sampled at admission, which were then identified as Streptococcus lutetiensis from one child and Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus from two children. We sequenced the genome of S. lutetiensis and identified five antibiotic islands, two pathogenicity islands, and five unique genomic islands. The identified virulence genes included hemolytic toxin cylZ of Streptococcus agalactiae and sortase associated with colonization of pathogenic streptococci. CONCLUSIONS: We identified S. lutetiensis and S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus from children with diarrhea of unknown etiology, and found pathogenic islands and virulence genes in the genome of S. lutetiensis.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex fecal carriage, colorectal carcinoma, and infective endocarditis: a new appraisal of a complex connection.
AB  - The proportion of group D streptococcal infective endocarditis (IE) (predominantly due to Streptococcus gallolyticus) and the incidence of colorectal cancer are higher in France than in most European countries. We assumed that this could be explained by a high group D streptococci (GDS) fecal carriage rate. The aims of this study were to re-assess the GDS fecal carriage rate in France and its relationship with colorectal cancer. Consecutive adult subjects who were to undergo a complete colonoscopy were invited to participate. GDS were searched in subjects' stools before their colonoscopy using biomolecular techniques. Colonoscopic findings were sorted into four subgroups: normal colonoscopy, non-tumoral lesions, benign tumors, and premalignant/malignant tumors. GDS fecal carriages were calculated overall and in each subgroup and compared. The data from 259 subjects were analyzed. GDS were identified in the feces of 12 subjects, with the following distribution: S. lutetiensis (n = 9), S. pasteurianus (n = 2), and S. gallolyticus (n = 1). This accounted for an overall GDS fecal carriage rate of 4.6 %. The GDS fecal carriage rate was 6 % in case of normal colonoscopy, 1.3 % in case of non-tumoral lesions, 3.2 % in case of benign tumors, and 11 % in case of premalignant/malignant tumors. These four percentages were not statistically different. The GDS fecal carriage rate was lower than expected, which did not confirm our working hypothesis. Most strains belonged to S. bovis biotype II, while S. gallolyticus was found only once. These findings suggest that different GDS play different roles in the etiopathogenesis of IE and colorectal cancer.
TI  - Comparative genome analysis of Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius CJ18, an African fermented camel milk isolate with adaptations to dairy environment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius (Sii) belongs to the Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex associated with several human and animal infections. Sii is a predominant bacterium in spontaneously fermented milk products in Africa. The genome sequence of Sii strain CJ18 was compared with that of other Streptococcus species to identify dairy adaptations including genome decay such as in Streptococcus thermophilus, traits for its competitiveness in spontaneous milk fermentation and to assess potential health risks for consumers. RESULTS: The genome of Sii CJ18 harbors several unique regions in comparison to Sii ATCC BAA-102T, among others an enlarged exo- and capsular polysaccharide operon; Streptococcus thermophilus-associated genes; a region containing metabolic and hypothetical genes mostly unique to CJ18 and the dairy isolate Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus; and a second oligopeptide transport operon. Dairy adaptations in CJ18 are reflected by a high percentage of pseudogenes (4.9%) representing genome decay which includes the inactivation of the lactose phosphotransferase system (lacIIABC) by multiple transposases integration. The presence of lacS and lacZ genes is the major dairy adaptation affecting lactose metabolism pathways also due to the disruption of lacIIABC.We constructed mutant strains of lacS, lacZ and lacIIABC and analyzed the resulting strains of CJ18 to confirm the redirection of lactose metabolism via LacS and LacZ.Natural competence genes are conserved in both Sii strains, but CJ18 contains a lower number of CRISPR spacers which indicates a reduced defense capability against alien DNA. No classical streptococcal virulence factors were detected in both Sii strains apart from those involved in adhesion which should be considered niche factors. Sii-specific virulence factors are not described. Several Sii-specific regions encoding uncharacterized proteins provide new leads for virulence analyses and investigation of the unclear association of dairy and clinical Sii with human diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The genome of the African dairy isolate Sii CJ18 clearly differs from the human isolate ATCC BAA-102T. CJ18 possesses a high natural competence predisposition likely explaining the enlarged genome. Metabolic adaptations to the dairy environment are evident and especially lactose uptake corresponds to S. thermophilus. Genome decay is not as advanced as in S. thermophilus (10-19%) possibly due to a shorter history in dairy fermentations.
TI  - [Streptococcus bovis, taxonomic status, clinical relevance and antimicrobial susceptibility].
AB  - Streptococcus bovis is a large bacterial complex of facultative anaerobic Gram-positive cocci that includes distinct, genetically-related species. Traditionally, S. bovis was classified into three biotypes: I (mannitol fermentation-positive), II/1 (mannitol-negative and beta-glucuronidase-negative), and II/2 (mannitol-negative and beta-glucuronidase-positive). The introduction of molecular techniques in the last few decades has led to proposals for a genetic classification of this complex: S. bovis biotype I belongs to Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, S. bovis biotype II/1 is, in fact, Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius, designated as Streptococcus lutetiensis, and S. bovis biotype II/2 is Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, commonly designated as Streptococcus pasteurianus. Although this modern taxonomy is currently accepted, many clinicians remain unfamiliar with these terms. The importance of correct identification lies in the strong association between bacteriemia, endocarditis and/or colon cancer and the various subspecies. In general, S. bovis is more susceptible to antimicrobial agents than other streptococci, but high levels of resistance to macrolides and tetracycline have been described.
TI  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus meningitis in an infant: a case report and literature review.
AB  - A case of 6-week-old male infant with meningitis and concurrent bacteremia caused by Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus (Streptococcus bovis biotype 11.2) is presented. The isolates were susceptible to all beta-lactam antibiotics. Nevertheless, delayed defervescence and lack of satisfactory clinical improvement after treatment with multiple beta-lactam antibiotics prompted the combination therapy of vancomycin and penicillin G. The patient completed a 2-week course of antibiotics and recovered uneventfully.
TI  - Long-term clinical outcomes after Streptococcus bovis isolation in asymptomatic blood donors in Hong Kong.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Risk of transfusion-transmitted bacterial sepsis has been substantially reduced by a bacterial surveillance program (BST). However, new problems emerge as asymptomatic bacteremia is detected in blood donors. Streptococcus bovis bacteremia, which is known to associate with infective endocarditis and colonic carcinoma, is an example. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to examine the demographic and clinical outcome of this group of donors. All confirmed culture-positive cases under the BST were retrieved and those donors with S. bovis bacteremia were contacted for follow-up. Viable culture samples were sent for detailed microbiologic analysis. RESULTS: From 1998 to 2012, a total of 16 donors were found to have S. bovis bacteremia, giving an estimated prevalence of 1 in 110,800 donations. They consisted of nine men and seven women with median age of 43.5 years. Eight donors had undergone colonoscopy with colonic carcinoma detected in two and benign adenoma in four. Five of the 16 isolates could be retrieved for 16S DNA sequencing. Four were identified as S. gallolyticus ssp. pasteurianus and one as S. gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus. The two patients with colonic carcinoma had one each of subspecies pasteurianus and gallolyticus. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight a close association of S. bovis and colonic carcinoma. We recommend prompt donor follow-up if S. bovis bacteremia is detected. Besides, all confirmed S. bovis should be fully characterized by molecular technique.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus  causing meningitis in ducklings.
AB  - Increased mortality was observed in a group of 10-day-old ducklings in China in 2010. The dead ducklings were characterized by meningitis, suggesting microbial infection as the cause of disease. Laboratory investigation led to the isolation of a bacterial strain designated as AL101002 from the brain of dead ducklings. Subsequent experimental infections with this strain resulted in marked symptoms in the ducklings similar to those observed in nature outbreaks. Gram-staining revealed Gram-positive cocci in pairs or short chains. Phenotypical analysis revealed the microorganism as Streptococcus pasteurianus. DNA sequencing revealed that the isolate was Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus. Experimental infection with AL101002 resulted in the death of ducklings with meningitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the isolation of S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus with high virulence in ducklings.
TI  - Enterococcus and Streptococcus spp. associated with chronic and self-medicated urinary tract infections in Vietnam.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTI) are one of the most common infections  among women worldwide. E. coli often causes more than 75% of acute uncomplicated UTI, however, little is known about how recurrent UTIs and indiscriminate use of antimicrobials affect the aetiology of UTIs. This study aimed to establish the aetiology of UTI in a population of recurrent and self-medicated patients referred from pharmacies to a hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam and to describe genotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility of the associated bacterial pathogens. The aetiology of bacterial pathogens associated with UTI (defined as >/= 104 CFU/ml urine) was established by phenotypic and molecular methods. Enterococcus faecalis isolates were typed by Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST), Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. METHODS: Urine samples from 276 patients suffering symptoms of urinary tract infection were collected and cultured on Flexicult agar(R) allowing for detection of the most common urine pathogens. Patients were interviewed about underlying diseases, duration of symptoms, earlier episodes of UTI, number of episodes diagnosed by doctors and treatment in relation to UTI. All tentative E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates were identified to species level by PCR, 16S rRNA and partial sequencing of the groEL gene. E. faecalis isolates were further characterized by Multi Locus Sequence Typing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. RESULTS: Mean age of 49 patients was 48 yrs (range was 11-86 yrs) and included 94% women. On average, patients reported to have suffered from UTI for 348 days (range 3 days-10 years, and experienced 2.7 UTIs during the previous year). Cephalosporins were reported the second drug of choice in treatment of UTI at the hospital. E. faecalis (55.1%), E. coli (12.2%) and Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (8.2%) were main bacterial pathogens. MIC testing of E. faecalis showed susceptibility to ampicillin, penicillin and vancomycin, but high-level resistance against gentamicin (48.1%). MLST revealed 12 Sequence Types (ST) of which ST 16 made up 44.5% and showed closely related PFGE types. CONCLUSION: The different aetiology of UTI compared with reports elsewhere, where E. coli dominates, may be a result of chronic and recurrent UTIs together with indiscriminate use of antimicrobials. The similar genotypes shown by epidemiologically unrelated ST 16 isolates in Vietnam and elsewhere, suggest that E. faecalis ST 16 might represent a globally distributed clone. Treatment of UTI with cephalosporins may select for E. faecalis as it is intrinsic resistant and further studies are needed to establish the source(s) and role of E. faecalis ST 16 in acute UTI.
TI  - The dominant microbial community associated with fermentation of Obushera (sorghum and millet beverages) determined by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  - Obushera includes four fermented cereal beverages from Uganda namely: Obutoko, Enturire, Ekitiribita and Obuteire, whose microbial diversity has not hitherto been fully investigated. Knowledge of the microbial diversity and dynamics in these products is crucial for understanding their safety and development of appropriate starter cultures for controlled industrial processing. Culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques including denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and mixed DNA sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified ribosomal RNA genes were used to study the bacteria and yeast diversity of Obushera. The pH dropped from 6.0-4.6 to 3.5-4.0 within 1-2 days for Obutoko, Enturire and Obuteire whereas that of Ekitiribita decreased to 4.4 after 4 days. Counts of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) increased from 5.0 to 11.0 log cfug(-1) and yeasts increased from 3.4 to 7.1 log cfug(-1) while coliform counts decreased from 2.0 to <1 log cfug(-1) during four days of fermentation. LAB and yeast isolates were identified by rRNA gene sequence analysis. LAB isolates included: Enterococcus spp., Lactobacillus (Lb.) plantarum, Lb. fermentum, Lb. delbrueckii, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc lactis, Streptococcus (S.) infantarius subsp. infantarius, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Weisella (W.) confusa. DGGE indicated predominance of S. gallolyticus, S. infantarius subsp. infantarius, Lb. fermentum, Lb. delbrueckii, W. confusa, Lb. reuteri, Fructobacillus spp., L. lactis and L. lactis. Yeast isolates included Clavispora lusitaniae, Cyberlindnera fabianii, Issatchenkia orientalis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. DGGE indicated predominance of S. cerevisiae in Obutoko, Enturire and Obuteire and also detected Pichia spp. and I. orientalis in Obutoko. Obushera produced in the laboratory was initially dominated by Enterobacteriaceae and later by Lactococcus spp. Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillus spp. were also detected in Ekitiribita. Development of starters for Obushera may require combinations of LAB and S. cerevisiae for Obutoko, Enturire and Obuteire and LAB for Ekitiribita.
TI  - Early onset neonatal bacterial meningitis caused by Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. paste urianus.
AB  - We report a case of neonatal meningitis due to Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp.  pasteurianus born to a mother with an asymptomatic urinary tract infection due to Streptococcus group D and Escherichia coli. In the past, this organism may have been reported as Streptococcus bovis or S. bovis biotype II/2. Accurate identification of this organism is necessary to determine the etiology of infection and give correct treatment of neonatal meningitis, caused by this organism.

TI  - [Fever as the presenting manifestation of colon cancer: a case series of 11 patients].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fever happens frequently in colon cancer but it is rarely the presenting manifestation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report a case series of patients with colon cancer revealed by fever in the three military hospitals in Paris. RESULTS: Of the 11 patients studied, seven were men and four were women, and their mean age was 70 years. Cancer was localized in the sigmoid colon (n=6), left colon (n=3) and right colon (n=2). Cancer staging (UICC TNM classification 2002) was respectively pTis (n=1), I (n=4), II (n=3) and III (n=3). Fever was the only reason for admission and two patients had a recurrent fever of unknown origin. All patients but one had bacterial infection. Blood cultures grew up in six cases, Escherichia coli (n=3), Streptococcus gallolyticus (ex bovis) (n=2) and anaerobic bacteria (n=1). There was one case of infective endocarditis caused by S. gallolyticus. Imaging showed a liver abscess (n=3) and a colon cancer complicated by an abscess (n=3). In seven patients, a familial history of colon cancer and symptoms of underlying colic disease were present (neglected rectal bleeding, iron deficiency anaemia, clinical evidence of an abdominal mass). CONCLUSIONS: Fever may reveal colon cancer at an early stage. Its main cause is a bacterial infection, such as bacteremia or abscess. Fever of unknown origin is a rare presentation. Detailed history, careful clinical examination and analysis of imaging contribute to recommend the prescription of colonoscopy.
TI  - ICESp1116, the genetic element responsible for erm(B)-mediated, inducible resistance to erythromycin in Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - ICESp1116, responsible for erm(B)-mediated, inducible erythromycin resistance in  Streptococcus pyogenes, was comprehensively characterized, and its chromosomal integration site was determined. It displayed a unique mosaic organization consisting of a scaffold, related to TnGallo1 from Streptococcus gallolyticus, with two inserted fragments separated by IS1216. One fragment, containing erm(B), displayed high-level identity to a portion of the S. pyogenes plasmid pSM19035; the other, containing a truncated tet(M) gene, displayed high-level identity to the right-hand portion of Clostridium difficile Tn5397.
TI  - The relationship between the new taxonomy of Streptococcus bovis and its clonality to colon cancer, endocarditis, and biliary disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The nomenclature of Streptococcus bovis has changed. The study aims were to examine and compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of infections based on the new taxonomy and the genetic relatedness of strains. METHODS: Bacteremic cases from 2004 to 2010 at Assaf Harofeh Medical Center were reviewed. VITEK 2 later confirmed with polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used for subspecies identification. VITEK 2 later confirmed with Etests was used for minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing. Repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR) was used to determine the genetic relatedness of strains. RESULTS: Twenty-four bacteremia cases were included. The median age of patients was 81 years (range 1 day to 91 years), two were neonates, three were pregnant, and 18 were elderly (>/= 65 years of age). The Charlson's combined conditional age-related score was 8.2 +/- 2.9, and 11 (58 %) patients were immunosuppressed. There were 13 patients who had S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, six had S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, four had S. infantarius subsp. coli, and one had S. infantarius subsp. infantarius. Ten of 19 non-pregnant adult patients had colon adenoma or carcinoma, three had acute biliary disease, and five had endocarditis. Two patients died in the hospital. rep-PCR revealed polyclonality. There were no significant associations between subspecies or genotypes and the various clinical characteristics or outcomes. CONCLUSION: S. bovis bacteremia is a serious disease that affects elderly immunosuppressed individuals. Infection is strongly associated with colon pathology and endocarditis, regardless of the new taxonomy or clone complex. The identification of S. bovis is of paramount importance, and microbiology laboratories should differentiate its processing from that of other S. viridans.
TI  - Bacterial responses to a simulated colon tumor microenvironment.
AB  - One of the few bacteria that have been consistently linked to colorectal cancer (CRC) is the opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus gallolyticus. Infections with this bacterium are generally regarded as an indicator for colonic malignancy, while the carriage rate of this bacterium in the healthy large intestine is relatively low. We speculated that the physiological changes accompanying the development of CRC might favor the colonization of this bacterium. To investigate whether colon tumor cells can support the survival of S. gallolyticus, this bacterium was grown in spent medium of malignant colonocytes to simulate the altered metabolic conditions in the CRC microenvironment. These in vitro simulations indicated that S. gallolyticus had a significant growth advantage in these spent media, which was not observed for other intestinal bacteria. Under these conditions, bacterial responses were profiled by proteome analysis and metabolic shifts were analyzed by (1)H-NMR-spectroscopy. In silico pathway analysis of the differentially expressed proteins and metabolite analysis indicated that this advantage resulted from the increased utilization of glucose, glucose derivates, and alanine. Together, these data suggest that tumor cell metabolites facilitate the survival of S. gallolyticus, favoring its local outgrowth and providing a possible explanation for the specific association of S. gallolyticus with colonic malignancy.
TI  - Molecular characterization of lactic acid bacteria and in situ amylase expression during traditional fermentation of cereal foods.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria play an important role in traditional fermented foods consumed in different countries. Study of their taxonomic structure and diversity is necessary for starter culture selection, improved safety and nutritional enhancement. To achieve these objectives, microbial genomic typing methods were used to study genetic differences of autochthonous bacteria and their distribution in two traditional African fermented cereal foods. A total of 85 predominant bacterial species were isolated from ogi and kunu-zaki obtained from Northern and Southern geographical region of Nigeria. They were identified using combination of 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on rpoA, pheS and atpA genes as well as M13-PCR gel fingerprints. The results showed that Lactobacillus fermentum was the most frequently isolated species in ogi (71.4%) and kunu-zaki (84.5%). Other species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) identified were Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus and Pediococcus pentosaceus. Non lactic acid bacteria isolated from these foods were species belonging to the Bacillus and Staphylococcus. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) analysis of the M13-PCR fingerprints for LAB strains showed clonal diversity among strains of the same species. In vitro and in situ expression of amylase gene during fermentation by amylolytic L. plantarum ULAG11 was detected, indicating the potential usefulness of such species for development of starter cultures and for controlled fermentation processes.
TI  - Association between bacteremia due to Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (Streptococcus bovis I) and colorectal neoplasia: a case-control study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between bacteremia by Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (SGG) and colorectal neoplasia (CRN) is well established but the frequency of the association varies widely in different studies. We conducted a case-control study to assess the association between SGG bacteremia and CRN. METHODS: An analysis of all SGG bacteremias was performed during the period 1988-2011. The frequency of CRN in patients with SGG bacteremia was compared with the frequency of CRN in a symptomatic control group of patients matched at a 1:2 ratio for gender and age (+/-3 years) without S. bovis bacteremia and personal history of CRN and with increased risk of CRN (by the presence of symptoms, signs, or test suspicious of colonic pathology or by family history of CRN). RESULTS: One hundred nine cases of SGG bacteremia were detected (mean age, 66 years; 87% male). Colonoscopy was performed in 98 cases, diagnosing 69 cases of CRN: 57 adenomas (39 advanced adenomas) and 12 invasive carcinomas. Only 4 cases had suspected CRN before the blood culture. The prevalence of CRN was higher in patients with SGG bacteremia than in the 196 control patients (70% vs 32%; odds ratio [OR], 5.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.0-8.6). This difference was not significant when comparing nonadvanced adenomas (19% vs 12%), but we found significant differences in advanced adenomas (40% vs 16%; OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 2.0-6.1) and invasive carcinomas (12% vs 5%; OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.2-6.9). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of CRN among SGG infected patients is significantly increased compared with symptomatic age-matched controls, indicating that SGG infection is a strong indicator for underlying occult malignancy.
TI  - Molecular-phylogenetic characterization of the microbiota in ulcerated and non-ulcerated regions in the patients with Crohn's disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota has been established in Crohn's disease (CD), but the molecular characterization of this dysbiosis in Chinese subjects with CD remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the predominant bacterial composition of the faecal and mucosal-associated microbiota in Chinese CD patients using culture-independent techniques. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Eighteen patients with CD and 9 healthy controls were included in this study. The faeces and the intestinal mucosal tissues from the ulcerated and nonulcerated sites were subjected to bacterial community fingerprinting using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The predominant bacterial composition in the faeces and mucosa was determined with DNA sequencing and BLAST. We showed that the bacterial diversity in the faeces of CD patients was reduced compared with that in healthy controls (p<0.01). The faecal bacterial dysbiosis of the patients was characterized by an elevated abundance of gamma-Proteobacteria (especially Escherichia coli and Shigella flexneri) and a reduced proportion of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Five bacterial species defined the microbiota imbalance of the ulcerated mucosa in CD, including an increase in Escherichia coli, a decrease in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Lactobacillus coleohominis, Bacteroides sp and Streptococcus gallolyticus in the bacterial community as compared with the nonulcerated (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first description of intestinal microbiota dysbiosis in Chinese CD patients. These results allow a better understanding of the faecal and mucosal microbiota in CD, showing a predominance of some opportunistic pathogenic bacteria and a decrease in beneficial bacterial species. The findings may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of CD in Chinese population.
TI  - Infective endocarditis due to Streptococcus gallolyticus associated with colonic  displasia.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus is a microorganism belonging to the Streptococcus bovis I group isolated in humans, bovines and equines pigeons, among other animals. Streptococcus bovis is a Streptococcus strain found in the rumen, and has been isolated in the milk of animals with mastitis. The authors describe a case of an adult immunocompetent patient with underlying valvular heart disease, with bacteraemia and infective endocarditis by Streptococcus gallolyticus, in whom adenomatous colonic polyps with dysplasia were identified.
TI  - [Analysis of diversity of vaginal microbiota in healthy Chinese women by using DNA-fingerprinting].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora in  different physiological states with PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), to establish the basis for the future study of lower genital tract infections, and to provide a theoretical basis for the development of vaginal probiotics adapted to Chinese females. METHODS: Women who underwent routine gynecologic examinations in Peking University First Hospital from October 2009 to January 2010 were enrolled, including 30 at reproductive age and 30 at post menopause age. Vaginal samples were collected and then total bacterial DNA was extracted. Universal bacterial primers were used to amplify the V3 region of 16S rDNA gene. PCR products were analyzed by denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Featured bands on DGGE were recovered, cloned and sequenced. Alignment with known sequence was made by using Blast on GenBank to identify bacterial strains so as to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora in different physiological states. RESULTS: (1) Vaginal flora in healthy Chinese women at their reproductive age were relatively simple, Lactobacillus were the dominant bacteria. Common bacteria included: Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners,and Lactobacillus gasseri. While L. iners were the dominant vaginal bacteria that could not be recognized by traditional method. (2) Vaginal bacteria in the women at post menopause age were more complex than in those at reproductive age. Common bacteria included: Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus crispatus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus gallolyticus, Veillonella sp., Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus anginosus, Prevotella sp., Anaerococcus lactolyticus and Bacteroides fragilis. CONCLUSION: Based on the DGGE analysis, the most common vaginal bacteria in Chinese healthy women at reproductive age are Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners,and Lactobacillus gasseri. the most common vaginal bacteria in healthy post-menopausal women are Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus crispatus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus sp., Prevotella sp.,Bacteroides fragilis and lactic acid producing Veillonella sp. and Anaerococcus lactolyticus. Meanwhile Lactobacillus iners was firstly found by DGGE to be the dominant vaginal bacteria in different physiological states.
TI  - Phenotypic and PCR-based identification of bacterial strains isolated from patients with suspected streptococcus suis infection in northern Thailand.
AB  - Twenty bacterial strains isolated from the blood of patients with suspected Streptococcus suis infection based on clinical symptoms in northern Thailand between 2009 and 2010 were subjected to phenotypic and genotypic identification. Commercial identification kits and a PCR-based assay targeting the S. suis-specific 16S rDNA sequence correctly identified S. suis isolated from patients in northern Thailand; however, there was a risk of misidentifying S. gallolyticus as S. suis using a PCR assay targeting the S. suis-specific house keeping gene encoding glutamate dehydrogenase. This is the first paper to report S. gallolyticus infection in humans in Thailand.
TI  - Immune response against Streptococcus gallolyticus in patients with adenomatous polyps in colon.
AB  - Our aim was to examine the humoral immune response against Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus antigens in individuals subjected to a routine colonoscopy in which colon adenomatous polyps were present or not. Serum samples from 133 individuals with adenomatous polyps and serum samples from 53 individuals with a normal colonoscopy were included. Western blot was performed in all subjects using a whole cell antigen from S. gallolyticus ATCC 9809, and rabbit antisera against the whole cell bacteria was prepared as a control. By analyzing the immune profile of the rabbit-immunized sera by Western-blot, at least 22 proteins were identified as immunogenic in S. gallolyticus. When we evaluated sera from human subjects, two proteins of approximately 30 and 22 kDa were most prominent. Based on this 2-protein band pattern, Western-blot profiles from human subjects were compared. The detection of a protein band of 22 kDa was associated with the presence of adenomatous polyps in colon [odds ratios (OR) 7.98, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 3.54-17.93], p < 0.001. When the presence of the 30 kDa protein alone or both the 22 and 30 kDa proteins were analyzed, the OR increased to 22.37 (95% CI: 3.77-131.64), p < 0.001. The specificity was 84.9 for the presence of the 22 kDa protein, and 98.1 for the presence of the 30 kDa protein alone or both 22 and 30 kDa bands. Serum from individuals with adenomatous polyps recognized two proteins from S. gallolyticus. This result confirmed the possible association of S. gallolyticus with adenomatous polyps in the colon.
TI  - [Diseases associated with bloodstream infections caused by the new species included in the old Streptococcus bovis group].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify possible diseases associated with bloodstream infections caused by new species of S. bovis group isolated in blood cultures and by studying patient records METHODS: Forty-four consecutive blood culture isolates initially designated S. bovis were further characterised using phenotypic methods Patient records were examined. RESULTS: We identified 15 Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, 24 Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, and 5 Streptococcus infantarius isolates in 44 BSI episodes. CONCLUSIONS: The association between S. bovis bacteraemia and endocarditis and/or colon carcinoma is highly dependent on the causative species. Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is a surrogate for endocarditis and/or bowel disease, whereas Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus is a surrogate for hepato-biliary disease.

TI  - A novel multiplex PCR/RFLP assay for the identification of Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex members from dairy microbial communities based on the 16S rRNA gene.
AB  - The Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC) comprises pathogenic species associated with different degrees with human infections but also spontaneously fermented dairy products. We aimed therefore at developing a specific identification assay for the SBSEC targeting the 16S rRNA gene comprising a multiplex PCR followed by a differentiating restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP). The multiplex PCR assay was positively applied on 200 SBSEC isolates including reference strains. The assay did not yield false-positive amplifications with strains of closely related bacteria and isolates of non-SBSEC streptococci, lactococci, enterococci, and other genera of dairy origin. The downstream RFLP using MseI and XbaI enabled further discrimination of Streptococcus infantarius/S. bovis (biotype II.1) from Streptococcus gallolyticus (biotype I and II.2)/Streptococcus alactolyticus and S. equinus. Furthermore, the newly developed primers can be used directly for Sanger sequencing. Conclusively, this novel PCR/RFLP assay is applicable in the complex dairy microbial communities and provides an important tool to assess the prevalence of members of the SBSEC in dairy products.
TI  - A longitudinal case series description of meningitis due to Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus in infants.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, previously known as Streptococcus bovis biotype II.2, is known to cause multiple infectious complications, including bacterial meningitis, in adults. Only sporadic individual case reports have identified this pathogen as a cause of meningitis in infants. This study is the first to longitudinally document S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus as a cause of meningitis in four epidemiologically unrelated infants less than 2 weeks of age. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of all 4 isolates were identical, and further were identical to 3 central nervous system (CNS) strains (two adults and one child) reported in existing literature. S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus is an increasingly recognized cause of meningitis and bacteremia in the newborn period, and it merits further study with respect to etiology of infection.
TI  - Molecular characterization of a Streptococcus gallolyticus genomic island encoding a pilus involved in endocarditis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus gallolyticus is a causative agent of infective endocarditis associated with colon cancer. Genome sequence of strain UCN34 revealed the existence of 3 pilus loci (pil1, pil2, and pil3). Pili are long filamentous structures playing a key role as adhesive organelles in many pathogens. The pil1 locus encodes 2 LPXTG proteins (Gallo2178 and Gallo2179) and 1 sortase C (Gallo2177). Gallo2179 displaying a functional collagen-binding domain was referred to as the adhesin, whereas Gallo2178 was designated as the major pilin. METHODS: S. gallolyticus UCN34, Pil1(+) and Pil1(-), expressing various levels of pil1, and recombinant Lactococcus lactis strains, constitutively expressing pil1, were studied. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the putative pilin subunits Gallo2178 and Gallo2179 were used in immunoblotting and immunogold electron microscopy. The role of pil1 was tested in a rat model of endocarditis. RESULTS: We showed that the pil1 locus (gallo2179-78-77) forms an operon differentially expressed among S. gallolyticus strains. Short pilus appendages were identified both on the surface of S. gallolyticus UCN34 and recombinant L. lactis-expressing pil1. We demonstrated that Pil1 pilus is involved in binding to collagen, biofilm formation, and virulence in experimental endocarditis. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies Pil1 as the first virulence factor characterized in S. gallolyticus.
TI  - Selective antibody response to Streptococcus gallolyticus pilus proteins in colorectal cancer patients.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (previously called Streptococcus bovis biotype I) infections have long been associated with colorectal cancer (CRC). This work aimed to investigate the CRC-associated humoral immune response to four pilus proteins of this bacterium by newly developed ELISAs. Pilus proteins are interesting diagnostic targets as they are the building blocks of pilin-like structures that mediate bacterial virulence and are readily exposed to the host immune system upon infection. The presence of serum antibodies against these pilus proteins was evaluated in Dutch and American populations. These analyses showed that an immune response to these antigens was specific for clinical S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus infections, but that increased serum antibody titers to multiple pilus proteins in single individuals were rarely observed. However, a multiplex approach based on antibody titers against any of these four antigens resulted in assay sensitivities between 16% and 43% for the detection of early-stage CRC. Together these findings underscore the potential of a multi-antigen approach to complement diagnosis of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus-associated CRC.
TI  - Neonatal meningitis caused by Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus.
AB  - We encountered a case of neonatal meningitis caused by Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus. The patient was an 8-day-old boy. Gram staining of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed gram-positive cocci in pairs or in short chains. In culture, gamma-streptococcus-like colonies grew. The result of 16S rRNA sequence analysis identified S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus. From these results, bacterial meningitis was diagnosed and, as a result of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, single-dose ampicillin therapy was given. Because inflammatory deterioration and spread was suspected from the CSF test results, this therapy was added by panipenem/betamipron. In response to his recovery, antibiotic treatment was stopped and the boy was discharged. This bacterium was classified as S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus in the latest report in 2003. Since this change, there have only been a few cases of neonatal meningitis caused by this bacterium. Here we report this rare case.
TI  - Clinical Importance of Streptococcus gallolyticus infection among colorectal cancer patients: systematic review and meta-analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus bovis has long been associated with colorectal cancer (CRC). However, not all genospecies are as closely related to CRC. With this systematic review, we aim to increase the awareness of the association between S. bovis biotype I (Streptococcus gallolyticus) and CRC and urge for uniform molecular microbiological classification. METHODS: In January 2011, the PubMed database was searched for all studies that investigated the association between S. bovis, infective endocarditis (IE), and CRC. A total of 191 studies were screened for eligibility and yielded 52 case reports and 31 case series, of which 11 were used for meta-analysis on the association between S. bovis biotype, IE, and adenomas/carcinomas (CRC). RESULTS: Among the S. bovis-infected patients who underwent colonic evaluation, the median percentage of patients who had concomitant adenomas/carcinomas was 60% (interquartile range, 22%), which largely exceeds the disease rate reported in the general asymptomatic population. Meta-analysis showed that patients with S. bovis biotype I infection had a strongly increased risk of having CRC (pooled odds ratio [OR], 7.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.94-13.36) and IE (pooled OR, 16.61; 95% CI, 8.85-31.16), compared with S. bovis biotype II-infected patients. Notably, CRC occurred more often among patients with S. bovis IE than among patients with S. bovis infection at other sites (pooled OR, 3.72; 95% CI, 2.03-6.81). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis clearly indicates that S. bovis should no longer be regarded as a single species in clinical practice, because S. gallolyticus (S. bovis biotype I) infection, in particular, has an unambiguous association with CRC.
TI  - Surface-affinity profiling to identify host-pathogen interactions.
AB  - Proteolytic treatment of intact bacterial cells has proven to be a convenient approach for the identification of surface-exposed proteins. This class of proteins directly interacts with the outside world, for instance, during adherence to human epithelial cells. Here, we aimed to identify host receptor proteins by introducing a preincubation step in which bacterial cells were first allowed to capture human proteins from epithelial cell lysates. Using Streptococcus gallolyticus as a model bacterium, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of proteolytically released peptides yielded the identification of a selective number of human epithelial proteins that were retained by the bacterial surface. Of these potential receptors for bacterial interference, (cyto)keratin-8 (CK8) was verified as the most significant hit, and its surface localization was investigated by subcellular fractionation and confocal microscopy. Interestingly, bacterial enolase could be assigned as an interaction partner of CK8 by MS/MS analysis of cross-linked protein complexes and complementary immunoblotting experiments. As surface-exposed enolase has a proposed role in epithelial adherence of several Gram-positive pathogens, its interaction with CK8 seems to point toward a more general virulence mechanism. In conclusion, our study shows that surface-affinity profiling is a valuable tool to identify novel adhesin-receptor pairs, which advocates its application in other hybrid biological systems.
TI  - Streptococcus gallolyticus prosthetic joint infection associated with undiagnosed colonic malignancy.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus is a group D streptococcus which was previously classified as part of the S. bovis/S. equinus complex. It is a rare pathogen in prosthetic joint infection but has been demonstrated to have a strong association with colorectal carcinoma. In this case, a patient with no symptomatology suggestive of colorectal carcinoma presented with a S. gallolyticus prosthetic joint infection. Awareness of the association prompted investigation and subsequent diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma which was successfully treated prior to two-stage revision knee replacement. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: V.
TI  - Complete genome and comparative analysis of Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, an emerging pathogen of infective endocarditis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is an important causative agent of infectious endocarditis, while the pathogenicity of this species is widely unclear. To gain insight into the pathomechanisms and the underlying genetic elements for lateral gene transfer, we sequenced the entire genome of this pathogen. RESULTS: We sequenced the whole genome of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strain ATCC BAA-2069, consisting of a 2,356,444 bp circular DNA molecule with a G+C-content of 37.65% and a novel 20,765 bp plasmid designated as pSGG1. Bioinformatic analysis predicted 2,309 ORFs and the presence of 80 tRNAs and 21 rRNAs in the chromosome. Furthermore, 21 ORFs were detected on the plasmid pSGG1, including tetracycline resistance genes telL and tet(O/W/32/O). Screening of 41 S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates revealed one plasmid (pSGG2) homologous to pSGG1. We further predicted 21 surface proteins containing the cell wall-sorting motif LPxTG, which were shown to play a functional role in the adhesion of bacteria to host cells. In addition, we performed a whole genome comparison to the recently sequenced S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strain UCN34, revealing significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of the whole genome sequence of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus promotes understanding of genetic factors concerning the pathogenesis and adhesion to ECM of this pathogen. For the first time we detected the presence of the mobilizable pSGG1 plasmid, which may play a functional role in lateral gene transfer and promote a selective advantage due to a tetracycline resistance.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of daptomycin tested against gram-positive strains collected in European hospitals: results from 7 years of resistance surveillance (2003-2009).
AB  - Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide approved by the European medicines Agency (EMEA) for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI) and Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis. We evaluated the in vitro activity of daptomycin and comparators tested against clinical isolates from european hospitals over a 7-year period (2003-2009). A total of 36,769 consecutive isolates were collected in 34 medical centers located in 13 European countries, Turkey and Israel. the collection included S. aureus (18,352; 27.2% oxacillin-resistant [MRSA]); coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 6,874), Enterococcus spp. (7,241; 9.4% vancomycin-resistant), beta-hemolytic (3,009), viridans group streptococci (1,176), and Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus (107). The organisms were isolated mainly from patients with bloodstream infection (56%) or cSSTI (23%). Daptomycin was very active against S. aureus and CoNS (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l for both organisms), and its activity was not adversely influenced by oxacillin resistance. All Enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to daptomycin (MIC(50/90), 1/1 mg/l). Daptomycin (MIC(50/90), 2/2 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and linezolid (MIC(50/90), 1/2 mg/l; 99.7% susceptible) were the most active agents tested against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium. Vancomycin- resistant and -susceptible enterococcal strains were equally susceptible to daptomycin. Daptomycin was also active against beta-hemolytic streptococci (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.25 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible), viridans group streptococci (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 99.8% susceptible) and S. bovis (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.12 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible).In summary, daptomycin was very potent against this large collection (36,769) of Gram-positive organisms isolated in european hospitals, and its activity remained stable across the 7-year period evaluated (2003-2009), using reference methods and interpretive criteria. Decreases in daptomycin potency were not observed since EMEA approval and widespread clinical use, and emerging resistance to other compounds did not adversely influence daptomycin activity against contemporary Gram-positive species.
TI  - Reidentification of Streptococcus bovis isolates causing bacteremia according to  the new taxonomy criteria: still an issue?
AB  - All Streptococcus bovis blood culture isolates recovered from January 2003 to January 2010 (n = 52) at the Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal were reidentified on the basis of their genetic traits using new taxonomic criteria. Initial identification was performed by the semiautomatic Wider system (Fco. Soria-Melguizo, Spain) and the API 20 Strep system (bioMerieux, France). All isolates were reidentified by PCR amplification and sequencing of both the 16S rRNA and sodA genes and by mass spectrometry using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS; Bruker, Germany). Results of 16S rRNA/sodA gene sequencing were as follows: Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, 14/14 (number of isolates identified by 16S rRNA/number of isolates identified by sodA gene sequencing); Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, 24/24; Streptococcus spp., 7/0; Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius, 0/2; Streptococcus lutetiensis, 0/5; Leuconostoc mesenteroides, 4/0; and Lactococcus lactis, 3/3. MALDI-TOF MS identified 27 S. gallolyticus isolates but not at the subspecies level, 4 L. mesenteroides isolates, 3 L. lactis isolates, and 6 S. lutetiensis isolates, whereas 12 isolates rendered a nonreliable identification result. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis grouped all S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates into 3 major clusters clearly different from those of the S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus isolates, which, in turn, exhibited no clonal relationship. The percentages of resistance to the tested antimicrobials were 38% for erythromycin, 23% for fosfomycin, 10% for levofloxacin, 6% for tetracycline, and 4% for co-trimoxazole. The most frequent underlying diseases were hepatobiliary disorders (53%), endocarditis (17%), and malignancies (12%). We conclude that sequencing of the sodA gene was the most discriminatory method and that S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus appears to have a higher genetic diversity than S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus.
TI  - Exploring internal features of 16S rRNA gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. The genus has been divided into different groups based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. The variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. The present study was taken up to explore 16S rRNA gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus Streptococcus. METHODS: 16S rRNA gene sequences belonging to the isolates of S. dysgalactiae, S. equi, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. bovis, S. gallolyticus, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. mitis, S. pneumoniae, S. thermophilus and S. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. RESULTS: The framework based analysis was used to segregate Streptococcus spp. previously identified upto genus level. This segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized Streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. CONCLUSIONS: The markers generated exploring 16S rRNA gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus Streptococcus.
TI  - Sequencing and comparative genome analysis of two pathogenic Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies: genome plasticity, adaptation and virulence.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus infections in humans are often associated with bacteremia, infective endocarditis and colon cancers. The disease manifestations are different depending on the subspecies of S. gallolyticus causing the infection. Here, we present the complete genomes of S. gallolyticus ATCC 43143 (biotype I) and S. pasteurianus ATCC 43144 (biotype II.2). The genomic differences between the two biotypes were characterized with comparative genomic analyses. The chromosome of ATCC 43143 and ATCC 43144 are 2,36 and 2,10 Mb in length and encode 2246 and 1869 CDS respectively. The organization and genomic contents of both genomes were most similar to the recently published S. gallolyticus UCN34, where 2073 (92%) and 1607 (86%) of the ATCC 43143 and ATCC 43144 CDS were conserved in UCN34 respectively. There are around 600 CDS conserved in all Streptococcus genomes, indicating the Streptococcus genus has a small core-genome (constitute around 30% of total CDS) and substantial evolutionary plasticity. We identified eight and five regions of genome plasticity in ATCC 43143 and ATCC 43144 respectively. Within these regions, several proteins were recognized to contribute to the fitness and virulence of each of the two subspecies. We have also predicted putative cell-surface associated proteins that could play a role in adherence to host tissues, leading to persistent infections causing sub-acute and chronic diseases in humans. This study showed evidence that the S. gallolyticus still possesses genes making it suitable in a rumen environment, whereas the ability for S. pasteurianus to live in rumen is reduced. The genome heterogeneity and genetic diversity among the two biotypes, especially membrane and lipoproteins, most likely contribute to the differences in the pathogenesis of the two S. gallolyticus biotypes and the type of disease an infected patient eventually develops.
TI  - Novel clues on the specific association of Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp gallolyticus with colorectal cancer.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp gallolyticus ( Streptococcus bovis biotype I) endocarditis is in general low but very often linked to colorectal cancer. Therefore, this study aimed to reveal the virulence characteristics that distinguish this opportunistic pathogen from a panel of (closely related) intestinal bacteria. METHODS: The route of infection was reconstructed in vitro with adhesion, invasion, and translocation assays on differentiated Caco-2 cells. Furthermore, cellular immune responses upon infection and bacterial biofilm formation were analyzed in a comparative manner. RESULTS: S. gallolyticus subsp gallolyticus strains were demonstrated to have a relative low adhesiveness and could not internalize epithelial cells. However, these bacteria were uniquely able to paracellularly cross a differentiated epithelium without inducing epithelial interleukin 8 or 1beta responses. Importantly, they had an outstanding ability to form biofilms on collagen-rich surfaces, which in vivo are found at damaged heart valves and (pre)cancerous sites with a displaced epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data show that S. gallolyticus subsp gallolyticus has a unique repertoire of virulence factors that facilitate infection through (pre)malignant colonic lesions and subsequently can provide this bacterium with a competitive advantage in (1) evading the innate immune system and (2) forming resistant vegetations at collagen-rich sites in susceptible patients with colorectal cancer.

TI  - Analysis of bacterial communities of traditional fermented West African cereal foods using culture independent methods.
AB  - In this study, the microbial composition of kunu-zaki and ogi, two popular foods  in Nigeria produced after natural, uncontrolled fermentation of cereals, was assessed by culture-independent molecular profiling methods. In particular, PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and construction of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries revealed the presence of diverse bacterial communities. DNA sequencing of the highly variable V3 region of the 16S rRNA genes obtained from PCR-DGGE fingerprints identified species related to Weissella confusa, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus amylolyticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Bacillus spp. and Lactococcus lactis spp lactis from food samples obtained from northern and southern geographical locations. A more comprehensive analysis of 272 full-length 16S rRNA gene inserts revealed that 70% of them were assigned to the Lactobacillaceae family and 19% to the Streptococcaceae family. Interestingly, sequences associated with a particular food type were also identified. For example, L. plantarum, L. pantheris and L. vaccinostercus were found in ogi but not in kunu-zaki while W. confusa, Streptococcus lutetiensis and Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus were found in kunu-zaki but not in ogi. Phylotypes corresponding to potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus were also detected highlighting the need for controlled fermentation processes.
TI  - The association of Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus with colorectal tumors: the nature and the underlying mechanisms of its etiological role.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis (S. bovis) bacteria are associated with colorectal cancer and adenoma. S. bovis is currently named S. gallolyticus. 25 to 80% of patients with S. bovis/gallolyticus bacteremia have concomitant colorectal tumors. Colonic neoplasia may arise years after the presentation of bacteremia or infectious endocarditis of S. bovis/gallolyticus. The presence of S. bovis/gallolyticus bacteremia and/or endocarditis is also related to the presence of villous or tubular-villous adenomas in the large intestine. In addition, serological relationship of S. gallolyticus with colorectal tumors and direct colonization of S. gallolyticus in tissues of colorectal tumors were found. However, this association is still under controversy and has long been underestimated. Moreover, the etiological versus non-etiological nature of this associationis not settled yet. Therefore, by covering the most of up to date studies, this review attempts to clarify the nature and the core of S. bovis/gallolyicus association with colorectal tumors and analyze the possible underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Molecular detection, quantification, and isolation of Streptococcus gallolyticus  bacteria colonizing colorectal tumors: inflammation-driven potential of carcinogenesis via IL-1, COX-2, and IL-8.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) has long been associated with bacteremia and/or endocarditis by Streptococcus gallolyticus member bacteria (SGMB) but the direct colonization of SGMB along with its molecular carcinogenic role, if any, has not been investigated. We assessed the colonization of SGMB in CRC patients with history of bacteremia (CRC-w/bac) and without history of bacteremia (CRC-wo/bac) by isolating SGMB from feces, mucosal surfaces of colorectum, and colorectal tissues and detecting SGMB DNA, via PCR and in situ hybridization (ISH) assays targeting SodA gene in colorectal tissues. Moreover, mRNA of IL1, IL-8, COX-2, IFN-gamma, c-Myc, and Bcl-2 in colorectal tissues of studied groups was assessed via ISH and RT-PCR. RESULTS: SGMB were found to be remarkably isolated in tumorous (TU) and non-tumorous (NTU) tissues of CRC-w/bac, 20.5% and 17.3%, and CRC-wo/bac, 12.8% and 11.5%, respectively while only 2% of control tissues revealed SGMB (P < 0.05); such contrast was not found in mucosal and fecal isolation of SGMB. The positive detection of SGMB DNA in TU and NTU of CRC-w/bac and CRC-wo/bac via PCR, 48.7%, 35.9%, 32.7%, and 23%, respectively, and ISH, 46.1%, 30.7%, 28.8%, and 17.3%, respectively, was higher than in control tissues, 4 and 2%, respectively (P < 0.05). SGMB count measured via quantitative PCR of SGMB DNA in terms of copy number (CN), in TU and NTU of CRC-w/bac and CRC-wo/bac, 2.96-4.72, 1.29-2.81, 2.16-2.92, and 0.67-2.07 log10 CN/g respectively, showed higher colonization in TU than in NTU and in CRC-w/bac than in CRC-wo/bac (P < 0.05). The PCR-based mRNA ratio and ISH-based percentage of positively stained cells of IL-1, 1.77 and 70.3%, COX-2, 1.63 and 44.8%, and IL-8, 1.73 and 70.3%, respectively, rather than IFN-gamma, c-Myc, and Bcl-2, were higher in SGMB positive patients than in control or SGMB negative patients (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The current study indicated that colorectal cancer is remarkably associated with SGMB; moreover, molecular detection of SGMB in CRC was superior to link SGMB with CRC tumors highlighting a possible direct and active role of SGMB in CRC development through most probably inflammation-based sequel of tumor development or propagation via, but not limited to, IL-1, COX-2, and IL-8.
TI  - Increased exposure to bacterial antigen RpL7/L12 in early stage colorectal cancer patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer 2010. (c) 2010 American Cancer Society. : Intestinal bacteria  have long been implicated in colorectal cancer pathology, and many reports point to a close linkage between Streptococcus bovis biotype I (recently renamed Streptococcus gallolyticus) infections and tumors of the human colon. This work aims to investigate the humoral immune response to this bacterium during different stages of colorectal cancer. METHODS: The presence of serum antibodies against S. bovis antigen RpL7/L12, previously assigned as a potential diagnostic antigen, was evaluated in Dutch (n = 209) and American (n = 112) populations using a newly developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The analyses consistently showed that an immune response against this bacterial antigen was increased in polyp patients and stage I/II colorectal cancer patients as compared with asymptomatic individuals. This was not paralleled by increased antibody production to endotoxin, an intrinsic cell wall component of the majority of intestinal bacteria, which implies that the humoral immune response against RpL7/L12 is not a general phenomenon induced by the loss of colonic barrier function. Notably, increased anti-RpL7/L12 levels were not or were only mildly detected in late stage colorectal cancer patients having lymph node or distant metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer 2010. (c) 2010 American Cancer Society. : These findings are indicative of an increased exposure to antigen RpL7/L12 during early stages of colon carcinogenesis and suggest that intestinal bacteria such as S. bovis constitute a risk factor for the progression of premalignant lesions into early stage carcinomas. Clearly, the current findings emphasize the necessity for further studies on the possible etiologic relationship between intestinal bacteria and human colorectal cancer.
TI  - A case of Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus infective endocarditis with colon cancer: identification by 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing.
AB  - Although the association between Streptococcus bovis endocarditis and colon carcinoma is well known, very few cases of S. bovis infection associated with underlying malignancies have been reported in Korea. The S. bovis group has been recently reclassified and renamed as Streptococcus gallolyticus and Streptococcus infantarius subspecies under a new nomenclature system. We report a case of infective endocarditis with colon cancer caused by S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (previously named S. bovis biotype I). A 59-yr-old woman presented with a 1-month history of fever. Initial blood cultures were positive for gram-positive cocci, and echocardiography showed vegetation on mitral and aortic valves. Antibiotic treatment for infective endocarditis was started. The infecting strain was a catalase-negative and bile-esculin-positive alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus susceptible to penicillin and vancomycin. The strain was identified as S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus with the use of the Vitek 2 GPI and API 20 Strep systems (bioMerieux, USA). The 16S rDNA sequences of the blood culture isolates showed 100% homology with those of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus reported in GenBank. The identification of the infecting organism, and the subsequent communication among clinical microbiologists and physicians about the changed nomenclature, led to the detection of colon cancer. The patient recovered after treatment with antibiotics, valve surgery, and operation for colon cancer. This is the first report of biochemical and genetic identification of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus causing infective endocarditis associated with underlying colon cancer in a Korean patient.

TI  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus (biotype II/2), a newly reported cause of adult meningitis.
AB  - We report the first case of adult meningitis confirmed to be due to Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus. Phenotypically reported as Streptococcus bovis biotype II/2, 16S rRNA sequencing revealed S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus. Because of taxonomic uncertainties, S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus may be an underrecognized agent of systemic infections.
TI  - Interactions between endocarditis-derived Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates and human endothelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is an important causative agent of infective endocarditis (IE) but the knowledge on virulence factors is limited and the pathogenesis of the infection is poorly understood. In the present study, we established an experimental in vitro IE cell culture model using EA.hy926 and HUVEC cells to investigate the adhesion and invasion characteristics of 23 Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strains from different origins (human IE-derived isolates, other human clinical isolates, animal isolates). Adhesion to eight components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the ability to form biofilms in vitro was examined in order to reveal features of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus endothelial infection. In addition, the strains were analyzed for the presence of the three virulence factors gtf, pilB, and fimB by PCR. RESULTS: The adherence to and invasion characteristics of the examined S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strains to the endothelial cell line EA.hy926 differ significantly among themselves. In contrast, the usage of three different in vitro models (EA.hy926 cells, primary endothelial cells (HUVECs), mechanical stretched cells) revealed no differences regarding the adherence to and invasion characteristics of different strains. Adherence to the ECM proteins collagen I, II and IV revealed the highest values, followed by fibrinogen, tenascin and laminin. Moreover, a strong correlation was observed in binding to these proteins by the analyzed strains. All strains show the capability to adhere to polystyrole surfaces and form biofilms. We further confirmed the presence of the genes of two known virulence factors (fimB: all strains, gtf: 19 of 23 strains) and demonstrated the presence of the gene of one new putative virulence factor (pilB: 9 of 23 strains) by PCR. CONCLUSION: Our study provides the first description of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus adhesion and invasion of human endothelial cells, revealing important initial information of strain variability, behaviour and characteristics of this as yet barely analyzed pathogen.
TI  - Genome sequence of Streptococcus gallolyticus: insights into its adaptation to the bovine rumen and its ability to cause endocarditis.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly known as Streptococcus bovis biotype I) is an increasing cause of endocarditis among streptococci and frequently associated with colon cancer. S. gallolyticus is part of the rumen flora but also a cause of disease in ruminants as well as in birds. Here we report the complete nucleotide sequence of strain UCN34, responsible for endocarditis in a patient also suffering from colon cancer. Analysis of the 2,239 proteins encoded by its 2,350-kb-long genome revealed unique features among streptococci, probably related to its adaptation to the rumen environment and its capacity to cause endocarditis. S. gallolyticus has the capacity to use a broad range of carbohydrates of plant origin, in particular to degrade polysaccharides derived from the plant cell wall. Its genome encodes a large repertoire of transporters and catalytic activities, like tannase, phenolic compounds decarboxylase, and bile salt hydrolase, that should contribute to the detoxification of the gut environment. Furthermore, S. gallolyticus synthesizes all 20 amino acids and more vitamins than any other sequenced Streptococcus species. Many of the genes encoding these specific functions were likely acquired by lateral gene transfer from other bacterial species present in the rumen. The surface properties of strain UCN34 may also contribute to its virulence. A polysaccharide capsule might be implicated in resistance to innate immunity defenses, and glucan mucopolysaccharides, three types of pili, and collagen binding proteins may play a role in adhesion to tissues in the course of endocarditis.
TI  - Mode of action and In Vitro susceptibility of mastitis pathogens to macedocin ST91KM and preparation of a teat seal containing the bacteriocin.
AB  - Mastitis is considered to be the most economically costly disease affecting the dairy industry. Regular dosage of animals with antibiotics, including use of prophylactic concentrations, may select for resistant strains. The purpose of this study was to determine the mode of action of a new bacteriocin (macedocin ST91KM), to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance of mastitis pathogens to antibiotics commonly used in treatment remedies, and to introduce the possible use of an alternative antimicrobial agent. The bacteriocin macedocin ST91KM, produced by Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus ST91KM, is bactericidal to Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis and Staphylococcus aureus associated with mastitis infections, including strains resistant to methicillin and oxacillin. Sensitive cells were deformed and secreted nucleotides, K(+) and beta-galactosidase when exposed to macedocin ST91KM. Adsorption of the peptide to target cells decreased in the presence of solvents, suggesting that receptors on the cell surfaces have lipid moieties. No adsorption was recorded in the presence of MgCl2, KI and Na2CO3, suggesting that ionic strength plays an important role. A teat seal preparation containing macedocin ST91KM effectively released the peptide and inhibited the growth of S. agalactiae. Macedocin ST91KM could form the basis for alternative dry cow therapy to prevent mastitis infections in dairy cows as it is effective against pathogens that display resistance to conventional antibiotic therapy.

TI  - Investigation into the controversial association of Streptococcus gallolyticus with colorectal cancer and adenoma.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The seroprevalence of IgG antibodies of Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus, CIP 105428, was evaluated to investigate the controversial association of S. gallolyticus with colorectal carcinoma and adenoma in attempt to investigate the nature of such association if any, by exploring the mRNA expression of NF-kappaB and IL-8. Moreover, the serological behavior of S. gallolyticus IgG antibodies was compared to that of an indicator bacterium of bowel, Bacteroides fragilis. METHODS: ELISA was used to measure IgG antibodies of S. gallolyticus and B. fragilis in sera of 50 colorectal cancer, 14 colorectal adenoma patients, 30 age- and sex- matched apparently healthy volunteers (HV) and 30 age- and sex- matched colonoscopically-proven tumor-free control subjects. NF-kappaB and IL-8 mRNA expression was evaluated in tumorous and non-tumorous tissue sections of carcinoma and adenoma patients in comparison with that of control subjects by using in situ hybridization assay. RESULTS: Colorectal cancer and adenoma patients were associated with higher levels of serum S. gallolyticus IgG antibodies in comparison with HV and control subjects (P < 0.05) while no similar association was found with serum IgG antibodies of B. fragilis (P > 0.05). ELISA cutoff value for the seropositivity of S. gallolyticus IgG was calculated from tumor-free control group. The expression of NF-kappaB mRNA was higher in tumorous than non-tumorous tissue sections of adenoma and carcinoma, higher in carcinoma/adenoma sections than in control subjects, higher in tumorous sections of carcinoma than in adenoma patients, and higher in S. gallolyticus IgG seropositive than in seronegative groups in both tumorous and non-tumorous sections (P < 0.05). IL-8 mRNA expression in tumorous sections of adenoma and carcinoma was higher than in non-tumorous sections, higher in carcinoma/adenoma than in control subjects, and higher in S. gallolyticus IgG seropositive than in seronegative groups in tumorous rather than non-tumorous sections (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: S. gallolyticus most likely plays an essential role in the oncogenic progression of normal colorectal mucosa to adenoma and to CRC. This promoting/propagating role of S. gallolyticus might take place by utilizing certain inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and angiogenic factors of transformation including NF-kappaB and IL-8.
TI  - Surface-exposed histone-like protein a modulates adherence of Streptococcus gallolyticus to colon adenocarcinoma cells.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly known as Streptococcus bovis biotype I) is a low-grade opportunistic pathogen which is considered to be associated with colon cancer. It is thought that colon polyps or tumors are the main portal of entry for this bacterium and that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) at the colon tumor cell surface are involved in bacterial adherence during the first stages of infection. In this study, we have shown that the histone-like protein A (HlpA) of S. gallolyticus is a genuine anchorless bacterial surface protein that binds to lipoteichoic acid (LTA) of the gram-positive cell wall in a growth phase-dependent manner. In addition, HlpA was shown to be one of the major heparin-binding proteins of S. gallolyticus able to bind to the HSPG-expressing colon tumor cell lines HCT116 and HT-29. Strikingly, although wild-type levels of HlpA appeared to contribute to adherence, coating of additional HlpA at the bacterial surface resulted in reduced binding to colon tumor cells. This may be explained by the fact that heparan sulfate and LTA compete for the same binding site in HlpA. Altogether, this study implies that HlpA serves as a fine-tuning factor for bacterial adherence.

TI  - A collagen-binding adhesin, Acb, and ten other putative MSCRAMM and pilus family  proteins of Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (Streptococcus bovis Group, biotype I).
AB  - Members of the Streptococcus bovis group are important causes of endocarditis. However, factors associated with their pathogenicity, such as adhesins, remain uncharacterized. We recently demonstrated that endocarditis-derived Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates frequently adhere to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Here, we generated a draft genome sequence of an ECM protein-adherent S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strain and found, by genome-wide analyses, 11 predicted LPXTG-type cell wall-anchored proteins with characteristics of MSCRAMMs, including a modular architecture of domains predicted to adopt immunoglobulin (Ig)-like folding. A recombinant segment of one of these, Acb, showed high-affinity binding to immobilized collagen, and cell surface expression of Acb correlated with the presence of acb and collagen adherence of isolates. Three of the 11 proteins have similarities to major pilus subunits and are organized in separate clusters, each including a second Ig-fold-containing MSCRAMM and a class C sortase, suggesting that the sequenced strain encodes three distinct types of pili. Reverse transcription-PCR demonstrated that all three genes of one cluster, acb-sbs7-srtC1, are cotranscribed, consistent with pilus operons of other gram-positive bacteria. Further analysis detected expression of all 11 genes in cells grown to mid to late exponential growth phases. Wide distribution of 9 of the 11 genes was observed among S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates with fewer genes present in other S. bovis group species/subspecies. The high prevalence of genes encoding putative MSCRAMMs and pili, including a collagen-binding MSCRAMM, among S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates may play an important role in the predominance of this subspecies in S. bovis endocarditis.

TI  - Association of Streptococcus pluranimalium with valvular endocarditis and septicaemia in adult broiler parents.
AB  - The genus Streptococcus consists of more than 60 species, but only Streptococcus  equi subspecies zooepidemicus, Streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus, Streptococcus gallinaceus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus suis have been isolated from poultry. During investigations of the aetiology of increased mortality in broiler parent stock at the end of production, pure cultures of streptococcal-like organisms that could not be classified among these six species were obtained from 24 cases of septicaemia or valvular endocarditis and septicaemia. Phenotypic characterization using the API20 STREP kit identified the isolates as Aerococcus viridans (10), Aerococcus urinae (2), Leuconostoc species (4), Streptococcus salivarius (2), Streptococcus bovis II 3 (1), Enterococcus avium (3), Enterococcus faecium (1) or Gemella morbillorum (1). However, this identification was misleading as subsequent genetic investigations using pulse field gel electrophoresis and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes showed that 19 isolates were classified as Streptococcus pluranimalium, while the remaining isolates were E. avium (3), E. faecium (1) or Lactobacillus species (1). Misidentification by API20 STREP was related to the database provided by the manufacturer, as the phenotypic characteristics could identify these organisms as S. pluranimalium. The isolates of S. pluranimalium belonged to at least three different clones as determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of SmaI-digested genomic DNA. The capacity that these isolates had to colonize the valvular endothelium was suggested by the occurrence of valvular endocarditis in 12 of 19 cases. Demonstration of the same clone in all four houses on a farm suggested the pathogenic potential of this organism.

AB  - A 55-year-old man admitted on April 1, 2008, for sudden abdominal pain onset whose laboratory data demonstrated apparent inflammation and whose computed tomography (CT) results showed free air and ascites underwent emergency surgery. An ascetic fluid sample submitted for bacteriological examination yielded Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. He was treated for 6 days with flomoxef (FMOX; 3 g/day) and recovered, being discharged on hospital day 17. This is, to our knowledge, the first case reported in Japan of bacterial peritonitis due to S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus.
TI  - Adherence characteristics of endocarditis-derived Streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus (Streptococcus bovis biotype I) isolates to host extracellular matrix proteins.
AB  - Members of the Streptococcus bovis group are frequent colonizers of the intestinal tract, which can also cause endocarditis. However, their ability to adhere to and colonize host tissues and the factors associated with pathogenicity are largely unknown. Here, we assessed 17 endocarditis-derived human isolates [identified here as 15 Streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus (S. bovis biotype I), one S. gallolyticus ssp. pasteurianus (biotype II/2) and one Streptococcus infantarius ssp. coli (biotype II/1)] for their in vitro adherence to components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Adherence to collagen type I was found to be the most common phenotype exhibited by 76% of isolates, followed by collagen type IV (53%), fibrinogen (47%), collagen type V (35%) and fibronectin (35%). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analyses showed that >50% of endocarditis-derived S. gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus isolates are genetically diverse, although two clusters of two and four isolates were observed. The diversity of strains and differences observed in adherence characteristics to distinct host ECM proteins suggest that isolates of S. gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus produce different surface components, similar to other gram-positive pathogens, to colonize the host and cause infection.
TI  - Identification of Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus as the etiological agent in a case of culture-negative multivalve infective endocarditis by 16S rDNA PCR analysis of resected valvular tissue.
AB  - Today, PCR using broad-range primers is being used increasingly to detect pathogens from resected heart valves. Herein is described the first case of multivalve infective endocarditis where 16S rDNA PCR was used to detect a single pathogen from two affected valves in a 61-year-old man. Triple heart valve replacement was required despite six weeks of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. The organism was confirmed as Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus, a member of the 'S. equinus/S. bovis' complex. To date, only one report has been made of human infection due to this organism. This may be due to the limited resolution of the routine diagnostic methods used and/or as a consequence of the complex nomenclature associated with this group of organisms.

AB  - AIM: To identify Streptococcus bovis bacteraemia episodes and their clinical associations, including differences in associations by S. bovis biotypes (or species). METHODS: The study was performed at Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane. Streptococcus bovis blood culture results for 1999-2006 were retrieved. Patient data including diagnosis and investigations were retrospectively obtained from clinical records and compared with the microbiological result, including S. bovis biotype/species. RESULTS: Twenty evaluable S. bovis bacteraemia episodes were identified. Ten were S. bovis biotype I (Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus) and 10 S. bovis II. For S. bovis I infections, six patients had a diagnosis of infective endocarditis. Nine had assessment for colonic pathology and all had malignant or premalignant colonic lesions. Of patients with S. bovis II infections, two were diagnosed with endocarditis and six had a hepatobiliary source of infection. Of five patients assessed in this group, three had premalignant colonic lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Endocarditis and hepatobiliary infections were the main causes of S. bovis bacteraemia. Endocarditis was diagnosed in the majority of S. bovis I bacteraemias and all patients assessed in this group had premalignant/malignant colonic lesions. Determining S. bovis biotype/species provides information on likely clinical associations of bacteraemia episodes.

AB  
TI  - Bacteriocin ST91KM, produced by Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus ST91KM, is a narrow-spectrum peptide active against bacteria associated with mastitis in dairy cattle.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus ST91KM produces a bacteriocin (macedocin ST91KM) active against Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Macedocin ST91KM is, according to tricine-SDS PAGE, between 2.0 and 2.5 kDa in size. Antimicrobial activity remained unchanged after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-10.0 and after 100 min at 100 degrees C. The peptide was inactivated after 20 min at 121 degrees C and when treated with proteolytic enzymes. Treatment with alpha-amylase had no effect on activity, suggesting that the mode of action does not depend on glycosylation. Amplification of the genome of strain ST91KM with primers designed from the macedocin precursor gene (mcdA) produced 2 fragments (approximately 375 and 220 bp) instead of one 150-bp fragment, as recorded for macedocin produced by Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus ACA-DC 198. Strain ACA-DC 198 was not available. However, DNA amplified from strain LMG 18488 (ACA-DC 206), genetically closely related to strain ACA-DC 198, revealed 99% homology to the mcdA of strain ACA-DC 198 (accession No. DQ835394). Macedocin ST91KM may thus be a second putative bacteriocin described for Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus.
TI  - Comprehensive study of strains previously designated Streptococcus bovis consecutively isolated from human blood cultures and emended description of Streptococcus gallolyticus and Streptococcus infantarius subsp. coli.
AB  - Modern taxonomy has delineated Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, Streptococcus infantarius subsp. coli, and S. infantarius subsp. infantarius within the heterogenous group of previously designated clinical Streptococcus bovis bacteria. In the present study, 58 consecutive blood culture isolates initially designated S. bovis were further characterized by applying phenotypic and molecular genetic methods, and possible disease associations were investigated by studying the patients' records. Published phenotypic characteristics of S. gallolyticus and S. infantarius were not unequivocal and did not allow an unambiguous phenotypic differentiation of the 58 clinical isolates. However, full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences clearly assigned the strains to S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (n = 29), S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (n = 12), and S. infantarius subsp. coli (n = 17). Only 28% of the patients with available records presented with endocarditis and 7% presented with colon carcinoma, whereas 37% of the patients had altered liver parenchyma and 28% had gall bladder disease as underlying diseases. Detailed antimicrobial susceptibility data on both S. gallolyticus subspecies and S. infantarius subsp. coli are given for the first time. As a result of the extensive characterization of the largest number of S. gallolyticus and S. infantarius human clinical isolates published so far, emended species descriptions are given. It is recommended that both clinical microbiologists and infectious disease specialists avoid the designation S. bovis for true S. gallolyticus and S. infantarius strains in the future in order to get a clearer picture of the possible disease associations of these species.
TI  - Endocarditis in chickens caused by subclinical infection of Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus causes endocarditis in humans and  acute septicemia in domestic birds. We describe here the infective endocarditis caused by the bacterium found among clinically healthy broilers at two abattoirs in Japan. The chickens were thought to be healthy because of the lack of clinical symptoms and normal levels of mortality before slaughtering. At the time of inspection, some chickens were condemned because of organ disorders characterized by vegetative valvular endocarditis as well as focal necrosis in heart, liver, and spleen. Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus was isolated from the organs as a pure culture, indicating that the bacterium probably was the causative agent of the disorders. Amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis of the isolates collected at the abattoirs from chickens grown in nine different farms indicated that the isolates were different variants of the same clonal lineage and may have been derived from the same ancestor. These results suggest that S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus causes infectious endocarditis in chickens and that healthy chickens may possess the bacterium in their normal flora as an opportunistic pathogen.
TI  - Molecular diagnosis of infective endocarditis by real-time broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing directly from heart valve tissue.
AB  - Traditionally, infective endocarditis (IE) has been microbiologically diagnosed by blood cultures or serology. However, conventional microbiologic methods do not always provide an etiologic diagnosis. We conducted the current study to evaluate the usefulness of a universal real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the 16S rRNA gene followed by sequencing for the diagnosis of IE in explanted heart valve tissue (HV) as part of the routine of a clinical microbiology laboratory, and to compare it with conventional culture of blood or HV. We prospectively analyzed 177 HV samples by universal PCR and sequencing: 48 were from 35 patients with definite IE and 129 were from 120 patients without IE. Specific PCR tests were used when necessary to confirm broad-range PCR results. For the 35 patients with IE, all of the HV samples except for 2 from the same patient gave positive PCR results. The microorganisms identified matched those isolated by blood culture in 31 cases. The other 3 patients had negative blood culture IE, but PCR made possible the detection of Tropheryma whipplei, Bartonella quintana, and Streptococcus gallolyticus. For the negative control group, universal PCR was completely negative in 123 of the 129 samples. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of this real-time PCR method were 96%, 95.3%, 98.4%, and 88.5%, respectively, for the diagnosis of IE, using the Duke criteria to define IE and using blood culture results to identify etiologic microorganisms. Conventional HV culture correlated poorly with blood cultures and molecular techniques, and frequently represented tissue contamination resulting from valve handling. Our universal PCR method has proved to be more sensitive, specific, and rapid than conventional culture methods, and should therefore be included as a new major Duke criterion for the diagnosis of IE. According to the results of the current study, this technique should be used to supplement blood and HV culture. Conventional HV cultures are frequently responsible for false-positive and false-negative results, and are not always useful to establish the etiology of IE.
TI  - Association of tannase-producing Staphylococcus lugdunensis with colon cancer and characterization of a novel tannase gene.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between Streptococcus (St.) bovis endocarditis and colon cancer is well known. In St. bovis, the biotype I strain (formerly, St. gallolyticus) produces tannase that degrades tannins. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of tannase-producing bacteria with colon cancer, and to identify the major tannase-producing bacteria and the gene involved. METHODS: Tannase-producing bacteria were isolated in tannic acid-treated selective agar medium from feces and rectal swabs of 357 patients who underwent colon endoscopy from 1999 to 2004. RESULTS: Tannase-producing bacteria were isolated more frequently from the colon cancer group (24.3%) than from the adenoma or normal groups (14.4%; P < 0.05). S. gallolyticus, Staphylococcus (S.) lugdunensis, Lactobacillus (L.) plantarum, and L. pentosus were all identified as tannase-producing bacteria. Of these, S. lugdunensis was significantly isolated from the advanced-stage cancer group (22.2%; P < 0.001) more than from the early-stage cancer (8.6%) or adenoma (4.9%) groups. The gene (tanA) for tannase in S. lugdunensis was cloned and sequenced. The tanA gene was associated with all S. lugdunensis but not with other bacteria by Southern blotting and polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Tannase-producing S. lugdunensis is associated with advanced-stage colon cancer, and the tanA gene is a useful marker for the detection of S. lugdunensis.
TI  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus septicaemia in goslings.
AB  - Increased mortality was observed in a group of 2-3-week old goslings. At post mortem examination, gross lesions included congestion and haemorrhages in the viscera. Histopathological lesions included generalised congestion of tissues with multifocal bacterial colonies, an acute septic fibrinoid splenitis, and an acute septic hepatitis, all consistent with acute septicaemia. Gram-stained sections of liver and lung confirmed the presence of Gram-positive bacteria and Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (Streptococcus bovis biotype II/2) was isolated in pure growth from two of the goslings, and in mixed growth from a third.
TI  - Colon cancer presenting as Streptococcus gallolyticus infective endocarditis.
AB  - A 58-year-old Chinese man presented with a three-week history of fever. He had a  background history of rheumatic heart disease, hypertension, and thalassaemia. He was found to have infective endocarditis of the aortic valve due to Streptococcus gallolyticus. During the hospital stay, he developed a few episodes of haematochaezia and was subsequently found to have colonic carcinomain- situ. He completed appropriate antibiotic treatment for his infective endocarditis and underwent a left hemicolectomy with primary anastomosis. The association between Streptococcus gallolyticus infective endocarditis and colonic neoplasm is well documented. This case report stresses the importance of performing routine colonoscopy to look for colonic neoplastic change in patients diagnosed to have Streptococcus gallolyticus infective endocarditis. The early diagnosis of the colonic neoplasm has enabled our patient to have a curative surgery without compromising his quality of life.
TI  - Geno- and phenotypic diversity of avian isolates of Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (Streptococcus bovis) and associated diagnostic problems.
AB  - Recently, strains of Streptococcus bovis were reclassified as Streptococcus gallolyticus. In the present study we describe for the first time an outbreak of S. gallolyticus in a broiler flock. Mortality during the first week was normal (<1%), with a final total mortality at the end of production reaching 4.3%. Specific symptoms were not observed. Postmortem pathology demonstrated enlarged and light spleens and livers accompanied by multifocal irregular necroses surrounded by a hemorrhagic zone. In addition, these birds suffered from arthritis and osteomyelitis. Strains isolated from liver and spleen lesions showed clonality as demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Compared to strains representing previously derived phylogeny, including the S. bovis-S. equinus complex, the 16S rRNA-derived phylogeny of the strains investigated in this study demonstrated a paraphyletic group (S. gallolyticus) well separated from two monophyletic groups: (i) S. equinus-S. bovis plus S. infantarius and (ii) S. alactolyticus plus S. intestinalis. According to information in GenBank, none of the strains included from the two monophyletic groups have been isolated from birds. Further biochemical analyses, including tannase activity, identified for the first time avian isolates belonging to S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. However, these investigations also demonstrated a clear heterogeneity with pigeon isolates.
TI  - Tigecycline (GAR-936) activity against Streptococcus gallolyticus (bovis) and viridans group streptococci.
AB  - Viridans group streptococci including Streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly S. bovis) represent serious invasive pathogens often associated with endocarditis or sepsis among immunocompromised or cancer patients. Tigecycline (GAR-936), the first clinically studied glycylcycline, has a potent gram-positive activity with a potential treatment option for these streptococcal infections. The studied collection (848 strains) included 100 isolates each of Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, and fewer strains of S. gallolyticus (98 strains) and Streptococcus mutans (50 strains). These strains were isolated from patients on 3 continents in the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program and tested for susceptibility and interpreted by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute broth microdilution methods and criteria (< or = 0.25 microg/mL for tigecycline per US Food and Drug Administration). Penicillin susceptibility rates for the entire collection varied from 61% (S. sanguis) to 98% (S. constellatus), and macrolide susceptibility was also compromised (49-88%; average, 69%). Tigecycline was active against all isolates tested, in contrast to tetracycline resistance rates of 8-66%, and highest for S. gallolyticus. In conclusion tigecycline was quite active against bacteremic isolates of viridans group streptococci species and S. gallolyticus with an overall MIC90 at < or = 0.06 microg/mL; the highest MIC was only 0.25 microg/mL.
TI  - Interaction of gut microflora with tannins in feeds.
AB  - Tannins (hydrolyzable and condensed) are water-soluble polyphenolic compounds that exert antinutritional effects on ruminants by forming complexes with dietary proteins. They limit nitrogen supply to animals, besides inhibiting the growth and activity of ruminal microflora. However, some gastrointestinal microbes are able to break tannin-protein complexes while preferentially degrading hydrolyzable tannins (HTs). Streptococcus gallolyticus, Lonepinella koalarum and Selenomonas ruminantium are the dominant bacterial species that have the ability to degrade HTs. These tanninolytic microorganisms possess tannin-degrading ability and have developed certain mechanisms to tolerate tannins in feeds. Hence, selection of efficient tanninolytic microbes and transinoculation among animals for long-term benefits become areas of intensive interest. Here, we review the effects of tannins on ruminants, the existence and significance of tannin-degrading microorganisms in diverse groups of animals and the mechanisms that tannin-degrading microorganisms have developed to counter the toxic effects of tannin.
TI  - The erm(T) gene is flanked by IS1216V in inducible erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus.
AB  - We investigated the sequence and the genetic context of the erm(T) gene in six inducible erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (formerly S. bovis biotype II.2) isolates. In all isolates, the erm(T) genes were flanked by two IS1216V-like elements with the same polarity and were found to be inserted in the chromosome.
TI  - Isolation of tannin-degrading bacteria isolated from feces of the Japanese large  wood mouse, Apodemus speciosus, feeding on tannin-rich acorns.
AB  - Bacteria with tannase activity were isolated from the feces of the Japanese large wood mouse, Apodemus speciosus. They were largely classified into two groups: Gram-positive cocci and Gram-positive bacilli. Genotypic analysis using a species-specific PCR assay as well as biochemical tests identified all cocci as Streptococcus gallolyticus. A PCR assay targeting a genus-specific sequence in the 16S/23S rDNA spacer region and additional 16S rDNA sequencing indicated that the bacilli belong to the genus Lactobacillus, with L. animalis and L. murinus being closely related taxa. Subsequent estimation of guanine-plus-cytosine content, amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis, and DNA/ DNA hybridization assay confirmed that the bacilli are homologous to each other but different from L. animalis or L. murinus. Consequently, a novel species of the genus Lactobacillus may be proposed. To date, this study is the first to report on the isolation of tannase-positive bacteria from the feces of a rodent species. These bacteria may play an essential role for the host organism in digesting tannin-rich acorns available in their natural habitats, thereby endowing them with a greater ecological advantage.
TI  - Bacteremia due to Streptococcus gallolyticus, or the perils of revised nomenclature in bacteriology.
AB  
TI  - Genetic basis of antibiotic resistance in clinical isolates of Streptococcus gallolyticus (Streptococcus bovis).
AB  - Among 128 Streptococcus gallolyticus (Streptococcus bovis) isolates, 77.7% were resistant to tetracyclines and contained tet(M) and/or tet(L) and/or tet(O). A total of 59.4% had macrolide resistance and contained erm(B) and, rarely, mef(A). Among the one-third of isolates highly resistant to kanamycin and streptomycin, most harbored aphA3 and aad-6 genes.
TI  - ARDRA and RAPD analyses of human and animal isolates of Streptococcus gallolyticus.
AB  - A total of 23 Streptococcus gallolyticus strains, consisting of 12 strains from feces of healthy animals and 11 from clinical cases of human or cow mastitis milk, were examined genealogically. Four strains of S. bovis "biotype II/1" and 3 strains of S. equinus, the closely related organisms to S. gallolyticus, were also analyzed for outgroup comparison. Neither the amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) nor the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis that had been designed to recognize S. gallolyticus strains virulent in pigeons could differentiate clinical strains from the others of S. gallolyticus. No correspondence between the DNA profile in either analysis and the host animal species was detected.
TI  - Novel observations of genotypic and metabolic characteristics of three subspecies of Streptococcus gallolyticus.
AB  
TI  - Use of community genome arrays (CGAs) to assess the effects of Acacia angustissima on rumen ecology.
AB  - This research developed a community genome array (CGA) to assess the effects of Acacia angustissima on rumen microbiology. A. angustissima produces non-protein amino acids as well as tannins, which may be toxic to animals, and CGA was used to assess the effects of this plant on the ecology of the rumen. CGAs were developed using a 7.5 cmx2.5 cm nylon membrane format that included up to 96 bacterial genomes. It was possible to separately hybridize large numbers of membranes at once using this mini-membrane format. Pair-wise cross-hybridization experiments were conducted to determine the degree of cross-hybridization between strains; cross-hybridization occurred between strains of the same species, but little cross-reactivity was observed among different species. CGAs were successfully used to survey the microbial communities of animals consuming an A. angustissima containing diet but quantification was not precise. To properly quantify and validate the CGA, Fibrobacter and Ruminococcus populations were independently assessed using 16S rDNA probes to extracted rRNA. The CGA detected an increase in these populations as acacia increased in the diet, which was confirmed by rRNA analysis. There was a great deal of variation among strains of the same species in how they responded to A. angustissima. However, in general Selenomonas strains tended to be resistant to the tannins in the acacia while Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens was sensitive. On the other hand some species, like streptococci, varied. Streptococcus bovis-like strains were sensitive to an increase in acacia in the diet while Streptococcus gallolyticus-like strains were resistant. Strep. gallolyticus has independently been shown to be resistant to tannins. It is concluded that there is significant variation in tannin resistance between strains of the same species. This implies that there are specific molecular mechanisms at play that are independent of the phylogenetic position of the organism.
TI  - New group D streptococcal species.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The heterogeneity of group D streptococci led to the identification of various biotypes of Streptococcus equinus and Streptococcus bovis and to the description of new species. The objective of the present study was to improve the phenotypic delineation between species and to clarify their respective phylogenetic position. METHODS: Physiological and genomic analyses were carried out in 84 representative strains of the group D streptococci. Biotypes were determined with the API 20 strep and rapid ID 32 STREP systems of identification. Quantitative DNA-DNA hybridization under stringent conditions and values of the deltaT(m) allowed to delineate species and subspecies. The phylogenic position of the different genomic groups was determined by comparing the sequences of their 16S rDNA. RESULTS: Four DNA-clusters, including seven species or subspecies, were characterized. Differential associations of biochemical characters allowed their identification. S. equinus and the type strain of S. bovis belonged to a single species. S. gallolyticus, S. bovis biotype II.2, and S. macedonicus formed a single DNA-cluster including three different subspecies. These were designated as S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, and S. gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus. The two other DNA-clusters corresponded to the two subspecies of S. infantarius, and to S. alactolyticus. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: This study presented a new classification associated with an identification scheme of group D streptococci. The changes in this classification demonstrate the interest of a polyphagic approach of the bacterial identification.
TI  - Impact of susceptibility to antibiotics of streptococci & enterococci isolated from patients with infective endocarditis on antibiotic treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Streptococci and enterococci are the most frequent pathogens causing infective endocarditis. In order to update the recommendations for both curative and prophylaxis treatment, the susceptibility to antibiotics of the most prevalent species of Streptococcaceae isolated from the patients with infective endocarditis was determined. METHODS: Streptococcal and enterococcal isolates (n=133) isolated from confirmed cases of infective endocarditis during a one-year prospective survey conducted in 1999 in France were studied. The identification of 106 streptococci and 27 enterococci to the species level was carried out by conventional methods. Their susceptibility to ten antibiotics used in curative or prophylactic treatment was measured. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by agar dilution method. RESULTS: All the streptococcal and enterococcal isolates were susceptible to 4 mg/l or less of penicillin or amoxicillin. High levels of resistance to aminoglycosides were observed in two species, Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus and Enterococcus faecalis. All isolates were susceptible to glycopeptides. Resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, and pristinamycin was restricted to some species. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Curative treatments recommended for streptococcal or enterococcal endocarditis, including penicillin, amoxicillin or vancomycin in association with gentamicin were found to be appropriate for 98.5 per cent of cases. The emergence of erythromycin resistance in oral streptococci led to the use of pristinamycin in oral prophylactic treatment in patients allergic to beta-lactams.
TI  - Presence and mechanism of macrolide-lincosamide resistance in Enterococcus columbae strains belonging to the intestinal flora of pigeons.
AB  - Faecal samples from 50 pigeons all originating from different lofts were screened for the presence of macrolide and lincosamide (ML)-resistant isolates of Streptococcus gallolyticus and Enterococcus columbae by plating the samples onto selective media. Sixty-eight ML-resistant E. columbae strains were recovered from the faecal samples of 29 animals. Two of these samples also harboured ML-resistant S. gallolyticus strains. The erm(B) gene was detected in 58 E. columbae and in five S. gallolyticus isolates. Four of these E. columbae isolates also carried the mef(A) gene. Five E. columbae strains possessed the mef(A) gene in the absence of erm(B). On the basis of the sequence of the complete erm(B) gene, 10 E. columbae isolates clustered together in six groups. In two of these isolates, the erm(B) gene sequence was identical to that of S. gallolyticus strains, indicating that exchange of resistance genes might occur between pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacterial species belonging to the pigeon's intestinal flora.
TI  - The use of PCR for the identification and characterisation of bacteriocin genes from bacterial strains isolated from rumen or caecal contents of cattle and sheep.
AB  - PCR primers were designed to amplify the gene that encodes bovicin 255 from Streptococcus gallolyticus LRC0255 and the bacteriocin genes from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens strains AR10 and OR79A (bviD and bvi79A) in order to screen for their incidence in rumen and caecal B. fibrisolvens and Streptococcus bovis-like isolates from New Zealand and North American ruminants. None of the B. fibrisolvens-like strains (n=34) isolated from New Zealand or North America had the genes encoding for butyrivibriocins AR10 (bviD) or OR79 (bvi79A). However, seven S. bovis isolates from New Zealand ruminants and three from North American animals had the bovicin 255 gene. Sequence comparison of cloned bovicin 255 PCR products indicated a 92.9-95.7% similarity to that of the corresponding bovicin 255 gene sequence of S. gallolyticus. Four of the New Zealand bovicin 255 positive S. bovis isolates were from the caecal contents of the same sheep and had identical PFGE profiles. Two other S. bovis isolates sharing the same PFGE profile were isolated from a separate animal from the same flock. PFGE analysis of the North American strains indicated that all three were closely related as two of three had identical PFGE profiles with the remaining isolate differing only by a single band position. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the 10 isolates were at least 99.8% identical to S. bovis. All 10 S. bovis isolates having the gene for bovicin 255 produced bacteriocin activity that inhibited the growth of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius D1 in a deferred antagonism plating (DAP) assay. Certain S. bovis isolates obtained from ruminants have bacteriocin activity associated with a distinct bovicin 255 gene sequence but it appears that bacteriocin production by the rumen anaerobe B. fibrisolvens may be uncommon in strains isolated from cattle and sheep in New Zealand.
TI  - Development of a diagnostic PCR assay targeting the Mn-dependent superoxide dismutase gene (sodA) for identification of Streptococcus gallolyticus.
AB  - A PCR-based assay to identify Streptococcus gallolyticus has been developed. The  assay uses an oligonucleotide primer pair targeting a partial sequence of the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase gene (sodA). The assay distinguished members of the S. gallolyticus group from other, closely related taxa successfully by yielding a 408-bp specific amplicon.
TI  - Comparative molecular and microbiologic diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis.
AB  - Sequencing of 16S rDNA, and of sodAint and rpoBint in some cases, was applied to  DNA from heart valves of 46 patients (36 with definite and 10 with possible endocarditis). Sequence-based identifications were compared with those obtained with conventional methods. Among the 36 definite cases, 30 had positive blood cultures and 6 had negative cultures. Among the 30 positive cases, sequencing of 16S rDNA permitted identification of species (18), genus (8), or neither (4); sodAint and rpoBint sequencing was necessary for species identification in 8 cases. Species identifications were identical in only 61.5%, when conventional techniques and DNA sequencing were used. In five of the six blood culture-negative endocarditis cases, sequencing identified Bartonella quintana (3), B. henselae (1), and Streptococcus gallolyticus (1). Our results demonstrate a clear benefit of molecular identification, particularly in cases of blood culture-negative endocarditis and of possible endocarditis, to confirm or invalidate the diagnosis. Moreover, in 19.4% of the definite cases, the improvement in species identification by sequencing led to improved patient management.
TI  - Phenotypic and genetic characterization of resistance against macrolides and lincosamides in Streptococcus gallolyticus strains isolated from pigeons and humans.
AB  - The macrolide and lincosamide (ML) resistance phenotype of 65 pigeon and 30 human Streptococcus gallolyticus strains was determined by the disk diffusion method. Constitutive resistance against the tested antibiotics was seen in 13 human and 28 pigeon strains. Simultaneous screening for the presence of erm(B) and mef(A) genes using PCR revealed that the erm(B) gene was present in 40 out of these 41 phenotypically resistant S. gallolyticus strains while the mef(A) gene was detected in only one resistant and one susceptible human-derived strain. The erm(B) genes of 10 human and 10 pigeon S. gallolyticus strains were sequenced and compared. Four human and seven pigeon strains possessed exactly the same sequence for the erm(B) gene. The sequence of the erm(B) gene of the remaining strains differed in one to five nucleotides. These findings could indicate a possible exchange of resistance genes between human and pigeon strains.
TI  - Association of Streptococcus gallolyticus strains of high and low virulence with  the intestinal tract of pigeons.
AB  - We investigated the ability of a high virulence (STR 357) and a low virulence (STR 598) strain of Streptococcus gallolyticus to attach to the intestinal tract of pigeons. For that purpose, first of all, two groups of six pigeons were anesthetized and ligatures were placed at the beginning of duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon. The obtained intestinal loops of the birds of the first and second group were injected with S. gallolyticus strains STR 357 and STR 598, respectively. At 15, 30, and 60 min postinoculation, two pigeons of each group were euthanatized and the various intestinal loops were sampled for histologic, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic examination. Both the high and low virulence strains were able to adhere to the intestinal mucosa. Indeed, all samples dearly showed numerous coccal-shaped bacteria that stained positively with S. gallolyticus antiserum and were lining up against the intestinal epithelium. Likewise, on electron microscopic examination, cocci were seen in the mucus covering the intestinal epithelium. Second, the association of S. gallyticus strains of differing virulence with the intestinal tissue was determined quantitatively. Experiments were performed as described above. The number of S. gallolyticus bacteria that adhered to the intestinal epithelium was determined by plating out 10-fold serial dilutions of the segments. No significant differences in the number of adhered bacteria were found between the strains of high and low virulence.
TI  - Transferable vanB2 Tn5382-containing elements in fecal streptococcal strains from veal calves.
AB  - Three vancomycin-resistant veal calf fecal streptococci, identified as Streptococcus gallolyticus (n = 2) and Streptococcus lutetiensis, were shown to harbor vanB2 Tn5382-like elements earlier described in enterococci. One S. gallolyticus strain had a 1,495-bp IS256-related element inserted in vanS(B). The vanB2 Tn5382 element present in the plasmid-free S. lutetiensis strain was transferable to Enterococcus faecium BM4105-RF, Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2, and its recombination-deficient derivative, UV202. The transfer frequencies were comparable between recipient strains (from 1 x 10(-7) to 7 x 10(-6)). All transconjugants acquired a vanB-containing chromosomal insert of approximately 100 kb, apparently by site-specific integration. Secondary transconjugants were not observed in intraspecies retransfer experiments. These observations are consistent with a conjugative, selftransmissible, integrative element that might be involved in the interspecies spread of vanB2 resistance determinants. Two JH2-2-derived transconjugants had also gained additional copies of large vanB-containing chromosomal fragments, a process that involves unexplained mechanisms that seems to require functional host cell-dependent recombination mechanisms.
TI  - Reappraisal of the taxonomy of the Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex and related species: description of Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus subsp. nov., S. gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus subsp. nov. and S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus subsp. nov.
AB  - 'Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus' is a large bacterial complex including different species frequently isolated from infections of humans (Streptococcus gallolyticus, Streptococcus infantarius) or animals (S. bovis, S. equinus, Streptococcus alactolyticus). The separation of S. bovis into three different biotypes has been partially correlated with genetic differentiation. In addition, recent advances in bacterial phylogeny have led to the inclusion of Streptococcus macedonicus and Streptococcus waius in this complex. The aim of this study was to improve physiological differentiation between species related to the complex and to clarify their respective phylogenetic positions. In this study, physiological, genetic and phylogenetic analyses of a set of 88 streptococcal strains were performed. The diversity of strains of S. bovis biotype II was analysed, and it was confirmed that they belong to different species, either S. equinus or S. infantarius. It was demonstrated that S. gallolyticus, S. bovis biotype II.2, S. macedonicus and S. waius form a single DNA cluster separated into three different subspecies. They are delineated by different biochemical traits, limited DNA-DNA relatedness and noticeable divergence in 16S rDNA sequences. According to the current definition of species, the names S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus subsp. nov., S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus subsp. nov. and S. gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus subsp. nov. are proposed for these three subspecies.
TI  - Failure of a low virulence Streptococcus gallolyticus serotype 1 strain to immunize pigeons against streptococcosis.
AB  - Ten pigeons were inoculated intravenously with the low virulence Streptococcus gallolyticus strain PDH 827, which belongs to serotype 1, supernatant phenotype A(-)T2. The birds did not develop clinical disease but shed S. gallolyticus in their faeces, and antibodies against the bacterium were detected in post-inoculation plasma samples of all birds. Seven weeks later, these pigeons, as well as 14 control pigeons, were challenged intravenously with the highly virulent S. gallolyticus strain STR 357, which also belongs to serotype 1 but to the supernatant phenotype A(+)T1. Post-inoculation morbidity in the immunized group amounted to 90%, demonstrating that no protective immunity had been built up after the first infection. These findings indicate that serotype-specific antigens are not, or at least not solely, involved in induction of protection against S. gallolyticus septicaemia in pigeons.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among pigeon isolates of Streptococcus gallolyticus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium.
AB  - Thirty-three Streptococcus gallolyticus, 60 Escherichia coli and 18 Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium var. Copenhagen strains isolated from homing pigeons (Columba livia) were tested for susceptibility to the antimicrobials most commonly used to treat pigeons. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined using the agar dilution technique. Aminoglycosides (gentamicin and kanamycin), trimethoprim and flumequine were relatively inactive against the streptococci tested. Acquired tetracycline resistance amounted to 85%, and lincomycin and macrolide (erythromycin) resistance to 48 and 45%, respectively. Fluoroquinolone (enrofloxacin) resistance was found in four S. gallolyticus strains. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin. With the E. coli strains, resistance was found to all antibiotics tested. Over one-half of them were resistant to tetracycline and to broad-spectrum penicillins (ampicillin); however, none showed extended spectrum beta-lactamase activity, implying that the cephalosporins (ceftiofur) remained active. Resistance to trimethoprim, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolone ranked next. In contrast to the S. gallolyticus and E. coli strains, the S. enterica strains were susceptible to all the antimicrobials tested.
TI  - Taxonomic dissection of the Streptococcus bovis group by analysis of manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase gene (sodA) sequences: reclassification of 'Streptococcus infantarius subsp. coli' as Streptococcus lutetiensis sp. nov. and of Streptococcus bovis biotype 11.2 as Streptococcus pasteurianus sp. nov.
AB  - The taxonomic dissection of the Streptococcus bovis-Streptococcus equinus group was carried out upon obtaining sequences for the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase gene (sodA) of the type strains of S. bovis, Streptococcus caprinus, S. equinus, Streptococcus gallolyticus, Streptococcus infantarius, Streptococcus macedonicus and Streptococcus waius. The sodA sequences of 29 streptococcal strains of animal and human origin that were related to S. bovis were also sequenced. A phylogenetic analysis of the sodA sequences revealed that the S. bovis-S. equinus group comprises five different clusters that correspond to five distinct species. The type strains of S. bovis and S. equinus were associated in the same cluster, corresponding to the species S. equinus. The type strains of S. caprinus, S. gallolyticus, S. macedonicus and S. waius were associated in the same cluster, which defined a single species containing S. gallolyticus and its junior synonym S. caprinus, and S. macedonicus and its junior synonym S. waius. The two subspecies thought to constitute the species S. infantarius, namely S. infantarius subsp. infantarius and 'S. infantarius subsp. coli', were located in two distinct clusters. One of these clusters defined the species S. infantarius and included the type strain of S. infantarius subsp. infantarius. The other cluster defined 'S. infantarius subsp. coli', leading to the proposal of its reclassification as the novel species Streptococcus lutetiensis (NEM 782T = CIP 106849T). The remaining cluster comprised all of the strains previously identified as belonging to S. bovis biotype 11.2, leading to the proposal to reassign these strains to the novel species Streptococcus pasteurianus (NEM 1202T = CIP 107122T). The results of the phylogenetic analysis were confirmed by DNA-DNA hybridization experiments, thus demonstrating that sequence databases of defined DNA targets, such as sodA, may constitute a valuable alternative approach for modern bacterial systematics.
TI  - Isolation from a shea cake digester of a tannin-degrading Streptococcus gallolyticus strain that decarboxylates protocatechuic and hydroxycinnamic acids, and emendation of the species.
AB  - A facultatively anaerobic, mesophilic, non-motile, non-sporulating bacterium, designated strain B7, was isolated from an anaerobic digester fed with shea cake rich in tannins and aromatic compounds, after enrichment on tannic acid. The coccoid cells (less than 2 microm in diameter) occurred in pairs or short chains and stained gram-positive. Strain B7 fermented a wide range of carbohydrates (cellobiose, fructose, galactose, glucose, lactose, maltose, mannitol, melibiose, raffinose and trehalose), grew optimally at pH 7.0 and had a G+C content of 40.4+/-0.3 mol%. Strain B7 was closely related to Streptococcus gallolyticus ACM 3611T, a member of the Streptococcus bovis rRNA cluster, with a sequence similarity of 98% and a DNA hybridization value of 86 mol%. Isolate B7 hydrolysed tannic acid and decarboxylated gallic acid to pyrogallol, traits also observed in S. gallolyticus ACM 3611T. In addition, both strains decarboxylated protocatechuic acid to catechol, p-coumaric acid to 4-vinylphenol, caffeic acid to 4-vinylcatechol and ferulic acid to 4-vinylguaiacol. An unsubstituted para-hydroxyl group on the benzene ring was required for decarboxylation. Glucose addition markedly increased the conversion rate. As these traits were not described previously, emendation of the description of the species Streptococcus gallolyticus is proposed.
TI  - The gram-positive tonsillar and nasal flora of piglets before and after weaning.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate gram-positive nasal and tonsillar microbial flora of piglets before and after weaning. METHODS AND RESULTS: The nasal and tonsillar gram-positive bacterial flora of 20 non-weaned piglets (2 weeks of age) and 20 weaned piglets (6 weeks of age), obtained from four different piggeries, was quantified by culture and identified by tDNA-PCR. The most widely occurring species from nasal conchae before as well as after weaning in the different piglets investigated were Streptococcus suis and Rothia nasimurium. After weaning a wide variety of Lactobacillus species appeared but in low numbers. In the tonsils, Strep. suis, Strep. dysgalactiae, S. hyicus, S. aureus, Arcanobacterium pyogenes and Actinomyces hyovaginalis were the species isolated from the largest number of pigs before and after weaning. S. aureus and most lactobacilli became more prevalent after weaning. Bacteria not known to be associated with pigs found in the present study included R. nasimurium, Strep. gallolyticus, Pediococcus pentosaceus and some Lactobacillus species. CONCLUSIONS: Over 30 different gram-positive bacterial species may occur in nasal conchae and tonsils of unweaned piglets at 2 weeks of age and of 6-week-old weaned piglets. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study demonstrated that weaning is associated with changes in prevalence of only a small minority of the highly diversified bacterial flora of the nares and tonsils of pigs.
TI  - Composition of enterococcal and streptococcal flora from pigeon intestines.
AB  - AIMS: To identify the streptococcal and enterococcal components of the microflora from pigeon intestines to species level by tDNA-intergenic polymerase chain reaction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Gram-positive coccal strains were isolated from the intestines or faeces of 50 different pigeons, all from different lofts, on Columbia CNA blood agar. Sodium azide-sensitive enterococci were found to constitute the major coccal members of the intestinal flora of pigeons. Forty-two of 69 isolates were identified as Enterococcus columbae (84% of animals tested positive), while E. cecorum was encountered in 28% of all animals (14 isolates). Minor species (less than 10% of pigeons positive) were E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum, E. casseliflavus, Streptococcus alactolyticus and Strep. gallolyticus. Contrary to the species description of E. columbae and E. cecorum, some of the strains were found to be motile. Certain other minor differences with the species description of E. columbae are also indicated. CONCLUSIONS: Enterococcus columbae is the major Gram-positive facultatively anaerobic component of the pigeon intestinal flora. Certain phenotypic characteristics differ from the original species description. The potentially pathogenic Strep. gallolyticus is a minor component of the microflora. Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis are rare in pigeons. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The enterococcal and streptococcal flora of pigeons is composed of mainly host-specific bacteria. These are not likely to act as zoonotic pathogens nor as carriers of antibiotic resistance determinants possibly spreading to humans.
TI  - Lactobacillus agilis is an important component of the pigeon crop flora.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the presence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB: enterococci, streptococci and lactobacilli) in the pigeon crop. METHODS AND RESULTS: The crops of 10 pigeons were sampled and inoculated on agar plates for isolation of streptococci, enterococci and lactobacilli. The isolates were identified using tDNA-PCR. Lactobacillus agilis, a species described in 1981 from municipal sewage, was the dominant component in eight of these pigeon crop sacs. A Lactobacillus species related to L. fermentum and L. mucosae but probably not belonging to one of these species was isolated from five birds. Three pigeons carried Enterococcus cecorum. Minor species found were E. columbae, E. faecalis, E. hirae, L. johnsonii, L. salivarius, and Streptococcus gallolyticus. A description is given of the phenotypic characteristics of the L. agilis pigeon strains. CONCLUSIONS, SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: L. agilis is found to be the main component of the LAB flora in the pigeon crop.
TI  - Effect of hydrolysable and condensed tannins on growth, morphology and metabolism of Streptococcus gallolyticus (S. caprinus) and Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus (S. caprinus) was resistant in vitro to at least 7% (w/v) tannic acid and 4% (w/v) acacia condensed tannin, levels 10-fold greater than those tolerated by S. bovis. Growth of S. gallolyticus in liquid medium was characterized by a lag period which increased, and a growth rate which decreased, with increasing tannin concentration. S. gallolyticus was also more tolerant to the presence of simple phenolic acid monomers than was S. bovis, but the lag period was still concentration dependent. Gallate decarboxylase activity in S. gallolyticus was elevated in the presence of tannic acid or gallic acid but not with other phenolic acids. Scanning electron microscopic analysis showed that both the size and shape of S. gallolyticus and S. bovis changed in response to tannin but only S. gallolyticus was surrounded by an extracellular polysaccharide matrix which accumulated in a tannin-concentration-dependent fashion. Washing of the cells to remove extracellular polysaccharide increased the lag period of S. gallolyticus in the presence of 1% (w/v) tannic acid from 4 h to 6 h. In contrast, increasing extracellular polysaccharide synthesis in S. bovis did not increase its tolerance to tannic acid. These data demonstrate that S. gallolyticus has developed a number of mechanisms to reduce the potential effect of tannins on cell growth, and that these mechanisms provide the organism with a selective advantage over S. bovis when grown in the presence of tannins.
TI  - 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis distinguishes biotypes of Streptococcus bovis: Streptococcus bovis Biotype II/2 is a separate genospecies and the predominant clinical isolate in adult males.
AB  - We characterized 22 human clinical strains of Streptococcus bovis by genotypic (16S rRNA gene sequence analysis [MicroSeq]; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) and phenotypic (API 20 Strep and Rapid ID32 Strep systems (bioMerieux Vitek, Hazelton, Mo.) methods. The strains, isolated from blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and urine, formed two distinct 16S ribosomal DNA sequence clusters. Three strains which were associated with endocarditis urinary tract infection (UTI), and sepsis clustered with the S. bovis type strain ATCC 33317 (cluster 1); other closely related type strains were S. equinus and S. infantarius. Nineteen strains clustered at a distance of about 2.5% dissimilarity to the S. bovis type strain (cluster 2) and were associated with central nervous system (CNS) disease in addition to endocarditis, UTI, and sepsis. All strains were distinct from S. gallolyticus. Within cluster 2, a single strain grouped with ATCC strain 43143 (cluster 2a) and may be phenotypically distinct. All the other strains formed a second subgroup (cluster 2b) that was biochemically similar to S. bovis biotype II/2 (mannitol negative and beta galactosidase, alpha galactosidase, beta glucuronidase, and trehalose positive). The API 20 Strep system identified isolates of cluster 2b as S. bovis biotype II/2, those of cluster 1 as S. bovis biotype II/1, and that of cluster 2a as S. bovis biotype I. There was an excellent correlation of biotype and genotype: S. bovis biotype II/2 isolates form a separate genospecies distinct from the S. bovis, S. gallolyticus, and S. infantarius type strains and are the most common isolates in adult males.
TI  - [Streptococcus gallolyticus infections in racing pigeons, a literature review].
AB  - S. gallolyticus, formerly known as S. bovis is known since 1988 as a facultative  pathogen of racing pigeons. Important clinical signs include acute mortality, inability to fly, lameness, weight loss and slimy green diarrhea. A pathognomonic sign at post mortem examination is the presence of well circumscribed areas of necrosis in the pectoral muscle. Furthermore tenosynovitis of the supracoracoid muscle and arthritis of the knee, shoulder and hock can be observed. In one study S. gallolyticus septicaemia was diagnosed in 10% of necropsied pigeons. Since S. gallolyticus was also isolated from nearly 40% of clinical healthy pigeons it is regarded as a facultative pathogen. Various biotypes, serotypes and culture supernatant phenotypes can be distinguished. Supernatant phenotypes are identified on the basis of the presence of either a T1, T2 or T3 protein triplet and the presence or absence of an extracellular A protein. S. gallolyticus strains with A protein are highly virulent, while strains with only T3 or T2 protein are of moderately or low virulence respectively. Fimbriae are only seen in highly virulent and some of the moderately virulent strains. Possible virulence factors include survival in macrophages, adhesion to cells and toxin production. Infection with serotype 1 and 2 induces some degree of protection against re-infection with serotype 1, which offers perspectives for the development of a vaccine. Experimentally ampicillin, doxycycline and erythromycin have shown therapeutic effects. For the treatment of clinical cases the use of ampicillin is advocated, together with hygienic measures, such as the use of grid floors and avoiding overcrowding.
TI  - Identification of bacteriocin-like inhibitors from rumen Streptococcus spp. and isolation and characterization of bovicin 255.
AB  - Streptococci obtained from rumen sources were tested for the production of antibacterial compounds using a deferred-antagonism plating assay. Of 35 isolates tested, 7 were identified that inhibited the growth of other streptococci. None of the inhibitory activity was due to bacteriophage. Three isolates, LRC0253, LRC0255, and LRC0476, were selected for further characterization. Analysis of 16S ribosomal DNA indicated that LRC0476 was a strain of Streptococcus bovis, while isolates LRC0253 and LRC0255 are likely strains of Streptococcus gallolyticus. The antibacterial compounds produced by these bacteria were protease sensitive, remained active in a pH range from 1 to 12, and did not lose activity after heating at 100 degrees C for 15 min. The inhibitory peptide from strain LRC0255 was purified using pH-dependent adsorption and desorption to bacterial cells, followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation and reversed-phase chromatography and gel filtration. The peptide was 6 kDa, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. An oligonucleotide probe based on the N-terminal sequence of the purified peptide was used to identify the gene encoding the inhibitory peptide. The antibacterial peptide has characteristics that are very similar to those described for class II bacteriocins of gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Adhesion of Streptococcus gallolyticus strains to extracellular matrix proteins.
AB  - Fourteen pigeon Streptococcus gallolyticus strains of differing virulence, were tested for their ability to adhere to immobilised fibronectin, collagen types I, III and IV. Eight, 2 and 13 strains were able to bind fibronectin, collagen types III and IV, respectively. None of the strains adhered to collagen type I. Heat treatment, proteolytic digestion or periodate treatment reduced the binding of S. gallolyticus to fibronectin and collagen type IV, suggesting that surface receptors contain proteins and carbohydrates. Although binding to these extracellular matrix proteins can play a role in the pathogenesis of streptococcosis in pigeons, binding properties could not be related to virulence, indicating that other factors determine differences in virulence among pigeon S. gallolyticus strains. Adhesion to collagen type IV may account in part for the distribution pattern of the lesions observed in naturally and experimentally infected pigeons.
TI  - Identification of virulence associated markers in the cell wall of pigeon Streptococcus gallolyticus strains.
AB  - The cell wall protein profiles of 56 isolates of Streptococcus gallolyticus of differing virulence for pigeons were compared by SDS-PAGE. Additionally, Western blot analysis was performed on the cell wall proteins of 14 strains using sera of pigeons, experimentally infected with A(+)T1 or A(-)T2 strains of S. gallolyticus. The profile of silver stained gels exhibited a complex array of 20-50 bands ranging from less than 6.5-210kDa. A band with molecular mass of 114kDa was only observed in isolates that belonged to the highly virulent A(+)T1, A(+)T2, A(+)T3 and A(-)T1 culture supernatant groups. A band with a slightly higher molecular mass (115kDa) as well as a 207kDa band were only detected in isolates that belonged to the moderately A(-)T3 or low A(-)T2 virulent culture supernatant groups. The 114 and 115kDa band were recognised by all homologous and heterologous pigeon sera used whereas the 207kDa band was only recognised by sera of pigeons infected with a A(-)T2 strain. These findings may indicate that the 114, 115 and 207kDa bands are useful as additional virulence associated markers for pigeon S. gallolyticus strains.
TI  - Genomic fingerprinting of pigeon Streptococcus gallolyticus strains of different  virulence by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis.
AB  - Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was performed on 95 pigeon S.  gallolyticus strains of different virulence and belonging to different biotypes and different culture supernatant phenotypes as determined by SDS-PAGE. Four distinct RAPD patterns, designated A, B, C and D, were distinguished using primer OPM6 (5'CTGGGCAACT). All 76 strains generating RAPD pattern A or B were designated highly virulent on the basis of their SDS-PAGE pattern. Five of seven strains generating RAPD pattern C and 11 of 12 strains generating RAPD pattern D belonged to the moderately virulent and low virulent culture supernatant phenotype groups, respectively. Only one RAPD group C strain belonged to a highly virulent culture supernatant phenotype group. There was a correlation between biotype and RAPD patterns. These findings indicate that there is a high correlation between RAPD pattern and virulence for pigeons. Therefore, RAPD typing seems a rapid, reliable method to distinguish pigeon S. gallolyticus strains of high, moderate and low virulence.
TI  - Identification of aesculin-hydrolyzing streptococci, lactococci, aerococci and enterococci from subclinical intramammary infections in dairy cows.
AB  - Aesculin-hydrolyzing, catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci isolated from subclinical intramammary infections in dairy cows were identified to species level using growth characteristics and biochemical activity. The results indicated that the aesculin-hydrolyzing cocci associated with this type of infection are a very heterogenic group. S. uberis strains, including inulin- or beta-glucuronidase-negative isolates, accounted for only about one-third of the collection, and Enterococcus faecalis strains for one-fifth. Other species of some importance included (in descending order of isolation frequency) Aerococcus viridans, Streptococcus pluranimalium, Lactococcus garvieae, Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus gallolyticus.
TI  - Ultrastructure of surface components of Streptococcus gallolytics (S. bovis) strains of differing virulence isolated from pigeons.
AB  - Virulence of Streptococcus gallolyticus (S. bovis) strains isolated from pigeons  is associated with the presence of the extracellular proteins A, T1, T2 and T3. Based on the presence or absence of these proteins, six supernatant-phenotypes are distinguished. Experimental infection studies have indicated that strains belonging to the A-T1, A+T1, A+T2 and A+T3 groups are highly virulent for pigeons, strains belonging to the A-T3 groups are moderately virulent and A-T2 strains are of low virulence. In this study the surface structure of 15 pigeon S. gallolyticus strains representing high, moderate and low virulence supernatant-phenotypes was examined by electron microscopy. The presence of capsular material was determined by transmission electron microscopy after polycationic ferritin labelling and immunostabilization. Capsules from cells labelled with polycationic ferritin were usually thicker than those from cells exposed to antiserum. The capsule of the virulent strains had a regular, continuous appearance whilst irregularity of the capsule was a characteristic of the low virulence A-T2 strains. Negative staining revealed the presence of fimbriae in all strains belonging to the high virulence A-T1, A+T1, A+T2 and A+T3 supernatant groups and in one strain of the moderately virulent A-T3 group. The fimbriae were thin, flexible structures with a diameter of approximately 3-4 nm and a length of up to 700 nm. Fimbriae as described above were absent in two other A-T3 strains examined and in the low virulence A-T2 strains. Results from this study indicate that morphological differences in surface structure exist among virulent and low virulence pigeon S. gallolyticus strains, and that the capsule and/or fimbriae are possibly involved in virulence.
TI  - Differentiation between Streptococcus gallolyticus strains of human clinical and  veterinary origins and Streptococcus bovis strains from the intestinal tracts of ruminants.
AB  - Strains formerly identified as Streptococcus bovis were allotted to two groups by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of whole-cell proteins. Strains from humans with infections, mostly patients with endocarditis, and strains from pigeons with septicemia clustered with the recently described species Streptococcus gallolyticus. The original S. bovis type strain and strains exclusively from ruminants formed the second cluster. The findings indicate that S. gallolyticus is more likely to be involved in human and animal infections than S. bovis. Growth characteristics and several biochemical reactions were found to be useful in the differentiation of S. gallolyticus from S. bovis.
TI  - Phenotypic and phylogenetic characterization of ruminal tannin-tolerant bacteria.
AB  - The 16S rRNA sequences and selected phenotypic characteristics were determined for six recently isolated bacteria that can tolerate high levels of hydrolyzable and condensed tannins. Bacteria were isolated from the ruminal contents of animals in different geographic locations, including Sardinian sheep (Ovis aries), Honduran and Colombian goats (Capra hircus), white-tail deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from upstate New York, and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) from Oregon. Nearly complete sequences of the small-subunit rRNA genes, which were obtained by PCR amplification, cloning, and sequencing, were used for phylogenetic characterization. Comparisons of the 16S rRNA of the six isolates showed that four of the isolates were members of the genus Streptococcus and were most closely related to ruminal strains of Streptococcus bovis and the recently described organism Streptococcus gallolyticus. One of the other isolates, a gram-positive rod, clustered with the clostridia in the low-G+C-content group of gram-positive bacteria. The sixth isolate, a gram-negative rod, was a member of the family Enterobacteriaceae in the gamma subdivision of the class Proteobacteria. None of the 16S rRNA sequences of the tannin-tolerant bacteria examined was identical to the sequence of any previously described microorganism or to the sequence of any of the other organisms examined in this study. Three phylogenetically distinct groups of ruminal bacteria were isolated from four species of ruminants in Europe, North America, and South America. The presence of tannin-tolerant bacteria is not restricted by climate, geography, or host animal, although attempts to isolate tannin-tolerant bacteria from cows on low-tannin diets failed.
TI  - Isolation of glycopeptide resistant Streptococcus gallolyticus strains with vanA, vanB, and both vanA and vanB genotypes from faecal samples of veal calves in The Netherlands.
AB  
TI  - The tannin-degrading species Streptococcus gallolyticus and Streptococcus caprinus are subjective synonyms.
AB  - The tannin-degrading species Streptococcus gallolyticus and Streptococcus caprinus have been shown to be subjective synonyms on the basis of their levels of 16S rRNA sequence similarity (98.3%) and DNA-DNA homology (> 70%) and the phenotypes of their type strains. S. gallolyticus has nomenclatural priority according to Rule 24b(2) of the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria.
