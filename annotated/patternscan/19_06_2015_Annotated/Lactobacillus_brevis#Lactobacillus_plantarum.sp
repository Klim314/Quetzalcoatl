TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == gene expression of enzymes involved in utilization of xylooligosaccharides by strains.
AB  == prebiotics are defined as food components that confer health benefits on the host through modulation of the microbiota. xylooligosaccharides (xos) are non-digestible oligosaccharides that have recently received increasing attention  as potential prebiotic candidates. xos are sugar oligomers composed of 1,4-linked xylopyranosyl backbone and are obtained by either chemical or, more commonly, enzymatic hydrolysis of xylan polysaccharides, extracted from the plant cell wall. the bifidogenic effect of xos was demonstrated by both in vitro studies and small-scale in vivo human studies. some intestinal bacterial strains are able to  grow on xos, yet numerous studies have demonstrated that the ability to utilize these oligosaccharides varies considerably among these bacteria. the aim of this  study is to investigate the ability of several strains lactobacillus to use xos.  fifteen lactobacillus strains, allifiated to l. plantarum, l. brevis and l. sakei, were studied. screening procedure was performed for the ability of the strains to utilize xos as an alternative carbon source. only some of them utilize xos. the growth kinetics show the presence of two lag phases, indicating that these bacteria utilize probably some monosaccharides present in the used xos. xos were fermented with high specificity by bifidobacteria strains, but lactobacilli  did not metabolize xos efficiently.

TI  == production of wheat bread without preservatives using sourdough starters.
AB  == in order for the beneficial effects of sourdough application in breadmaking to take place a proper selection of lactic acid bacteria species and strains, an appropriate technology and effective control of the purity and activity of the selected cultures. four symbiotic starters for sourdough for the production of bread were developed and probated in a production laboratory using the selected strains lactobacillus brevis lbrz7, l. buchneri lbrz6, l. plantarum x2, l. paracasei rn5, l. sanfranciscensis r and l. fermentum lbrh10 and the probiotic strain propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii nbimcc 327. the starter sourdoughs that include propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii nbimcc 327 had greater antimicrobial activity against saprophytic microorganisms: bacillus subtilis, b. mesentericus, aspergillus niger, penicillium sp. and rhizopus sp., but none of them inhibited the growth of bakery yeasts saccharomyces cerevisiae. it was established that in order to prevent bacterial spoilage 10% of the selected starter sourdoughs had to be added in the breadmaking process, while for prevention of mold spoilage the necessary amount of starter sourdough had to be between 15% and 20%.the application of the developed starters for the production of wheat bread guarantees longer shelf life and no adverse alterations in the features of the final bread.

TI  == lactic acid microflora of the gut of snail .
AB  == the intestinal lactic acid microflora of the edible snail cornu aspersum was studied by culture-based methods and was phenotypically and molecularly characterized. the antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolates  was investigated. snails in different stages of development were collected from farms located in several regions of bulgaria. one hundred twenty-two isolates, belonging to the group of lab, were characterized morphologically and were divided into four groups. representative isolates from each morphological type were subjected to phenotypic characterization and molecular identification. the snail gut lactic acid microflora was composed by enterococcus (17 isolates), lactococcus (12 isolates), leuconostoc (7 isolates), lactobacillus (18 isolates)  and weissella (1 isolate). the species affiliation of lactococcus lactis (12), leuconostoc mesenteroides (4) and lactobacillus plantarum (2) was confirmed by species-specific primers. the lactobacillus isolates were identified by sequence  analysis of 16s rdna as lactobacillus brevis (12), l. plantarum (2), lactobacillus graminis (1) and lactobacillus curvatus (3). the species l. brevis, l. graminis and l. curvatus were found in snails in a phase of hibernation, whereas l. plantarum was identified both in active and hibernation phases. antibacterial activity (bacteriocine-like) was shown only by one strain of l. mesentereoides p4/8 against propionibacterium acnes. the present study showed that the lab are a component of the microbial communities in the snail digestive  system. this is the first report on lactobacillus strains detected in the gut of  c. aspersum.

TI  == examination of the technological properties of newly isolated strains of the genus and possibilities for their application in the composition of starters.
AB  == the ability of four lactobacillus strains - lactobacillus brevis lbrz7 (isolated  from fermented cabbage), lactobacillus plantarum lbrz12 (isolated from fermented  cabbage), lactobacillus fermentum lbrh9 (of human origin) and lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus lbrc11 (isolated from home-made cheese) - to grow in flour/water environment and to accumulate high concentrations of viable cells was examined. two starters for sourdough were created for lab-scale production of wheat bread:  a two-strain starter and a four-strain starter. wheat bread with improved properties - greater loaf volume, enhanced flavour and softer and brighter crumb  - was obtained from the 7% four-strain starter sourdough. the addition of sourdough in the production of wheat bread affected positively the technological  and organoleptic characteristics of the final bread by inhibiting the growth of wild yeasts and mold and bacillus spores without the addition of preservatives. the inclusion of 15% of the four-strain starter sourdough in the bread-making process led to enhanced safety and longer shelf life of the baked bread.

TI  == three-phase succession of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria to reach a stable ecosystem within seven days of natural bamboo shoot fermentation as revealed by different molecular approaches.
AB  == microbial community structure and population dynamics during spontaneous bamboo shoot fermentation for production of 'soidon' (indigenous fermented food) in north east india were studied using cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent molecular approaches. cultivation-dependent analyzes (pcr amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis and rrna gene sequencing) and cultivation-independent analyzes (pcr-dgge, qpcr and illumina amplicon sequencing) were conducted on the time series samples collected from three independent indigenous soidon fermentation batches. the current findings revealed three-phase succession of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria to attain a stable ecosystem within 7 days natural fermentation of bamboo shoots. weissella spp. (weissella cibaria, uncultured weissella ghanensis) and lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris predominated the early phase (1 - 2 days) which was joined by leuconostoc citreum during the mid phase (3 days), while lactobacillus brevis and lactobacillus plantarum emerged and became dominant in the late phase (5 - 7 days) with concurrent disappearance of w. cibaria and l. lactis subsp. cremoris.  lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and uncultured lactobacillus acetotolerans were  predominantly present throughout the fermentation with no visible dynamics. the above identified dominant bacterial species along with their dynamics can be effectively utilized for designing a starter culture for industrialization of soidon production. our results showed that a more realistic view on the microbial ecology of soidon fermentation could be obtained by cultivation-dependent studies complemented with cultivation-independent molecular approaches. moreover, the critical issues to be considered for reducing methodological biases while studying the microbial ecology of traditional food fermentation were also highlighted with this soidon fermentation model. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == construction of a shuttle vector based on the small cryptic plasmid pjy33 from weissella cibaria 33.
AB  == a cryptic plasmid, pjy33, from weissella cibaria 33 was characterized. pjy33 was  2365 bp in size with a gc content of 41.27% and contained two putative open reading frames (orfs). orf1 encoded a putative hypothetical protein of 134 amino  acids. orf2 was 849 bp in size, and its putative translation product exhibited 87% identity with a replication initiation factor from a plasmid from w. cibaria  klc140. a weissella-escherichia coli shuttle vector, pjy33e (6.5 kb, em(r)), was  constructed by ligation of pjy33 with pbluescript ii sk(-) and an erythromycin resistance gene (em(r)). pjy33e replicated in lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus plantarum, and weissella confusa. a  single-stranded dna intermediate was detected from lb. brevis 2.14 harbouring pjy33e, providing evidence for rolling-circle replication of pjy33. most lb. brevis 2.14 cells (85.9%) retained pjy33e after one week of daily culturing in mrs broth without em. an aga gene encoding alpha-galactosidase (alpha-gal) from leuconostoc mesenteroides was successfully expressed in lb. brevis 2.14 using pjy33e, and the highest level of alpha-gal activity (36.13 u/mg protein) was observed when cells were grown on melibiose.

TI  == effect of probiotics on enrofloxacin disposition in gastrointestinal tract of poultry.
AB  == probiotics are routinely used in poultry husbandry due to health benefit on the host. the gut microbiota is now recognized to exert an important influence on the absorption and pharmacokinetics of many compounds. therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the effect of candidate probiotics belonging to the species  lactobacillus brevis, l. plantarum and l. bulgaricus on pharmacokinetics of enrofloxacin in healthy chickens. the probiotic administration leads to higher degree of metabolism of enrofloxacin to ciprofloxacin in liver. the antibacterial drug was significantly faster absorbed (kab of 0.61 +/- 0.54 h-1 and tmax 7.81 +/- 3.52 h) at lower concentrations (cmax of 1.34 +/- 0.18 mug.g-1 ) during the first 24 h of treatment in the probiotic's group. the values of kab , tmax , and  cmax for the group, treated solely with enrofloxacin, were 0.10 +/- 0.065 h-1 , 15.42 +/- 3.07 h, and 1.61 +/- 0.24 mug.g-1 , respectively. a significantly higher concentration of enrofloxacin and its metabolite ciprofloxacin in the liver was observed in the group with the probiotic treatment. disposition of both drugs was not significantly changed in the duodenum and in the jejunum. the selected dose is appropriate for treatment of infections caused by pathogens with mic < 0.06 mug.ml-1 irrespective of antibiotic administration alone or in combination with probiotics.

TI  == comparison of homo- and heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria for implementation of fermented wheat bran in bread.
AB  == despite its potential health benefits, the integration of wheat bran into the food sector is difficult due to several adverse technological and sensory properties such as bitterness and grittiness. sourdough fermentation is a promising strategy to improve the sensory quality of bran without inducing severe changes to the bran matrix. therefore, identification of species/strains with potential for industrial sourdough fermentations is important. we compared the effects of different representatives of species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on  wheat bran. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and fructobacillus fructosus produced highly individual fermentation patterns as judged from carbohydrate consumption and organic acid production. interestingly, fructose was released during all bran fermentations and possibly influenced the fermentation profiles of obligately heterofermentative species to varying degrees. except for the reduction of ferulic acid by l. plantarum and l. pentosus, analyses of phenolic compounds and  alkylresorcinols suggested that only minor changes thereof were induced by the lab metabolism. sensory analysis of breads baked with fermented bran did not reveal significant differences regarding perceived bitterness and aftertaste. we  conclude that in addition to more traditionally used sourdough species such as l. sanfranciscensis and l. brevis, also facultatively heterofermentative species such as l. plantarum and l. pentosus possess potential for industrial wheat bran  fermentations and should be considered in further investigations.

TI  == microbiological and chemical characteristics of taruba, an indigenous beverage produced from solid cassava fermentation.
AB  == the aim of this work was to identify and characterize the microbiota present during fermentation and in the final beverage, taruba, by culture-dependent and -independent methods. in addition, target chemical compounds (carbohydrates, organic acids, and ethanol) were evaluated. lactic acid bacteria (lab) and mesophilic bacteria were the predominant microorganisms. among them, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus subtilis were frequently isolated and detected by dgge analysis. torulaspora delbrueckii was the dominant yeast species. yeast isolates pichia exigua, candida rugosa, t. delbrueckii, candida tropicalis, pichia kudriavzevii,  wickerhamomyces anomalus, and candida ethanolica and bacteria isolates lb. plantarum, bacillus subtilis, bacillus amyloliquefaciens, bacillus licheniformis, bacillus sp., and chitinophaga terrae showed amylolytic activity. only isolates of p. exigua and t. delbrueckii and all species of the genus bacillus identified  in this work exhibited proteolytic activity. all microbial isolates grew at 38 degrees c, and only the isolates belonging to hanseniaspora uvarum species did not grow at 42 degrees c. these characteristics are important for further development of starter cultures; isolates of t. delbrueckii, p. exigua, and bacillus species identified in this work displayed all of these properties and are potential strains for use as starter culture in cassava fermented food.

TI  == evaluation of mono or mixed cultures of lactic acid bacteria in type ii sourdough system.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the use of mono and mixed lactic acid bacteria (lab) cultures to determine suitable lab combinations for a type ii sourdough system. in this context, previously isolated sourdough lab strains with antimicrobial activity, which included lactobacillus plantarum pfc22, lactobacillus brevis pfc31, pediococcus acidilactici pfc38, and lactobacillus sanfranciscensis pfc80, were used as mono or mixed culture combinations in a fermentation system to produce type ii sourdough, and subsequently in bread dough production. compared to the monoculture fermentation of dough, the use of mixed cultures shortened the adaptation period by half. in addition, the use of mixed cultures ensured higher microbial viability, and enhanced the fruity flavor during bread dough production. it was determined that the combination of l. plantarum pfc22 + p. acidilactici pfc38 + l. sanfranciscensis pfc80 is a promising culture mixture that can be used in the production of type ii sourdough systems, and which may also contribute to an increase in metabolic activity during bread production process.

TI  == isolation of lactic acid bacteria from pao cai, a chinese traditional fermented vegetable, with inhibitory activity against salmonella associated with fresh-cut  apple, using a modelling study.
AB  == aims: to isolate lactic acid bacteria (lab) from pao cai, a chinese traditional fermented vegetable, with outstanding inhibitory activity against salmonella inoculated on fresh-cut apple, using a modelling method. methods and results: four kinds of pao cai were selected. a total of 122 isolates exhibited typical lab characteristics: gram-positive and catalase negative, among which 104 (85.24%) colonies showed antibacterial activity against salmonella by the well diffusion assay. four colonies showing maximum antibacterial radius against salmonella were selected to co-inoculate with salmonella on fresh-cut apple and stored at 10 degrees c, further identified as three strains of lactobacillus plantarum and one strain of lactobacillus brevis by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. the modified gompertz model was employed to analyse the growth of the micro-organisms on apple wedges. two of the four selected strains showed antagonistic activity against salmonella on fresh-cut apple, one of which, rd1, exhibited best inhibitory activity (salmonella were greatly inhibited when co-inoculated with rd1 at 10 degrees c at 168 h). no deterioration in odour or appearance of the apple piece was observed by the triangle test when fresh-cut apple was inoculated with rd1. conclusions: the mathematical modelling method is  essential to select lab with outstanding inhibitory activity against salmonella associated with fresh-cut apple. lab rd1 holds promise for the preservation of fresh-cut apple. significance and impact of the study: this study provided a new  method on fresh-cut product preservation. besides, to make the lab isolating procedure a more correct one, this study first added the mathematical modelling method to the isolating procedure.

TI  == physiological functions at single-cell level of lactobacillus spp. isolated from  traditionally fermented cabbage in response to different ph conditions.
AB  == changes in ph are significant environmental stresses that may be encountered by lactobacilli during fermentation processes or passage through the gastrointestinal tract. here, we report the cell response of lactobacillus spp. isolated from traditionally fermented cabbage subjected to acid/alkaline treatments at ph 2.5, 7.4 and 8.1, which represented ph conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. among six isolates, four species of lactobacillus plantarum and two of lactobacillus brevis were identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). the fluorescence-based strategy of combining carboxyfluorescein diacetate (cfda) and propidium iodine (pi) into a dual-staining assay was used together with epifluorescence microscopy (efm) and flow cytometry (fcm) for viability assessment. the results showed that the cells  maintained esterase activity and membrane integrity at ph 8.1 and 7.4. there was  also no loss of culturability as shown by plate counts. in contrast, the majority of 2.5 ph-treated cells had a low extent of esterase activity, and experienced membrane perturbation. for these samples, an extensive loss of culturability was  demonstrated. comparison of the results of an in situ assessment with that of the conventional culturing method has revealed that although part of the stressed population was unable to grow on the growth media, it was deemed viable using a cfda/pi assay. however, there was no significant change in the cell morphology among ph-treated lactobacilli populations. these analyses are expected to be useful in understanding the cell response of lactobacillus strains to ph stress and may facilitate future investigation into functional and industrial aspects of this response.

TI  == influence of lactobacillus brevis 15 and lactobacillus plantarum 13 on blood glucose and body weight in rats after high-fructose diet.
AB  == in recent years, many authors have investigated the possible antidiabetic effect  of lactic acid bacteria. lactobacillus species constitute a major part of the lactic acid bacteria group and have been found to exhibit beneficial effects on the development of diabetes and its complications. in the current study, we investigated the effects of newly characterised bulgarian lactobacillus strains,  lactobacillus brevis 15 and lactobacillus plantarum 13, on blood glucose levels and body weight of rats fed a fructose-enriched diet. an experiment was conducted over a period of 8 weeks with 24 2-month-old wistar rats randomly assigned to receive a standard diet (con, control group), fructose-enriched diet (fr group),  standard diet with probiotics given twice a week (pro group), and fructose-enriched diet with probiotics given twice a week (pro+fr group). at the  end of the experimental period, a statistically significant increase in body weight was observed in all experimental groups (p<0.0001). the highest rise was seen in the fructose group (fr, 169+/-19 g), followed by the pro+fr group (153+/-15 g), pro group (149+/-13 g), and con group (141+/-5 g). moreover, the final blood glucose levels had risen significantly in the groups receiving fructose either without (fr; p<0.0001) or with lactobacilli (pro+fr; p=0.002), while the rise was insignificant in the group of rats given probiotic supplementation only (pro, p=0.071) and inexistent in the con group (p=0.999). the highest elevation of blood glucose levels was observed in the fr group (3.18  mmol/l), followed by the pro+fr group (2.00 mmol/l) whereas the pro group showed  the lowest levels (0.60 mmol/l). the results of our study suggest that the newly  characterised bulgarian lactobacillus strains, l. brevis 15 and l. plantarum 13,  could be considered as possible probiotics and might be able to prevent some metabolic disturbances.

TI  == fermentation characteristics and microbial diversity of tropical grass-legumes silages.
AB  == calliandra calothyrsus preserved in silage is an alternative method for improving the crude protein content of feeds for sustainable ruminant production. the aim of this research was to evaluate the quality of silage which contained different  levels of c. calothyrsus by examining the fermentation characteristics and microbial diversity. silage was made in a completely randomized design consisting of five treatments with three replications i.e.: r0, pennisetum purpureum 100%; r1, p. purpureum 75%+c. calothyrsus 25%;, r2, p. purpureum 50%+c. calothyrsus 50%; r3, p. purpureum 25%+c. calothyrsus 75%; and r4, c. calothyrsus 100%. all silages were prepared using plastic jar silos (600 g) and incubated at room temperature for 30 days. silages were analyzed for fermentation characteristics and microbial diversity. increased levels of c. calothyrsus in silage had a significant effect (p<0.01) on the fermentation characteristics. the microbial diversity index decreased and activity was inhibited with increasing levels of c. calothyrsus. the microbial community indicated that there was a population of lactobacillus plantarum, l. casei, l. brevis, lactococcus lactis, chryseobacterium sp., and uncultured bacteria. the result confirmed that silage with a combination of grass and c. calothyrsus had good fermentation characteristics and microbial communities were dominated by l. plantarum.

TI  == lactic acid production from biomass-derived sugars via co-fermentation of lactobacillus brevis and lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == lignocellulosic biomass is an attractive alternative resource for producing chemicals and fuels. xylose is the dominating sugar after hydrolysis of hemicellulose in the biomass, but most microorganisms either cannot ferment xylose or have a hierarchical sugar utilization pattern in which glucose is consumed first. to overcome this barrier, lactobacillus brevis atcc 367 was selected to produce lactic acid. this strain possesses a relaxed carbon catabolite repression mechanism that can use glucose and xylose simultaneously; however, lactic acid yield was only 0.52 g g(-1) from a mixture of glucose and xylose, and 5.1 g l(-1) of acetic acid and 8.3 g l(-1) of ethanol were also formed during production of lactic acid. the yield was significantly increased and ethanol production was significantly reduced if l. brevis was co-cultivated with lactobacillus plantarum atcc 21028. l. plantarum outcompeted l. brevis in glucose consumption, meaning that l. brevis was focused on converting xylose to lactic acid and the by-product, ethanol, was reduced due to less nadh generated in the fermentation system. sequential co-fermentation of l. brevis and l. plantarum increased lactic acid yield to 0.80 g g(-1) from poplar hydrolyzate and increased yield to 0.78 g lactic acid per g of biomass from alkali-treated corn stover with minimum by-product formation. efficient utilization of both cellulose and hemicellulose components of the biomass will improve overall lactic acid production and enable an economical process to produce biodegradable plastics.

TI  == reduction of ochratoxin a in chicken feed using probiotic.
AB  == mycotoxins present in fodders may evoke health problems of animals and people. the data published by fao in 2001 show that 25% of raw materials are contaminated with mycotoxins, while their type and concentration are to a great extent dependable on the climatic zone. biological detoxification of mycotoxins by the use of microorganisms is one of the well-known strategies for the management of mycotoxins in foods and feeds. the aim of this study was to determine the influence of spontaneous fermentation and that with the use of probiotic bacteria and yeast on ochratoxin a (ota) concentration and the microbiota pattern during fermentation. the probiotic preparation is a natural product containing bacteria  resistant to gastric juice and bile: lactobacillus paracasei lock 0920, lactobacillus brevis lock 0944, lactobacillus plantarum lock 0945, as well as live yeasts saccharomyces cerevisiae lock 0140 of high fermenting capacity. after 6-hour fermentation with the probiotic, in feed with a low concentration of ochratoxin a (1 mg/kg) the amount of ochratoxin a decreased by 73%. in the case of high a concentration (5 mg/kg) the decrease in ochratoxin a was lower at about 55%. this tendency was sustained during the following hours of incubation (12th and 24th hours). the application of probiotic bacteria and yeasts resulted in the reduction of aerobic spore forming bacteria. it can be concluded that the probiotic preparation containing bacteria of lactobacillus strains and yeasts saccharomyces cerevisiae used in the study was conducive to detoxification of ochratoxin a added to a feed.

TI  == phenotypic identification and technological attributes of native lactic acid bacteria present in fermented bamboo shoot products from north-east india.
AB  == fermented bamboo shoots such as soibum, soidon, eup, hirring, hecche and ekung etc. are non-salted acidic products obtained by natural fermentation predominantly with lactic acid bacteria (lab). in this study, we have characterized 11-representative lab that includes, lactobacillus sp. (n = 2), lactobacillus plantarum (n = 3), and one each of lactobacillus fermentum, lactococcus sp., lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus curvatus, leuconostoc sp. and lactobacillus xylosus. subsequently, these cultures were studied for their technological and functional properties. different isolates exhibited variation in their activities. l. brevis showed maximum phytic acid degradation ability (19.33 u ml (-1) ). l. xylosus had highest protease activity (64.2 nmol/ml) and also exhibited lipolytic activity. in addition, degree of cell hydrophobicity among these cultures ranged between 12.5 and 93.48 % with l. plantarum (sm2) showing highest degree of activity. lactobacillus plantarum was the most common species found in the product studied. results indicated that most of the labs showed putative probiotic as well as antagonistic properties against the selected pathogenic bacteria. characteristic aroma, flavour and texture in the fermented bamboo shoot products could be attributed to presence of these new lab isolates.

AB  == a total of 152 lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from pickles produced in  the ankara-cubuk region. these isolates were clustered into eight groups on the basis of their phenotypic characteristics including cell morphology, co2 production from glucose, growth at 10 and 45 degrees c, growth in 6.5 % nacl, and growth at ph 9.6. api 50 ch carbohydrate fermentation test, 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) sequence analysis, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) whole-cell protein profile analysis were also performed for precise identification of the isolates at the species level. molecular identification revealed that the most prevalent lab species involved in pickle fermentation were pediococcus ethanolidurans (46 isolates, 30.3 %), lactobacillus brevis (37 isolates, 24.3 %), lactobacillus plantarum (37 isolates, 24.3 %), and lactobacillus buchneri (15 isolates, 9.9 %). other lab were found in minor frequencies such as pediococcus parvulus (8 isolates, 5.3 %), lactobacillus namurensis (6 isolates, 3.9 %), lactobacillus diolivorans (1 isolate, 0.7 %), lactobacillus parabrevis (1 isolate, 0.7 %), and enterococcus casseliflavus (1 isolate, 0.7 %). when results of phenotypic and genotypic identification methods  were compared, differences in the species distribution of lab associated with pickles were defined between the api and the 16s rrna sequencing. the api 50 chl  test coincided with the 16s rrna results in 71 out of the 152 tested isolates, indicating that api gave unreliable identification results. a clear correlation could not be found between the results of whole-cell sds profiles and 16s rrna sequencing. therefore, molecular characterization by 16s rrna sequencing was considered to be the most reliable method for identifying isolates. the results presented in this work provide insight in to the lab population associated with traditional cubuk pickles and constitute a lab strain resource for further studies involving the development of starter cultures.

TI  == fermented fruits and vegetables of asia: a potential source of probiotics.
AB  == as world population increases, lactic acid fermentation is expected to become an  important role in preserving fresh vegetables, fruits, and other food items for feeding humanity in developing countries. however, several fermented fruits and vegetables products (sauerkraut, kimchi, gundruk, khalpi, sinki, etc.) have a long history in human nutrition from ancient ages and are associated with the several social aspects of different communities. among the food items, fruits and vegetables are easily perishable commodities due to their high water activity and nutritive values. these conditions are more critical in tropical and subtropical  countries which favour the growth of spoilage causing microorganisms. lactic acid fermentation increases shelf life of fruits and vegetables and also enhances several beneficial properties, including nutritive value and flavours, and reduces toxicity. fermented fruits and vegetables can be used as a potential source of probiotics as they harbour several lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus plantarum, l. pentosus, l. brevis, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, leuconostoc fallax, and l. mesenteroides. as a whole, the traditionally fermented fruits and vegetables not only serve as food supplements but also attribute towards health benefits. this review aims to describe some important asian fermented fruits and vegetables and their significance as a potential source of probiotics.

TI  == purification and characterization of bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus brevis un isolated from dhulliachar: a traditional food product of north east india.
AB  == a bacteriocin producing strain lactobacillus brevis un isolated from dulliachar-a salted pickle and identified by biochemical and molecular methods. l. brevis un was found to produce bacteriocin with broad spectrum activity against spoilage causing/food borne pathogens viz. l. monocytogenes, c. perfringens, s. aureus, l. mesenteroides, l. plantarum and b. cereus. bacteriocin production was optimized through classical one variable at a time method. the isolate showed maximum bacteriocin production at early stationary phase, ph 4.0, temperature 35 degrees  c and with an inoculum size of 1.5 od @ 10 %. bacteriocin produced by l. brevis un was purified to homogeneity by single step gel exclusion chromatography and was most active at ph 6.0 and 7.0, stable up to 100 degrees c and was proteinaceous in nature. the results of nmr revealed the presence of proline, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, leucine, isoleucine and serine in its peptide structure. pcr amplification analysis determined that bacteriocin encoded gene in l. brevis un was plasmid bound.

TI  == the adsorption of ochratoxin a by lactobacillus species.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine ochratoxin a (ota) binding by three lactic acid bacteria (lab) species: lactobacillus plantarum, l. brevis, and l. sanfranciscensis. experiments were conducted using mrs medium and pbs buffer contaminated with 1000 ng/ml ota and inoculated with live or thermally inactivated bacterial biomass at a concentration of 1 or 5 mg dry weight/ml. it was found that, depending on the strain and biomass density, live bacterial cells reduced ota content by 16.9% to 35% in mrs medium and by 14.8% to 26.4% in pbs after 24 h of contact. ota binding was higher in the case of thermally inactivated bacterial biomass (46.2% to 59.8%). the process is very rapid: ota was removed from pbs as early as after 30 min of contact. the binding of the toxin by cells was partially reversible under the treatment by water and 1 m hcl. the results show that ota is adsorbed to the surface structures of the cell wall, which is promoted not only by the hydrophobic properties of the cell wall, but also by electron donor-acceptor and lewis acid-base interactions.

TI  == effects of ensiling fermentation and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community in italian ryegrass, guinea grass, and whole-crop maize silages stored  at high moisture content.
AB  == the effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in italian ryegrass (ir), guinea grass (gg), and whole-crop maize (wm) silages. direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content  of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the ir, gg, and wm silages, respectively. the acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type  of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of  gg ensiling. pantoea agglomerans, rahnella aquatilis, and enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the ir silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. staphylococcus sciuri and bacillus pumilus were detected when ir silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community  at silo opening. lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the gg silage. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. enterobacter cloacae appeared when the gg silage was spoiled. in the wm silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. throughout the ensiling, weissella paramesenteroides, weissella confusa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to l. plantarum, l. brevis, and l. lactis. upon deterioration, acetobacter pasteurianus, klebsiella variicola, enterobacter hormaechei, and bacillus gibsonii were detected. these results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling  and aerobic spoilage of ir, gg, and wm silages.

TI  == inhibitors of biofilm formation by biofuel fermentation contaminants.
AB  == biofuel fermentation contaminants such as lactobacillus sp. may persist in production facilities by forming recalcitrant biofilms. in this study, biofilm-forming strains of lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus plantarum were isolated and characterized from a dry-grind fuel ethanol plant. a variety of potential biofilm inhibitors were tested, including microbial polysaccharides, commercial enzymes, ferric ammonium citrate, liamocins, phage endolysin, xylitol, and culture supernatants from bacillus sp. a commercial enzyme mixture (novozyme 188) and culture supernatants from bacillus subtilis strains alt3a and rpt-82412 were identified as the most promising biofilm inhibitors. in biofilm flow cells, these inhibitors reduced the density of viable biofilm cells by 0.8-0.9 log cfu/cm(2). unlike b. subtilis strain rpt-82412, b. subtilis strain alt3a and novozyme 188 did not inhibit planktonic growth of lactobacillus sp. maldi-tof mass spectra showed the production of surfactin-like molecules by both b. subtilis strains, and the coproduction of iturin-like molecules by strain rpt-82412.

TI  == biodiversity of lactobacillus plantarum from traditional italian wines.
AB  == in this study, 23 samples of traditional wines produced in southern italy were subjected to microbiological analyses with the aim to identify and biotype the predominant species of lactic acid bacilli. for this purpose, a multiple approach, consisting in the application of both phenotypic (api 50chl test) and biomolecular methods (polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rrna gene sequencing) was used. the results showed that lactobacillus plantarum was the predominant species, whereas lb. brevis was detected in lower amount. in detail, out of 80 isolates 58 were ascribable to lb. plantarum and 22 to lb. brevis. randomly amplified polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction was used to highlight intraspecific variability among lb. plantarum strains. interestingly, the cluster analysis evidenced a relationship between different biotypes of lb. plantarum and their origin, in terms of wine variety. data acquired in this work show the possibility to obtain several malolactic fermentation starter cultures, composed by different lb. plantarum biotypes, for their proper use in winemaking processes which are distinctive for  each wine.

TI  == traditionally produced sauerkraut as source of autochthonous functional starter cultures.
AB  == spontaneous sauerkraut fermentation was performed at industrial scale in "prehrana inc.", varazdin, in order to select autochthonous lactic acid bacteria  (lab) which were evaluated according probiotic criteria and tested for their capacity as probiotic starter cultures. at the end of the spontaneous sauerkraut  fermentation, total lab counts reached 9.0x10(5) cfu/ml. this underlines that the need for addition of the well characterised probiotic cultures, in appropriate viable cell counts, would be valuable in probiotic sauerkraut production. phenotypic characterisation through api 50 chl and sds-page of cell protein patterns revealed that lactobacillus plantarum is predominant lab strain in homofermentative phase of fermentation. autochthonous lab isolates sf1, sf2, sf4, sf9 and sf15 were selected based on the survival in in vitro gastrointestinal tract conditions. rapd fingerprints indicated that the selected autochthonous lab were distinct from one another. all of the strains efficiently inhibited the growth of indicator strains and satisfied technological properties such as acidification rate, tolerance to nacl and viability during freeze-drying. strains lb. paraplantarum sf9 and lb. brevis sf15, identified by aflp dna fingerprints, have shown the best properties to be applied as probiotic starter cultures, because of their highest adhesion to caco-2 cells and expression of specific, protective s-layer proteins of 45 kda in size. with addition of these strains, probiotic attribute of the sauerkraut will be achieved, including health promoting, nutritional, technological and economic advantages in large scale industrial sauerkraut production.

TI  == evolution of bacterial consortia in spontaneously started rye sourdoughs during two months of daily propagation.
AB  == the evolution of bacterial consortia was studied in six semi-solid rye sourdoughs during long-term backslopping at different temperatures. each rye sourdough was started spontaneously in a laboratory (dough yield 200), propagated at either 20  degrees c or 30 degrees c, and renewed daily at an inoculation rate of 1ratio10 for 56 days. the changes in bacterial diversity over time were followed by both dgge coupled with partial 16s rrna gene sequencing and pyrosequencing of bar-coded 16s rrna gene amplicons. four species from the genus lactobacillus (brevis, crustorum, plantarum, and paralimentarius) were detected in different combinations in all sourdoughs after 56 propagation cycles. facultative heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria dominated in sourdoughs fermented at 30 degrees c, while both obligate and facultative heterofermentative lab were found  to dominate in sourdoughs fermented at 20 degrees c. after 56 propagation cycles, kazachstania unispora (formerly saccharomyces unisporus) was identified as the only yeast species that dominated in sourdoughs fermented at 20 degrees c, while  different combinations of strains from four yeast species (kazachstania unispora, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida krusei and candida glabrata) were detected in sourdoughs propagated at 30 degrees c. the evolution of bacterial communities in  sourdoughs fermented at the same temperature did not follow the same time course  and changes in the composition of dominant and subdominant bacterial communities  occurred even after six weeks of backslopping.

TI  == social attraction mediated by fruit flies' microbiome.
AB  == larval and adult fruit flies are attracted to volatiles emanating from food substrates that have been occupied by larvae. we tested whether such volatiles are emitted by the larval gut bacteria by conducting tests under bacteria-free (axenic) conditions. we also tested attraction to two bacteria species, lactobacillus brevis, which we cultured from larvae in our lab, and l. plantarum, a common constituent of fruit flies' microbiome in other laboratory populations and in wild fruit flies. neither larvae nor adults showed attraction to axenic food that had been occupied by axenic larvae, but both showed the previously reported attraction to standard food that had been occupied by larvae with an intact microbiome. larvae also showed significant attraction to volatiles from axenic food and larvae to which we added only either l. brevis or l. plantarum, and volatiles from l. brevis reared on its optimal growth medium. controlled learning experiments indicated that larvae experienced with both standard and axenic used food do not perceive either as superior, while focal larvae experienced with simulated used food, which contains burrows, perceive it as superior to unused food. our results suggest that flies rely on microbiome-derived volatiles for long-distance attraction to suitable food patches. under natural settings, fruits often contain harmful fungi and bacteria, and both l. brevis and l. plantarum produce compounds that suppress the growth of some antagonistic fungi and bacteria. the larval microbiome volatiles may therefore lead prospective fruit flies towards substrates with a hospitable microbial environment.

TI  == diversity of the lactic acid bacterium and yeast microbiota in the switch from firm- to liquid-sourdough fermentation.
AB  == four traditional type i sourdoughs were comparatively propagated (28 days) under  firm (dough yield, 160) and liquid (dough yield, 280) conditions to mimic the alternative technology options frequently used for making baked goods. after 28 days of propagation, liquid sourdoughs had the lowest ph and total titratable acidity (tta), the lowest concentrations of lactic and acetic acids and free amino acids, and the most stable density of presumptive lactic acid bacteria. the cell density of yeasts was the highest in liquid sourdoughs. liquid sourdoughs showed simplified microbial diversity and harbored a low number of strains, which were persistent. lactobacillus plantarum dominated firm sourdoughs over time. leuconostoc lactis and lactobacillus brevis dominated only some firm sourdoughs,  and lactobacillus sanfranciscensis persisted for some time only in some firm sourdoughs. leuconostoc citreum persisted in all firm and liquid sourdoughs, and  it was the only species detected in liquid sourdoughs at all times; it was flanked by leuconostoc mesenteroides in some sourdoughs. saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida humilis, saccharomyces servazzii, saccharomyces bayanus-kazachstania sp., and torulaspora delbrueckii were variously identified in firm and liquid sourdoughs. a total of 197 volatile components were identified through purge and trap-/solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (pt-/spme-gc-ms). aldehydes, several alcohols, and some esters were  at the highest levels in liquid sourdoughs. firm sourdoughs mainly contained ethyl acetate, acetic acid, some sulfur compounds, and terpenes. the use of liquid fermentation would change the main microbial and biochemical features of traditional baked goods, which have been manufactured under firm conditions for a long time.

TI  == prevalence of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria isolated from the faeces of broiler chicken in malaysia.
AB  == background: probiotics are commonly used as feed additive to substitute antibiotic as growth promoter in animal farming. probiotic consists of lactic acid bacteria (lab), which enhance the growth and health of the animal. probiotic also have higher possibility to become pathogenic bacteria that may carry antibiotic resistant gene that can be transmitted to other lab species. the aim of this study was to identify the lab species in the faeces of broiler chicken and to determine the prevalence of antibiotic resistant in lab of broiler chicken. methods: sixty faeces samples were collected from wet markets located in klang valley of malaysia for the isolation of lab using de-mann rogosa sharpe medium. thirteen species of lab were obtained in this study and the identification of lab was performed by using api test kit on the basis of carbohydrate fermentation profile. antibiotic susceptibility assay was then carried out to determine the prevalence of lab antibiotic resistance. results: lactococcus lactis subsp lactis was found in nine out of sixty faecal samples. lactobacillus paracasei was the second common lab species isolated from chicken faecal. no significant difference (p > 0.05) was found between the occurrence of  lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus plantarum, leuconostoc lactis mesenteroides subsp mesenteroides/dectranium and pediococcus pentosaceus isolated from 5 different locations. most of the isolated lab was resistant to antibiotic and high variability of the antibiotic resistance was observed among the lab against 15 types of antibiotics. penicillin, amoxicillin,  chloramphenicol, and ampicillin had significant higher (p< 0.05) inhibitory zone  than nalidixic acid, gentamycin, sulphamethoxazole, kanamycin, and streptomycin.  conclusions: many species of lab were isolated from the faecal samples of broiler chicken that resistance to the common antibiotics used in the farm. the development of resistant against antibiotics in lab can be attributed to the long term exposure of antibiotic as growth promoter and therapeutic agents. thus, it is essential to advise farmer the safety measure of antibiotic application in animal farming. additionally, the supplementation of probiotic in animal feeding  also needs more attention and close monitoring.

TI  == soluble products of escherichia coli induce mitochondrial dysfunction-related sperm membrane lipid peroxidation which is prevented by lactobacilli.
AB  == unidentified soluble factors secreted by e. coli, a frequently isolated microorganism in genitourinary infections, have been reported to inhibit mitochondrial membrane potential (deltapsim), motility and vitality of human spermatozoa. here we explore the mechanisms involved in the adverse impact of e.  coli on sperm motility, focusing mainly on sperm mitochondrial function and possible membrane damage induced by mitochondrial-generated reactive oxygen species (ros). furthermore, as lactobacilli, which dominate the vaginal ecosystem of healthy women, have been shown to exert anti-oxidant protective effects on spermatozoa, we also evaluated whether soluble products from these microorganisms could protect spermatozoa against the effects of e. coli. we assessed motility (by computer-aided semen analysis), deltapsim (with jc-1 dye by flow cytometry),  mitochondrial ros generation (with mitosox red dye by flow cytometry) and membrane lipid-peroxidation (with the fluorophore bodipy c11 by flow cytometry) of sperm suspensions exposed to e. coli in the presence and in the absence of a combination of 3 selected strains of lactobacilli (l. brevis, l. salivarius, l. plantarum). a transwell system was used to avoid direct contact between spermatozoa and microorganisms. soluble products of e. coli induced deltapsim loss, mitochondrial generation of ros and membrane lipid-peroxidation, resulting  in motility loss. soluble factors of lactobacilli prevented membrane lipid-peroxidation of e. coli-exposed spermatozoa, thus preserving their motility. in conclusion, sperm motility loss by soluble products of e. coli reflects a mitochondrial dysfunction-related membrane lipid-peroxidation. lactobacilli could protect spermatozoa in the presence of vaginal disorders, by preventing ros-induced membrane damage.

TI  == a generic model for spoilage of acidic emulsified foods: combining physicochemical data, diversity and levels of specific spoilage organisms.
AB  == the spoilage pattern of three emulsified, vegetable-based spreads of low ph (3.90-4.15) adjusted with acetic acid was characterized by correlating the growth of spoilage flora with the organoleptic and physicochemical changes, as well as the changes in the species composition of the dominant microflora during storage  under isothermal conditions. in a further step, a generic (hereafter called 'unified') model was developed to describe the maximum specific growth rate of the specific spoilage organisms (ssos) in all acetic acid acidified products, including literature data and additional in-house data from similar products, as  a function of the storage temperature, ph (3.61-4.25) and initial concentration of the undissociated acetic acid in each product. the predictions of the unified  model were compared with those of product-specific models, with temperature as the sole predictor variable. two independent batches of commercially prepared pepper- (ps), fava beans- (fs) and eggplant-based (es) spreads were stored at 4,  7, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20 and 25 degrees c. the growth of lactic acid bacteria (ssos; lab) was correlated with changes in ph, titratable acidity and organic acids concentration, as well as sensory characteristics, in order to define the shelf-life of the products. isolates from each spread and storage temperature were grouped with sds-page and were identified with 16s rrna, determining the association between spoilage and species diversity. product-specific models were  developed using the square root model, while a polynomial and the ratkowsky model were used for the development of the unified model. products with lower ph and/or higher acetic acid content showed higher microbial stability. lactobacillus plantarum or lactobacillus brevis dominated the lab association in all three spreads, although their relative percentage at the beginning of storage varied significantly. these facultative or obligate hetero-fermentative bacteria increased lactic acid and, sporadically, acetic acid levels in the spreads. the developed models were validated under real chill chain conditions and showed very good agreement with the observed data in ps and fs. the spoilage perception patterns of the different products were similar and thus, the proposed unified model may provide accurate predictions for the spoilage of a wide variety of acetic acid-acidified spreads, regardless of differences in the formulation (e.g., raw materials) and the manufacturing procedure.

AB  == silage is green fodder conserved by lactic acid fermentation performed by epiphytic lactic acid bacteria under anaerobic conditions. to improve the ensiling process and the quality of the resulting silage, starter cultures are added to the fresh forage. a detailed analysis of the microbial community playing a role in grass ensiling has been carried out by high throughput sequencing technologies. moreover, the influence of the inoculant lactobacillus buchneri cd034 on the microbial community composition was studied. for this purpose, grass was ensiled untreated or inoculated with l. buchneri cd034. the fresh forage as well as silages after 14 and 58 days of fermentation were characterized physico-chemically. characteristic silage conditions such as increased titers of  lactic acid bacteria and higher concentrations of acetic acid were observed in the inoculated silage in comparison to the untreated samples. taxonomic community profiles deduced from 16s rdna amplicon sequences indicated that the relative abundance of lactococci diminished in the course of fermentations and that the proportion of bacteria belonging to the phyla proteobacteria and bacteroidetes increased during the fermentation of untreated silage. in the inoculated silage,  members of these phyla were repressed due to an increased abundance of lactobacilli. in addition, metagenome analyses of silage samples confirmed taxonomic profiles based on 16s rdna amplicons. moreover, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis and lactococcus lactis were found to be dominant  species within silages as analyzed by means of fragment recruitments of metagenomic sequence reads on complete reference genome sequences. fragment recruitments also provided clear evidence for the competitiveness of the inoculant strain l. buchneri cd034 during the fermentation of the inoculated silage. the inoculation strain was able to outcompete other community members and also affected physico-chemical characteristics of the silage.

TI  == a review on traditional turkish fermented non-alcoholic beverages: microbiota, fermentation process and quality characteristics.
AB  == shalgam juice, hardaliye, boza, ayran (yoghurt drink) and kefir are the most known traditional turkish fermented non-alcoholic beverages. the first three are  obtained from vegetables, fruits and cereals, and the last two ones are made of milk. shalgam juice, hardaliye and ayran are produced by lactic acid fermentation. their microbiota is mainly composed of lactic acid bacteria (lab).  lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis and lactobacillus paracasei subsp.  paracasei in shalgam fermentation and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei and lactobacillus casei subsp. pseudoplantarum in hardaliye fermentation are predominant. ayran is traditionally prepared by mixing yoghurt with water and salt. yoghurt starter cultures are used in industrial ayran production. on the other hand, both alcohol and lactic acid fermentation occur in boza and kefir. boza is prepared by using a mixture of maize, wheat and rice or their flours and  water. generally previously produced boza or sourdough/yoghurt are used as starter culture which is rich in lactobacillus spp. and yeasts. kefir is prepared by inoculation of raw milk with kefir grains which consists of different species  of yeasts, lab, acetic acid bacteria in a protein and polysaccharide matrix. the  microbiota of boza and kefir is affected from raw materials, the origin and the production methods. in this review, physicochemical properties, manufacturing technologies, microbiota and shelf life and spoilage of traditional fermented beverages were summarized along with how fermentation conditions could affect rheological properties of end product which are important during processing and storage.

TI  == biowaste: a lactobacillus habitat and lactic acid fermentation substrate.
AB  == composite organic waste was assessed for its physical, chemical and microbial suitability to serve as a substrate for the fermentative production of lactic acid. the biowaste studied was highly acidic (ph 4.3) and had high organic carbon content (45%). a clone library identified 90% of the bacterial community were lactic acid bacteria, mainly represented by lactobacilli (70%). cultivation using semiselective media identified lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis and  their closest relatives as the dominating taxa. pcr-dgge using general bacterial  and lactic acid bacterial specific primers resulted in little heterogeneity of microbial community. these data indicate that biowaste is a preferred habitat of  lactic acid bacteria, suggesting that the unsterilized biowaste and its natural flora could be used in a fermentation process for lactic acid production. such kind of biowaste application could be an alternative for current substrates and provide a modern, efficient and environmental friendly waste treatment technology.

TI  == a description of the lactic acid bacteria microbiota associated with the production of traditional fermented vegetables in vietnam.
AB  == an important part of the daily nourishment in vietnam constitutes of fermented vegetables. bacteria and especially lactic acid bacteria play a central role in the production of many fermented vegetables. the current study was conducted to investigate the diversity of native lactic acid bacteria (lab) populations in 'dua muoi' (mustard and beet fermentation) and 'ca muoi' (eggplant fermentation), three types of popular traditional fermented vegetables of vietnamese origin. to  this end a polyphasic approach combining matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) and phes gene sequence analysis was used. in addition, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was performed as a culture-independent method to complement the observed culturable diversity data. a total of 881 lab isolates were recovered from 21 different samples. predominant lab associated with 'dua muoi' and 'ca muoi' were identified as lactobacillus fermentum (56.6%), lactobacillus pentosus  (24.4%) and lactobacillus plantarum (17.1%). less abundant species were pediococcus pentosaceus (1.0%) and lactobacillus brevis (0.5%). species present less than 0.1% included lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus pantheris and pediococcus acidilactici. in contrast to fermented mustard and beet with the highest prevalence of l. fermentum, the species most recovered from fermented eggplant samples was l. pentosus. in addition, an important degree of genetic variability within the different predominant species was observed and strain dependency correlating with the type of fermented vegetable or location of production could be demonstrated using multivariate statistics. this research gives an extensive and detailed inventory of the lab diversity associated with the production of diverse vietnamese fermented vegetables and demonstrates the influence of type of raw material and/or production location and conditions on this diversity.

TI  == species diversity, community dynamics, and metabolite kinetics of spontaneous leek fermentations.
AB  == leek (allium ampeloprasum var. porrum) is one of belgium's most important vegetables. all or part of the green leek parts are often left on the fields because of their limited cooking applications compared to the white leek parts. therefore, the possibility to perform leek fermentations in view of product valorization and diversification was investigated. this study deals with the community dynamics, species diversity, and metabolite kinetics of spontaneous leek fermentations, thereby studying the influence of added nacl concentration, harvesting season, and duration of the fermentation. the combination of a culture-dependent and culture-independent approach revealed the prevalence of lactic acid bacteria (lab) from the third day of fermentation onwards, which was  not influenced by the fermentation conditions applied. enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonadaceae, and yeasts disappeared after one week of fermentation. leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus sakei, and lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and lactobacillus parabrevis were the most frequently isolated lab species. both added nacl concentrations were suitable to perform successful fermentations within three weeks. by that time, glucose and fructose,  the main leek carbohydrates, were metabolized into mainly lactic acid, acetic acid, ethanol, and mannitol. a sensory analysis revealed that the fermented white leek parts were generally more appreciated than the fermented green leek parts.

TI  == probiotic potential of lactobacillus spp. isolated from brazilian regional ovine  cheese.
AB  == twelve lactobacillus isolates from brazilian starter-free ovine cheeses were evaluated for their probiotic potential. the strains were identified by 16s rdna  sequencing as lactobacillus plantarum (7), lb. brevis (2), lb. casei (2) and lb.  parabuchneri (1). all strains showed variable resistance to gastric juices and relative tolerance to pancreatin and bile salts. only five strains of lb. plantarum could not deconjugate the sodium salt of taurodeoxycholic acid. autoaggregation ability after 24 h was above 50% and hydrophobicity was higher than 60% for most strains. all lactobacilli could inhibit linolenic acid oxidation, except lb. parabuchneri strain, whereas none of them could scavenge dpph radical. beta-galactosidase activity ranged from 47.7 to 2503 miller units.  inhibition of food pathogens listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium was demonstrated and the production of organic acids could be associated with this effect. the lactobacillus strains from brazilian regional ovine cheese showed interesting functional characteristics, mainly the strains lb. brevis sm-b and lb. plantarum  sm-i. both presented high acid tolerance. in addition, lb. brevis sm-b also displayed remarkable antioxidant activity and lb. plantarum sm-i was the highest  beta-galactosidase producer, exhibited high autoaggregation and hydrophobicity properties.

TI  == fast identification of wine related lactic acid bacteria by multiplex pcr.
AB  == the microflora of must and wine consists of yeasts, acetic acid bacteria and lactic acid bacteria (lab). the latter group plays an important role for wine quality. the malolactic fermentation carried out by lab leads to deacidification  and stabilisation of wines. nevertheless, lab are often associated with wine spoilage. they are mainly responsible for the formation of biogenic amines. furthermore, some strains produce exopolysaccharide slimes, acetic acid, diacetyl and other off-flavours. in this context a better monitoring of the vinification process is crucial to improve wine quality. moreover, a lot of biodiversity studies would also profit from a fast and reliable identification method. in this study, we propose a species-specific multiplex pcr system for a rapid and simultaneous detection of 13 lab species, frequently occurring in must or wine: lactobacillus brevis, lb. buchneri, lb. curvatus, lb. hilgardii, lb. plantarum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, oenococcus oeni, pediococcus acidilactici, p. damnosus, p. inopinatus, p. parvulus, p. pentosaceus and weissella paramesenteroides.

TI  == bacteriophage ecology in a commercial cucumber fermentation.
AB  == to reduce high-salt waste from cucumber fermentations, low-salt fermentations are under development. these fermentations may require the use of starter cultures to ensure normal fermentations. because potential phage infection can cause starter  culture failure, it is important to understand phage ecology in the fermentations. this study investigated the phage ecology in a commercial cucumber fermentation. brine samples taken from a fermentation tank over a 90-day period were plated onto deman-rogosa-sharpe agar plates. a total of 576 lactic acid bacterial isolates were randomly selected to serve as potential hosts for phage isolation. filtered brine served as a phage source. fifty-seven independent phage isolates were obtained, indicating that 10% of the bacterial isolates were sensitive to phage attack. phage hosts include lactobacillus brevis (67% of all hosts), lactobacillus plantarum (21%), weissella paramesenteroides, weissella cibaria, and pediococcus ethanolidurans. nearly 50% of phages were isolated on day 14, and the majority of them attacked l. brevis. some phages had a broad host range and were capable of infecting multiple hosts in two genera. other phages were species specific or strain specific. about 30% of phage isolates produced turbid pinpoint plaques or only caused reduced cell growth on the bacterial lawns. six phages with distinct host ranges were characterized. the data from this study showed that abundant and diverse phages were present in the commercial cucumber fermentation, which could cause significant mortality to the lactic acid bacteria population. therefore, a phage control strategy may be needed in low-salt cucumber fermentations.

TI  == development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in thai fermented sausage.
AB  == to improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. a total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16s rrna gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species,  including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. after fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. the array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (lactobacillus plantarum  group, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. sakei, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and listeria monocytogenes) except l. animalis. multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. the feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with thai fermented sausages  (nham). meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, l. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and l. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. the naturally-fermented nham contained l. sakei, l. delbrueckii, l. plantarum and l. fermentum. the l. plantarum-inoculated nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for l. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. the l. brevis-inoculated nham contained l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. delbrueckii and l. fermentum. the array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. the naturally-fermented and l. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of l. plantarum on  day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. in contrast, the l. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and l. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. the bacteria identification  array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.

TI  == tyrosine-containing peptides are precursors of tyramine produced by lactobacillus plantarum strain ir bl0076 isolated from wine.
AB  == background: biogenic amines are molecules with allergenic properties. they are found in fermented products and are synthesized by lactic acid bacteria through the decarboxylation of amino acids present in the food matrix. the concentration  of biogenic amines in fermented foodstuffs is influenced by many environmental factors, and in particular, biogenic amine accumulation depends on the quantity of available precursors. enological practices which lead to an enrichment in nitrogen compounds therefore favor biogenic amine production in wine. free amino  acids are the only known precursors for the synthesis of biogenic amines, and no  direct link has previously been demonstrated between the use of peptides by lactic acid bacteria and biogenic amine synthesis. results: here we demonstrate for the first time that a lactobacillus plantarum strain isolated from a red wine can produce the biogenic amine tyramine from peptides containing tyrosine. in our conditions, most of the tyramine was produced during the late exponential growth  phase, coinciding with the expression of the tyrdc and tyrp genes. the dna sequences of tyrdc and tyrp in this strain share 98% identity with those in lactobacillus brevis consistent with horizontal gene transfer from l. brevis to l. plantarum. conclusion: peptides amino acids are precursors of biogenic amines  for lactobacillus plantarum strain ir bl0076.

TI  == characterization of lactobacillus brevis l62 strain, highly tolerant to copper ions.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) as starter culture in food industry must be suitable for large-scale industrial production and possess the ability to survive in unfavorable processes and storage conditions. approaches taken to address these problems include the selection of stress-resistant strains. in food industry, lab are often exposed to metal ions induced stress. the interactions between lab and  metal ions are very poorly investigated. because of that, the influence of non-toxic, toxic and antioxidant metal ions (zn, cu, and mn) on growth, acid production, metal ions binding capacity of wild and adapted species of leuconostoc mesenteroides l3, lactobacillus brevis l62 and lactobacillus plantarum l73 were investigated. the proteomic approach was applied to clarify how the lab cells, especially the adapted ones, protect themselves and tolerate high concentrations of toxic metal ions. results have shown that zn and mn addition into mrs medium in the investigated concentrations did not have effect on the bacterial growth and acid production, while copper ions were highly toxic, especially in static conditions. leuc. mesenteroides l3 was the most efficient in zn binding processes among the chosen lab species, while l. plantarum l73 accumulated the highest concentration of mn. l. brevis l62 was the most copper resistant species. adaptation had a positive effect on growth and acid production of all species in the presence of copper. however, the adapted species incorporated less metal ions than the wild species. the exception was adapted l.  brevis l62 that accumulated high concentration of copper ions in static conditions. the obtained results showed that l. brevis l62 is highly tolerant to  copper ions, which allows its use as starter culture in fermentative processes in media with high concentration of copper ions.

TI  == survival of silage lactic acid bacteria in the goat gastrointestinal tract as determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == aims: to determine the survival rate of silage lactic acid bacteria (lab) in the  ruminant gastrointestinal tract. methods and results: wilted italian ryegrass (lolium multiflorum lam.) silage (containing 1.9 x 10(6) cfu lab g(-1)) was fed ad libitum to three goats equipped with rumen cannulae. silage was given alone or with concentrates at a 1 : 1 ratio on a dry matter basis. rumen fluid was then obtained 2, 4 and 8 h after the morning feeding. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was performed to compare lab communities in silage, rumen fluid and faeces. the lab detected in the wilted silage included lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus murinus and lactobacillus sakei. bands indicative of lact. murinus were detected in either the rumen fluid or faeces, whereas the bands indicative of lact. plantarum, lact. brevis and lact. sakei were not. although the rumen fluid lab counts and volatile fatty acid concentrations were higher in goats fed silage plus concentrates compared with those fed silage alone, the lab communities themselves remained unaffected. sampling times and goat-to-goat variations did not affect the lab communities found in the rumen fluid. conclusion: lab communities found in the gut are not remarkably affected by the consumption of silage lab, even when the silage is accompanied by concentrates that facilitate gut fermentation. significance and impact of the study: although silage can improve probiotic function, it may be difficult for silage lab to survive the digestive process in the ruminant gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from apples are able to catabolise arginine.
AB  == we investigated the potentiality of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from two  apples variety to utilize arginine at different initial ph values. apples surface contained average levels of bacteria ranging from log 2.49 +/- 0.53 to log 3.73 +/- 0.48 cfu/ml for red delicious and golden delicious varieties, respectively. thirty-one strains able to develop in presence of arginine at low ph were phenotypically and genotipically identified as belonging to lactobacillus, pediococcus and leuconostoc genera. in general, they did not produce ammonia from arginine when cultivated in basal medium with arginine (bma) at ph 4.5 or 5.2. when this metabolite was quantified only six strains belonging to leuconostoc dextranicum, lactobacillus brevis and lactobacillus plantarum species formed higher ammonia amounts in bma as compared to control. this was correlated with arginine utilization and it was more pronounced at ph 4.5 than 5.2. analysis of citrulline production confirmed the arginine utilization in these bacteria by the arginine deiminase (adi) pathway. maxima citrulline production was observed for lactobacillus brevis m15 at the two ph values. in this strain ammonia was formed  at higher rate than citrulline, which was detected in concentration lower than 1  mm. thus, main lab species found on apple surfaces with abilities to degrade arginine by the adi pathway under different conditions were reported here at the  first time. the results suggested that the adi pathway in apples lab might not be mainly relevant for their survival in the acid natural environmental, despite leading to the ammonia formation, which may contribute to the increase in ph, coping the acid stress.

AB  == aims: this study was designed to characterize a beta-glucosidase of oenococcus oeni st81, a strain isolated from a spanish wine of the origin appellation ribeira sacra. methods and results: the beta-glucosidase of o. oeni st81 seems to have a periplasmic localization into the cells. this activity was strongly inhibited by gluconic acid, partially inhibited by glucose and not inhibited by fructose, lactate, malate, mannitol or sorbitol. ethanol increased the activity of this enzyme up to 147%. among the several metal ions assayed, only fe(2)(+) (10 mmol l(-)(1)) and cu(2)(+) (5 mmol l(-)(1)) exhibited a partial inhibitory effect (40%). this enzyme was partially purified using a combination of ammonium  sulfate precipitation and chromatographic methods. the single peak because of beta-glucosidase in all chromatographic columns indicates the presence of a single enzyme with an estimated molecular mass of 140 kda. the calculated k(m) and v(max) values for 4-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside were 0.38 mmol l(-)(1) and 5.21 nmol min(-)(1), respectively. the enzyme was stable at ph 5.0 with a value of t(1/2) = 50 days for the crude extract. conclusions: the beta-glucosidase of o. oeni st81 is substantially different from those characterized from other wine-related lactic acid bacteria (lab), such as lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus brevis; however, it appears to be closely related to a beta-glucosidase from o. oeni atcc baa-1163 cloned into escherichia coli. the periplasmic localization of the enzyme together with its high tolerance to ethanol and fructose, the low inhibitory effect of some wine-related compounds on the enzymatic activity and long-term stability of the enzyme could be of interest for winemaking. significance and impact of the study: information regarding a beta-glucosidase from o. oeni st81 is presented. although the release of aroma compounds by lab has been demonstrated, little information exists concerning the responsible enzymes. to our knowledge, this study contains  the first characterization of a native beta-glucosidase purified from crude extracts of o. oeni st81.

AB  == aims: to investigate the effects of nisin on lactobacilli contamination of yeast  during ethanol fermentation and to determine the appropriate concentration required to control the growth of selected lactobacilli in a yp/glucose media fermentation model. methods and results: the lowest concentration of nisin tested (5 iu ml(-1) ) effectively controlled the contamination of yp/glucose media with  10(6) cfu ml(-1) lactobacilli. lactic acid yield decreased from 5.0 to 2. 0 g l(-1) and potential ethanol yield losses owing to the growth and metabolism of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus brevis were reduced by 11 and 7.8%, respectively. approximately, equal concentrations of lactic acid were produced by lact. plantarum and lact. brevis in the presence of 5 and 2 iu ml(-1) nisin, respectively, thus demonstrating the relatively higher nisin sensitivity of lact. brevis for the strains in this study. no differences were observed in the final ethanol concentrations produced by yeast in the absence of bacteria at any of the nisin concentrations tested. conclusions: metabolism of contaminating bacteria was reduced in the presence of 5 iu ml(-1) nisin, resulting in reduced lactic acid production and increased ethanol production by the yeast. significance and impact of the study: bacteriocins represent an alternative to the use of antibiotics for the control of bacterial contamination in fuel ethanol plants and may be important in preventing the emergence of antibiotic-resistant contaminating strains.

TI  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of metabolites from lactobacillus strains on candida species implicated in candida vaginitis.
AB  == background: research from developing countries, such as nigeria, on lactobacillus species in the female urogenital tract and their role as a barrier to vaginal infection is limited. therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the clinical biotherapeutic potential of indigenous lactobacillus species. methods: antimicrobial metabolites production were characterised using simple and easily reproducible qualitative and quantitative methods. the in vitro inhibitory effect of lactobacillus antimicrobials on vulvovaginal candidiasis-associated candida species was investigated using modified agar spot and agar well-diffusion methods. results: the maximum levels of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and diacetyl from 20 vaginal lactobacillus strains from diseased subjects were 1.46 mg/l, 1.36 mmol/l, and 1.72 mg/l respectively. from the 4 healthy subjects, the maximum level of lactic acid was 1.08 mg/l; hydrogen peroxide, 1.36 mmol/l; and diacetyl, 0.86 mg/l. the maximum productions of these substances occurred between 72 and 120 hours of incubation. the in vitro antagonistic activities of vaginal l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. casei, l. delbrueckii,  and l. jensenii from diseased subjects inhibited a maximum of 5.71% of the 35 candida species tested, while vaginal l. acidophilus and l. plantarum from healthy subjects inhibited between 57.1% and 68.6% of candida species in vitro. conclusion: antimicrobial-producing lactobacilli can be considered as adjunct biotherapeutic candidates for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis.

TI  == biochemical, microbiological and phytochemical studies on aqueous-fermented extracts from atropa belladonna l. part 1--biochemistry and microbiology.
AB  == extraction methods of fresh plants into aqueous-fermented extracts according to german homoeopathic pharmacopoeia (hab), regulation nos. 33 and 34 were evaluated. in the course of production, the extraction is accompanied by fermentation and the resulting preparation is stored for at least 6 months until  further processing. the present work aimed at revealing the underlying biochemical reactions during manufacture and storage. in addition, the responsible microorganisms were isolated and identified. to study the robustness  of the preparation method, formulation components as well as production conditions were varied. additionally, questions were addressed at the reproducibility of the method and a comparison with an ethanolic extract was also performed. from 2006 to 2009, 110 extracts from the fresh flowering herb of atropa belladonna var. belladonna (l.) were produced and analyzed. the results show that lactic acid bacteria (lab) are primarily involved in the fermentation process, mainly producing lactic acid besides acetic acid and ethanol. the homofermentative lactobacillus plantarum and the heterofermentative lactobacillus brevis were identified as predominant lactic acid bacteria. finally, factors for  a successful fermentation are proposed.

TI  == fermentation quality and chemical composition of shrub silage treated with lactic acid bacteria inoculants and cellulase additives.
AB  == effects of lactic acid bacteria (lab) inoculants and cellulase additives on fermentation quality and chemical compositions of shrub silages were studied by using a small-scale fermentation system. two lab inoculants of qingbao (lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus acidilacticii, lactobacillus casei and clostridium phage) and caihe (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis and pediococcus acidilactici) and a commercial cellulase made from trichoderma reesei were used as additives for intermediate pea-shrub, rush bushclover, arborescent ceratoides and shrubby silage preparation. the crude protein, neutral detergent fiber and water-soluble carbohydrate contents of the four shrub materials were 10.1-14.2, 62.6-67.2 and 1.9-3.5% on a dry matter basis, respectively. all shrub  silages had ph 3.40-4.43, ammonia-n 0.1-0.2% g/kg and lactic acid 1.3-2.9% on a fresh matter basis. the silage quality of lab-inoculated silages did not have a greater effect than control silages, except shrubby silage preparation. silages treated with the cellulase, the ph of rush bushclover and shrubby sweetvetch silage were significantly (p < 0.05) lower and the lactic acid content were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the control silages. the results confirmed that shrub contained a relatively high content of crude protein; its silages can  be preserved in good quality, and they are new potential resources for livestock  feed.

TI  == insights into the completely annotated genome of lactobacillus buchneri cd034, a  strain isolated from stable grass silage.
AB  == lactobacillus buchneri belongs to the group of heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria and is a common member of the silage microbiome. here we report the completely annotated genomic sequence of l. buchneri cd034, a strain isolated from stable grass silage. the whole genome of l. buchneri cd034 was sequenced on  the roche genome sequencer flx platform. it was found to consist of four replicons, a circular chromosome, and three plasmids. the circular chromosome was predicted to encode 2319 proteins and contains a genomic island and two prophages which significantly differ in g+c-content from the remaining chromosome. it possesses all genes for enzymes of a complete phosphoketolase pathway, whereas two enzymes necessary for glycolysis are lacking. this confirms the classification of l. buchneri cd034 as an obligate heterofermentative lactic acid bacterium. a set of genes considered to be involved in the lactate degradation pathway and genes putatively involved in the breakdown of plant cell wall polymers were identified. moreover, several genes encoding putative s-layer proteins and two crispr systems, belonging to the subclasses i-e and ii-a, are located on the chromosome. the largest plasmid pcd034-3 was predicted to encode 57 genes, including a putative polysaccharide synthesis gene cluster, whereas the functions of the two smaller plasmids, pcd034-1 and pcd034-2, remain cryptic. phylogenetic analysis based on sequence comparison of the conserved marker gene rpoa reveals that l. buchneri cd034 is more closely related to lactobacillus hilgardii strains than to lactobacillus brevis and lactobacillus plantarum strains. comparison of the l. buchneri cd034 core genome to other fully sequenced and closely related members of the genus lactobacillus disclosed a high degree of conservation between l. buchneri cd034 and the recently sequenced l. buchneri strain nrrl b-30929 and a more distant relationship to l. buchneri atcc 11577 and l. brevis ssp. gravesensis atcc 27305, which cluster together with l. hilgardii type strain atcc 8290. l. buchneri cd034 genome information will certainly provide the basis for further postgenome studies with the objective to optimize application of the strain in silage production.

TI  == fructooligosaccharides metabolism and effect on bacteriocin production in lactobacillus strains isolated from ensiled corn and molasses.
AB  == fructo- (fos) and galacto-oligosaccharides have been used to promote the growth of probiotics, mainly those from lactobacillus genus. however, only few reports have evaluated the effect of prebiotics on bacteriocins activity and production.  in this work, we characterized the effect of fos supplementation on the growth, lactic and acetic acids production, and antimicrobial activity of crude extracts  obtained from lactobacillus strains isolated from ensiled corn and molasses. seven out of 28 isolated lactobacillus, belonging to lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus brevis, showed antimicrobial activity  against listeria innocua. among them, the strain l. plantarum le5 showed antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes and enteroccocus faecalis;  while the l. plantarum le27 strain showed antimicrobial effect against l. monocytogenes, e. faecalis, escherichia coli and salmonella enteritidis. this antimicrobial activity in most of the cases was obtained only after fos supplementation. in summary, these results show the feasibility to increase the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus bacteriocins by supplementing the growth  medium with fos.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == changes in microbiota population during fermentation of narezushi as revealed by  pyrosequencing analysis.
AB  == modern japanese sushi is derived from an archetype, narezushi, which is made by the fermentation of salted fish with rice. several studies have demonstrated that lactic acid bacteria are dominantly present in narezushi, but no studies have addressed how microbial composition changes during fermentation. in this study, we examined changes in the microbial population in aji (horse mackerel)-narezushi during fermentation by pyrosequencing the 16s ribosomal rna gene (rdna). ribosomal database project classifier analysis revealed that among the 53 genera  present, the lactobacillus population drastically increased during fermentation,  while the populations of other bacteria remained unchanged. basic local alignment search tool analysis revealed that l. plantarum and l. brevis were the major species. comparison with other fermented food microbiota indicated high product-dependency of the bacterial composition, which might have been due to the starter-free fermentation process.

TI  == combination of culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular methods for the determination of lactic microbiota in sucuk.
AB  == in this study, the culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular methods were used for the identification of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in sucuk a turkish fermented dry sausage. on the one hand, the pcr-dgge method targetting the v1 and v3 regions of 16s dna was applied to dna that was directly extracted from sucuk samples. on the other hand, rep-pcr fingerprinting was performed for the primary  differentiation and grouping of the isolates, and the results were confirmed by sequencing of the 16s rdna and 16s-23s rdna intergenic spacer region. as a result of the pcr-dgge analysis of all the samples, total 8 different lactic acid bacteria were identified, and lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus curvatus and weissella viridescens were the dominant microbiota among these bacteria. the culture-dependent approach indicated that the majority of the strains belonged to the lactobacillus genera including lb. sakei, lactobacillus plantarum, lb. curvatus, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus farciminis and lactobacillus alimentarius. however, leuconostoc and weisella were also detected as minor genera. again, lactococcus piscium, weissella halotolerans, staphylococcus succinus and the comigrated staphylococcus piscifermentans/staphylococcus condimenti/staphylococcus carnosus group were detected only with the culture-independent method while lb. plantarum, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc citreum were identified only by using the culture-dependent method. in the results, it was concluded that the combination of culture-dependent and culture-independent methods was necessary for reliable and detailed investigation of lab communities in fermented food products.

AB  == beer quality can be compromised by the growth of certain lactobacilli, in particular lactobacillus brevis and lactobacillus plantarum, and various strategies have been used to control such bacterial spoilage. biocontrol by means of bacteriophage is a reemerging approach for the suppression of spoilage bacteria in food and beverage matrices. a virulent phage capable of infecting l.  brevis beer-spoilage strains was isolated and morphologically assessed by electron microscopy. the myophage sa-c12 was shown to be stable in beer and capable of controlling the growth of its host, l. brevis strain 56, in commercial beer. the results of this study indicate that bacteriophage-based treatments may  be used as an alternative and natural strategy for the control of bacterial contamination of beer.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the evolution of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts during the fermentation of tarhana produced with some pasteurised ingredients and carried out at 30 and 40 degrees c. the chemical parameters were those typical for tarhana production. coliform bacteria were not  detected during fermentation, while lab and yeasts were in the range 10(7)-10(8)  colony forming units (cfu) g(-1). plate counts showed an optimal development of both fermenting microbial groups and the differences in cell concentrations were  not significant (p > 0.05). lab were isolated during fermentation and grouped on  the basis of phenotypic and polymorphic characteristics. lab isolates were identified by a combined genetic approach consisting of 16s/23s rrna intergenic spacer region (its) and partial 16s rrna gene sequencing as pediococcus acidilactici, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus brevis. hence, the pasteurisation of the vegetable ingredients, excluded wheat flour, enhanced the hygienic conditions of tarhana without influencing the normal evolution of lab. however, the fermentation at 40 degrees c favoured pediococci, while the production at 30 degrees c was mainly characterised by lactobacilli. yeasts, identified by the restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) of the 5.8s its rrna gene, were mainly represented by the species saccharomyces cerevisiae in both productions.

TI  == lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species do not secrete protease that cleaves the muc2 mucin which organises the colon mucus.
AB  == the colon epithelium is covered by two layers of mucus built around the muc2 mucin. an inner dense and attached mucus layer does not allow bacteria to penetrate, thus keeping the epithelial cell surface free from bacteria. an outer  loose mucus layer is the habitat for the commensal bacterial microbiota. the inner mucus layer is renewed from the epithelial side and gets converted into the outer layer due to proteolytic cleavages by host proteases. we have now analysed  if potential probiotic bacteria, namely lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus and bifidobacterium lactis, can secrete protease that cleaves the muc2 mucin. we found that none of the potential probiotic bacteria lactobacillus and bifidobacterium could cleave the muc2 core protein in the form of recombinant muc2 n and c-termini although they secreted active proteases. this was in contrast to crude mixtures of oral and faecal bacteria that cleaved the muc2 mucin. this observation further supports the view  that these potential probiotic bacteria are of no harm to the host, as these bacteria cannot disrupt the mucin organised mucus as long as they are covered by  glycans.

TI  == dynamics of indigenous lactic acid bacteria populations in wine fermentations from la rioja (spain) during three vintages.
AB  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) species has been analyzed for three consecutive years (2006, 2007, and 2008) during alcoholic and malolactic fermentations of tempranillo wine in a winery at la rioja. the results showed differences in malolactic fermentation duration, and in both diversity of lab species and diversity of oenococcus oeni genotypes. o. oeni was shown to be the predominant species (73% of total isolates). monitoring the different strains of  o. oeni using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of chromosomal dna digested with sfii and apai allowed detection of a total of 37 distinct genotypes, most of them comprised at least two isolates. six appeared in more than one vintage, one of them being present in the three studied years. moreover, four genotypes were indistinct of the strains isolated from the air of this same winery in 2007 vintage. the frequency of participation of each genotype varied from year to year, thus dominant genotypes at one year were minority or not present at another year. this suggests that distinct indigenous o. oeni strains are better adapted to the different winery conditions every year. predominant genotypes that appeared in more than one vintage and lead to quality wines with low histamine contents could be considered as interesting for selecting of new malolactic starter cultures.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == low-diversity bacterial community in the gut of the fruitfly drosophila melanogaster.

TI  == partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by two lactobacilus strains with probiotic properties.
AB  == the probiotic characteristics of lactobacillus brevis bg18 and lb. plantarum bg33, isolated from traditional turkish tulum cheese were assessed. these two bacteriocinproducer strains exhibited good probiotic characteristics such as resistance in media containing 0.3% bile salt, pepsin (3 mg ml(-)(1)), and pancreatine (1 mg ml(-)(1)) as well as acid resistance at ph 2. they were also adhered to caco-2 epithelial cells in a manner comparable to escherichia coli lmg3083 (etec) and salmonella typhimurium sl1344. the strains produced a heat-stable antimicrobial compound that was shown to be proteinaceous in nature,  and therefore, referred to as bacteriocins. the bacteriocins were able to inhibit growth of a number grampositive bacteria such as listeria monocytogenes, clostridium botulinum, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus. tricine-sds-page of the active fraction resulted in single bands with estimated molecular masses of 2.5 kda and 2.7 kda for lb. brevis bg18 and lb. plantarum bg33 bacteriocins, respectively.

TI  == [comparative clinical efficacy of a probiotic vs. an antibiotic in the treatment  of patients with intestinal bacterial overgrowth and chronic abdominal functional distension: a pilot study].
AB  == introduction: patients with intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo) are usually treated with different antibiotics. certain probiotics have proved to be clinically effective in patients with abdominal distension. objective: to compare the short-term clinical efficacy of metronidazol vs. a probiotic in patients with sibo and functional chronic abdominal distension. patients and methods. this was  a randomized prospective pilot study. the study population consisted of 50 patients with chronic abdominal distension (rome iii criteria) and diagnosis of sibo made by a lactulose h2 breath test. patients were consecutively randomized to receive either metronidazol or a probiotic. the metronidazol group consisted of 25 subjects (23 women, median age 49 +/- 19 years old), who received metronidazol (flagyl), 500 mg bid for 5 days. the probiotic group consisted of 25 subjects (20 women, median age 58 +/- 19 years old). the probiotic administered to the latter group contained lactobacillus casei (3.3 x 10(7) ufc), lactobacillus plantarum (3.3 x 10(7) ufc), streptococcus faecalis (3.3 x 10(7) ufc) and bifidobacterium brevis (1.0 x 10(6) ufc) (bioflora) and 5 ml bid were administered for 5 days. both groups went on the same diet, which consisted in reduced consumption of alcohol, legumes, dairy products and leafy green vegetables. response to treatment was assessed by an independent questioner 15 days post treatment. a five-level overall response questionnaire was used. responses included much better, better, the same, worse, and much worse. better and much better were considered positive responses. results: thirteen (52%) subjects receiving metronidazol and 20 (82%) receiving the probiotic referred clinical improvement after the treatment. a statistically significant difference  favoured the use of the probiotic (p = 0.036). all the study patients completed treatment. no adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were observed.  conclusions: based on this pilot study results, we can suggest that the probiotic herein used has a higher efficacy than metronidazol in the early clinical response of patients with chronic abdominal distension and sibo.

TI  == an in vitro protocol for direct isolation of potential probiotic lactobacilli from raw bovine milk and traditional fermented milks.
AB  == a method for isolating potential probiotic lactobacilli directly from traditional milk-based foods was developed. the novel digestion/enrichment protocol was set up taking care to minimize the protective effect of milk proteins and fats and was validated testing three commercial fermented milks containing well-known probiotic lactobacillus strains. only probiotic bacteria claimed in the label were isolated from two out of three commercial fermented milks. the application of the new protocol to 15 raw milk samples and 6 traditional fermented milk samples made it feasible to isolate 11 potential probiotic lactobacillus strains  belonging to lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus vaginalis species. even though further analyses need to ascertain functional properties of these lactobacilli, the novel protocol set-up  makes it feasible to isolate quickly potential probiotic strains from traditional milk-based foods reducing the amount of time required by traditional procedures that, in addition, do not allow to isolate microorganisms occurring as sub-dominant populations.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic analyses of lactic acid bacteria in local fermented food, breast milk and faeces of mothers and their babies.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are generally accepted as beneficial to the host and their presence is directly influenced by ingestion of fermented food or probiotics. while the intestinal lactic microbiota is well-described knowledge on its routes of inoculation and competitiveness towards selective pressure shaping  the intestinal microbiota is limited. in this study, lab were isolated from faecal samples of breast feeding mothers living in syria, from faeces of their infants, from breast milk as well as from fermented food, typically consumed in syria. a total of 700 isolates were characterized by genetic fingerprinting with  random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) and identified by comparative 16s rdna sequencing and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) analyses. thirty six different species of lactobacillus, enterococcus, streptococcus, weissella and pediococcus were identified. rapd and maldi-tof-ms patterns allowed comparison of the lactic microbiota on species and strain level. whereas some species were unique for one  source, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus brevis were found in all sources. interestingly, identical rapd genotypes of l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis and p. pentosaceus were found in the faeces of mothers, her milk and in faeces of her babies. diversity of rapd types found in food versus human samples suggests the importance of host factors in colonization and individual host specificity, and support the hypothesis that there is a vertical  transfer of intestinal lab from the mother's gut to her milk and through the milk to the infant's gut.

TI  == novel pcr-based identification of weissella confusa using an aflp-derived marker.
AB  == an extensive use of weissella (w.) confusa is currently being made for the production of a variety of fermented foods and beverages although some strains of this species have emerged as opportunistic pathogens for humans and animals. nevertheless, no rapid methods are available for the reliable identification of w. confusa. we developed a novel pcr using aflp (amplified fragment length polymorphism)-derived primers for the rapid and unequivocal identification of w.  confusa. fluorescent aflp of 30 strains of w. confusa, leuconostoc citreum, lactobacillus (lb.) brevis, lb. rossiae, lb. plantarum and lb. buchneri allowed us to detect, purify and sequence several w. confusa specific aflp fragments. the homology search in blast of a 303 bp nucleotide sequence revealed a </= 77% identity of the purified fragment with the lepa gene of several lactic acid bacteria. a pcr assay targeting 225 bp of this fragment was developed and tested  against the dna of 109 strains, including 34 foodborne and clinical w. confusa and 75 strains of 47 phylogenetically closely and distantly related species, resulting in 100% specificity with a detection limit of 16 pg. being the first species-specific pcr to date developed for the rapid and unambiguous identification of w. confusa, this novel assay could be a reliable and efficient  tool for detecting w. confusa not only in food and beverages, but also in clinical specimens, thus contributing to clarify its real significance in human and animal infections.

TI  == characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  == the study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented foods in xi'an, china. lab strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of lactobacillus (n = 73), and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and s. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of lactobacillus. the erm(b) gene was detected from two strains of each of l. fermentum and l. vaginalis, and one strain of each of l. plantarum, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, l. animalis, and s. thermophilus. the tet genes were  identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. this is the first time, the authors identified tet(s) gene from l. brevis and l. kefiri. the  erm(b) gene from l. fermentum nwl24 and l. salivarius nwl33, and tet(m) gene from l. plantarum nwl22 and l. brevis nwl59 were successfully transferred to enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. it was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in xi'an, china and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria from musts and wines of three consecutive vintages of ribeira sacra.
AB  == aims: this study was designed to isolate and characterize the lactic acid microbiota of the musts and wines of a young denomination of origin area, ribeira sacra in north-west spain. methods and results: over three consecutive years (2007, 2008 and 2009), we examined musts and wines from four cellars in different zones of the region. through biochemical and genetic tests, 459 isolates of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were identified as the following species: lactobacillus alvei (0.7%), lactobacillus brevis (1.7%), lactobacillus frumenti (0.9%), lactobacillus kunkeei (12%), lactobacillus plantarum (6.5%), lactobacillus pentosus (0.9%), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (3%), leuconostoc citreum (0.7%), leuconostoc fructosum (synon. lactobacillus fructosum) (3.7%), leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides (2.8%), leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (0.2%), oenococcus oeni (59%), pediococcus parvulus (7%) and  weisella paramesenteroides (synon. leuconostoc paramesenteroides) (0.9%). of these species, o. oeni was the main one responsible for malolactic fermentation (mlf) in all cellars and years with the exception of lact. plantarum, predominant in 2007, in one cellar, and lact. brevis, lact. frumenti and ped. parvulus coexisting with o. oeni in one cellar in 2009. different strains (84) of lab species (14) were identified by biochemical techniques (api strips, the presence  of plasmids, enzyme activities and mlf performance) and molecular techniques (pcr). all assays were carried out with every one of the 459 isolates. to select  candidates for use as culture starters, we assessed malolactic, beta-glucosidase  and tannase activities, the presence of genes involved in biogenic amine production and plasmid content. conclusions: a high diversity of lab is present in the grape musts of ribeira sacra but few species are responsible for mlf; however, different strains of such species are involved in the process. as far as we are aware, this is the first report of lact. frumenti thriving in wine. significance and impact of the study: information on lab populations in must and  wine is presented. a large collection of well-characterized strains of lab are available as starter cultures to winemakers.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == protective effect of lactobacillus casei strain shirota against lethal infection  with multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 in mice.
AB  == aims: the anti-infectious activity of lactobacilli against multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 (dt104) was examined in a murine model of an opportunistic antibiotic-induced infection. methods and results: explosive intestinal growth and subsequent lethal extra-intestinal translocation  after oral infection with dt104 during fosfomycin (fom) administration was significantly inhibited by continuous oral administration of lactobacillus casei  strain shirota (lcs), which is naturally resistant to fom, at a dose of 10(8) colony-forming units per mouse daily to mice. comparison of the anti-salmonella activity of several lactobacillus type strains with natural resistance to fom revealed that lactobacillus brevis atcc 14869(t) , lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917(t) , lactobacillus reuteri jcm 1112(t) , lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469(t) and lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741(t) conferred no activity even when they obtained the high population levels almost similar to those of the effective strains such as lcs, lact. casei atcc 334(t) and lactobacillus zeae atcc 15820(t) . the increase in concentration of organic acids and maintenance of the lower ph in the intestine because of lactobacillus colonization were correlated with the anti-infectious activity. moreover, heat-killed lcs was not protective against the infection, suggesting that the metabolic activity of lactobacilli is important for the anti-infectious activity. conclusion: these results suggest that certain lactobacilli in combination with antibiotics may be  useful for prophylaxis against opportunistic intestinal infections by multi-drug  resistant pathogens, such as dt104. significance and impact of the study: antibiotics such as fom disrupt the metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiota that produce organic acids, and that only probiotic strains that are metabolically active in vivo should be selected to prevent intestinal infection when used clinically in combination with certain antibiotics.

AB  == mezcal is an alcoholic beverage obtained from the distillation of fermented juices of cooked agave spp. plant stalks (agave must), and each region in mexico  with denomination of origin uses defined agave species to prepare mezcal with unique organoleptic characteristics. during fermentation to produce mezcal in the state of tamaulipas, not only alcohol-producing yeasts are involved, but also a lactic acid bacterial community that has not been characterized yet. in order to  address this lack of knowledge on this traditional mexican beverage, we performed a dgge-16s rrna analysis of the lactic acid bacterial diversity and metabolite accumulation during the fermentation of a typical agave must that is rustically produced in san carlos county (tamaulipas, mexico). the analysis of metabolite production indicated a short but important malolactic fermentation stage not previously described for mezcal. the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis of the 16s rrna genes showed a distinctive lactic acid bacterial  community composed mainly of pediococcus parvulus, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus composti, lactobacillus parabuchneri, and lactobacillus plantarum.  some atypical genera such as weissella and bacillus were also found in the residual must. our results suggest that the lactic acid bacteria could strongly be implicated in the organoleptic attributes of this traditional mexican distilled beverage.

TI  == a ready-to-use antifungal starter culture improves the shelf life of packaged bread.
AB  == fungal spoilage is the main cause of economic loss in the baking industry. in this study, we developed a ready-to-use biopreserver (slurry [sl]) for nonsliced  packed bread by using selected antifungal lactic acid bacteria (lab) and low-cost ingredients that are compatible with the food matrix. four lab strains (lactobacillus brevis crl 772, l. brevis crl 796, l. plantarum crl 778, and l. reuteri crl 1100) tested in bread preservation were able to inhibit penicillium sp. growth and lengthen shelf life twofold with respect to breads prepared using  only saccharomyces cerevisiae (2 days shelf life). the best biopreservation effect (5 days shelf life) was obtained with 40% antifungal slurry sl778 containing l. plantarum crl 778; this was as effective as 0.2% calcium propionate (pca). the antifungal effect of sl778 was related to the synthesis of acetic and  phenyllactic acid as well as lactic acid, which was produced at a high concentration (31.2 mmol/kg) and lowered the ph of the dough, favoring the undissociated fraction of the organic acids. the combination of the starter sl778 with 0.4% pca extended the shelf life of packaged bread to 24 days, 2.6-fold longer than breads prepared with only 0.4% pca.

TI  == how three adventitious lactic acid bacteria affect proteolysis and organic acid production in model portuguese cheeses manufactured from several milk sources and two alternative coagulants.
AB  == model cheeses were manufactured according to a full factorial experimental design to help shed light on the individual and combined roles played by 3 native lactic acid bacteria (lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, lactobacillus brevis, and lactobacillus plantarum) upon proteolysis and organic acid evolution in cheese. the model cheeses were manufactured according to a generally representative portuguese artisanal protocol, but the (ubiquitous) adventitious microflora in the cheesemaking milk were removed via sterilization before manufacture; therefore, the specific effects of only those lactic acid bacteria selected were  monitored. in addition, 2 types of coagulant (animal and plant) and 3 types of cheesemaking milk (cow, sheep, and goat) were assessed to determine their influence on the final characteristics of the model cheeses. the nature of the coagulant appeared to be essential during the first stage of proteolysis as expected, whereas the contribution of those bacteria to the pools of total free aa and organic acids was crucial afterward. this was especially so in terms of the differences observed in the metabolisms of lactic acid (in the case of lactococcus spp.) as well as acetic and citric acids (in the case of lactobacillus spp.).

TI  == inhibition of herpes simplex virus type 2 by vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  == the protective effect of selected vaginal lactobacillus strains (l. brevis cd2, l. salivarius fv2, l. plantarum fv9) towards herpes simplex virus type 2 (hsv-2)  infection in vitro has been analyzed. living bacterial cells affect different steps of virus multiplication. the effect on the early phases of virus infection  appeared related to the bacterial adhesive potential to the cell membrane while all the strains strongly reduced intracellular events of virus multiplication. the anti hsv-2 activity was not mediated by a virucidal effect. instead it was exerted through bacterial soluble factors able to down regulate the production of infective virions. in fact hsv-2 yield was significantly reduced in infected cells fed with cell-free supernatants of lactobacilli grown in cell culture medium. purified lactic acid and h(2)o(2), lactobacillus metabolites with known antimicrobial activity, produced a dose-dependent virucidal effect. lactic acid successfully interfered with viral intracellular antigen synthesis and both the virucidal activity and the inhibition of replication were correlated to acidic ph values. l. brevis cd2, the most active strain, does not produce h(2)o(2) and neutralized lactic acid had no effect, thus indicating that factors other than h(2)o(2) and lactic acid could be responsible for the antiviral effect.

TI  == gene cloning, expression, and characterization of phenolic acid decarboxylase from lactobacillus brevis rm84.
AB  == phenolic acid decarboxylase (pad) catalyzes the synthesis of vinyl phenols from hydroxycinnamic acids. the gene encoding pad from lactobacillus brevis was cloned and expressed as a fusion protein in escherichia coli. the recombinant pad enzyme is a heat-labile enzyme that functions optimally at 22 degrees c and ph 6.0. the  purified enzyme did not show thermostability at temperatures above 22 degrees c.  l. brevis pad is able to decarboxylate exclusively the hydroxycinnamic acids, such as p-coumaric, caffeic, and ferulic acids, with k (m) values of 0.98, 0.96,  and 0.78 mm, respectively. the substrate specificity exhibited by l. brevis pad is similar to the pad isolated from bacillus subtilis and b. pumilus, but different from that of l. plantarum and pediococcus pentosaceus. as the c-terminal region may be involved in determining pad substrate specificity and catalytic capacity, amino acid differences among these proteins could explain the differences observed. the substrate specificity shown by l. brevis pad shows promise for the synthesis of high-added value products from plant wastes.

TI  == probiotic table olives: microbial populations adhering on olive surface in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in an industrial plant.
AB  == this study reports the dynamics of microbial populations adhering on the surface  of debittered green olives cv. bella di cerignola in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in different brining conditions (4% and 8% (w/v) nacl) at room temperature and 4 degrees c. the probiotic strain successfully colonized the olive surface dominating the natural  lab population and decreasing the ph of brines to <or=5.0 after 30 days until the end of fermentation. the dynamics of microbial populations associated with olive  surface and belonging to the different groups indicated that inoculated olives held at room temperature did not host enterobacteriaceae at the end of fermentation. yeast populations were present in a low number (<or=log(10) 5.7 cfu/g) throughout the process. a considerable genetic diversity of lab species colonizing the olive surface was found mainly in inoculated set brined in 8% nacl, as indicated by the shannon diversity index calculated for each set. generally, strains of lactobacillus coryniformis, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l.  pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. brevis, l. mali, l. vaccinostercus, l.casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, weissella paramesenteroides, w. cibaria, enterococcus casseliflavus group and e.  italicus were identified during the whole process. in particular, l. pentosus was the most frequently isolated species and it showed a high strain diversity throughout fermentation in all processes except for the one held at 4 degrees c.  also a notable incidence of leuc. mesenteroides on olives was highlighted in this study during all fermentation. results indicated that the human strain l. paracasei impc2.1 can be considered an example of a strain used in the dual role  of starter and probiotic culture which allowed the control of fermentation processes and the realization of a final probiotic product with functional appeal.

TI  == distribution of aminogenic activity among potential autochthonous starter cultures for dry fermented sausages.
AB  == any bacterial strain to be used as starter culture should have suitable characteristics, including a lack of amino acid decarboxylase activity. in this study, the decarboxylase activity of 76 bacterial strains, including lactic acid  bacteria and gram-positive, catalase-positive cocci, was investigated. these strains were previously isolated from european traditional fermented sausages to  develop autochthonous starter cultures. of all the strains tested, 48% of the lactic acid bacteria strains and 13% of gram-positive, catalase-positive cocci decarboxylated one or more amino acids. aminogenic potential was strain dependent, although some species had a higher proportion of aminogenic strains than did others. thus, all lactobacillus curvatus strains and 70% of lactobacillus brevis strains had the capacity to produce tyramine and beta-phenylethylamine. some strains also produced other aromatic amines, such as  tryptamine and the diamines putrescine and cadaverine. all the enterococcal strains tested were decarboxylase positive, producing high amounts of tyramine and considerable amounts of beta-phenylethylamine. none of the staphylococcal strains had tyrosine-decarboxylase activity, but some produced other amines. from the aminogenic point of view, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, and staphylococcus xylosus strains would be the most suitable for use as autochthonous starter cultures for traditional fermented sausages.

TI  == characterization of a novel lysm domain from lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the endolysin lyb5, from lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phipyb5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. sequence analysis revealed that the c terminus of the endolysin lyb5 (ly5c) contained three putative lysin motif (lysm) repeat regions, implying that  ly5c was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. to investigate the potential of ly5c for surface display, green fluorescent protein (gfp) was fused to ly5c at its n or c terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in escherichia coli. after being mixed with various cells in vitro, gfp was successfully displayed on the surfaces of lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lb. brevis, lb. plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lb. helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus cells. increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated l. lactis and lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for ly5c. moreover, the ph and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of gfp-ly5c, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. all results suggested that ly5c was  a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (lab). to demonstrate the applicability of the ly5c-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) from paenibacillus sp. strain k1, replacing gfp, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of lab cells via ly5c. the success in surface display of gfp and beta-gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in  lab.

TI  == characterization of a cryptic plasmid pd403 from lactobacillus plantarum and construction of shuttle vectors based on its replicon.
AB  == a cryptic plasmid pd403 was isolated from lactobacillus plantarum d403 derived from fermented dairy products. it was 2,791 bp in size with a g+c content of 37%. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed two open reading frames, orf1 and orf2. orf1 (318 amino acids) was identified as a replication protein (repa). orf2 (137  amino acids) shared 31% similarity with the transcriptional regulator of ralstonia pickettii 12d. functional investigation indicated that orf2 (tra) had the ability of improving the transformation efficiency. the origin of replication was predicted, suggesting that pd403 was a rolling-circle-replication (rcr) plasmid. an escherichia coli/lactobacillus shuttle vector pcd4032 was constructed based on the pd403 replicon, and proved to be successfully transformed into various lactobacilli including lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus brevis. the transformation efficiencies were ranged from 1.3 x 10(2) to 7 x 10(4) transformants per microgram dna. furthermore, an expression vector pcd4033 was developed with the promoter of the lactate dehydrogenase from lactobacillus delbrueckii 11842. the green fluorescent protein (gfp) as a reporter was expressed successfully in various lactobacilli tested, suggesting that the expression vector pcd4033 had the potential to be used as a molecular tool for heterologous gene cloning and expression in lactobacilli.

TI  == genetic screening of wine-related enzymes in lactobacillus species isolated from  south african wines.
AB  == aims: the objective of this study was to investigate the presence of genes coding for enzymes of oenological relevance in wine lactobacillus strains isolated from  south african grape and wine samples during the 2001 and 2002 harvest seasons. methods and results: a total of 120 wine lactobacilli isolates belonging to lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus hilgardii, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus sakei and lactobacillus paraplantarum were genetically screened for enzyme-encoding genes using pcr with primers specific for beta-glucosidase, protease, esterase, citrate lyase and phenolic acid decarboxylase. the results of pcr screening showed that the lactobacillus strains possessed different combinations of enzymes and that some strains did not possess any of the enzymes tested. confirmation analysis with gene sequencing also showed high similarity of genes with those available in genbank database. conclusion: in this study, we have demonstrated the existence of genes coding for wine-related enzymes in wine lactobacilli that could potentially hydrolyse wine precursors to positively influence wine aroma. significance and impact of the study: an expansion of knowledge on the genetic diversity of wine-associated lactic acid bacteria will enable the selection of novel malolactic fermentation starter cultures with desired oenological traits for the improvement of the organoleptic quality of the wine, and hence wine aroma.

TI  == isolation and basic characterization of a beta-glucosidase from a strain of lactobacillus brevis isolated from a malolactic starter culture.
AB  == aims: to study glycosidase activities of a lactobacillus brevis strain and to isolate an intracellular beta-glucosidase from this strain. methods and results:  lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from a commercially available starter culture preparation for malolactic fermentation were tested for beta-glycosidase activities. a strain of lact. brevis showing high intracellular beta-d-glucosidase, beta-d-xylosidase and alpha-l-arabinosidase activities was selected for purification and characterization of its beta-glucosidase. the pure  glucosidase from lact. brevis has also side activities of xylosidase, arabinosidase and cellobiosidase. it is a homotetramer of 330 kda and has an isoelectric point at ph 3.5. the k(m) for p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside and p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-xylopyranoside is 0.22 and 1.14 mmol l(-1), respectively. the beta-glucosidase activity was strongly inhibited by gluconic acid delta-lactone, partially by glucose and gluconate, but not by fructose. ethanol and methanol were found to increase the activity up to twofold. the free  enzyme was stable at ph 7.0 (t(1/2) = 50 day) but not at ph 4.0 (t(1/2) = 4 days). conclusions: the beta-glucosidase from lact. brevis is widely different to that characterized from lactobacillus casei (coulon et al. 1998) and lactobacillus plantarum (sestelo et al. 2004). the high tolerance to fructose and ethanol, the low inhibitory effect of glucose on the enzyme activity and the good long-term stability could be of great interest for the release of aroma compounds during winemaking. significance and impact of the study: although the release of  aroma compounds by lab has been demonstrated by several authors, little information exists on the responsible enzymes. this study contains the first characterization of an intracellular beta-glucosidase isolated from a wine-related strain of lact. brevis.

TI  == biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in french wheat sourdough as determined by molecular characterization using species-specific pcr.
AB  == the lactic acid microflora of nine traditional wheat sourdoughs from the midi-pyrenees area (south western france) was previously isolated and preliminary characterized using conventional morphological and biochemical analysis. however, such phenotypic methods alone are not always reliable and have a low taxonomic resolution for identification of lactic acid bacteria species. in the present study, a total of 290 lab isolates were identified by pcr amplification using different sets of specific primers in order to provide a thorough characterization of the lactic flora from these traditional french sourdoughs. overall, the lab isolates belonged to 6 genera: lactobacillus (39%, 8 species), pediococcus (38%, 1 species), leuconostoc (17%, 2 species), weissella (4%, 2 species), lactococcus (1%, 1 species) and enterococcus (<1%, 1 species) and 15 different species were detected: l. plantarum, l. curvatus, l. paracasei, l. sanfranciscensis, l. pentosus, l. paraplantarum, l. sakei, l. brevis, p. pentosaceus, l. mesenteroides, l. citreum, w. cibaria, w. confusa, l. lactis and  e. hirae. facultative heterofermentative lab represent more than 76% of the total isolates, the main species isolated herein correspond to l. plantarum and p. pentosaceus. obligate heterofermentative lactobacilli (l. sanfranciscencis, l. brevis) represent less than 3% of the total isolates whereas leuconostoc and weissella species represent 21% of the total isolates and have been detected in eight of the nine samples. detection of some lab species was preferentially observed depending on the isolation culture medium. the number of different species within a sourdough varies from 3 to 7 and original associations of hetero- and homofermentative lab species have been revealed. results from this study clearly confirm the diversity encountered in the microbial community of traditional sourdough and highlight the importance of lab cocci in the sourdough  ecosystem, along with lactobacilli.

TI  == main microorganisms involved in the fermentation of ugandan ghee.
AB  == ghee is widely produced from a traditional fermented butter-like product named mashita in western uganda. however, no detailed studies have been done to identify the microorganisms involved in mashita fermentation. the aim of this study was to identify the microorganisms present at the end of mashita ripening using culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. the most commonly identified species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in mashita using culture-dependent techniques were lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus perolens constituting 37.3%, 10.1%, 8.1% and 7.7% of total bacterial colonies isolated respectively. l. paracasei was the only bacterial species identified in all mashita samples by culture-dependent technique. two of the four most commonly isolated lab species (l. helveticus and l. plantarum) were also identified in mashita by a culture-independent method (pcr-dgge). other main lab species identified in mashita by pcr-dgge were bifidobacterium sp., enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus acetotolerans, lactobacillus sp., lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and streptococcus salivarius. the main species of acetic acid bacteria (aab) identified in the mashita using pcr-dgge method were acetobacter aceti, acetobacter lovaniensis, acetobacter orientalis and acetobacter pasteurianus. pcr-dgge identification of yeasts showed that brettanomyces custersianus, candida silvae, geotrichum sp., issatchenkia occidentalis, issatchenkia orientalis, kluyveromyces marxianus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and trichosporon asahii were main yeast species in mashita. a. lovaniensis, a. aceti, and i. orientalis were identified in all the six mashita samples analyzed using pcr-dgge method. other microbial species were only found in some samples. these results indicate that lab and yeasts, as in similar fermentation products, but also aab are main microbial groups involved in mashita fermentation.

TI  == bacterial community associated with ensilage process of wilted guinea grass.
AB  == aims: to determine the effects of wilting, storage period and bacterial inoculant on the bacterial community and ensiling fermentation of guinea grass silage. methods and results: fermentation products, colony counts and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) profiles were determined. there was more lactic acid than acetic acid in all silages, but the lactic acid to acetic acid ratio decreased with storage time. this shift from lactic to acetic acid was not prevented even with a combination of wilting and bacterial inoculant. the dgge analyses suggest that facultatively heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis and lactobacillus pentosus) were involved in the shift to acetic acid fermentation. conclusions: lactic acid can dominate the fermentation in tropical grass silage with sufficient wilting prior  to ensiling. prolonged storage may lead to high levels of acetic acid without distinctive changes in the bacterial community. significance and impact of the study: the bacterial community looks stable compared to fermentation products over the course of long storage periods in tropical grass silage. acetic acid fermentation in tropical grass silage can be a result of the changes in bacterial metabolism rather than community structure.

TI  == characterization of four plasmids harboured in a lactobacillus brevis strain encoding a novel bacteriocin, brevicin 925a, and construction of a shuttle vector for lactic acid bacteria and escherichia coli.
AB  == in this study we isolated over 250 lactic acid bacteria (lab) candidates from fruit, flowers, vegetables and a fermented food to generate an lab library. one strain, designated 925a, isolated from kimchi (a traditional korean fermented dish made from chinese cabbage) produced a novel type of bacteriocin, brevicin 925a, which is effective against certain lab, including strains of lactobacillus, enterococcus, streptococcus, bacillus and listeria. strain 925a, identified as lactobacillus brevis, harboured at least four plasmids and we determined the entire nucleotide sequence of each one. the four plasmids were designated plb925a01-04, and have molecular sizes of 1815, 3524, 8881 and 65 037 bp, respectively. we obtained bacteriocin non-producing derivatives by treatment of strain 925a with novobiocin. all of these derivatives, which were susceptible to  their own antibacterial product, lost the largest plasmid, plb925a04, suggesting  that the genes for bacteriocin biosynthesis (breb and brec) and immunity (bree) are located on plb925a04. the partial amino acid sequence of purified brevicin 925a and sequence analysis of plb925a04 showed that breb is the structural gene for brevicin 925a. we constructed a shuttle vector (ples003, 6134 bp) that can replicate in both escherichia coli and lab such as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus hilgardii and enterococcus hirae. to determine the function of gene bree, which displays no significant similarity  to any other sequences in the blast search database, the gene was inserted into ples003. a plb925a04-cured derivative transformed with ples003 carrying bree acquired immunity to brevicin 925a, suggesting that bree encodes an immunity protein.

AB  == the potential to produce volatile phenols from hydroxycinnamic acids was investigated for lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from spanish grape must and  wine. a pcr assay was developed for the detection of lab that potentially produce volatile phenols. synthetic degenerate oligonucleotides for the specific detection of the pdc gene encoding a phenolic acid decarboxylase were designed. the pdc pcr assay amplifies a 321 bp dna fragment from phenolic acid decarboxylase. the pdc pcr method was applied to 85 strains belonging to the 6 main wine lab species. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and pediococcus pentosaceus strains produce a positive response in the pdc pcr assay, whereas oenococcus oeni, lactobacillus hilgardii, and leuconostoc mesenteroides strains did not produce the expected pcr product. the production of vinyl and ethyl derivatives from hydroxycinnamic acids in culture media was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. a relationship was found between pdc pcr  amplification and volatile phenol production, so that the lab strains that gave a positive pdc pcr response produce volatile phenols, whereas strains that did not  produce a pcr amplicon did not produce volatile phenols. the proposed method could be useful for a preliminary identification of lab strains able to produce volatile phenols in wine.

TI  == taxonomic structure and monitoring of the dominant population of lactic acid bacteria during wheat flour sourdough type i propagation using lactobacillus sanfranciscensis starters.
AB  == the structure and stability of the dominant lactic acid bacterium population were assessed during wheat flour sourdough type i propagation by using singly nine strains of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis. under back-slopping propagation with wheat flour type 0 f114, cell numbers of presumptive lactic acid bacteria varied  slightly between and within starters. as determined by randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr and restriction endonuclease analysis-pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analyses, only three (ls8, ls14, and ls44) starters dominated throughout 10 days of propagation. the others progressively decreased to less than 3 log cfu g(-1). partial sequence analysis of the 16s rrna and reca genes and pcr-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis analysis using the rpob gene allowed identification of weissella confusa, lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rossiae, lactobacillus brevis, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus, and lactobacillus spp. as the dominant species of the raw wheat flour. at the end of propagation, one autochthonous strain of l. sanfranciscensis was found in all the sourdoughs. except for l. brevis, strains of the above species were variously found in the mature sourdoughs. persistent starters were found in association with other biotypes of l. sanfranciscensis and with w. confusa or l. plantarum. sourdoughs were characterized for acidification, quotient of fermentation, free amino acids, and community-level catabolic profiles by using biolog 96-well eco microplates. in particular, catabolic profiles of sourdoughs containing persistent starters behaved similarly and were clearly differentiated from the others. the three persistent starters were further used for the production of sourdoughs and propagated by using another wheat flour whose lactic acid bacterium population in part differed from the previous one. also, in this case all three starter strains persisted during propagation.

TI  == rapid differentiation of lactic acid bacteria from autochthonous fermentation of  iberian dry-fermented sausages.
AB  == the populations of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in different types of iberian dry-fermented sausages from central-west spain were identified. a simple and rapid electrophoretic method of whole-cell protein profiles was evaluated, correlating it with 16s rrna gene sequence analysis and biochemical identification by api 50 chl. a total of 96 isolates were identified by sds-page  showing stable profiles corresponding to 30-45 polypeptides in the range 95-8kda  that were clearly different for the different species and were grouped with those of the 9 reference strains used in this study. the sds-page method showed that the predominant species were pediococcus acidilactici (48%) followed by lactobacillus plantarum (23%) and lactobacillus brevis (18%). the identifications obtained by this approach were confirmed by sequencing the v2-v3 region of the 16s rrna gene and by a blast search of the genbank database. however, biochemical identifications by api 50 chl showed different errors at the genus and species level. in sum, the sds-page analysis showed itself to be a rapid and accurate differentiation method for the most commonly encountered lab isolates in dry-fermented sausages.

TI  == microbial diversity of traditional vietnamese alcohol fermentation starters (banh men) as determined by pcr-mediated dgge.
AB  == the diversity of fungi and bacteria associated with traditional vietnamese alcohol fermentation starters (banh men) was investigated by pcr-mediated dgge. from 52 starter samples, 13 species of fungi (including yeasts) and 23 species of bacteria were identified. the fungal composition of the starters was consistent with little variation among samples. it consisted of amylase producers (rhizopus  oryzae, r. microsporus, absidia corymbifera, amylomyces sp., saccharomycopsis fibuligera), ethanol producers (saccharomyces cerevisiae, issatchenkia sp., pichia anomala, candida tropicalis, p. ranongensis, clavispora lusitaniae), and (opportunistic) contaminants (xeromyces bisporus, botryobasidium subcoronatum). the bacterial microflora of starters was highly variable in species composition and dominated by lactic acid bacteria (lab). the most frequent lab were pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus plantarum, l. brevis, weissella confusa, and w. paramesenteroides. species of amylase-producing bacillus (bacillus subtilis, b. circulans, b. amyloliquefaciens, b. sporothermodurans), acetic acid  bacteria (acetobacter orientalis, a. pasteurianus), and plant pathogens/environment contaminants (burkholderia ubonensis, ralstonia solanacearum, pelomonas puraquae) were also detected. fungal dgge was found to be useful for evaluating starter type and starter quality. moreover, in view of the  high biological diversity of these substrates, bacterial dgge may be useful in determining the identity of a starter. the constant occurrence of opportunistic contaminants highlights the need for careful examination of the role of individual components in starters.

TI  == biodiversity of the microbial community in a spanish farmhouse cheese as revealed by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == the microbial diversity within alberquilla cheese, made from a spontaneously fermented mixture of raw goats' and sheep's milk in the alpujarra mountains (granada, south-east spain), has been studied by the classical culturing method and also by molecular analysis of community dna. a collection of 206 isolates was obtained from the cheese on different selective/differential media, which were then re-grouped to 52 after randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analyses. isolates on man-rogosa and sharpe-agar (mrs), m17-glucose agar and kenner fecal (kf)-agar medium were identified by specific pcr or 16s rrna gene sequencing and belonged mainly to the lactic-acid bacteria group. the predominant genus was lactobacillus, which accounted for more than 50% of the isolates, the most abundant species being lactobacillus paracasei, followed by considerably less quantities of lb. plantarum and lb. brevis. other lactic-acid bacteria identified were pediococcus urinaequi, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuc. mesenteroides, lactococcus lactis and even the enterococci enterococcus faecium and e. devriesei. cluster analyses of rapd-pcr patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among the lactobacilli. the gram-negative bacterial strains belonged mainly to hafnia alvei species. the microbes occurring in alberquilla cheese were also studied by pcr temporal temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge) of the 16s rrna v3 region and partial 16s rrna sequencing of the ttge bands. the results showed a major presence of lactic-acid bacteria closely related to lc. lactis, lb. paracasei, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. acidophilus and enterococcus sp. the non-lactic-acid bacterium detected was identified as escherichia coli. all the enterococcus strains showed great susceptibility to the most clinically relevant antibiotics, harbouring only the virulence gene efaafm.  on the basis of their antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes we chose two strains of ln. mesenteroides that produced mesenterocin b105 and mesenterocin y105, as revealed by pcr techniques.

TI  == functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
AB  == this paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. the organisms previously identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. fermentum, lb. acidophilus, pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc dextranicum and saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as  mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees c) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). the ph fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with lb. plantarum; 4.37 in l. dextranicum+s.  cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. significant differences (p <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels  (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among ph and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic a. flavus. the findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.

TI  == diversity of predominant lactic acid bacteria associated with cocoa fermentation  in nigeria.
AB  == the fermentation of cocoa relies on a complex succession of bacteria and filamentous fungi, all of which can have an impact on cocoa flavor. so far, few investigations have focused on the diversity of lactic acid bacteria involved in  cocoa fermentation, and many earlier investigations did not rely on polyphasic taxonomical approaches, which take both phenotypic and genotypic characterization techniques into account. in our study, we characterized predominant lactic acid bacteria from cocoa fermentations in nigeria, using a combination of phenotypic tests, repetitive extragenic palindromic pcr, and sequencing of the 16s rrna gene of representative strains for accurate species identification. thus, of a total of 193 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains isolated from common media used to cultivate lab, 40 (20.7%) were heterofermentative and consisted of either l. brevis or l. fermentum strains. the majority of the isolates were homofermentative rods (110 strains; 57% of isolates) which were characterized as  l. plantarum strains. the homofermentative cocci consisted predominantly of 35 (18.1% of isolates) pediococcus acidilactici strains. thus, the lab populations derived from these media in this study were accurately described. this can contribute to the further assessment of the effect of common lab strains on the flavor characteristics of fermenting cocoa in further studies.

AB  == this work was aimed at decreasing the glycaemic index (gi) of white wheat bread.  breads made with wheat flour (wf) or wholemeal flour (wmf) and fermented with baker's yeast had similar values of resistant starch (rs; 1.4-1.7 %, starch basis). sourdough lactobacillus plantarum p1 and lactobacillus brevis p2 favoured the highest formation of rs (approximately 5 %) when fermented with wf and wmf. the mixture (1:1) of wf and wmf (wf/wmf) was selected. the effect of dietary fibres, chemical or sourdough acidification on the hydrolysis index (hi) of wf/wmf bread was determined. among fibres, only the addition of oat fibre (5 %) decreased the hi to 90.84 %. lactic acid determined the lowest hi, and the effect was related to the decrease of ph. for the same decrease of ph, breads fermented  with l. plantarum p1 and l. brevis p2 (sourdough wf/wmf) showed values of hi lower than chemical acidification. the glucose response and gi of wf bread or sourdough wf/wmf bread enriched with oat fibre was determined by using fifteen healthy volunteers. anhydrous glucose was used as reference. the area under the glucose response curve and the value of gi (72 %) of wf bread were significantly  (p < 0.05) higher than sourdough wf/wmf bread enriched with oat fibre (gi = 53.7  %). the decrease of gi of the sourdough wf/wmf bread may be due to both fibre content and decreased ph. compared to wmf bread, sourdough wf/wmf bread, enriched with oat fibre, had higher specific volume, better cell crumb structure and more  appreciated acidulous smell, taste and aroma.

TI  == increased internal and external bacterial load during drosophila aging without life-span trade-off.
AB  == the role of microbial load during aging of the adult fruit fly drosophila melanogaster is incompletely understood. here we show dramatic increases in aerobic and anaerobic bacterial load during aging, both inside the body and on the surface. scanning electron microscopy and cell staining analyses of the surface of aged flies detected structures resembling abundant small bacteria and  bacterial biofilms. bacteria cultured from laboratory flies included aerobic species acetobacter aceti, acetobacter tropicalis, and acetobacter pasteurianus and anaerobic species lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus sp. mr-2; lactobacillus homohiochii, lactobacillus fructivorans, and lactobacillus brevis were identified by dna sequencing. reducing bacterial load and antimicrobial peptide gene expression by axenic culture or antibiotics had no effect on life span. we conclude that drosophila can tolerate a significant bacterial load and mount a large innate immune response without a detectable trade-off with life span; furthermore, microbes do not seem to limit life span under optimized laboratory conditions.

TI  == cell-cell communication in sourdough lactic acid bacteria: a proteomic study in lactobacillus sanfranciscensis cb1.
AB  == the mechanisms of cell-cell communication in lactobacillus sanfranciscensis cb1 were studied. the highest number of dead/damaged cells of l. sanfranciscensis cb1 was found in cocultures with lactobacillus plantarum dc400 or lactobacillus brevis cr13 when the late stationary phase of growth (18 h) was reached. 2-de analysis was carried out. almost the same proteins were induced in all three cocultures at the mid-exponential phase of growth (7 h). the number of induced proteins markedly increased at 18 h, especially when l. sanfranciscensis cb1 was  cocultured with l. plantarum dc400 or l. brevis cr13. nineteen overexpressed proteins were identified. these proteins had a central role in stress response mechanisms and luxs-mediated signalling was involved in the regulation of most of them. the luxs and metf genes were partially sequenced in l. sanfranciscensis cb1. rt-pcr showed that the expression of luxs gene decreased from 7 to 12 h. it  was highest in cocultures with l. plantarum dc400 and l. brevis cr13. 2(3h)dihydrofuranone-5ethyl and 2(3h)dihydrofuranone-5pentyl were identified as presumptive signalling molecules when l. sanfranciscensis cb1 was cocultured with l. brevis cr13 and, especially, l. plantarum dc400. the synthesis of other volatile compounds and peptidase activities were also influenced by the type of microbial cocultures.

TI  == evidence for in vitro anti-genotoxicity of cheese non-starter lactobacilli.
AB  == the inhibition of direct acting dna reactive agents by 63 non-starter lactobacilli isolated from raw ewes milk cheeses was examined by short-term assay (sos-chromotest) and compared with already characterized starter lactobacilli. the screening revealed strains active against the nitroarene 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (nqo) and the alkylating agent n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng) in different species of the genus lactobacillus (l. rhamnosus, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. brevis, lactobacillus spp.). it was proved that the anti-genotoxicity was strain-dependent, and always  associated with spectroscopic modification of genotoxins. the frequency of strains inhibiting nitroarene genotoxicity was comparable for non-starter and starter lactobacilli, whereas inhibition of the alkylating agent was largely predominant in non-starter isolates. seventeen strains presented inhibitory activity against both genotoxins. dna rapd-pcr performed with m13, pro-up and rpo2 primers on the lactobacilli under examination showed genetic diversity in these strains. the non-starter isolates clustered in seven groups and the strains presenting a high degree of activity against 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide clustered in a single group with a similarity around 75%. interestingly, the strains with anti-genotoxic properties also showed acid-bile tolerance, indicating that the autochthonous lactobacilli which survive cheese ripening may also reach the gut as viable cells and could prevent genotoxin dna damage to enterocytes, as is desirable for probiotic bacteria.

TI  == population dynamics and metabolite target analysis of lactic acid bacteria during laboratory fermentations of wheat and spelt sourdoughs.
AB  == four laboratory sourdough fermentations, initiated with wheat or spelt flour and  without the addition of a starter culture, were prepared over a period of 10 days with daily back-slopping. samples taken at all refreshment steps were used for determination of the present microbiota. furthermore, an extensive metabolite target analysis of more than 100 different compounds was performed through a combination of various chromatographic methods including liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. the establishment of a stable microbial ecosystem occurred through a three-phase evolution within a week, as revealed by both microbiological and metabolite analyses. strains of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus rossiae, lactobacillus brevis, and lactobacillus paraplantarum were dominating some of the sourdough ecosystems. although the heterofermentative l. fermentum was dominating one of the wheat sourdoughs, all other sourdoughs were dominated by a combination of obligate and facultative heterofermentative taxa. strains of homofermentative species were not retrieved in the stable sourdough ecosystems. concentrations of sugar and amino acid metabolites hardly changed during the last days of fermentation. besides lactic acid, ethanol, and mannitol, the production of succinic acid, erythritol, and various amino acid metabolites,  such as phenyllactic acid, hydroxyphenyllactic acid, and indolelactic acid, was shown during fermentation. physiologically, they contributed to the equilibration of the redox balance. the biphasic approach of the present study allowed us to map some of the interactions taking place during sourdough fermentation and helped us to understand the fine-tuned metabolism of lactic acid bacteria, which  allows them to dominate a food ecosystem.

TI  == characterization of italian cheeses ripened under nonconventional conditions.
AB  == four italian cheeses (casciotta di urbino, barricato san martino, vento d'estate, and ubriaco di raboso) nonconventionally ripened under different plant materials  (walnut leaves, herbs, hay, and wine by-products, respectively) were compared for compositional, microbiological, biochemical, and volatile profile characteristics. mean values for gross composition were rather similar. because primary starters were not used for manufacture, the endogenous lactic acid bacteria were mainly present (7.0 to 9.0 log10 cfu/g). except for lactobacillus paracasei and leuconostoc mesenteroides, which were commonly identified in 3 cheeses, lactococcus lactis, enterococcus sanguinicola, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus durans/enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum, and weissella  cibaria/weissella confusa were variously found in the 4 cheeses. random amplification of polymorphic dna-pcr analysis showed the biodiversity among the strains, and the species of lactobacilli were in part grouped according to their  origin. as shown by the principal component analysis of reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography data for the ph 4.6-soluble fractions and by the determination of free aa, the secondary proteolysis of barricato san martino and  vento d'estate mainly differed from the other 2 cheeses. purge-and-trap and solid-phase microextraction were coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine volatile compounds. vento d'estate showed the highest levels of almost all chemical classes, and casciotta di urbino was characterized  by a very low level of volatile components. esters, ketones, and terpenes were the chemical classes that mainly differentiated the cheeses. several volatile compounds seemed to be released directly from the plant materials used for ripening, especially terpenes for vento d'estate cheese. the lowest level of volatile free fatty acids was found in casciotta d'urbino, in which rennet paste  was not used during manufacture. the highest concentration of free fatty acids, especially butyric and caproic acids, was found in vento d'estate cheese.

TI  == isolation and molecular characterization of antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacteria from poultry and swine meat products.
AB  == the transfer via the food chain from animals to humans of microbes that are resistant to antimicrobial agents is of increasing concern. to determine the contributions of nonpathogenic microflora to the occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistance (ar) genes in the food chain, 123 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from 29 samples of raw and processed pork and chicken meat products that had previously tested positive for one or more ar genes that encode clinically relevant ars: tet(m), tet(o), tet(k), erm(a), erm(b), erm(c), aac (6')-ie aph (2")-ia, meca, and blaz. all of the isolates were initially tested for their ar gene profiles by pcr. the 59 isolates carrying a tet, erm, or blaz gene were taken through molecular identification, analyzed by determination of the mic, and subjected to genetic fingerprinting. lactococcus garvieae was the predominant species (28 isolates), followed by lactobacillus plantarum (11 isolates) and l. salivarius (6 isolates), whereas lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus  johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. crispatus, and l. brevis were identified at lower frequencies. the tet(m) and erm(b) genes were the most frequently detected. assessment of multiple resistances in 18 tet positive (tet+) isolates revealed that tet(m) plus erm(b) and tet(k) plus erm(b) were the most frequent ar gene patterns. partial sequencing of the tet(m) open reading frame of three selected strains showed high sequence similarities (> 99%) with tet(m) genes previously found in human pathogens (listeria monocytogenes and neisseria meningitidis). southern hybridization with plasmid profiles revealed these strains contained tet(m)-carrying plasmids.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum for oral peptide delivery.
AB  == aims: to evaluate strains of lactobacilli for their ability to persist and secrete heterologous protein in the oral cavity. methods and results: four different strains of common oral lactobacilli, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus murinus and lactobacillus plantarum, were  transformed with the plasmid pkth2121, which contains a secretion cassette for beta-lactamase. lactobacilli isolated from the mouth of host mice were also transformed with pkth2121 for later feeding. lactococcus lactis, transformed with pkth2121, was also fed to mice as a negative control. all transformed isolates were fed to c57black mice in varying schedules. the number of transformed bacteria persisting in the mouth was reported as a percentage of total oral bacteria recovered by swabbing. conclusions: the transformed l. lactis, l. brevis, l. johnsonii, l. murinus, and the endogenous murine lactobacillus strain  failed to persist in the mouth. transformed l. plantarum, however, persisted in the mouth and comprised up to 25% of the total lactobacilli at 18 h and 10% at 24 h after feeding. l. plantarum recovered after feeding retained its ability to secrete beta-lactamase into culture medium efficiently. beta-lactamase activity could be detected in oral secretions at 8 h after feedings. after repeated feedings, however, the l. plantarum containing pkth2121 gradually lost its ability to persist after feedings. this experiment demonstrates that l. plantarum can transiently colonize the oral mucosa in large numbers, while continuously secreting foreign proteins, raising the possibility of using lactobacilli as a vector for delivery of oral mucosal peptides.

TI  == enterococcus and lactobacillus contamination of raw milk in a farm dairy environment.
AB  == enterococci and lactobacilli are ubiquitously found in the intestinal microflora  of humans and animals. the aim of the present study was to determine the importance of bovine faeces as a source of these organisms in raw milk. one hundred and fifty six putative enterococci and 362 lactobacilli were isolated from bovine faeces (n=26), cows' teats, raw milk, the milking machine and the milking environment on one farm. the clonal relationships of each group were investigated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and representatives of the different clusters were identified by repetitive dna element (rep)-pcr fingerprinting, protein profiling, phenylalanyl-trna synthase (phes) sequence analysis or 16s rdna gene sequencing. lactobacilli were present at approximately  3 orders of magnitude greater than enterococci in the bovine faeces. the majority of the bovine faecal enterococcal isolates were identified as aerococcus viridans. seven teat isolates belonged to a potential novel aerococcus sp. and one bovine faecal isolate to a potential second novel aerococcus sp. the lactobacilli present in the bovine faeces were predominantly lactobacillus mucosae and lactobacillus brevis, with small numbers of lactobacillus plantarum.  only one enterococcus (a strain of e. casseliflavus) out of 76 and one lactobacillus (a strain of l. parabuchneri/kefir) out of 247 of the bovine faecal isolates was found in the milk. the major source of these bacteria in the milk was the milking equipment.

TI  == rapid discrimination of lactobacilli isolated from kefir grains by ft-ir spectroscopy.
AB  == fourier transform infrared (ft-ir) spectroscopy was used in combination with multivariate statistical analysis for differentiation of lactic bacteria isolated from kefir grains. twelve reference strains and 42 lactobacilli isolates from four local kefir grains, previously identified by biochemical traditional techniques at species level were included in this study. the spectra were analysed by hierarchical clustering analysis (hca) using pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient and ward's algorithm. the differentiation between homo- and heterofermentative lactobacilli, proposed as a first level in the classification scheme, was performed with vector normalized first derivatives spectra in the windows 1789-1700, 1059-935, 3000-2927 and 896-833 cm(-1). for heterofermentative lactobacilli the windows 1780-1750, 1500-1200, 2950-2930 and 900-700 cm(-1) were found to contribute to the maximal separation among l. kefir, l. parakefir and lactobacillus brevis. it was also demonstrated that although this model was robust against small variations in growth temperature (+/-5 degrees c) and growth time (+/-5 h), the make of culture medium used (biokar or difco) affected the separation of heterofermentative lactobacilli at species level. for homofermentative lactobacilli the spectral regions 1230-900, 1777-1690, 1357-1240 and 2960-2870 cm(-1), were selected for discrimination among 5 different species that are normally present in kefir grains: l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. kefirgranum, l. kefiranofaciens and l. cassei. the classification and discrimination schemes proposed in this work completely matched with the identification obtained by classical biochemical techniques at species level.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

AB  == the aim of this study was to examine 29 strains of lactic acid bacteria of the lactobacillus and lactococcus genera, assessing their sensitivity to ochratoxin a and their ability to remove it from a liquid medium. it was demonstrated that most strains are insensitive to the presence of ota at the quantity of 5 microg/disc. it was demonstrated that all strains caused a reduction of the toxin amount in the liquid medium. the highest decrease, exceeding 50% of the initial ota content, was caused by the strains lactobacillus acidophilus ch-5, l. rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum bs, l. brevis and l. sanfranciscensis. the example of  three selected strains confirmed the negative effect of the toxin on the dynamics of bacterial growth. a sharp decrease of ochratoxin a was observed during the first 15 hours of culture growth. in the course of cultivation the amount of the  toxin in the medium increased, indicating that the toxin elimination is partially reversible. a small quantity of ochratoxin a became bound to the bacterial biomass.

AB  == the use of length-heterogeneity pcr was explored to monitor lactic acid bacteria  succession during ensiling of maize. bacterial diversity was studied during the fermentation of 30-day-old maize in optimal and spoilage-simulating conditions. a length heterogeneity pcr profile database of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the silage and identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing was established. although interoperonic 16s rrna gene length polymorphisms were detected in some isolates,  strain analysis showed that most of the lactic acid bacteria species thriving in  silage could be discriminated by this method. the length heterogeneity pcr profiles of bacterial communities during maize fermentation were compared with those on a database. under optimal fermentation conditions all the ecological indices of bacterial diversity, richness and evenness, deduced from community profiles, increased until day thirteen of fermentation and then decreased to the  initial values. pediococcus and weissella dominated, especially in the first days of fermentation. lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis and lactobacillus brevis were mainly found after six days of fermentation. a peak corresponding to lactobacillus plantarum was present in all the fermentation phases, but was only  a minor fraction of the population. unsuitable fermentation conditions and withered maize leaves in the presence of oxygen and water excess caused an enrichment of enterococcus sp. and enterobacter sp.

AB  == a total of 248 strains of predominant lactobacilli isolated during the manufacture and ripening of artisanal manchego cheeses obtained from two dairies  were obtained and the genetic diversity of 197 investigated using random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd-pcr). 51 isolates could not be lysed and were therefore not genotyped. forty-two distinct rapd patterns, grouped in six major clusters at a similarity level of 54%, were obtained. phenotypic characterization of isolates enabled their assignment to the species l. plantarum, l. brevis, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. fermentum, l. pentosus, l. acidophilus and l. curvatus. in samples from both dairies, the species l. plantarum, l. brevis and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei dominated during ripening. three genotypes showed excellent physiological characteristics and were therefore proposed as adjunct cultures for manchego cheese manufacture.

TI  == microbiological study of lactic acid fermentation of caper berries by molecular and culture-dependent methods.
AB  == fermentation of capers (the fruits of capparis sp.) was studied by molecular and  culture-independent methods. a lactic acid fermentation occurred following immersion of caper berries in water, resulting in fast acidification and development of the organoleptic properties typical of this fermented food. a collection of 133 isolates obtained at different times of fermentation was reduced to 75 after randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis. isolates were identified by pcr or 16s rrna gene sequencing as lactobacillus plantarum (37 isolates), lactobacillus paraplantarum (1 isolate), lactobacillus pentosus (5 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (9 isolates), lactobacillus fermentum (6 isolates), pediococcus pentosaceus (14 isolates), pediococcus acidilactici (1  isolate), and enterococcus faecium (2 isolates). cluster analysis of rapd-pcr patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among lactobacilli (with four major  groups and five subgroups), while pediococci clustered in two closely related groups. a culture-independent analysis of fermentation samples by temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis (ttge) also indicated that l. plantarum is the predominant species in this fermentation, in agreement with culture-dependent results. the distribution of l. brevis and l. fermentum in samples was also determined by ttge, but identification of pediococcus at the species level was not possible. ttge also allowed a more precise estimation of the distribution of  e. faecium, and the detection of enterococcus casseliflavus (which was not revealed by the culture-dependent analysis). results from this study indicate that complementary data from molecular and culture-dependent analysis provide a more accurate determination of the microbial community dynamics during caper fermentation.

TI  == resistance to antimicrobial agents in lactobacilli isolated from caper fermentations.
AB  == a collection of lactobacilli comprising species of lactobacillus plantarum (43 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (9 isolates) and lactobacillus fermentum (6 isolates) obtained from spontaneous fermentations of capers (the fruits of capparis spinosa) were investigated for resistance to antimicrobial agents. all isolates were resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin (mic > 16 microg/ml). resistance to ciprofloxacin (mic > 2 microg/ml) was detected in all isolates of l. brevis and l. fermentum as well as in most isolates of l. plantarum, whilst resistance to levofloxacin showed a much lower incidence. among l. plantarum and  l. brevis isolates, low levels of resistance to tetracycline and/or nitrofurantoin were detected. higher resistance levels were also detected in some isolates. resistance to penicillin and rifampicin were also detected among l. plantarum isolates. all isolates were sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, streptomycin, and quinupristin/dalfopristin.

TI  == effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  == fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. in this study, three sourdough yeasts, candida milleri cbs 8195, saccharomyces cerevisiae ts 146, and torulaspora delbrueckii ts 207; a control, baker's yeast s. cerevisiae alko 743; and four lactobacillus spp., l. acidophilus tsb 262, l. brevis tsb 307, l. plantarum tsb 304, and l. sanfranciscensis tsb 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. the microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. total folate contents were determined using lactobacillus rhamnosus (atcc 7469) as the growth  indicator organism. the microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised  rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g  after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, l. helveticus, pediococcus spp., and streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. although the four lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal.  it was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as enterobacter cowanii and pantoea agglomerans.

TI  == use of real time pcr to determine population profiles of individual species of lactic acid bacteria in alfalfa silage and stored corn stover.
AB  == real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) was used to quantify seven species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in alfalfa silage prepared in the presence or absence of four commercial inoculants and in uninoculated corn stover harvested and stored under a variety of field conditions. species-specific pcr primers were designed based on reca gene sequences. commercial inoculants improved the quality of alfalfa silage, but species corresponding to those in the inoculants displayed variations in persistence over the next 96 h. lactobacillus brevis was the most abundant lab (12 to 32% of total sample dna) in all of the alfalfa silages by 96  h. modest populations (up to 10%) of lactobacillus plantarum were also observed in inoculated silages. pediococcus pentosaceus populations increased over time but did not exceed 2% of the total. small populations (0.1 to 1%) of lactobacillus buchneri and lactococcus lactis were observed in all silages, while lactobacillus pentosus and enterococcus faecium were near or below detection limits. corn stover generally displayed higher populations of l. plantarum and l. brevis and lower populations of other lab species. the data illustrate the utility of rt-pcr for quantifying individual species of lab in conserved forages  prepared under a wide variety of conditions.

TI  == [antifungal effect in selected natural compounds and probiotics and their possible use in prophylaxis of vulvovaginitis].
AB  == objective: a survey of effective natural compounds and probiotics with antifungal activity and their possible use in vulvovaginitis as a prophylactic or therapeutic drug. design: review of literature. setting: charles university at prague, pharmaceutical faculty at hradec kralove. methods: and review of literature and publications from medical data-bases. conclusions: certain natural compounds were proved to exert antimycotic effects. the efficiency of garlic extract under in vitro conditions against yeast of c. albicans family becomes manifest within one hour. essential oils present in the cayenne pepper (capsodum  frutescens) exert considerable antifungal activity against c. albicans as well. clove exerts lower antimycotic effects. the effects of chinese leek are similar to garlic. propolis also possesses antifungal properties, and sensitivity of the  yeast strains decreases in the following order: c. albicans > c. tropicalis > c.  crusei > c. guilliermondii. its efficiency depends on the composition and place of origin. tea trea oil (melalauca alternifolia) is inhibiting strains of candida family (genus) in minimal inhibiting concentration, higher concentrations are necessary for c. crusei and c. norvengensis. in the prophylaxis of vaginal candidoses, oral administration of the strains of lactobacilus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14, b-54 may be recommended. moreover there are suitable strains  of l. brevis cd-2, l. salivarius fv-2, l. gasseri mb 335, l. plantarum, useful in the form of gel capsules (l. plantarum) or vaginal tablets (l. gasseri). the strains of l. acidophilus crl 1294 and l. salivarius crl 1328 display the capacity of self aggregation and co-aggregation with candida. it should be pointed out that the probiotic strain of lactobacillus (especially l. casei and l. rhamnosus) may, in exceptional cases, cause bacteriemia and sepsis, especially in immunodeficient patients and those who underwent surgery of alimentary tract.  no protective effect against yeast infection was detected with vitamin e, any positive effect was not unequivocally confirmed with zinc, but adjusting zinc levels to normal may be recommended.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria and yeasts associated with spontaneous fermentations during  the production of sour cassava starch in brazil.
AB  == sour cassava starch is a traditional fermented food used in the preparation of fried foods and baked goods such as traditional cheese breads in brazil. thirty samples of sour cassava starch were collected from two factories in the state of  minas gerais. the samples were examined for the presence of lactic acid bacteria, yeasts, mesophilic microorganisms, bacillus cereus and faecal coliforms. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolates were identified by biochemical tests, and the identities were confirmed by molecular methods. lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus fermentum were the prevalent lactic acid bacteria in product from both factories, at numbers between 6.0 and 9.0 log cfu g(-)(1). lactobacillus perolans and lactobacillus brevis were minor fractions of the population. galactomyces geothricum and issatchenkia sp. were the prevalent yeasts at numbers of 5.0 log cfu g(-)(1). a species similar to candida ethanolica was frequently isolated from one factory. mesophilic bacteria and amylolytic microorganisms were recovered in high numbers at all stages of the fermentation. b. cereus was found  at low numbers in product at both factories. the spontaneous fermentations associated with the production of sour cassava starch involve a few species of lactic acid bacteria at high numbers and a variety of yeasts at relatively low numbers.

TI  == diversity and technological properties of predominant lactic acid bacteria from fermented cassava used for the preparation of gari, a traditional african food.
AB  == traditional fermentation of cassava is dominated by a lactic acid bacteria (lab)  population. fermentation is important for improving product flavour and aroma as  well as safety, especially by reduction of its toxic cyanogenic glucosides. the production of gari from cassava in benin typically occurs on a household or small industrial scale, and consequently suffers from inconsistent product quality and  may not always be safe for consumption. therefore, the diversity of lab from a typical cassava fermentation for the preparation of gari, and their technologically relevant characteristics were investigated with a view towards selection of appropriate starter cultures. a total of 139 predominant strains isolated from fermenting cassava were identified using phenotypic tests and genotypic methods such as rep-pcr and rapd-pcr. dna-dna hybridisation and sequencing of the 16s rrna genes were done for selected strains. lactobacillus plantarum was the most abundantly isolated species (54.6% of isolates), followed  by leuconostoc fallax (22.3%) and lactobacillus fermentum (18.0%). lactobacillus  brevis, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides and weissella paramesenteroides were sporadically isolated. the l. plantarum strains were shown to be better acid producers and capable of faster acid production than the l. fallax or l. fermentum strains. the incidence of beta-glucosidase (linamarase) activity was also highest among strains of this species. production of antagonistic substances such as h2o2 and bacteriocins, however, was more common among l. fallax and l. fermentum strains. strains of all three species were capable of utilising the indigestible sugars raffinose and stachyose. therefore, a starter culture containing a mixture of strains from all three species was recommended.

TI  == identification of potential probiotic starter cultures for scandinavian-type fermented sausages.
AB  == potential probiotic cultures suitable as starter cultures for the scandinavian-type fermented sausages were identified among strains well-adapted to fermented meats as well as strains originating from a culture collection. from 15 different fermented meat products, 22 strains were isolated as dominant non-starter lactic acid bacteria (nslab). the isolates were identified by rapd, api and sequence analysis of 16s rrna and showed to be five strains of lactobacillus sakei, five strains of lactobacillus farciminis, five strains belonging to the group of lactobacillus plantarum/pentosus, four strains of lactobacillus alimentarius, two strains of lactobacillus brevis and one strain of lactobacillus versmoldensis. heterofermentative strains as well as strains not growing at 37 degrees c and not lowering ph below 5.1 in a meat model were excluded leaving 9 strains for further studies. these strains together with 19 strains from a culture collection were evaluated by in vitro methods including survival upon exposure to ph 2.5 or 0.3% oxgall and adhesion to the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line caco-2 as well as antimicrobial activity against potential pathogens. strains that fulfilled all the probiotic criteria and showed to be fast acid producers in a meat model included three strains belonging to the group of lb. plantarum/pentosus (mf1291, mf1298, mf1300) which originated from the dominant nslab of fermented meat products. mf1291 and mf 1298 were further identified as lb. plantarum and mf1300 as lb. pentosus. the three strains were all successfully applied as starter cultures for the production of fermented sausage. the viable count at the end of the processing period reached high cell numbers (4.7x10(7)-2.9x10(8) cfu/g) and ph of the sausages decreased to ph 4.8-4.9 without any flavour deviation compared to sausage fermented by a commercial meat starter culture.

TI  == cloning, expression, purification, and analysis of mannitol dehydrogenase gene mtlk from lactobacillus brevis.
AB  == the commercial production of mannitol involves high-pressure hydrogenation of fructose using a nickel catalyst, a costly process. mannitol can be produced through fermentation by microorganisms. currently, a few lactobacillus strains are used to develop an efficient process for mannitol bioproduction; most of the  strains produce mannitol from fructose with other products. an approach toward improving this process would be to genetically engineer lactobacillus strains to  increase fructose-to-mannitol conversion with decreased production of other products. we cloned the gene mtlk encoding mannitol-2-dehydrogenase (ec 1.1.1.67) that catalyzes the conversion of fructose into mannitol from lactobacillus brevis using genomic polymerase chain reaction. the mtlk clone contains 1328 bp of dna sequence including a 1002-bp open reading frame that consisted of 333 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of about 36 kda. the functional mannitol-2-dehydrogenase was produced by overexpressing mtlk via prseta vector in escherichia coli bl21plyss on isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction. the fusion protein is able to catalyze the reduction of fructose to mannitol at ph 5.35. similar rates of catalytic reduction were observed using either the nadh or nadph as cofactor under in vitro assay conditions. genetically engineered lactobacillus plantarum tf103 carrying the mtlk gene of l. brevis indicated increased mannitol production from glucose. the evaluation of mixed sugar fermentation and mannitol production by this strain is in progress.

AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

AB  == the microbiota of two industrially processed rice sourdoughs was characterised by bacteriological culture in combination with pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and 16s/28s rdna sequence analysis. rice sourdough i was continuously propagated for several years by back-slopping every week, whereas sourdough ii was processed by using a commercial starter culture and back-slopping daily for three days. in rice sourdough ii candida krusei and saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gallinarum, lactobacillus kimchii, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus pontis dominated at the first day of fermentation. rapd analysis of lactobacilli  revealed identical profiles for each of the species except for l. fermentum and l. pontis indicating the presence of different strains. fluctuations within the lab community during fermentation were monitored by pcr-dgge. l. pontis decreased in numbers over time and l. curvatus became dominant after 3 days of fermentation. rice sourdough i contained s. cerevisiae, lactobacillus paracasei (present with three different rapd types), lactobacillus paralimentarius, and a lactobacillus strain which could not be allotted to any valid species. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rdna sequences revealed lactobacillus brevis as the closest relative (97.3% sequence similarity). differences in some phenotypic characteristics and dna-dna relatedness indicated that the strain represents a new lactobacillus species, for which the name lactobacillus spicheri is proposed.

TI  == a pcr assay for detection of acetic acid-tolerant lactic acid bacteria in acidic  food products.
AB  == a pcr assay for the detection of acetic acid-tolerant lactic acid bacteria in the genera of lactobacillus and pediococcus was developed in this study. primers targeting the bacterial 16s rrna gene were newly designed and used in this pcr assay. to determine the specificity of the assay, 56 different bacterial strains  (of 33 genera), 2 fungi, 3 animals, and 4 plants were tested. results were positive for most tested bacterial members of 16s rrna gene-based phylogenetic groups (classified in the lactobacillus casei and pediococcus group), including lactobacillus fructivorans, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus buchneri, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus paracasei. for all other bacterial strains and eukaryote tested, results were negative. bacterial dna for pcr was prepared with a simple procedure with the use of chelex 100 resin from culture after growth in deman rogosa sharpe broth (ph 6.0). to test this pcr assay for the monitoring of the acetic acid-tolerant lactic acid bacteria, l. fructivorans  was inoculated into several acidic food as an indicator. before the pcr, the inoculation of 10 to 50 cfu of bacteria per g of food was followed by a 28-h enrichment culture step, and the pcr assay allowed the detection of bacterial cells. including the enrichment culture step, the entire pcr detection process can be completed within 30 h.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from south african brandy base wines.
AB  == in brandy base wines, no sulphur dioxide is used and it therefore is ideal for the proliferation of lactic acid bacteria. as part of an extensive taxonomic survey within the ecological framework of south african vineyards and wineries, and the influence of naturally occurring lactic acid bacteria on the quality of wine and brandy, a total of 54 strains were isolated from grape juice and at different stages of brandy base wine production. the strains were identified using numerical analysis of total soluble cell protein patterns, 16s rrna sequence analyses and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using species-specific primers. the predominant species was oenococcus oeni (22 strains), but lactobacillus brevis (8 strains), lactobacillus paracasei (8 strains) and lactobacillus plantarum (6 strains) were also isolated frequently. many of the o. oeni strains were isolated from brandy base wines after completion of spontaneous malolactic fermentation (mlf). the lactobacillus spp. were isolated from all the  different stages of brandy base wine production. lb. plantarum was the dominant species in the juice, but disappeared during the later stages of production. however, lactobacillus hilgardii, lb. brevis and lb. paracasei were also isolated from base wine after spontaneous mlf. strains identified as lactobacillus vermiforme were isolated during the alcoholic fermentation and after mlf have been completed. total soluble cell protein patterns grouped o. oeni strains into  two phenotypic groups. two phenotypic clusters have also been identified for the  lb. brevis isolates. the lb. paracasei isolates all grouped in one cluster. this  is the first report of the presence of lb. paracasei and lb. vermiforme in brandy base wines. the presence of the lactobacillus spp. could be correlated to the decrease in quality of the base wine and distillate, while o. oeni strains were found to have a more favourable influence on the quality of base wine and distillates. these results shed some light on the ecology and oenological influence of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on the quality of south african brandy.

TI  == lactobacillus casei, dominant species in naturally fermented sicilian green olives.
AB  == this study investigated the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria in naturally fermented green olives, collected from different areas of sicily. both classical biochemical tests and pcr/restriction fragments length  polymorphism (rflp) of 16s rdna were used to characterize the isolates. the identity of the isolates was obtained by the partial sequencing analysis of the 16s rdna. the biomerieux software assigned the 13 heterofermentative strains to the lactobacillus brevis species; 24 homofermentative strains were classified as  lactobacillus casei and the remaining 11 homofermentative lactobacilli were identified as lactobacillus plantarum. the rapid id 32 strep test identified coccal-shaped strains as enterococcus faecium species. the pcr/rflp analysis showed a remarkable bacterial heterogeneity within the isolates. the 16s rdna partial sequencing did not confirm biochemical identification, revealing a strong dominance of isolates belonging to the l. casei species. it is noteworthy that this species has never been reported as dominant species in fermented vegetables.a combination of molecular and biochemical analysis allowed the identification of species involved in natural food fermentations.

TI  == construction and use of a computerized dna fingerprint database for lactic acid bacteria from silage.
AB  == efficient selection of new silage inoculant strains from a collection of over 10,000 isolates of lactic acid bacteria (lab) requires excellent strain discrimination. toward that end, we constructed a gelcompar ii database of dna fingerprint patterns of ethidium bromide-stained ecori fragments of total lab dna separated by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. we found that the total dna patterns were strain-specific; 56/60 american type culture collection strains of 33 species of lab could be distinguished. enterococcus faecium strains atcc19434 and atcc35667 had identical total dna patterns and riboprints. lactobacillus rhamnosus strains atcc7469 and atcc27773 also had identical total dna patterns, but different riboprints. ecori riboprint patterns could distinguish only about 9/23 lactobacillus plantarum strains and about 6/10 lactobacillus buchneri strains, whereas all 33 strains could be distinguished by  ecori total dna patterns. despite gel-to-gel variation, new dna patterns can be readily grouped with existing patterns using gelcompar ii. the database contains  large homogenous clusters of l. plantarum, e. faecium, l. buchneri, lactobacillus brevis and pediococcus species that can be used for tentative taxonomic assignment. we routinely use the dna fingerprint database to identify and characterize new strains, eliminate duplicate isolates and for quality control of inoculant product strains. the gelcompar ii database has been in continuous use for 7 years and contains more than 3600 patterns representing approximately 700 unique patterns from over 300 gels and is the largest computerized dna fingerprint database for lab yet reported.

TI  == antimicrobial interactions of microbial species involved in the fermentation of cassava dough into agbelima with particular reference to the inhibitory effect of lactic acid bacteria on enteric pathogens.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria, bacillus species and yeasts are involved in the fermentation of cassava dough into agbelima. microbial interactions within and between these groups of microorganisms were investigated in addition to the survival of five enteric pathogens inoculated into agbelima under various conditions. nine out of 10 cultures of lactic acid bacteria isolated at the end of agbelima fermentation showed inhibitory effect against 10 cultures of lactic acid bacteria isolated at the start of fermentation. only 3 out of 10 isolates of bacillus subtilis were inhibited by 10 isolates of lactic acid bacteria tested. no interactions were observed between yeasts and the lactic acid bacteria, whereas three of the bacillus isolates showed inhibitory effects against the yeasts. twelve isolates of lactobacillus plantarum tested inhibited the growth of an isolate each of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus brevis but none tested positive for bacteriocin production. the antimicrobial effect of the lactic acid bacteria was attributed to acid production. in fermenting cassava dough, enteric pathogens survived to different extents depending on ph and their  sensitivity to acids. vibrio cholerae c-230, salmonella typhimurium 9 and salmonella enteritidis 226 were not detectable in 10 g of sample after 4 h when inoculated into the 48-h fermented product, agbelima, whereas shigella dysenteriae 2357t and escherichia coli d2188 were detectable up to 8 h in the product.

TI  == the potential of dairy lactic acid bacteria to metabolise amino acids via non-transaminating reactions and endogenous transamination.
AB  == the metabolism of amino acids by 22 starter and 49 non-starter lactic acid bacteria (lab) was studied in a system consisting of amino acids and non-growing  cells without added amino acceptors such as alpha-ketoglutarate. there were significant inter- and intra-species differences in the metabolism of amino acids. some amino acids such as alanine, arginine, aspartate, serine and branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) were utilised, whereas other amino acids such as glycine, ornithine and citrulline were produced. alanine and aspartate were utilised by some lab and accumulated during  the incubation of other lab. arginine was degraded not only by lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (the lactococcal subspecies known to catabolise arginine), but also by pediococci, heterofermentative lactobacilli (lactobacillus brevis and lb. fermentum) and some unidentified homofermentative lactobacilli. serine was utilised predominantly by homofermentative lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, lb. rhamnosus and lb. plantarum. of the lab studied, lb. brevis and lb. fermentum were the most metabolically active, utilising alanine, arginine, aspartate, glutamate and branched-chain amino acids. leuconostocs were the least metabolically active, showing little potential to metabolise amino acids. the formation of ammonia and acetate from amino acid metabolism varied both between species and between strains within species. these findings suggest that the potential of lab for amino acid metabolism via non-transaminating reactions and endogenous transamination will impact both on the physiology of lab and on cheese ripening, especially when transamination is rate-limiting in the absence of an exogenous amino acceptor such as alpha-ketoglutarate.

TI  == proteolytic activities in togwa, a tanzanian fermented food.
AB  == proteolytic activities were investigated in sorghum-based togwa prepared by natural fermentation and using starter cultures previously isolated from the native product, i.e., lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, and issatchenkia orientalis in coculture with either l. brevis or l. plantarum. both  proteinase and aminopeptidase activities were substantially higher in naturally fermented togwa than in those with starters (14-30%, 12-70%, respectively). a variable but substantial part of the proteinase activity followed the particulate fraction of togwa; aminopeptidase activity was mainly in that fraction. the breakdown of relatively high molecular mass protein (64 kda) in togwa was detected by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page); the products were mainly in the 14-30 kda range. reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography (rp-fplc)-protein/peptide patterns changed during fermentation with some variation between togwa of different cultures. supplementation of gruel with malt increased the concentration of total protein [from 9.5% to 11.0% (w/w) on dry weight basis)] and of most of the free amino acids. fermentation had no effect on total protein content; however, the concentration of most of the amino acids was reduced, except for the proline content that increased. natural fermentation also increased the concentration of  glutamic acid and ornithine. fermentation by p. pentosaceus increased aspartic acid, while l. cellobiosus, l. fermentum, and l. brevis in coculture with i. orientalis increased the concentration of citrulline.

AB  == a total of 161 low-g+c-content gram-positive bacteria isolated from whole-crop paddy rice silage were classified and subjected to phenotypic and genetic analyses. based on morphological and biochemical characters, these presumptive lactic acid bacterium (lab) isolates were divided into 10 groups that included members of the genera enterococcus, lactobacillus, lactococcus, leuconostoc, pediococcus, and weissella: analysis of the 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) was used to  confirm the presence of the predominant groups indicated by phenotypic analysis and to determine the phylogenetic affiliation of representative strains. the virtually complete 16s rrna gene was pcr amplified and sequenced. the sequences from the various lab isolates showed high degrees of similarity to those of the genbank reference strains (between 98.7 and 99.8%). phylogenetic trees based on the 16s rdna sequence displayed high consistency, with nodes supported by high bootstrap values. with the exception of one species, the genetic data was in agreement with the phenotypic identification. the prevalent lab, predominantly homofermentative (66%), consisted of lactobacillus plantarum (24%), lactococcus lactis (22%), leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (20%), pediococcus acidilactici (11%), lactobacillus brevis (11%), enterococcus faecalis (7%), weissella kimchii  (3%), and pediococcus pentosaceus (2%). the present study, the first to fully document rice-associated lab, showed a very diverse community of lab with a relatively high number of species involved in the fermentation process of paddy rice silage. the comprehensive 16s rdna-based approach to describing lab community structure was valuable in revealing the large diversity of bacteria inhabiting paddy rice silage and enabling the future design of appropriate inoculants aimed at improving its fermentation quality.

AB  == one hundred and thirteen strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were selected from 351 isolates from 15 samples of traditionally fermented household bushera from uganda and also from laboratory-prepared bushera. isolates were phenotypically characterised by their ability to ferment 49 carbohydrates using api 50 chl kits  and additional biochemical tests. coliforms, yeasts and lab were enumerated in bushera. the ph, volatile organic compounds and organic acids were also determined. the lab counts in household bushera varied between 7.1 and 9.4 log cfu ml(-1). the coliform counts varied between < 1 and 5.2 log cfu ml(-1). the ph of bushera ranged from 3.7 to 4.5. ethanol (max, 0.27%) was the major volatile organic compound while lactic acid (max, 0.52%) was identified as the dominant organic acid in household bushera. the initial numbers of lab and coliforms in laboratory-fermented bushera were similar; however, the lab numbers increased faster during the first 24 h. lab counts increased from 5.5 to 9.0 log cfu ml(-1) during the laboratory fermentation. coliform counts increased from 5.9 to 7.8 log cfu ml(-1) at 24 h, but after 48 h, counts were less 4 log cfu ml(-1). yeasts increased from 4.3 to 7.7 log cfu ml(-1) at 48 h, but thereafter decreased slightly. the ph declined from 7.0 to around 4.0. lactic acid and ethanol increased from zero to 0.75% and 0.20%, respectively. lactic acid bacteria isolated from household bushera belonged to lactobacillus, streptococcus and enterococcus genera. tentatively, lactobacillus isolates were identified as lactobacillus plantarum, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. streptococcus thermophilus strains were also identified in household bushera. lab isolated from bushera produced in the laboratory belonged to five genera (lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, weissella and enterococcus. eight isolates were able to produce acid from starch  and were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (four strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (one strain), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum (one strain), weissella confusa (one strain) and l. plantarum (one strain).

AB  == the cytoplasmic extracts of 70 strains of the most frequently isolated sourdough  lactic acid bacteria were screened initially for arginine deiminase (adi), ornithine transcarbamoylase (otc), and carbamate kinase (ck) activities, which comprise the adi (or arginine dihydrolase) pathway. only obligately heterofermentative strains such as lactobacillus sanfranciscensis cb1; lactobacillus brevis am1, am8, and 10a; lactobacillus hilgardii 51b; and lactobacillus fructivorans dd3 and da106 showed all three enzyme activities. lactobacillus plantarum b14 did not show ck activity. l. sanfranciscensis cb1 showed the highest activities, and the three enzymes were purified from this microorganism to homogeneity by several chromatographic steps. adi, otc, and ck had apparent molecular masses of ca. 46, 39, and 37 kda, respectively, and the pis were in the range of 5.07 to 5.2. the otcs, cks, and especially adis were well adapted to ph (acidic, ph 3.5 to 4.5) and temperature (30 to 37 degrees c) conditions which are usually found during sourdough fermentation. internal peptide sequences of the three enzymes had the highest level of homology with adi, otc, and ck of lactobacillus sakei. l. sanfranciscensis cb1 expressed the adi pathway either on mam broth containing 17 mm arginine or during sourdough fermentation with 1 to 43 mm added arginine. two-dimensional electrophoresis showed that adi, otc, and ck were induced by factors of ca. 10, 4, and 2 in the whole-cell extract of cells grown in mam broth containing 17 mm arginine compared to cells cultivated without arginine. arginine catabolism in l. sanfranciscensis  cb1 depended on the presence of a carbon source and arginine; glucose at up to ca. 54 mm did not exert an inhibitory effect, and the ph was not relevant for induction. the ph of sourdoughs fermented by l. sanfranciscensis cb1 was dependent on the amount of arginine added to the dough. a low supply of arginine  (6 mm) during sourdough fermentation by l. sanfranciscensis cb1 enhanced cell growth, cell survival during storage at 7 degrees c, and tolerance to acid environmental stress and favored the production of ornithine, which is an important precursor of crust aroma compounds.

TI  == reduction of oxaluria after an oral course of lactic acid bacteria at high concentration.
AB  == background: hyperoxaluria is a major risk factor for renal stones, and in most cases, it appears to be sustained by increased dietary load or increased intestinal absorption. previous studies have shown that components of the endogenous digestive microflora, in particular oxalobacter formigenes, utilize oxalate in the gut, thus limiting its absorption. we tested the hypothesis of whether oxaluria can be reduced by means of reducing intestinal absorption through feeding a mixture of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. methods: six patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis and mild hyperoxaluria (>40 mg/24 h) received daily a mixture containing 8 x 10(11) freeze-dried lactic acid  bacteria (l. acidophilus, l. plantarum, l. brevis, s. thermophilus, b. infantis)  for four weeks. the 24-hour urinary excretion of oxalate was determined at the end of the study period and then one month after ending the treatment. the ability of bacteria to degrade oxalate and grow in oxalate-containing media, and  the gene expression of ox1t, an enzyme that catalyzes the transmembrane exchange  of oxalate, also were investigated. results: the treatment resulted in a great reduction of the 24-hour excretion of oxalate in all six patients enrolled. mean  levels +/- sd were 33.5 +/- 15.9 mg/24 h at the end of the study period and 28.3  +/- 14.6 mg/24 h one month after treatment was interrupted compared with baseline values of 55.5 +/- 19.6 mg/24 h (p < 0.05). the treatment was associated with a strong reduction of the fecal excretion of oxalate in the two patients tested. two bacterial strains among those used for the treatment (l. acidophilus and s. thermophilus) proved in vitro to degrade oxalate effectively, but their growth was somewhat inhibited by oxalate. one strain (b. infantis) showed a quite good degrading activity and grew rapidly in the oxalate-containing medium. l. plantarum and l. brevis showed a modest ability to degrade oxalate even though they grew significantly in oxalate-containing medium. no strain expressed the ox1t gene. conclusions: the urinary excretion of oxalate, a major risk factor for renal stone formation and growth in patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis, can be greatly reduced with treatment using a high concentration of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. we postulate that the biological manipulation  of the endogenous digestive microflora can be a novel approach for the prevention of urinary stone formation.

TI  == lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  == samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. yeasts (20.1%), streptococcus spp. (8.7%), staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. the lactobacillus isolates were l. brevis (24.6%) l. fermentum (18.5%) l. casei (16.9%), l. delbrueckii (15.4%), l. plantarum (9.23%), l. acidophilus (7.69%), l. jensenii (4.62%), l. salivarius (1.54%) and l. gasseri (1.54%). the most common species was l. brevis (24.6%). the strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. all the lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella dysenteriae, s. sonnei, klebsiella spp. and campylobacter sp. all the lactobacilli except l. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. the involvement of lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. the ability of lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.

TI  == characterization of non-starter lactic acid bacteria from italian ewe cheeses based on phenotypic, genotypic, and cell wall protein analyses.
AB  == non-starter lactic acid bacteria (nslab) were isolated from 12 italian ewe cheeses representing six different types of cheese, which in several cases were produced by different manufacturers. a total of 400 presumptive lactobacillus isolates were obtained, and 123 isolates and 10 type strains were subjected to phenotypic, genetic, and cell wall protein characterization analyses. phenotypically, the cheese isolates included 32% lactobacillus plantarum isolates, 15% l. brevis isolates, 12% l. paracasei subsp. paracasei isolates, 9%  l. curvatus isolates, 6% l. fermentum isolates, 6% l. casei subsp. casei isolates, 5% l. pentosus isolates, 3% l. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum isolates, and 1% l. rhamnosus isolates. eleven percent of the isolates were not phenotypically identified. although a randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis based on three primers and clustering by the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average (upgma) was useful for partially differentiating the 10 type strains, it did not provide a species-specific dna band or a combination of bands which permitted complete separation of all the species considered. in contrast, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis cell wall protein profiles clustered by upgma were species specific and resolved the nslab. the only exceptions were isolates phenotypically identified as l. plantarum and l. pentosus or as l. casei subsp. casei and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, which were grouped together. based on protein profiles, italian ewe cheeses frequently contained four different species and 3 to 16 strains. in general, the cheeses produced from raw ewe milk contained a larger number of more diverse strains than the cheeses produced from pasteurized  milk. the same cheese produced in different factories contained different species, as well as strains that belonged to the same species but grouped in different rapd clusters.

TI  == reaction kinetic interpretation of heat destruction influenced by environmental factors.
AB  == based on reaction kinetics and thermodynamic considerations a mathematical model  was developed to describe the thermal death rate of microbes as a function of environmental factors such as temperature, water activity, ph and redox potential. the mathematical model is discussed and validated by fitting to data sets of heat destruction of lactobacillus brevis and lactobacillus plantarum. the mathematical analysis of the kinetic model and the parameters of the model fitting demonstrate its applicability both for the prediction of the heat destruction rate and estimation of the thermodynamic parameters of heat destruction.

TI  == phenotypic and molecular identification and clustering of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts from wheat (species triticum durum and triticum aestivum) sourdoughs of southern italy.
AB  == the microflora of 25 wheat sourdoughs from the apulia region, southern italy, was characterized. the sourdoughs were mainly produced from triticum durum wheat. the number of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts ranged from ca. log 7.5 to log 9.3 colony forming units (cfu)/g and from log 5.5 to log 8.4 cfu/g, respectively. about 38% of the 317 isolates of lactic acid bacteria were identified by conventional physiological and biochemical tests. phenotypic identification was confirmed by 16s rdna and 16s/23s rrna spacer region pcr. overall, 30% of the isolates were identified as lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, 20% as lb. alimentarius, 14% as lb. brevis, 12% as leuconostoc citreum, 7% as lb. plantarum, 6% as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, 4% as lb. fermentum and lb. acidophilus,  2% as weissella confusa and 1% as lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. some of these species have not been previously isolated from sourdoughs. since bakers yeast is widely used in sourdough production, saccharomyces cerevisiae was largely found. the phenotypical relationships within the main lactic acid bacteria identified were established by using cluster analysis. a microbial map of the 25 sourdoughs was plotted showing characteristic associations among lactic acid bacteria and differences in the lactic acid bacteria species which were mainly due to the species of wheat flour, use of bakers yeast and type of bread.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria constituting the predominating microflora  in an acid-fermented condiment (tempoyak) popular in malaysia.
AB  == tempoyak is a traditional malaysian fermented condiment made from the pulp of the durian fruit (durio zibethinus). salt is sometime added to proceed fermentation at ambient temperature. in various samples obtained from night markets, lactic acid bacteria (lab) were the predominant microorganisms, ranging from log 8.4 to  log 9.2 cfu g(-1). no other microorganisms were present to such a level. these samples contained reduced amount of saccharose, glucose and fructose but increased amount of d- and l-lactic acid and acetic acid compared with samples of non-fermented durian fruit. sixty-four isolates of lab were divided into five groups by use of a few phenotypic tests. a total of 38 strains of lab were selected for comparison by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) of their whole cell protein patterns with a sds-page database of lab. these strains were also examined for their carbohydrate fermentation patterns by use of api 50 ch. isolates belonging to the lactobacillus plantarum group were shown to be the predominant members of the lab flora. in addition, isolates belonging to the lactobacillus brevis group, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus mali, lactobacilus fermentum and an unidentified lactobacillus sp. were also observed. a high degree of diversity among isolates belonging to the lb. plantarum group was demonstrated by analysis  of their plasmid profiles.

TI  == decarboxylation of substituted cinnamic acids by lactic acid bacteria isolated during malt whisky fermentation.
AB  == seven strains of lactobacillus isolated from malt whisky fermentations and representing lactobacillus brevis, l. crispatus, l. fermentum, l. hilgardii, l. paracasei, l. pentosus, and l. plantarum contained genes for hydroxycinnamic acid (p-coumaric acid) decarboxylase. with the exception of l. hilgardii, these bacteria decarboxylated p-coumaric acid and/or ferulic acid, with the production  of 4-vinylphenol and/or 4-vinylguaiacol, respectively, although the relative activities on the two substrates varied between strains. the addition of p-coumaric acid or ferulic acid to cultures of l. pentosus in mrs broth induced hydroxycinnamic acid decarboxylase mrna within 5 min, and the gene was also induced by the indigenous components of malt wort. in a simulated distillery fermentation, a mixed culture of l. crispatus and l. pentosus in the presence of  saccharomyces cerevisiae decarboxylated added p-coumaric acid more rapidly than the yeast alone but had little activity on added ferulic acid. moreover, we were  able to demonstrate the induction of hydroxycinnamic acid decarboxylase mrna under these conditions. however, in fermentations with no additional hydroxycinnamic acid, the bacteria lowered the final concentration of 4-vinylphenol in the fermented wort compared to the level seen in a pure-yeast fermentation. it seems likely that the combined activities of bacteria and yeast  decarboxylate p-coumaric acid and then reduce 4-vinylphenol to 4-ethylphenol more effectively than either microorganism alone in pure cultures. although we have shown that lactobacilli participate in the metabolism of phenolic compounds during malt whisky fermentations, the net result is a reduction in the concentrations of 4-vinylphenol and 4-vinylguaiacol prior to distillation.

TI  == purification and characterization of novel antifungal compounds from the sourdough lactobacillus plantarum strain 21b.
AB  == sourdough lactic acid bacteria were selected for antifungal activity by a conidial germination assay. the 10-fold-concentrated culture filtrate of lactobacillus plantarum 21b grown in wheat flour hydrolysate almost completely inhibited eurotium repens ibt18000, eurotium rubrum ftdc3228, penicillium corylophilum ibt6978, penicillium roqueforti ibt18687, penicillium expansum idm/fs2, endomyces fibuliger ibt605 and idm3812, aspergillus niger ftdc3227 and idm1, aspergillus flavus ftdc3226, monilia sitophila idm/fs5, and fusarium graminearum idm623. the nonconcentrated culture filtrate of l. plantarum 21b grown in whole wheat flour hydrolysate had similar inhibitory activity. the activity was fungicidal. calcium propionate at 3 mg ml(-1) was not effective under the same assay conditions, while sodium benzoate caused inhibition similar  to l. plantarum 21b. after extraction with ethyl acetate, preparative silica gel  thin-layer chromatography, and chromatographic and spectroscopic analyses, novel  antifungal compounds such as phenyllactic and 4-hydroxy-phenyllactic acids were identified in the culture filtrate of l. plantarum 21b. phenyllactic acid was contained at the highest concentration in the bacterial culture filtrate and had  the highest activity. it inhibited all the fungi tested at a concentration of 50  mg ml(-1) except for p. roqueforti ibt18687 and p. corylophilum ibt6978 (inhibitory concentration, 166 mg ml(-1)). l. plantarum 20b, which showed high antimold activity, was also selected. preliminary studies showed that phenyllactic and 4-hydroxy-phenyllactic acids were also contained in the bacterial culture filtrate of strain 20b. growth of a. niger ftdc3227 occurred after 2 days in breads started with saccharomyces cerevisiae 141 alone or with s. cerevisiae and lactobacillus brevis 1d, an unselected but acidifying lactic acid  bacterium, while the onset of fungal growth was delayed for 7 days in bread started with s. cerevisiae and selected l. plantarum 21b.

TI  == [cloning and gene expression in lactic acid bacteria].
AB  == the possibility of using the genera lactobacillus and lactococcus as vector representatives is widely discussed at present. the prospects of the construction of recombinant bacteria are closely connected with the solution of a number of problems: the level of the transcription of cloned genes, the effectiveness of the translation of heterologous mrna, the stability of protein with respect to bacterial intracellular proteases, the method by protein molecules leave the cell (by secretion or as the result of lysis). to prevent segregation instability, the construction of vector molecules on the basis of stable cryptic plasmids found in wild strains of lactic acid bacteria was proposed. high copying plasmids with low molecular weight were detected in l. plantarum and l. pentosus strains. several plasmids with molecular weights of 1.7, 1.8 and 2.3 kb were isolated from bacterial cells to be used as the basis for the construction of vector molecules. genes of chloramphenicol- and erythromycin-resistance from staphylococcus aureus  plasmids were used as marker genes ensuring cell transformation. the vector plasmids thus constructed exhibited high transformation activity in the electroporation of different strains, including l. casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum and l. brevis which could be classified with the replicons of a wide circle of hosts. but the use of these plasmids was limited due to the risk of the uncontrolled dissemination of recombinant plasmids. l. acidophilus were also found to have strictly specific plasmids with good prospects of being used as the basis for the creation of vectors, incapable of dissemination. in addition to the search of strain-specific plasmids, incapable of uncontrolled gene transmission, the use of chromosome-integrated heterologous  genes is recommended in cloning to ensure the maximum safety.

TI  == arabinose fermentation by lactobacillus plantarum in sourdough with added pentosans and alphaalpha-l-arabinofuranosidase: a tool to increase the production of acetic acid.
AB  == sixty-five strains of obligately and facultatively heterofermentative sourdough lactic acid bacteria were screened for their capacity to grow optimally in the presence of arabinose, ribose and xylose as carbon sources. lactobacillus alimentarius 15f, lact. brevis 10a, lact. fermentum 1f and lact. plantarum 20b showed higher growth rate, cell yield, acidification rate and production of acetic acid when some pentoses instead of maltose were added to the sdb medium. lactobacillus plantarum 20b used arabinose also in a synthetic medium where complex growth factors such as yeast extract were omitted. other lact. plantarum  strains did not show the same property. pentosan extract was treated with alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase from aspergillus niger or endo-xylanase from bacillus subtilis to produce hydrolysates containing mainly arabinose and xylose, respectively. in particular, the hydrolysate containing arabinose substantiated the growth and the production of lactic acid and, especially, of acetic acid by lact. plantarum 20b. sourdough fermentation by lact. plantarum 20b with addition  of pentosan extract and alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase increased the acidification rate, titratable acidity and acetic acid content compared with traditional sourdough. a facultatively heterofermentative strain, lact. plantarum 20b, also produced a sourdough with an optimal fermentation quotient.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic characterization of non-starter lactic acid bacteria in  mature cheddar cheese.
AB  == non-starter lactic acid bacteria were isolated from 14 premium-quality and 3 sensorially defective mature irish cheddar cheeses, obtained from six manufacturers. from countable plates of lactobacillus-selective agar, 20 single isolated colonies were randomly picked per cheese. all 331 viable isolates were biochemically characterized as mesophilic (i.e., group ii) lactobacillus spp. phenotypically, the isolates comprised 96.4% l. paracasei, 2.1% l. plantarum, 0.3% l. curvatus, 0.3% l. brevis, and 0.9% unidentified species. randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis was used to rapidly identify the dominant strain groups in nine cheeses from three of the factories, and through clustering by the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages, an average of seven strains were found per cheese. in general, strains isolated from cheese produced at the same factory clustered together. the majority of isolates  associated with premium-quality cheese grouped together and apart from clusters of strains from defective-quality cheese. no correlation was found between the isomer of lactate produced and rapd profiles, although isolates which did not ferment ribose clustered together. the phenotypic and genotypic methods employed  were validated with a selection of 31 type and reference strains of mesophilic lactobacillus spp. commonly found in cheddar cheese. rapd analysis was found to be a useful and rapid method for identifying isolates to the species level. the low homology exhibited between rapd banding profiles for cheese isolates and collection strains demonstrated the heterogeneity of the l. paracasei complex.

AB  == two bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus plantarum tmw1.25 have been purified by a four-step purification procedure, including ammonium sulphate precipitation  and cation-exchange chromatography followed by hydrophobic-interaction chromatography on octyl sepharose. the final purification was performed by repeated reversed-phase chromatography steps which yielded two bacteriocin fractions designated plantaricin 1.25 alpha and plantaricin 1.25 beta. the molecular masses of the peptides in these fractions were 5979 and 5203 da, respectively. combination of the fractions did not have any synergistic effects on bacteriocin activity, indicating that they each contain a one-peptide bacteriocin. the major peptide in the alpha fraction was blocked at its n-terminus, and a partial sequence (25 residues) could only be obtained after cleavage with cnbr. this sequence did not show clear homologies with known bacteriocins. the beta peptide has been sequenced almost completely and consists, presumably, of 53 residues. this peptide displayed strong homology to the known n-terminal part of brevicin 27 produced by lactobacillus brevis sb27. the results showed that the beta peptide contains as many as six consecutive lysine residues  at the n-terminus.

AB  == a cassette based on the expression signals of the lactobacillus brevis surface (s)-layer protein gene (slpa) was constructed. the low-copy-number vector pkth2095, derived from pgk12, was used as the cloning vector. the efficiency of slpa promoters in intracellular protein production was studied using three reporter genes, beta-glucuronidase (gusa), luciferase (luc) and aminopeptidase n  (pepn) in three different lactic acid bacteria hosts: lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus gasseri. the s-layer promoters were recognized in each strain and especially l. lactis and lb. plantarum exhibited high levels of transcripts. the production kinetics of reporter proteins was studied as a function of growth. the gusa, luc and pepn activities varied considerably among the lactic acid bacterial strains studied. the highest levels  of beta-glucuronidase and luciferase activity were obtained in l. lactis. the level of gusa obtained in l. lactis corresponded to over 15% of the total cellular proteins. the highest level of aminopeptidase n activity was achieved in lb. plantarum where pepn corresponded up to 28% of the total cellular proteins at the late exponential phase of growth. this level of pepn activity is 30-fold higher than that in lb. helveticus, which is the species from which the pepn gene originates.

TI  == molecular cloning and functional expression in lactobacillus plantarum 80 of xylt, encoding the d-xylose-h+ symporter of lactobacillus brevis.
AB  == a 3-kb region, located downstream of the lactobacillus brevis xyla gene (encoding d-xylose isomerase), was cloned in escherichia coli tg1. the sequence revealed two open reading frames which could code for the d-xylulose kinase gene (xylb) and another gene (xylt) encoding a protein of 457 amino acids with significant similarity to the d-xylose-h+ symporters of e. coli, xyle (57%), and bacillus megaterium, xylt (58%), to the d-xylose-na+ symporter of tetragenococcus halophila, xyle (57%), and to the l-arabinose-h+ symporter of e. coli, arae (60%). the l. brevis xylabt genes showed an arrangement similar to that of the b. megaterium xylabt operon and the t. halophila xylabe operon. southern hybridization performed with the lactobacillus pentosus xylr gene (encoding the d-xylose repressor protein) as a probe revealed the existence of a xylr homologue in l. brevis which is not located with the xyabt locus. the existence of a functional xylr was further suggested by the presence of xylo sequences upstream  of xyla and xylt and by the requirement of d-xylose for the induction of d-xylose isomerase, d-xylulose kinase, and d-xylose transport activities in l. brevis. when l. brevis was cultivated in a mixture of d-glucose and d-xylose, the d-xylose isomerase and d-xylulose kinase activities were reduced fourfold and the d-xylose transport activity was reduced by sixfold, suggesting catabolite repression by d-glucose of d-xylose assimilation. the xylt gene was functionally  expressed in lactobacillus plantarum 80, a strain which lacks proton motive force-linked d-xylose transport activity. the role of the xylt protein was confirmed by the accumulation of d-xylose in l. plantarum 80 cells, and this accumulation was dependent on the proton motive force generated by either malolactic fermentation or by the metabolism of d-glucose. the apparent affinity  constant of xylt for d-xylose was approximately 215 microm, and the maximal initial velocity of transport was 35 nmol/min per mg (dry weight). furthermore, of a number of sugars tested, only 6-deoxy-d-glucose inhibited the transport of d-xylose by xylt competitively, with a ki of 220 microm.

TI  == electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases, a new tool for bacterial species identification: application to 10 lactobacillus species.
AB  == lactobacilli have been used as industrial starters for a long time, but in many cases their phenotypic identification is still neither easy nor reliable. previously we observed that the cell wall peptidoglycan hydrolases of lactobacillus helveticus were highly conserved enzymes; the aim of the present work was to determine whether peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns obtained by renaturing sds-page could be of interest in the identification of lactobacilli species. for that purpose, the peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns of 94 strains of  lactobacilli belonging to 10 different species were determined; most of the species studied are used either in dairy, meat, bakery or vegetable fermentations: l. helveticus, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii, l. brevis, l. fermentum, l. jensenii, l. plantarum, l. sake, l. curvatus and l. reuteri. within a species, the strains exhibited highly similar patterns: the apparent molecular  weights of the lytic bands were identical, with only slight variations of intensity. moreover, each species, including phylogenetically close species such  as l. sake and l. curvatus, or l. acidophilus and l. helveticus, gave a different pattern. interestingly, the closer the species were phylogenetically, the more related were their patterns. the sensitivity of the method was checked using various quantities of l. acidophilus cells: a peptidoglycan hydrolase extract of  5 x 10(6) cells was sufficient to obtain an informative pattern, as was a single  colony. finally, the method was also successfully applied to distinguish two carnobacterium species. in conclusion, the electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases is proposed as a new tool for lactobacilli identification: it is rapid, sensitive and effective even for phylogenetically close species. furthermore, this work provides the first evidence of the potential overall taxonomic value of bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases.

TI  == high level heterologous protein production in lactococcus and lactobacillus using a new secretion system based on the lactobacillus brevis s-layer signals.
AB  == a secretion cassette, based on the expression and secretion signals of a s-layer  protein (slpa) from lactobacillus brevis, was constructed. e. coli beta-lactamase (bla) was used as the reporter protein to determine the functionality of the s-layer signals for heterologous expression and secretion in lactococcus lactis,  lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus casei using a low-copy-number plasmid derived from pgk12. in all hosts tested, the bla gene was expressed under the slpa signals and all bla activity was secreted to the culture medium. the lb. brevis s-layer promoters were very efficiently recognized in l. lactis, lb. brevis and lb. plantarum, whereas in lb. gasseri the slpa promoter region appeared to be recognized at a lower level and in lb. casei the level of transcripts was below the detection limit. the production of bla was mainly restricted to the exponential phase of growth. the highest yield of bla was obtained with l. lactis and lb. brevis. without ph control, substantial degradation of bla occurred during prolonged cultivations with all lactic acid bacteria (lab) tested. when growing l. lactis and lb. brevis under ph control, the bla activity could be stabilized also at the stationary phase. l. lactis produced up to 80 mg/l of bla which to our knowledge  represents the highest amount of a heterologous protein secreted by lab so far. the short production phase implied a very high rate of secretion with a calculated value of 5 x 10(5) bla molecules/cell per h. such a high rate was also observed with lb. plantarum, whereas in lb. brevis the competition between the wild type slpa gene and the secretion construct probably lowered the rate of bla  production. the results obtained indicate wide applicability of the lb. brevis slpa signals for efficient protein production and secretion in lab.

TI  == lactic acid fermentation of cassava dough into agbelima.
AB  == the souring of cassava dough during fermentation into the fermented cassava meal, agbelima, was investigated. four different types of traditional inocula were used to ferment the dough and increases in titrable acidity expressed as lactic acid from 0.31-0.38 to 0.78-0.91% (w/w) confirmed the fermentation to be a process of  acidification. the microflora of all inocula and fermenting dough contained high  counts of lactic acid bacteria, 10(8)-10(9) cfu/g in all inocula and 10(7)-10(8), 10(8)-10(9) and 10(9) cfu/g at 0, 24 and 48 h in all fermentations. lactobacillus plantarum was the dominant species of lactic acid bacteria during all types of fermentation accounting for 51% of 171 representative isolates taken from various stages of fermentation. other major lactic acid bacteria found were lactobacillus brevis, 16%, leuconostoc mesenteroides, 15% and some cocci including streptococcus spp. whose numbers decreased with fermentation time. the lactic acid bacteria were responsible for the souring of agbelima through the production of lactic acid. all l. plantarum, l. brevis and l. mesenteroides isolates examined demonstrated linamarase as well as other enzymatic activities but did not possess tissue degrading enzymes like cellulase, pectin esterase and polygalacturonase. the aroma profile of agbelima did not vary with the type of inoculum used and in all samples the build-up of aroma compounds were dominated by a non-identified low molecular weight alcohol, 1-propanol, isoamyl alcohol, ethyl acetate, 3-methyl-1-butanol and acetoin. substantial reductions occurred in the levels of cyanogenic compounds present in cassava during fermentation into agbelima and detoxification was enhanced by the use of inoculum.

AB  == lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus, and lactobacillus paraplantarum  (m.-c. curk, j.-c. hubert, and f. bringel, int. j. syst. bacteriol. 46:595-598, 1996) can hardly be distinguished on the basis of their phenotypes. unlike l. plantarum and l. paraplantarum, l. pentosus ferments glycerol and xylose but not  melezitose. we identified two l. pentosus strains (cnrz 1538 and cnrz 1544) which ferment glycerol and melezitose but not xylose. alpha-methyl-d-mannoside was fermented by 66% of the l. plantarum strains tested but not by l. paraplantarum strains. in this paper we describe a simple method to identify l. plantarum, l. pentosus, and l. paraplantarum. this method is based on nonradioactive southern-type hybridization between bgli dna digests of the lactobacilli tested and a dna probe (l. plantarum pyrdfe genes from strain ccm 1904). a total of 68 lactobacilli were classified into five groups on the basis of the bands detected. two groups contained l. plantarum strains; one of these groups contained 31 strains, including the type strain, and was characterized by bands at 7, 4, and 1 kb, and the other group contained strain lp 85-2 and was characterized by bands at 5 and 1.1 kb. only one band (a band at around 7 kb) was detected in the strains belonging to the l. pentosus group, and two bands (at 4 and 1 kb) were found in the strains belonging to the l. paraplantarum group. no hybridization was detected in the last group, which contained lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus coryniformis, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and lactobacillus leichmannii strains.

TI  == microbiology of mesu, a traditional fermented bamboo shoot product.
AB  == the use of mesu as a pickle and as the base of curry is a tradition in the darjeeling hills and sikkim of india. a total of 327 strains of lactic acid bacteria, representing lactobacillus plantarum, l. brevis and pediococcus pentosaceus were isolated from 30 samples of mesu. these species were present in  all samples of raw bamboo shoots tested. mesu was dominated by l. plantarum followed by l. brevis; p. pentosaceus was isolated less frequently and recovered  from only 40-50% of the mesu samples. the fermentation was initiated by p. pentosaceus, followed by l. brevis, and finally succeeded by l. plantarum species. during fermentation, the titratable acidity increased from 0.04 to 0.95%, resulting in the decline in ph from 6.4 to 3.8.

TI  == interaction between lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in sour-dough using a rheofermentometer.
AB  == rheofermentometer assays were used to characterize the leavening of sour-doughs produced using species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts, alone or in combination. saccharomyces cerevisiae 141 produced the most co2 and ethanol whereas s. exiguus m14 and lactobacillus brevis subsp. lindneri cb1 contributed poorly to leavening and gave sour-doughs without porosity. in comparison with that seen in sour-dough produced with yeast alone, yeast fermentation with heterofermentative lab present was faster whereas that with homofermentative lab  (l. plantarum dc400, l. farciminis cf3) present was slower and produced more co2. combining l. brevis subsp. lindneri cb1 with s. cerevisiae 141 decreased bacterial cell numbers and souring activity. however, addition of fructose to the sour-dough overcame these problems as well as activating s. cerevisiae 141.

TI  == the antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria from fermented maize (kenkey)  and their interactions during fermentation.
AB  == a total of 241 lactic acid bacteria belonging to lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus fermentum/reuteri and lactobacillus brevis from various processing stages of maize dough fermentation were investigated. results indicated that each processing stage has its own microenvironment with strong antimicrobial activity. about half of the lact. plantarum and practically  all of the lact. fermentum/reuteri investigated were shown to inhibit other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, explaining the elimination of these organisms during the initial processing stages. further, widespread microbial interactions amounting to 85% to 18% of all combinations tested were demonstrated amongst lactic acid bacteria within the various processing stages, i.e. raw material, steeping, 0 h and 48 h of fermentation, explaining the microbial succession taking place amongst lactic acid bacteria during fermentation. the antimicrobial effect was explained by the combined effect of acids, compounds sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and other compounds with antimicrobial activity  with the acid production being the most important factor. the pattern of antimicrobial factors was not species-specific and the safety and storage stability of fermented maize seem to depend on a mixed population of lactic acid  bacteria with different types of antimicrobial characteristics. this means that introduction of pure cultures as starters may impose a risk to the product.

TI  == the lysins of bacteriophages infecting lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == this short review highlights the complete absence of literature on lysins of bacteriophages infecting species like s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus, pediococcus and leuconostoc species, l. helveticus, l. acidophilus, l. plantarum  and l. brevis, which are also widely used in the dairy industry. the lysins described share some similar biochemical characteristics: optimal ph and temperature, site of hydrolysis inside the peptidoglycan, and some activators and inhibitors. the cloning of the genes encoding these lysins only began in the last few years and four of them have been completely sequenced. in the future, these lysin genes could be interestingly compared to the host autolysin(s) gene(s). by  contrast, the passage of phage lysins through the cytoplasmic membrane of the host cell in order to reach the peptidoglycan (via a signal sequence or the presence of a holin) seems not to be clearly resolved. the presence of a second open-reading frame upstream from the gene of the lysin, enabling a putative holin to be encoded, has already been suggested. no doubt our ever increasing knowledge about bacteriophage genome organization will help to elucidate this question. meanwhile the obtention of a lactococcus strain with an autolytic phenotype, using a bacteriophage lysin gene, as well as the successful use of purified pl1 lysin to obtain protoplasts of l. casei encourage us to continue to explore the field of bacteriophage lysins.

TI  == characterisation of lactic acid bacteria isolated from naturally fermented greek  dry salami.
AB  == a total of 348 lactic acid bacteria isolated from five batches of naturally fermented dry salami at various stages of ripening were characterised. the majority of the strains were assigned to two main phylogenetic groups of species: (i) the psychrotrophic, formerly called atypical, meat streptobacteria (169 strains) and (ii) a new genus weissella (120), which was recently proposed (collins et al., 1993) to include leuconostoc paramesenteroides and some other closely related species. meat streptobacteria were identified as lactobacillus curvatus (88 strains) and l. sake (76), whereas 5 strains were indistinguishable  and, thus designated l. sake/curvatus. non-psychrotrophic streptobacteria were also isolated and identified as l. plantarum (34 strains), l. farciminis (10), l. coryniformis (1) and l. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (1). the majority of the weissella strains (86) were leuconostoc-like bacteria; four of them were identified as w. viridescens, 11 belonged to the newly described w. hellenica (collins et al., 1993), another 11 resembled w. paramesenteroides, whereas 60 isolates were not classified to any species. the latter group comprised strains that produced d(l)-lactate. the remaining weissella were gas-forming, arginine-positive rods assigned to w. minor (31) and w. halotolerans (3). other species identified were enterococcus faecium (10), leuconostoc mesenteroides (1), l. brevis (1) and pediococcus sp. (1). the main criteria used to distinguish between above species as well as their distribution on the five salami batches in relation to their succession with time and suitability as starters were discussed.

TI  == regulation of acetic acid production by homo- and heterofermentative lactobacilli in whole-wheat sour-doughs.
AB  == the efficiency of sour-dough as a possible preservative agent of microbial spoilage of bread depends on its acetic acid content. as a secondary metabolite of sugar fermentation by lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid may be promoted in the presence of o2 or h+ acceptors. this paper studies the influence of o2 and high fructose content products (pure sugar, invert sugar, fructose syrup) addition on  acetic acid production by hetero- (lactobacillus brevis 25a, b-21, l-62; l. sanfrancisco l-99) and homofermentative (l. plantarum b-39) lactobacilli in whole-wheat sour-doughs [280 and 250 dough yield (dy)]. the ph and total titratable acidity (tta) of sour-doughs after 44 h fermentation varied with dy and strain. as expected, the addition of o2 promoted greater increases in tta with heterofermentative lactobacilli (15-42%) than with l. plantarum (15%). fructose addition was only effective for heterofermentative strains, but the overall effects were smaller than those observed for oxygenation. the ability of  lactobacilli to produce acetic acid in sour-doughs without treatment varied from  0.16 g/100 g flour at 44 h (b-39, 280, 350 dy) to 0.47-0.65% (l-62, 280, 350 dy). the production of acetic acid was positively promoted by all treatments. oxygenation was again the most effective way of inducing acetic acid production;  increases ranged from 54% (b-21) to 269% (l-99, 350 dy). the addition of h+ acceptors had variable effects.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == a total of 712 strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from forage grasses were  studied for their ability to ferment fructans of phlein- as well as inulin-type.  only 16 strains utilized phlein and eight of these also fermented inulin. they were identified as lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, lact. plantarum, lact. brevis and pediococcus pentosaceus. in the species lact. paracasei subsp. paracasei, all strains gave positive results, whereas the other positive strains  possessed unique properties within their own species. in all but two cases (strains of the species lact. plantarum), the phlein was more intensively fermented than the inulin, as indicated by a lower ph and a higher lactic acid concentration. on the basis of the outcome of this study it seems worthwhile to inoculate grasses of low sugar content before ensiling with an active strain that can ferment fructans.

AB  == the uptake kinetics of sugars present in wheat doughs and alpha-glucosidase as well as beta-fructosidase activities were determined in different strains of yeasts and lactic acid bacteria. these strains were previously selected according to their breadmaking quality. saccharomyces cerevisiae (p6), candida guilliermondii (p40), lactobacillus plantarum (b31 and la18) and l. brevis (b21)  showed good performance, while sacch. fructuum (p43), l. cellobiosus (b37) and enterococcus faecium (b11) yielded bread of lower quality. leuconostoc mesenteroides (b10), when used in combination with other strains led also to high quality starters. all yeast strains used assimilated glucose, fructose and maltose, exhibiting saturable kinetics. lactic acid bacteria showed saturable kinetics only for hexoses, whereas disaccharide uptake was linear. sacch. cerevisiae, leuconostoc mesenteroides, l. brevis and l. plantarum (b31) displayed better sugar uptake properties. for all the strains used alpha-glucosidase and beta-fructosidase activities were detected. the highest specific activities were  found for sacch. cerevisiae, c. guilliermondii and l. plantarum (b31). these results indicate good correlation between the parameters evaluated and the breadmaking potential of the microorganisms.

TI  == accelerated natural lactic fermentation of cereal-based formulas at reduced water activity.
AB  == energy required to dehydrate fermented cereal-based food formulas plays a significant part in the production cost. therefore the effect of reduced moisture content on the fermentation was investigated. generally, lactic fermentation at reduced moisture content resulted in increased final ph. significant acidification still occurred at 0.33 kg water/kg dry matter corresponding to either aw = 0.925 in a sorghum-maize-soya (sms) mixture, or aw = 0.950 in a sorghum-maize-milk powder (smm) mixture. acidification adequate for microbiological safety (ph < or = 4.5) was achieved at 0.54 kg water/kg dm in sms (aw = 0.950) and 0.43 kg/kg dm in smm (aw = 0.965). in stable accelerated natural lactic fermentations obtained by inoculum recycling ('back-slopping') at 30 degrees c, dominant lactic acid bacteria included lactobacillus plantarum, l. brevis, l. acidophilus and lactococcus lactis. dominating yeasts were saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida krusei. l. plantarum isolated from high-moisture (1.5 kg/kg dry matter) sms fermentations had higher specific growth rates than l. plantarum isolated from reduced moisture (0.54 kg/kg dm) sms fermentations, when tested under similar aw conditions. this effect was not caused by previous culturing conditions; probably different strains of l. plantarum having different aw-optima dominate at high or reduced moisture conditions.

TI  == incompatibility of lactobacillus vectors with replicons derived from small cryptic lactobacillus plasmids and segregational instability of the introduced vectors.
AB  == three new lactobacillus vectors based on cryptic lactobacillus plasmids were constructed. the shuttle vector plp3537 consists of a 2.3-kb plasmid from lactobacillus pentosus md353, an erythromycin resistance gene from staphylococcus aureus plasmid pe194, and puc19 as a replicon for escherichia coli. the vectors plpe317 and plpe323, which do not contain e. coli sequences, were generated by introducing the erythromycin resistance gene of pe194 into a 1.7- and a 2.3-kb plasmid from l. pentosus md353, respectively. these vectors and the shuttle vector plp825 (m. posno, r. j. leer, j. m. m. van rijn, b. c. lokman, and p. h. pouwels, p. 397-401, in a. t. ganesan and j. a. hoch, ed., genetics and biotechnology of bacilli, vol. 2, 1988) could be introduced by electroporation into lactobacillus casei, l. pentosus, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, and l. brevis strains with similar efficiencies. transformation efficiencies were strain dependent and varied from 10 to 10 transformants per mug of dna. plasmid dna analysis of l. pentosus md353 transformants revealed that the introduction of plp3537 or plpe323 was invariably accompanied by loss of the endogenous 2.3-kb plasmid. remarkably, plpe317 could only be introduced into an l. pentosus md353 strain that had been previously cured of its endogenous 1.7-kb  plasmid. the curing phenomena are most likely to be explained by the incompatibility of the vectors and resident plasmids. lactobacillus vectors are generally rapidly lost when cells are cultivated in the absence of selective pressure. however, plpe323 is stable in three of four lactobacillus strains tested so far.

TI  == fermentation patterns of forage sorghum ensiled under different environmental conditions.
AB  == the effects of temperature, aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the silo and plant characteristics [water-soluble carbohydrate (wsc) contents, growing season] on the fermentation characteristics of a tropical forage species, sorghum bicolor cv. sugar-drip, were investigated. silages fermented in oxygen-impermeable bags were well preserved and had low ph (3.7), high lactic acid [72 g kg(-1) dry matter (dm) identical with 80% of total acids], and low butyric acid (0.12 g kg(-1) dm) and ammonia nitrogen (nh3-n) (57 g kg(-1) total nitrogen contents. conversely, the use of oxygen-permeable bags as silos allowed aerobic decomposition of the ensiled forages. increasing the incubation temperature lowered the population of lactic acid bacteria, reduced lactic acid production and caused the ph to rise. the heterofermentative leuconostoc spp. predominated on fresh forages but homofermentative lactobacillus plantarum began to dominate after 5 and 8 days of fermentation. heterofermentative lactobacilli, notably lactobacillus brevis, were dominant among the isolates obtained from 100-day silages. varying the wsc contents, by crushing and/or chopping the forage, and growing season did not significantly affect the fermentation quality of the resulting silages. it was concluded that the maintenance of anaerobic conditions  is essential if good quality silage is to be produced from tropical forage species.

TI  == ecology of accelerated natural lactic fermentation of sorghum-based infant food formulas.
AB  == accelerated natural lactic fermentation of mixed sorghum-cowpea (formula 1) and sorghum-milkpowder (formula 2) infant food formulas was achieved by repetitive (60 fermentation cycles of 24 h each) use of the previous batch as an inoculum at a rate of 10% (w/w) and resulted in a gradual establishment of mixed populations  of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts. in formula 1, early fermentation stages (fermentation cycles 1-4) were dominated by leuconostoc and lactococcus spp. which caused conditions inhibitive to yeasts. probably due to micronutrient deficiencies, the former lactic acid bacteria were succeeded by a combination of  lactobacillus plantarum and candida spp. achieving ph values 4.2-4.3. in formula  2, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus brevis consistently achieved ph 3.7-3.8, thereby allowing only a minority of yeasts, mainly candida and trichosporon spp. none of the isolated yeasts exhibited 'killer'-activity.

AB  == nucleic acid composition of 17 cultures representing the type or neotype strains  of 15 named lactobacillus species was studied. nucleic acid characterization of these isolates was accompanied by a comparative study of conventional phenotypic  reactions. the overall guanine plus cytosine mean deoxyribonucleic acid base composition ranged from 33 to 50% and genome sizes varied between 700 and 1500 x  10(6) daltons. sporolactobacillus inulinus contained 2500 x 10(6) daltons of chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid and was therefore similar in size to members of the genus bacillus. deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization at a temperature 15 degrees c below the thermal melting temperature confirmed the extreme molecular heterogeneity of many species. the genus can be divided into three major groups,  each containing four or more species based on a combination of nucleic acid characteristics and conventional phenotypic reactions. group i (33 to 39% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus helveticus nov. ssp. jugurt, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus sanfrancisco. group ii (42 to 48% guanine plus cytosine contains lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus brevis, and group iii (48 to 50% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. leichmanii, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus fermentum nov. ssp. cellobiosis.

TI  == [the microflora of sourdough. xix. the effect of temperature and dough yield on the proteolytic effect of lactic acid bacteria in sourdough].
AB  == during fermentation of sour dough the flour proteins are degraded. the proteolysis depends not only on lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus plantarum, l. brevis ssp. lindneri, l. fructivorans) but also on the conditions of fermentation of the sour dough. an increase of temperatures between 25 degrees c and 35 degrees c causes an increase in the amino acid content. the water content of the  dough (t.a. 150/t.a. 210) influences the proteolytic activity of the bacteria to  a lesser degree.

AB  == acidification of the dough by the use of sourdough or acidifiers is necessary not only for good baking quality of rye flour but it is also very important for development of the typical sensory characteristics of rye bread. we confirmed that the lactic acid bacteria of sour dough are proteolytic. proteolytic effects  are observed in the increase of the amino acid content during fermentation. a marked increase was found in the content of leucine, alanine, valine, isoleucine, glutamic acid, glutamine, arginine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, tyrosine and serine. lactobacillus plantarum showed a higher proteolytic activity than l.  brevis ssp. lindneri or l. fructivorans.

AB  == in commercial vacuum-packed bologna, growth of brochothrix thermosphacta was limited at 5 degrees c during a 4-week storage period. factors controlling the growth of this organism were associated in part with certain lactobacilli isolated from the meat. the lactic acid bacteria associated with the decline of b. thermosphacta and overall spoilage of vacuum-packed bologna were isolated and  identified. the principal organisms were lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus buchneri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus viridescens, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and certain streptococci. in associated growth experiments with b. thermosphacta at 5 and 15 degrees c, l. brevis and l. plantarum showed the greatest antagonism towards the brochothrix species. studies with changes in incubation temperatures (5 or 15 degrees c) or nitrite levels (0-50 microgram/ml) indicated that these two factors influence the antagonism but were minor compared with the influence of the lactic acid bacteria.

AB  == the reassembly of tetragonally arranged subunits in the cell wall of lactobacillus brevis and the reattachment of the subunits to cell wall fragments  were investigated by electron microscopy. the subunits dissociated from the cell  wall with guanidine hydrochloride (ghcl) reassembled into the same regular array  as seen in native cell wall after dialysis against neutral buffer even in the absence of specific cations. the subunits could also reattach to the cell wall fragments from which they had been removed by treatment with ghcl, sodium dodecyl sulfate or cold trichloroacetic acid but not to those treated with hot formamide. heterologous reattachment of the subunits occurred on cell wall fragments obtained from l. fermentum but not on those from l plantarum or l. casei subsp. casei. on the basis of these observations and chemical analyses of the cell wall  fragments, the subunits of l. brevis appeared to be bound by hydrogen bonds to a  neutral polysaccharide moiety in the cell wall but not to peptidoglycan or teichoic acid.

TI  == degradation of organic acids by dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == one hundred and twelve different strains of lactic acid bacteria, belonging to the genera leuconostoc, streptococcus, and lactobacillus, were examined for the ability to degrade 10 organic acids by detecting gas production, using the conventional durham tube method. all the strains did not break down succinate, glutarate, 2-oxo-glutarate, and mucate. malate, citrate, pyruvate, fumarate, tartrate, and gluconate were variably attacked. streptococcus cremoiris am2, ml8, and sk11 required glucose to produce gas from citrate, whereas leuconostoc citrovorum and streptococcus faecalis did not. streptococcus cremoris differed from the other streptococci in not producing gas from gluconate. from all lactic  acid bacteria examined, only lactobacillus plantarum formed gas from tartarate. determination of acetoin and diacetyl proved to be a more reliable evidence for assessing the degradation of pyruvate, compared with detection of gas production. homofermentative lactobacilli and leuconostoc citrovorum produced acetoin and diacetyl from pyruvate, whereas beta-bacteria did not, a character that would be  of taxonomic value. streptobacteria degraded pyruvate in the presence of glucose  with lactate as the major product together with a mean acetate of 4.1%, ethanol 7.9%, acetoin 1.7%, and diacetyl 2.6% yield on a molar basis after 60 days at 30  degrees c. l. brevis produced acetate and lactate. formation of diacetyl from pyruvate by lactic acid bacteria may play an important role in flavour development in fermenting dairy products, especially in cheese, where lactic acid bacteria usually predominate, and pyruvate is probably excreted in the breaking down of lactose and in the oxidative deamination of alanine by the accompanying microflora.

TI  == adjuvanticity of lactobacilli. i. differential effects of viable and killed bacteria.
AB  == the adjuvanticity of lactobacillus brevis and lactobacillus plantarum was the subject of this study. the latter was the better adjuvant in both delayed hypersensivity and antibody formation to sheep red blood cells. viable l. plantarum stimulated exclusively the delayed hypersensivity, where heat-killed bacteria had an adjuvant effect on antibody formation. for optimal adjuvant effects lactobacilli had to be injected in a dose of 10(8) into the same site as  the antigen. viable lactobacilli and to a lesser degree heat-killed bacteria induce hepato-splenomegaly, suggesting mediation of the adjuvant activity by the  reticuloendothelial system. granuloma formation with mainly mononuclear cell infiltrates could be observed after subcutaneous administration of viable lactobacilli whereas heat-killed lactobacilli induced granulomata containing about equal numbers of granulocytes and mononuclear cells. the possible clinical  application of l. plantarium in the immunotherapy of tumours is suggested.

TI  == bloater formation by gas-forming lactic acid bacteria in cucumber fermentations.
AB  == the formation of "bloaters" (hollow stock) in cucumbers brined for salt-stock purposes at 5 to 10% salt has been associated with gaseous fermentation caused chiefly by yeasts. recently, serious early bloater damage, not attributable to yeasts, has been observed in commercial-scale experiments on control of bloaters  in overnight dill pickles brined in 50-gal barrels at 3.0 to 4.5% salt. growth of fermentative species of yeasts was effectively controlled by the addition of 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1% sorbic acid or its sodium salt. in contrast to this, the fermenting brines showed extremely high populations of acid-forming bacteria, identified as lactobacillus plantarum, l. brevis, and pediococcus cerevisiae. the gas-forming species (i.e., l. brevis) constituted a high proportion of the total  populations. representative isolates from 36 barrels of overnight dill pickles were tested for their ability to produce bloaters in 1-quart jars of pasteurized  cucumbers equilibrated at 4 to 5% salt, 0.25% lactic acid, and ph 4.0. bloaters,  identical with those made by yeast cultures, were produced in all jars inoculated with l. brevis. no bloaters were produced by l. plantarum and p. cerevisiae. these results suggest that the control of bloater damage in cucumber fermentations, particularly at low salt concentrations, may necessitate inhibition of gas-forming lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == occurrence of an inhibitor of lactic acid bacteria in green olives.
AB  == green olives were found to contain an inhibitor(s) of several species of lactic acid bacteria usually associated with the spanish-type brined olive fermentation. the inhibitor was demonstrated by the presence of inhibition zones surrounding tissue which had been cut from frozen olives and implanted in a seeded nutritive  agar medium. relative potencies of aqueous extracts of frozen olives were determined by a paper disc assay method. the mission variety of olive contained the most inhibitor, and the manzanillo and ascolano, about 50 and 40% as much as  the mission variety, respectively. sevillano and barouni varieties contained comparatively little inhibitor. effects of the inhibitor on growth rates of lactic acid bacteria were determined by adding various amounts of a concentrated  aqueous extract of olives to a nutritive broth medium contained in screw-capped tubes. of the four species of lactic acid bacteria tested, leuconostoc mesenteroides was the most sensitive, and lactobacillus plantarum was the least sensitive; pediococcus cerevisiae and lactobacillus brevis were intermediate in sensitivity. extracts possessed a bactericidal property, as evidenced by their effect on l. mesenteroides. sodium chloride, especially at concentrations of about 5% and higher, greatly increased the effectiveness of the inhibitor. the inhibitor was ethyl alcohol-soluble and was stable when heated at 100 c in aqueous solution. potencies of extracts were reduced greatly by adjustment to ph  10, but no appreciable effect was noted by adjustment to ph 0.8.

TI  == pure culture fermentation of green olives.
AB  == the method previously developed by us for the pure-culture fermentation of brined cucumbers and other vegetables has been applied successfully to manzanillo variety olives. field-run grade fruit was processed first by conventional procedures to remove most of the bitterness. then the relative abilities of lactobacillus plantarum, l. brevis, pediococcus cerevisiae, and leuconostoc mesenteroides to become established and produce acid in both heat-shocked (74 c for 3 min) and unheated olives, brined at 4.7 to 5.9% nacl (w/v basis), were evaluated. the heat-shock treatment not only proved effective in ridding the fruit of naturally occurring, interfering, and competitive microbial groups prior to brining and inoculation, but also made the olives highly fermentable with respect to growth and acid production by the introduced culture, particularly l.  plantarum. of the four species used as inocula, l. plantarum was by far the most  vigorous in fermentation ability. it consistently produced the highest levels of  brine acidity (1.0 to 1.2% calculated as lactic acid) and the lowest ph values (3.8 to 3.9) during the fermentation of heat-shocked olives. also, l. plantarum completely dominated fermentations when used in two-species (with p. cerevisiae)  and three-species (with p. cerevisiae and l. brevis) combinations as inocula. in  contrast, when l. plantarum was inoculated into the brines of unheated olives it  failed to become properly established; the same was true for the other species tested, but even to a more pronounced degree. l. brevis was the only species used that failed to develop in brines of both heat-shocked and unheated olives. modification of the curing brine by the addition of lactic acid at the outset, either with or without dextrose, led to a much earlier onset of fermentation with accompanying acid development, as compared to treatments with dextrose alone or nonadditive controls. reasons for the marked improvement of the fermentability of manzanillo olives receiving the prebrining heat-shock treatment are discussed.

TI  == pure culture fermentation of brined cucumbers.
AB  == the relative abilities of pediococcus cerevisiae, lactobacillus plantarum, l. brevis, and several other species of lactic acid bacteria to grow and produce acid in brined cucumbers were evaluated in pure culture fermentations. such fermentations were made possibly by the use of two techniques, gamma radiation (0.83 to 1.00 mrad) and hot-water blanching (66 to 80 c for 5 min), designed first to rid the cucumbers of naturally occurring, interfering, and competitive microbial groups prior to brining, followed by inoculation with the desired lactic acid bacteria. of the nine species tested, strains of the three common to  cucumber fermentations, p. cerevisiae, l. plantarum, and l. brevis, grew to the highest populations, and produced the highest levels of brine acidity and the lowest ph values in fermentations at 5.4 to 5.6% nacl by weight; also, their sequence of active development in fermentations, with the use of a three-species  mixture for inoculation, was in the species order just named. this sequence of occurrence was similar to that estimated by others for natural fermentations. the rates of growth and acid production in fermentations with a mixture of p. cerevisiae, l. plantarum, and l. brevis increased as the incubation temperature was increased from 21 to 27 to 32 c; however, the maximal populations and acidities attained were essentially the same for fermentations at each temperature. further, these same three species were found to be the most salt tolerant of those tested; their upper limit for appreciable growth and measurable acid production was about 8% salt, whereas thermophilic species such as l. thermophilus, l. lactis, l. helveticus, l. fermenti, and l. delbrueckii exhibited a much lower salt tolerance, ranging from about 2.5 to 4.0%. however, certain strains of l. delbrueckii grew very rapidly in cucumbers brined at 2.5 to 3.0% salt, and produced sufficient acid in about 30 hr at 48 c to reduce the brine ph  from above 7.0 to below 4.0. an inexpensive, pure culture fermentor which was suitable for gamma radiation, resistant to salt and acid, and which permitted repeated aseptic sampling of the fermenting brine, is illustrated and the specifications are given.
