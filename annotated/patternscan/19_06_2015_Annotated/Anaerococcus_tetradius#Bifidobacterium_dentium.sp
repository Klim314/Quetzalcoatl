TI  == peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, mediastinitis, and nonclostridial anaerobic myonecrosis: a case report.
AB  == peritonsillar abscess is a potentially life-threatening complication of acute tonsillitis. on occasion, peritonsillar abscess can extend to neck spaces and/or  to the mediastinum. we describe a case of a patient with a peritonsillar abscess  that extended to the neck, producing bilateral retropharyngeal abscesses and myonecrosis of the strap muscles. culture of a specimen of the necrotic muscle yielded prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, lactobacillus catenaforme, another lactobacillus species, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and some nonanaerobes. culture of the peritonsillar abscess yielded p. intermedia and p. buccae plus p. anaerobius, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, bifidobacterium dentium, viridans and group f streptococci, and citrobacter diversus. culture of  the retropharyngeal abscess yielded fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces odontolyticus in addition to most of the aforementioned organisms. the patient underwent repeated drainage and debridement procedures and was treated with various antimicrobial agents and ultimately recovered. this case highlights the polymicrobial nature of peritonsillar abscess and the serious complications that  this infection may lead to.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of azithromycin, macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin and spiramycin) and streptogramin rp 59500 against oral organisms.
AB  == the in-vitro activities of azithromycin, clarithromycin, spiramycin and rp 59500  were compared with erythromycin against a wide range of oral organisms which have been implicated in oral infections and/or endocarditis (clindamycin was included  for oral streptococci). all compounds tested showed good activity against many of these organisms, although some variation was observed with different species. clarithromycin was the most active of the antibiotics tested against gram-positive anaerobes, including actinomyces spp., propionibacterium spp., lactobacillus spp. and bifidobacterium dentium. azithromycin was slightly less active than erythromycin against these species. in general, rp 59500 had higher mics than the macrolides, other than spiramycin, against these organisms, but was superior in activity against peptostreptococcus spp., inhibiting all isolates at  2 mg/l. azithromycin was, in general, the most active antibiotic tested against the gram-negative anaerobes: fusobacterium spp., bacteroides spp., wolinella spp., actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, selenomonas spp. and mitsuokella multiacida, including those isolates which were insusceptible to erythromycin. clarithromycin showed similar activity to erythromycin against most gram-negative species, but was superior against capnocytophaga ochraceus and eikenella corrodens. rp 59500 was less active than the macrolides against most gram-negative anaerobes, but was superior to erythromycin and clarithromycin against fusobacterium spp. and leptotrichia buccalis, some strains of which were  moderately resistant to erythromycin. the macrolides and clindamycin were about equally active against the oral streptococci, whereas rp 59500 showed lower inhibitory activity. the in-vitro results suggest that azithromycin and clarithromycin may be of value in the treatment of dental sepsis and the prophylaxis of endocarditis. rp 59500 showed useful activity against gram-positive anaerobes and, because of its bactericidal activity against oral streptococci, may also prove to have a role in these areas.
