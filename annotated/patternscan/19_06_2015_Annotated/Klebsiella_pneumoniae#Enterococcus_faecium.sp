TI  == bacteriology of spontaneous intra-abdominal abscess in patients with crohn disease in china: risk of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
AB  == background: crohn disease (cd) has its own features and the etiology is believed  to be related to the gastrointestinal flora, which are the cause of most intra-abdominal infections. however, few experiences have been reported regarding the specific bacteriology of spontaneous intra-abdominal abscess (iaa) in cd patients and related risk factors. in the present study, we aim to investigate the bacteriology of iaa in cd and the associated risk factors. methods: retrospective study on 97 cd patients suffering from iaa was performed from january 2007 to december 2012. microbiologic information of pus cultures was pooled, and logistic regression was applied to examine the possible factors affecting the incidence of common organisms and the bacteria producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl). results: of the 97 patients recruited, 151 aerobic bacteria were cultured from the pus of iaa. the leading bacteria were escherichia coli (57.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (19.6%) and enterococcus faecium  (18.6%). extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were more commonly found among cd patients receiving immunosuppressant. conclusions: broad-spectrum  antibiotics are recommended for treating iaa in cd. empirical antibiotic coverage against esbl-producing bacteria in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy is advocated. considering the predominance of enterococcus faecium, it may be advisable to use more effective antibiotics when gram-positive cocci are suspected.

TI  == bactericidal efficacy of atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (apntp) against  the eskape pathogens.
AB  == the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens within the clinical environment is presenting a mounting problem in hospitals worldwide. the 'eskape' pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp.) have been  highlighted as a group of causative organisms in a majority of nosocomial infections, presenting a serious health risk due to widespread antimicrobial resistance. the stagnating pipeline of new antibiotics requires alternative approaches to the control and treatment of nosocomial infections. atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (apntp) is attracting growing interest as an alternative infection control approach within the clinical setting. this study presents a comprehensive bactericidal assessment of an in-house-designed apntp jet both against biofilms and planktonic bacteria of the eskape pathogens. standard plate counts and the xtt metabolic assay were used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of apntp, with both methods demonstrating comparable eradication times. apntp exhibited rapid antimicrobial activity against all of the eskape pathogens in the planktonic mode of growth and provided efficient and  complete eradication of eskape pathogens in the biofilm mode of growth within 360s, with the exception of a. baumannii where a >4log reduction in biofilm viability was observed. this demonstrates its effectiveness as a bactericidal treatment against these pathogens and further highlights its potential application in the clinical environment for the control of highly antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.

TI  == repurposing non-antimicrobial drugs and clinical molecules to treat bacterial infections.
AB  == there is a pressing need to develop novel antimicrobials to circumvent the scourge of antimicrobial resistance. the objective of this study is to identify non-antibiotic drugs with potent antimicrobial activity, within an applicable clinical range. a library, containing 727 fda approved drugs and small molecules, was screened against eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobactercloacae). drugs that showed antimicrobial activity in an applicable clinical range were further tested in vitro and in vivo in an infected mouse model. the initial screening identified 24 non-antibiotic drugs and clinical molecules active against gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) isolates. two non-antibiotic drugs showed activity against gram-negative pathogens. among the active non-antibiotic drugs, only ebselen (eb) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (fdurd), showed bactericidal activity, in an applicable  clinical range, against multi-drug-resistant staphylococcus isolates including mrsa, vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa), and vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa).the minimum inhibitory concentration at which 90% of clinical isolates of s. aureus were inhibited (mic90) was found to be 0.25 and 0.0039mg/l  for eb and fdurd, respectively. treatment with eb orally significantly increased  mice survival in a lethal model of septicemic mrsa-infection by (60%) compared to that of control. fdurd oral and intraperitoneal treatment significantly enhanced  mouse survival by 60% and 100%, respectively. these data encourage screening and  repurposing of non-antibiotic drugs and clinical molecules to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.

TI  == the risk factors for mortality and septic shock in liver transplant recipients with eskape bacteremia.
AB  == background/aims: although bacteremias due to the six eskape pathogens have recently been identified as a serious emerging problems in solid organ transplant (sot), no information in liver transplant recipients is available. we sought to investigate the risk factors for mortality and septic shock in liver transplant recipients with eskape bacteremia. methodology: a retrospective analysis of bacteremia after liver transplantation was reviewed. risk factors for mortality and septic shock caused by eskape bacteremia were identified. results: forty-nine episodes ofbacteremia in 37 liver transplant recipients were due to eskape strains. the only factor for bacteremia-related mortality independently associated with eskape was septic shock (odds ratio [or] = 67.500, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 8.464-538.300, p < .001). the factors for septic shock independently associated with eskape were white blood cells count > 15,000/mm3 (or = 15.205, 95% ci = 2.271-101.799, p = .005) and temperature of 39 degrees c or greater (or = 10.959, 95% ci = 1.592-75.450, p = .015). conclusions: to improve the results of liver transplantation, more effectively therapeutic treatments are of paramount importance when liver transplant recipients with eskape bacteremia present with septic shock, elevated white blood cells count and high body temperature.

TI  == repurposing salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs to combat drug resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive bacterium that has become the leading cause of hospital acquired infections in the us. repurposing food and drug administration (fda) approved drugs for antimicrobial therapy involves lower risks and costs compared to de novo development of novel antimicrobial agents. in this study, we examined the antimicrobial properties of two commercially available anthelmintic drugs. the fda approved drug niclosamide and the veterinary drug oxyclozanide displayed strong in vivo and in vitro activity against methicillin resistant s. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic):  0.125 and 0.5 mug/ml respectively; minimum effective concentration: </= 0.78 mug/ml for both drugs). the two drugs were also effective against another gram-positive bacteria enterococcus faecium (mic 0.25 and 2 mug/ml respectively), but not against the gram-negative species klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter aerogenes. the in vitro antimicrobial activity of niclosamide and oxyclozanide were determined against methicillin, vancomycin, linezolid or daptomycin resistant s. aureus clinical isolates, with mics at 0.0625-0.5 and 0.125-2 mug/ml for niclosamide and oxyclozanide respectively. a time-kill study demonstrated that niclosamide is bacteriostatic, whereas oxyclozanide is bactericidal. interestingly, oxyclozanide permeabilized the bacterial membrane but neither of the anthelmintic drugs exhibited demonstrable toxicity to sheep erythrocytes. oxyclozanide was non-toxic to hepg2 human liver carcinoma cells within the range of its in vitro mics but niclosamide displayed toxicity even at low concentrations. these data show that the salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs niclosamide and oxyclozanide are suitable candidates for mechanism of action studies and further clinical evaluation for treatment of staphylococcal infections.

TI  == spectral and biological evaluation of a synthetic antimicrobial peptide derived from 1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid.
AB  == ac-gf(a6c)g(a6c)k(a6c)g(a6c)f(a6c)g(a6c)gk(a6c)kkkk-amide (a6c=1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid) is a synthetic antimicrobial peptide (amp) that exhibits in vitro inhibitory activity against drug resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterococcus faecium at concentrations ranging from 10.9 to 43mum. spectroscopic investigations were conducted to determine how this  amp interacts with simple membrane model systems in order to provide insight into possible mechanisms of action. cd and 2d-(1)h nmr experiments indicated this amp  on binding to sds and dpc micelles adopts conformations with varying percentages  of helical and random coil conformers. cd investigations in the presence of three phospholipid suvs consisting of popc, 4:1 popc/popg, and 60% pope/21%popg/19%popc revealed: (1) the interactions occurring with popc suvs have minimal effect on the conformational diversity of the amp yielding conformations similar to those observed in buffer. (2) the interactions with 4:1 popc/popg, and 60% pope/21%popg/19%popc suvs exhibited a greater influence on the percentage of different conformers contributing to the cd spectra. (3) the presence of a high of percentage of helical conformers was not observed in the presence of suvs as was the case with micelles. this data indicates that the diversity of surface bound conformations adopted by this amp are very different from the diversity of  conformations adopted by this amp on insertion into the lipid bilayer. cd spectra of this amp in the presence of suvs consisting of lps isolated from p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae and escherichia coli exhibited characteristics associated with various helical conformations.

TI  == development of novel antibacterial drugs to combat multiple resistant organisms.
AB  == background: infections due to multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria are increasing both in hospitals and in the community and are characterized by high mortality rates. new molecules are in development to face the need of active compounds toward resistant gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. in particular, the infectious diseases society of america (idsa) has supported the initiative to develop ten new antibacterials within 2020. principal targets are the so-called eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumanii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacteriaceae). purpose: to review the characteristics and the status of development of new antimicrobials including new cephalosporins, carbapenems, beta-lactamase inhibitors, aminoglycosides, quinolones, oxazolidones, glycopeptides, and tetracyclines. conclusions: while numerous new compounds target resistant gram-positive pathogens and have been approved for clinical use, very few new molecules are active against mdr gram-negative pathogens, especially carbapenemase producers. new glycopeptides and oxazolidinones are highly efficient against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), and new cephalosporins  and carbapenems also display activity toward mdr gram-positive bacteria. although new cephalosporins and carbapenems have acquired activity against mrsa, they offer few advantages against difficult-to-treat gram-negatives. among agents that are potentially active against mdr gram-negatives are ceftozolane/tazobactam, new carbapenems, the combination of avibactam with ceftazidime, and plazomicin. since a relevant number of promising antibiotics is currently in development, regulatory approvals over the next 5 years are crucial to face the growing threat of multidrug resistance.

TI  == utilization of blood cultures in danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  == this national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (bcs). a primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. from the danish microbiology database, we retrieved all bcs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the national patient registry. in total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one bc was taken. almost 50% of bcs were taken at admission. the chance of having a bc taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one bc  was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. ten species, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. an increase in bcs and positive bcs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. bcs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for s. pneumoniae particularly. a predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to s. aureus, e. faecium and k. pneumoniae. minor differences in bcs and positive bcs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. the study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.

TI  == antibiotic resistance prevalence in routine bloodstream isolates from children's  hospitals varies substantially from adult surveillance data in europe.
AB  == background: surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (amr) is central for defining appropriate strategies to deal with changing amr levels. it is unclear whether childhood amr patterns differ from those detected in isolates from adult  patients. methods: resistance percentages of nonduplicate staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream isolates from children less than 18 years of age reported to the antibiotic resistance and prescribing in european children (arpec) project were compared with all-age resistance percentages reported by the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance network (ears-net) for the same pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, period and countries. in addition, resistance percentages were compared between arpec isolates from children less than 1 year of age and children greater than or equal to1 year of age. results: resistance percentages for many important pathogen-antibiotic class combinations were different for arpec isolates compared with ears-net. e. coli and k. pneumoniae fluoroquinolone  resistance percentages were substantially lower in arpec (13.4% and 17.9%) than in ears-net (23.0% and 30.7%), whereas the reverse was true for all pathogen-antibiotic class combinations in p. aeruginosa (for example, 27.3% aminoglycoside resistance in arpec, 19.3% in ears-net, 32.8% carbapenem resistance in arpec and 20.5% in ears-net), and for s. pneumoniae and macrolide resistance. for many gram-negative pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, isolates from children greater than or equal to 1 year of age showed higher resistance percentages than isolates from children less than 1 year of age. conclusions: age-stratified presentation of resistance percentage estimates by surveillance programs will allow identification of important variations in resistance patterns between different patient groups for targeted intervention.

TI  == [the urinary bacterial flora in patients with cutaneous ureterostomy].
AB  == twenty-four patients with cutaneous ureterostomy at least 6 months after surgery  were included in this study. single-j ureteral catheters were indwelt in 7 patients. pouch urine was cultured and analyzed from asymptomatic patients and from those with pyelonephritis. forty-eight bacterial strains were isolated from  asymptomatic patients. thirty-five of these strains consisting of 18 species were isolated from the patients without ureteral catheters. enterococcus (e.) faecalis (20.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and proteus (p.) mirabilis (11. 4%) were isolated at high frequency. one methicilline-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus (mrcns) strain was isolated. thirteen bacterial strains consisting of 8 species were isolated from the patients with ureteral catheters. e. faecalis (23.1%), eschericia (e.) coli (23.1%) and pseudomonas (p.) aeruginosa (15.4%) were isolated at high frequency. one e. coli strain harboring extended-spectrum beta lactamase (esbl) and one mrcns strain were isolated. pyelonephritis occurred in 5 patients 14 times during follow-up for at least 6 months after surgery. the  patients with ureteral catheters suffered from pyelonephritis (4/7, 57.1%) more frequently as compared to the patients without catheters (1/17, 5.9%) (p = 0.014). p. aeruginosa (26.9%), e. faecium (15.4%), and p. mirabilis (11.5%) were  isolated inhigh frequency. one e. coli strain harboring esbl and one p. mirabilis strain harboring esbl were isolated. in conclusion, insertion of ureteral catheters in a cutaneous ureterostomy is a strong risk factor for pyelonephritis  and development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. therefore, urine culture is important in these patients who are under surveillance.

TI  == in vitro spectrum of pexiganan activity when tested against pathogens from diabetic foot infections and with selected resistance mechanisms.
AB  == pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. bacterial isolates from the 2013 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (dfi) and gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth. the mic50 and mic90 against all organisms tested from dfi were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa mic values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. pexiganan mic values among staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the  family enterobacteriaceae or p. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against s. aureus  or e. faecium. enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (mic, 32 to 256 mug/ml). the "all organism" mic90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.

TI  == in-vitro screening of malaysian honey from different floral sources for antibacterial activity on human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: different researches on therapeutic effects of honey have been conducted in different regions; however the study on the potential antibacterial  activity of malaysian honey is still limited. in this study, antibacterial activities of different monofloral honey samples were tested against several common human pathogenic bacteria. materials and methods: the well-diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) techniques were employed to investigate the putative antibacterial activity of malaysian monofloral honey from koompassia excelsa (becc.) taub (tualang), melaleuca cajuputi powell (gelam) and durio zibethinus murr. (durian). honey samples were tested against staphylococcus aureus atcc6518  and atcc25923, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc12228, enterococcus faecium lmg16192, enterococcus faecalis lmg16216 and atcc29212, escherichia coli atcc25922, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc14028 and klebsiella pneumoniae atcc13883. results: marked variations were observed in the antibacterial activity of these honey samples. durian honey failed to produce substantial antibacterial activity, whereas tualang and gelam honey showed a spectrum of antibacterial activity with their growth inhibitory effects against all of the tested bacterial species including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). conclusion: present findings suggested gelam honey possesses highest antibacterial effect among the tested malaysian honey samples.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activity of hyperimmune globulin preparations against multiresistant nosocomial pathogens.
AB  == purpose: we compared different immunoglobulin preparations containing igg (intraglobin/intratect) or a mixture of igg, iga, and igm (pentaglobin) to assess the opsonic and protective efficacy of human immunoglobulin preparations against  multiresistent nosocomial pathogens. materials and methods: clinical isolates of  e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and staphylococcus aureus were tested by opsonophagocytic assay using immunologobulin preparations at dilutions usually obtained in patients. the target antigens of opsonic antibodies were characterized by opsonophagocytic inhibition assays, and the protective efficacy in vivo was tested in a mouse bacteremia model as previously described. results: all strains  were killed to at least 50% by pentaglobin. one p. aeruginosa strain was not efficiently killed by intraglobin (23%) but the other strains were killed by intraglobin to a similar degree compared to pentaglobin. opsonic igg antibodies against e. faecalis were directed against lta, while opsonic antibodies in pentaglobin were primarily directed against other cell wall carbohydrates. in a mouse bacteremia model, pentaglobin was more protective than intratect against staphylococcus aureus, while intratect reduced colony counts better than normal rabbit serum or saline. conclusions: all tested human immunoglobulin preparations contain opsonic and protective antibodies against targets present on multiresistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. enrichment of these preparations with igm increases the protective efficacy against some strains, probably due to antibodies directed against cell wall carbohydrates.

TI  == blood infections in patients treated at transplantation wards of a clinical hospital in warsaw.
AB  == establishment of the etiology in blood infection is always advisable. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the proportion of different bacterial species, including aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in blood cultures of patients hospitalized in transplantation wards of a large clinical hospital between 2010 and 2012. a total of 1994 blood samples from patients who were treated at one of  two transplantation wards of a large hospital in warsaw were analyzed using an automated blood culture system, bact/alert (biomerieux, france). the 306 bacterial strains were obtained from the examined samples. the highest proportion were bacteria from the family enterobacteriaceae (112 strains; 36.6%) with escherichia coli (61 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (30 strains), and enterobacter cloacae (10 strains) most commonly isolated. the non-fermenting bacilli constituted 21.6% (66 strains), with most common stenotrophomonas maltophilia (31 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 strains), achromobacter spp. (12 strains), and acinetobacter baumannii (3 strains). most frequent gram-positive bacteria were staphylococci (25.2%). of 77 staphylococcal strains,  56 were coagulase-negative staphylococci and 21 staphylococcus aureus. other gram-positive bacteria included enterococci (14 strains) and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 strain). obligatory anaerobic bacteria were represented by 19 strains (6.2% of total isolates). among all enterobacteriaceae, 49 isolates (43.7%) produced extended-spectrum ss-lactamases (esbls). resistance to methicillin was detected in 62% of s aureus isolates and in 46% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. of 14 enterococci cultured from blood samples,  2 strains (14.3%) were resistant to vancomycin. both were enterococcus faecium. resistant strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria are significant problems for patients in the transplantation ward.

TI  == in vitro fermentation of lactulose by human gut bacteria.
AB  == lactulose has been known as a prebiotic that can selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. recent studies have indicated that streptococcus mutans, clostridium perfringens, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii are also able to utilize lactulose. however, the previous studies mainly focused  on the utilization of lactulose by individual strains, and few studies were designed to identify the species that could utilize lactulose among gut microbiota. this study aimed to identify lactulose-metabolizing bacteria in the human gut, using in silico and traditional culture methods. the prediction results suggested that genes for the transporters and glycosidases of lactulose are well distributed in the genomes of 222 of 453 strains of gastrointestinal-tract bacteria. the screening assays identified 35 species with  the ability to utilize lactulose, of which cronobacter sakazakii, enterococcus faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas putida were reported for the first time to be capable of utilizing lactulose. in addition, significant correlations between lactulose and galactooligosaccharide metabolism were found.  thus, more attention should be paid to bacteria besides bifidobacteria and lactobacilli to further investigate the relationship between functional oligosaccharides and gut bacteria.

TI  == membrane active phenylalanine conjugated lipophilic norspermidine derivatives with selective antibacterial activity.
AB  == natural and synthetic membrane active antibacterial agents offer hope as potential solutions to the problem of bacterial resistance as the membrane-active nature imparts low propensity for the development of resistance. in this report norspermidine based antibacterial molecules were developed that displayed excellent antibacterial activity against various wild-type bacteria (gram-positive and gram-negative) and drug-resistant bacteria (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, and beta-lactam-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae). in a novel structure-activity relationship study it has been shown how incorporation of an aromatic amino acid drastically improves selective antibacterial activity. additionally, the effect of stereochemistry on activity, toxicity, and plasma stability has also been studied. these rapidly bactericidal, membrane active antibacterial compounds do not trigger development of resistance in bacteria and  hence bear immense potential as therapeutic agents to tackle multidrug resistant  bacterial infections.

TI  == impact of minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints on local cumulative bacterial susceptibility data and antibiotic consumption.
AB  == background: the phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (ast) of bacteria depends on minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints issued by national and international breakpoint committees. the current study was performed in order to  test the influence of different ast standards on local cumulative ast data and on antibiotic consumption. methods: automated ast was performed with clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, and e. faecium. from each species 100 prospectively collected non-duplicate clinical isolates were tested and mic data were interpreted according to the interpretation standards issued by din and eucast, respectively. in addition cumulative ast data from clinical isolates and antibiotic consumption were monitored before and after implementation of new eucast mic breakpoints. results: the susceptibility rate of p. aeruginosa against piperacillin and gentamicin, and of c. freundii against piperacillin/tazobactam increased significantly, whereas the susceptibility rates of e. cloacae, s. marcescens, and m. morganii against ciprofloxacin decreased significantly after switching from din to eucast mic breakpoints. these changes in the cumulative antibiotic resistance pattern were reflected by enhanced consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam after implementation of eucast mic breakpoints. conclusions: these data show that changes of ast breakpoints have a significant influence on local cumulative ast data and on antibiotic consumption.

TI  == frequency and clinical outcomes of eskape bacteremia in solid organ transplantation and the risk factors for mortality.
AB  == background: although bacteremias caused by the 6 eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) have recently been highlighted  as a serious complication in solid organ transplant (sot), more information is urgently needed. we sought to investigate the frequency and clinical outcomes of  eskape bacteremia in sot and determine the risk factors for mortality. methods: a retrospective analysis of bacteremia after sot was reviewed. risk factors for mortality caused by eskape bacteremia were identified. results: eighty-four episodes of bacteremia were caused by eskape strains. of these strains, 41 were caused by resistant eskape (reskape) organisms. the only factor for bacteremia-related mortality independently associated with eskape was septic shock (odds ratio [or] = 21.017, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 5.038-87.682, p < 0.001). the factors for bacteremia-related mortality independently associated with reskape bacteremia were septic shock (or = 16.558, 95% ci = 6.620-104.668, p = 0.003) and age >/=40 years (or = 7.521, 95% ci = 1.196-47.292, p = 0.031). conclusions: to improve the outcomes of transplantation, more effective therapeutic treatments are of paramount importance when older sot recipients with bacteremia due to eskape/reskape organisms present with septic shock.

TI  == bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
AB  == the ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. the frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. a specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial  cells. much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would  allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. the use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.

TI  == transformation of human cathelicidin ll-37 into selective, stable, and potent antimicrobial compounds.
AB  == this letter reports a family of novel antimicrobial compounds obtained by combining peptide library screening with structure-based design. library screening led to the identification of a human ll-37 peptide resistant to chymotrypsin. this d-amino-acid-containing peptide template was active against escherichia coli but not methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). it possesses a unique nonclassic amphipathic structure with hydrophobic defects. by  repairing the hydrophobic defects, the peptide (17biphe2) gained activity against the eskape pathogens, including enterococcus faecium, s. aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumanii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species. in vitro, 17biphe2 could disrupt bacterial membranes and bind to dna. in vivo, the peptide prevented staphylococcal biofilm formation in a mouse model of  catheter-associated infection. meanwhile, it boosted the innate immune response to further combat the infection. because these peptides are potent, cell-selective, and stable to several proteases, they may be utilized to combat one or more eskape pathogens.

TI  == increase in the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter isolates and ampicillin-resistant non-typhoidal salmonella species in korea: a konsar study conducted in 2011.
AB  == background: antimicrobial surveillance is important for providing an up-to-date understanding of the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance and for creating a  forum for rational drug development. in this study, we analyzed antimicrobial test data generated in 2011 by hospitals and commercial laboratories participating in the korean nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance program (konsar). materials and methods: data on the results of susceptibility tests conducted in 32 hospitals and two commercial laboratories were analyzed. data on isolates from patients admitted to an intensive care unit (icu) and those admitted to other wards were compared. intermediate susceptibility was not analyzed and duplicate isolates were excluded. results: escherichia coli was the  most prevalent organism identified in both the hospital and commercial laboratories. among the hospital isolates, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), penicillin g-non-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, and ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium remained as prevalent as they were in 2009. the proportion of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (vr-efm) slightly decreased from 29% in 2009 to 23% in 2011. resistance rates of klebsiella pneumoniae to ceftazidime, cefoxitin, fluoroquinolone, and amikacin were 24%, 14%, 27%, and 8%, respectively. resistance rates of pseudomonas aeruginosa to fluoroquinolone, ceftazidime, imipenem, and amikacin were 33%, 20%, 22%, and 16%, respectively, whereas those of acinetobacter spp. resistance were 71%, 66%, 64, and 51%, respectively. the prevalence of oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa, mrsa, and vr-efm among icu isolates was higher than those among non-icu isolates. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing e. coli and k. pneumoniae, imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa, and vr-efm were more prevalent among isolates from commercial laboratories than those from hospitals. resistance rates of k. pneumoniae to ceftazidime and amikacin decreased from 32% and 24% in 2005 to 24%  and 8% in 2011, respectively. the resistance rate of p. aeruginosa to amikacin decreased from 22% in 2005 to 16% in 2011. the proportion of imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. increased from 16% in 2005 to 64% in 2011. conclusions: the prevalence of mrsa, penicillin g-non-susceptible s. pneumoniae, and ampicillin-resistant e. faecium among clinical isolates tested in laboratories remained high. multidrug resistance was more prevalent among isolates from icus.  the prevalence of ceftazidime-resistant and amikacin-resistant k. pneumoniae and  amikacin-resistant p. aeruginosa decreased after 2005, while the prevalence of imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. increased.

TI  == a broad-spectrum antibiofilm peptide enhances antibiotic action against bacterial biofilms.
AB  == biofilm-related infections account for at least 65% of all human infections, but  there are no available antimicrobials that specifically target biofilms. their elimination by available treatments is inefficient since biofilm cells are between 10- and 1,000-fold more resistant to conventional antibiotics than planktonic cells. here we describe the synergistic interactions, with different classes of antibiotics, of a recently characterized antibiofilm peptide, 1018, to potently prevent and eradicate bacterial biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant eskape (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) pathogens. combinations of peptide 1018 and the antibiotic ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, or tobramycin were synergistic in 50% of assessments and decreased by 2- to 64-fold the concentration of antibiotic required to treat biofilms formed by pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, and methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus. furthermore, in flow cell biofilm studies, combinations of low, subinhibitory levels of the peptide (0.8 mug/ml) and ciprofloxacin (40 ng/ml) decreased dispersal and triggered cell death in mature p. aeruginosa biofilms. in addition, short-term treatments with the peptide in combination with ciprofloxacin prevented biofilm formation and reduced p. aeruginosa pa14 preexisting biofilms. pcr studies indicated that the peptide suppressed the expression of various antibiotic targets in biofilm cells. thus, treatment with the peptide represents a novel strategy to potentiate antibiotic activity against biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant pathogens.

AB  == detection of antibody specific to leptospira by various immunological techniques  has been used for leptospirosis diagnosis. however, the sensitivity of antibody detection during the first few days after infection is low. molecular techniques  are suggested to provide earlier diagnosis than antibody detection, but a rapid and easy to perform assay for leptospira antigen detection would provide an additional useful tool for disease diagnosis. in this study, we coupled gold nanoparticles with antibody to lipl32, a protein commonly found in pathogenic leptospira. this coupled gold reagent was used in the immunochromatographic strip for leptospira detection. we demonstrated that the sensitivity of leptospira detection by this strip was 10(3) ml(-1). there was no positive result detected when strips were tested with non-pathogenic leptospira, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus group b, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis or enterococcus faecium. these data suggest that gold nanoparticles coupled with antibody to lipl32 could  be used for leptospira detection by a rapid test based on an immunochromatographic technique.

TI  == evaluation of epidemiological cut-off values indicates that biocide resistant subpopulations are uncommon in natural isolates of clinically-relevant microorganisms.
AB  == to date there are no clear criteria to determine whether a microbe is susceptible to biocides or not. as a starting point for distinguishing between wild-type and  resistant organisms, we set out to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) distributions for four common  biocides; triclosan, benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite for 3319 clinical isolates, with a particular focus on staphylococcus aureus (n = 1635) and salmonella spp. (n = 901) but also including escherichia coli (n = 368), candida albicans (n = 200), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 60), enterobacter spp. (n = 54), enterococcus faecium (n = 53), and enterococcus faecalis (n = 56). from these data epidemiological cut-off values (ecoffs) are proposed. as would be expected, mbcs were higher than mics for all biocides. in most cases both values  followed a normal distribution. bimodal distributions, indicating the existence of biocide resistant subpopulations were observed for enterobacter chlorhexidine  susceptibility (both mics and mbcs) and the susceptibility to triclosan of enterobacter (mbc), e. coli (mbc and mic) and s. aureus (mbc and mic). there is a concern on the potential selection of antibiotic resistance by biocides. our results indicate however that resistance to biocides and, hence any potential association with antibiotic resistance, is uncommon in natural populations of clinically relevant microorganisms.

TI  == a multidisciplinary intervention to reduce infections of esbl- and ampc-producing, gram-negative bacteria at a university hospital.
AB  == in response to a considerable increase in the infections caused by esbl/ampc-producing klebsiella pneumonia in 2008, a multidisciplinary intervention, with a main focus on antimicrobial stewardship, was carried out at  one university hospital. four other hospitals were used as controls. stringent guidelines for antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis were disseminated throughout the intervention hospital; cephalosporins were restricted for prophylaxis use only, fluoroquinolones for empiric use in septic shock only, and  carbapenems were selected for penicillin-allergic patients, infections due to esbl/ampc-producing and other resistant bacteria, in addition to their use in severe sepsis/septic shock. piperacillin-tazobactam +/- gentamicin was recommended for empiric treatments of most febrile conditions. the intervention also included education and guidance on infection control, as well as various other surveillances. two year follow-up data on the incidence rates of patients with selected bacterial infections, outcomes, and antibiotic consumption were assessed, employing before-and-after analysis and segmented regression analysis of interrupted time series, using the other hospitals as controls. the intervention led to a sustained change in antimicrobial consumption, and the incidence of patients infected with esbl-producing k. pneumoniae decreased significantly (p<0.001). the incidences of other hospital-associated infections also declined (p's<0.02), but piperacillin-tazobactam-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecium infections increased (p's<0.033). in wards with high antimicrobial consumption, the patient gut carrier rate of esbl-producing bacteria significantly decreased (p = 0.023). the unadjusted, all-cause 30-day mortality rates of k. pneumoniae and e. coli were unchanged over the four-year period, with similar results in all five hospitals. although not statistically significant, the 30-day mortality rate of patients with esbl-producing k. pneumoniae decreased, from 35% in 2008-2009, to 17% in 2010-2011. the two-year follow-up data indicated that this multidisciplinary intervention led to a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of esbl/ampc-resistant k. pneumoniae infections, as well as in the incidences of other typical hospital-associated bacterial infections.

TI  == could chloramphenicol be used against eskape pathogens? a review of in vitro data in the literature from the 21st century.
AB  == the widespread use of antibiotics has been associated with the emergence of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria. 'eskape' (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acintobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp.) pathogens play a major role in the rapidly changing scenario of antimicrobial resistance in the 21st century. chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum antibiotic that was abandoned in developed countries due to its association with fatal aplastic anemia. however, it is still widely used in the developing world. in light of the emerging problem of multi-drug resistant pathogens, its role should be reassessed. our paper reviews  in vitro data on the activity of chloramphenicol against eskape pathogens. susceptibility patterns for gram-positives were good, although less favorable for gram-negatives. however, in combination with colistin, chloramphenicol was found  to have synergistic activity. the risk-benefit related to chloramphenicol toxicity has not been analyzed. therefore, extra precautions should be taken when prescribing this agent.

TI  == validation of a novel murine wound model of acinetobacter baumannii infection.
AB  == patients recovering from traumatic injuries or surgery often require weeks to months of hospitalization, increasing the risk for wound and surgical site infections caused by eskape pathogens, which include a. baumannii (the eskape pathogens are enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species). as new therapies are being developed to counter a. baumannii infections, animal models are also needed to evaluate potential treatments. here, we present an excisional, murine wound model in which a diminutive inoculum of a clinically relevant, multidrug-resistant a. baumannii isolate can proliferate, form biofilms, and be effectively treated with antibiotics. the model requires a temporary, cyclophosphamide-induced neutropenia to establish an infection that can persist. a 6-mm-diameter, full-thickness wound was created in the skin overlying the thoracic spine, and after the wound bed was inoculated, it was covered with a dressing for 7 days. uninoculated control wounds healed within 13  days, whereas infected, placebo-treated wounds remained unclosed beyond 21 days.  treated and untreated wounds were assessed with multiple quantitative and qualitative techniques that included gross pathology, weight loss and recovery, wound closure, bacterial burden, 16s rrna community profiling, histopathology, peptide nucleic acid-fluorescence in situ hybridization, and scanning electron microscopy assessment of biofilms. the range of differences that we are able to identify with these measures in antibiotic- versus placebo-treated animals provides a clear window within which novel antimicrobial therapies can be assessed. the model can be used to evaluate antimicrobials for their ability to reduce specific pathogen loads in wounded tissues and clear biofilms. ultimately, the mouse model approach allows for highly powered studies and serves as an initial multifaceted in vivo assessment prior to testing in larger animals.

TI  == epidemiology, antibiotic therapy and outcomes of bacteremia caused by drug-resistant eskape pathogens in cancer patients.
AB  == purpose: infection due to the six eskape pathogens has recently been identified as a serious emerging problem. however, there is still a lack of information on bacteremia caused by these organisms in cancer patients. we aimed to assess the epidemiology, antibiotic therapy and outcomes of bacteremia due to drug-resistant eskape pathogens (reskape) in patients with cancer. methods: all episodes of bacteremia prospectively documented in hospitalized adults with cancer from 2006  to 2011 were analyzed. results: of 1,148 episodes of bacteremia, 392 (34 %) were  caused by eskape pathogens. fifty-four episodes (4.7 %) were due to reskape strains (vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium 0, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) 13, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (eslb)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae 7, carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii 4, carbapenem- and quinolone-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa 18 and derepression chromosomic ss-lactam and esbl-producing enterobacter species 12. risk factors independently associated with reskape bacteremia were comorbidities, prior antibiotic therapy, urinary catheter and urinary tract source. inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy was more frequent in patients with reskape bacteremia than in the other cases (55.6 % vs. 21.5 %, p < 0.001). persistence of bacteremia (25 % vs. 9.7 %), septic metastasis (8 % vs. 4 %) and early case-fatality rate (23 % vs. 11 %) were more frequent in patients with reskape bacteremia than in patients with other etiologies (p < 0.05). conclusions: bacteremia due to reskape pathogens in cancer patients occurs mainly among those with comorbidities who have received prior antibiotic therapy and have a urinary tract source. these patients often receive inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy and have a poor outcome.

TI  == chateter-associated urinary tract infections in adults.
AB  == introduction: hospital-acquired urinary tract infections make 35% of all the hospital-acquired infections, and about 80% of them are related to the catheterization of the urinary bladder. purpose: to determine clinical characteristics and dominant etiologic factors of urinary tract infections associated with urinary catheter (c-utis). methods: determined clinical characteristics of c-utis were prospectively analyzed on 38 hospitalized patients in the clinic for infectious diseases at the university clinical centre tuzla, from january 1(st) 2011 to december 31(st) 2011. the control group constituted of 200 patients with community-acquired urinary tract infections (co-utis) hospitalized in the same period. results: it was registered on 22 (57.89%) of symptomatic infections, 14 (36.84%) asymptomatic bacteriuria and 2 (5.26%) other  c-utis. dominant etiologic factors were: e. coli, caused 14 (36.84%), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing (esbl) klebsiella pneumoniae 7 (18.42%), enterococcus faecium and candida spp. 3 (7.89%) of c-utis. e. coli was  significantly most common etiologic factor of c-utis in younger women (p=0.04). e. coli from c-utis showed significantly higher resistance to antimicrobial drugs. inadequate antimicrobial therapy was significantly more common prescribed  to patients from c-utis. lethal outcome was significantly most common associated  with certain clinical and laboratory findings. conclusion: initial antimicrobial  therapy of those serious infections should be based on data from those research.

TI  == in-vitro experimental evaluation of skin-to-surface recovery of four bacterial species by antibacterial and non-antibacterial medical examination gloves.
AB  == background: the number of bacteria recovered from a stainless steel coupon after  touching a pigskin substrate with an examination glove coated on its outside with polyhexanide (phmb), as compared to the number of bacteria recovered in the same  manner with non-coated control gloves was evaluated. methods: suspensions containing 1 x 109 colony-forming units of 4 clinically relevant bacterial species (enterococcus faecium atcc #51559; escherichia coli atcc #25922; klebsiella pneumoniae atcc #4352; and staphylococcus aureus atcc #33591) were used to contaminate gamma-irradiated pigskin substrates. bacterial recoveries from the pigskin substrate, stainless steel coupons, and each glove swatch were performed. a difference in the bacterial recovery from the stainless steel coupons after touching with coated and uncoated control gloves was measured. results: for e. faecium, the coated glove showed a reduction of 4.63 log10 cfu recovery, when compared to control gloves. for e. coli, the coated glove showed 5.48 log10 cfu, for k. pneumoniae 5.03 log10 cfu, and for s. aureus 5.72 log10 cfu recovery, when compared to the non-coated control glove. conclusion: an in-vitro experiment designed to mimic cross-contamination of clinically relevant  bacteria in a simulated healthcare setting following glove contact with a contaminated biological surface and cross-transfer to a stainless steel surface has demonstrated that an examination glove coated on its outside surface with phmb was able to reduce bacterial recovery from a contaminated surface by > 4 log10 cfu, compared to a control non-coated examination glove. these elaborated results may encourage further clinical investigation on the clinical impact of an antibacterial examination glove.

TI  == emergence of enterococcus species in the infectious microorganisms cultured from  patients with endophthalmitis in south korea.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the microorganisms in culture-proven endophthalmitis and  their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents commonly used in south korea. methods: medical records of consecutive patients with culture-proven endophthalmitis at eight institutions between 1 january 2004 and 31 july 31 2010  were reviewed. four categories of endophthalmitis were studied: postoperative, posttraumatic, endogenous, and unspecified. outcome measures were culture-proven  infectious organisms, antimicrobial susceptibilities, and final visual acuity in  the patients. results: a total of 93 microorganisms were identified from 103 patients during the study period. the positive culture rate was 59.2 % (103/174). the most common organisms identified were enterococcus faecalis (in 20.8 % of patients, 20/96), staphylococcus epidermidis (18.8 %, 18/96), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (10.4 %, 10/96), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.3 %,  6/96), and klebsiella pneumoniae (6.3 %, 6/96). two cases of enterococcus faecium (2.1 %) were recognized. overall, 70 of 96 (73.0 %) isolates were gram-positive bacteria, 22 (23.0 %) were gram-negative bacteria, and 4 (4.2 %) were fungi. the  most common organisms resulting in reduced light perception were e. faecalis and  k. pneumoniae. conclusions: the emergence of e. faecalis in endophthalmitis is mainly caused by the high incidence of e. faecalis in postoperative endophthalmitis. this increase also impacts the final visual acuity of the patients.

TI  == update of contemporary antimicrobial resistance rates across china: reference testing results for 12 medical centers (2011).
AB  == antimicrobial resistance (r) surveillance across asia and especially in china has documented unique patterns and mechanisms. this 2011 study reports results for 2278 isolates from 12 hospitals in china (94-216 strains/site); most from bacteremia (20.4%), pneumonias (29.1%), or skin and skin structure infections (20.9%). samples were tested by reference broth microdilution methods, interpreted by published susceptibility (s) breakpoints. the most common species  were staphylococcus aureus (343, 45.8% mrsa), escherichia coli (ec; 288), pseudomonas aeruginosa (psa; 221), klebsiella spp. (ksp; 208), acinetobacters (acb; 178), enterobacters (155), streptococcus pneumoniae (spn; 154, 46.8% penicillin-s), and enterococci (ent; 137). among 849 gram-positive (gp) cocci, linezolid, tigecycline (tig), daptomycin, and vancomycin provided best antimicrobial coverage (>/=99.7% s). resistance patterns of concern were 0.3% visa, 15.4% teicoplanin non-s coagulase-negative staphylococci, 1.5% vancomycin-r ent (all enterococcus faecium), 1.9% levofloxacin-r beta-haemolytic streptococci, and 35.1 and 12.7% ceftriaxone-non-s rates for spn and viridans group streptococci, respectively. for gram-negative bacilli, r among enterobacteriaceae was highest against beta-lactams (extended spectrum beta-lactamase-phenotype strains at 73.6 and 42.8% in ec and ksp, respectively; carbapenem-r was only 2.1-4.3% with kpc and imp type enzymes detected in ksp). the widest spectrum agents were cefoperazone/sulbactam (79.5-86.1%), piperacillin/tazobactam (88.9-92.0%), tig (98.6-100%), amikacin (amk; 91.8-93.7%), and meropenem (95.7-97.1% s). psa was most inhibited by amk (90.5% s) and colistin (col; 99.5%), with cefepime (67.9%) best among the tested beta-lactams. only col (100%  s) and tig (mic90, 2 mug/ml) showed significant potencies against acb. in conclusion, r among pathogens from 12 chinese hospitals illustrates several agents active against gp pathogens, but more serious r problems were noted among  enterobacteriaceae, psa, and acb. combination treatment for the latter multidrug-r strains appears necessary, guided by local antibiograms and national  surveillance results applying reference methods.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of novel nanostructured cu-sio2 coatings prepared by chemical vapour deposition against hospital related pathogens.
AB  == there is increasing recognition that the healthcare environment acts as an important reservoir for transmission of healthcare acquired infections (hcai). one method of reducing environmental contamination would be use of antimicrobial  materials. the antimicrobial activity of thin silica-copper films prepared by chemical vapour deposition was evaluated against standard strains of bacteria used for disinfectant testing and bacteria of current interest in hcai. the structure of the coatings was determined using scanning electron microscopy and their hardness and adhesion to the substrate determined. antimicrobial activity was tested using a method based on bs iso 22196:2007. the coatings had a pale green-brown colour and had a similar hardness to steel. sem showed nano-structured aggregates of cu within a silica matrix. a log10 reduction in viability of >5 could be obtained within 4 h for the disinfectant test strains and within 6 h for producing acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. activity against the other hospital isolates was slower but still gave log10 reduction factors of >5 for extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli and >3 for vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa within 24 h. the results demonstrate the importance of testing antimicrobial materials destined for healthcare use against isolates of current interest in hospitals as well as standard test strains. the coatings used here can also be applied to substrates such as metals and ceramics and have potential  applications where reduction of microbial environmental contamination is desirable.

TI  == new antibiotics for bad bugs: where are we?
AB  == bacterial resistance to antibiotics is growing up day by day in both community and hospital setting, with a significant impact on the mortality and morbidity rates and the financial burden that is associated. in the last two decades multi  drug resistant microorganisms (both hospital- and community-acquired) challenged  the scientific groups into developing new antimicrobial compounds that can provide safety in use according to the new regulation, good efficacy patterns, and low resistance profile. in this review we made an evaluation of present data  regarding the new classes and the new molecules from already existing classes of  antibiotics and the ongoing trends in antimicrobial development. infectious diseases society of america (idsa) supported a program, called "the '10 x 20' initiative", to develop ten new systemic antibacterial drugs within 2020. the microorganisms mainly involved in the resistance process, so called the eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumanii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacteriaceae) were the  main targets. in the era of antimicrobial resistance the new antimicrobial agents like fifth generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactams, beta-lactamases inhibitors, aminoglycosides, quinolones, oxazolidones, glycopeptides, and tetracyclines active against gram-positive pathogens, like vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa) and mrsa, penicillin-resistant streptococci, and vancomycin resistant enterococcus (vre) but also against highly resistant gram-negative organisms are more than welcome. of these compounds some are already approved by  official agencies, some are still in study, but the need of new antibiotics still does not cover the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. therefore the management of antimicrobial resistance should also include fostering coordinated actions by all stakeholders, creating policy guidance, support for surveillance and technical assistance.

TI  == one-day point prevalence of emerging bacterial pathogens in a nationwide sample of 62 german hospitals in 2012 and comparison with the results of the one-day point prevalence of 2010.
AB  == background: antibiotic resistance of bacterial pathogens is an emerging problem worldwide. to combat multidrug resistant organisms (mrdos) networks of care providers have been established in all states in germany. the hicare-network, a project to combat mrdos, founded by the federal ministry of education and research, has published data from 2010 of a voluntary, german-wide, multicenter point-prevalence survey in 2011 conducted in collaboration with the german society of hospital hygiene. the aim of the present survey was the re-evaluation  of the situation in 2012. method: the survey was conducted as a voluntary, anonymous, point-prevalence in may 2012 using routine data of microbiological diagnostics of the hospitals. as in the former survey of 2010 it was differentiated between primary, secondary and tertiary care hospitals and only data from intensive care units, surgical and medical wards were collected. based  on the survey form used in 2010, an updated version was used including more pathogens and corrected issues observed in the former survey. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (total as well as separated in hospital-acquired (ha), community-acquired (ca) and lifestock-associated (la) mrsa), vancomycin resistant staphylococcus aureus (vrsa/grsa), vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecalis resp. enterococcus faecium (vr-e. faecalis resp.  vr-e. faecium), extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-building (esbl) e. coli (esbl-ec) and klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl-kp), multiresistant acinetobacter spp.  (mab), multiresistant pseudomonas spp. (mrp), carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cre) as well as clostridium difficile (cd) infections and severe infections requiring icu-treatment were included in the survey along with  additional data on screening strategy, the equipment with infection control staff and possible confounders. results: out of 1,550 hospitals asked to participate, 62 returned data (4%). data from 56 hospitals including primary (26), secondary (20) and tertiary (10) care hospitals were analyzable (3.6%). the most frequently reported organisms were mrsa 1.53% [ci95: 1.32-1.75], followed by cdad 1.30% [ci95: 1.11-1.50], esbl-ec 0.97% [ci95: 0.80-1.14], and esbl-kp 0.27% [ci95: 0.18-0.36], regardless of the level of care. prevalence of mrdos depended on the  level of care and on the type of ward, as expected. overall prevalence was highest on intensive care wards, and prevalences were remarkably high on medical  wards compared to surgical wards. all tertiary care providers employed their own  infection control nurse, while only ~70% of the secondary and primary care hospitals did. surprisingly, in two of the ten participating tertiary care providers neither an internal nor an external infection control doctor was available. discussion: with more than 13,000 patients in 56 hospitals distributed all over germany, the survey included more than three times as many patients as the first survey and therefore not only adds valuable information about the epidemiology of emerging nosocomial pathogens, but also helps to raise awareness  of the problem of antibacterial resistance in germany. the prevalences reported seem to be comparable to the results of the former survey and of other surveys published. some hospitals reported to have no infection control personnel available at all. this statement is in line with another survey published in this issue.

TI  == risk factors and outcomes of bacteremia caused by drug-resistant eskape pathogens in solid-organ transplant recipients.
AB  == background: although infections due to the six eskape pathogens have recently been identified as a serious emerging problem, information regarding bacteremia caused by these organisms in solid-organ transplant (sot) recipients is lacking.  we sought to determine the frequency, risk factors, and outcomes of bacteremia due to drug-resistant eskape (reskape) organisms in liver, kidney, and heart adult transplant recipients. methods: all episodes of bacteremia prospectively documented in hospitalized sot recipients from 2007 to 2012 were analyzed. results: of 276 episodes of bacteremia, 54 (19.6%) were due to reskape strains (vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium [0], methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus [5], extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella  pneumoniae [10], carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii [8], carbapenem- and quinolone-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa [26], and derepressed chromosomal  beta-lactam and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacter species [5]). factors independently associated with reskape bacteremia were prior transplantation, septic shock, and prior antibiotic therapy. patients with reskape bacteremia more often received inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy than the others (41% vs. 21.6%; p=0.01). overall case-fatality rate (30 days) was higher in patients with reskape bacteremia (35.2% vs. 14.4%; p=0.001). conclusions: bacteremia due to reskape pathogens is frequent in sot recipients and causes significant morbidity and mortality. reskape organisms should be considered when selecting empirical antibiotic therapy for hospitalized sot recipients presenting with septic shock, particularly those with prior transplantation and antibiotic use.

TI  == bacterial spectrum and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bloodstream infections in children with febrile neutropenia: experience of single center in southeast of turkey.
AB  == empirical antimicrobial therapy is usually started in febrile neutropenic patients without having culture results. the aim of this study was to help determine the policies of empirical antibiotic usage in febrile neutropenic children by detecting the antimicrobial susceptibility profile in this group of patients. in this study 811 blood cultures taken from neutropenic children hospitalized at the department of oncology of gaziantep children hospital november 2007 and february 2010 were retrospectively evaluated. blood cultures were routinely collected in aerobic and anaerobic media and incubated using the bactec system. identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolates to antimicrobial agents was performed using the vitek2((r)) system according to the recommendations of the clinical and laboratory standards institute. of 811 isolates analyzed, 128 (56.4%) were gram positive cocci, 43 (18.9%) were gram negative bacilli and fungi accounted for 56 (24.7%). the main isolated gram-positive bacteria from blood were coagulase-negative staphylococcus (56.7%), followed by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (14.1%). s. aureus and streptococcus spp. were all susceptible to linezolid, vancomycin and teicoplanin. s aureus was still susceptible to few other antimicrobial agents such as tetracycline (82.4%), chloramphenicol (55.6%). seven e. faecium, 7 e. fecalis and 1 e. hirae was isolated from blood cultures. vancomycin resistance was detected in 6 out of 15 (40%) enterococcus spp. isolates. among gram-negative bacteria e. coli (30.2%) was followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (20.9%) and proteus spp. (18.6%). imipenem (89.2%), meropenem (86.6%), chloramphenicol (88.9%), amicasin (82.4%) and fosfomycin (81.3%) showed highest susceptibility in vitro activity against all gram-negative isolates. to know the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of the pathogens frequently isolated from febrile neutropenic children and to consider this profile before starting an empirical antibiotic therapy would help the clinics which have any role in the treatment of these patients to determine the empirical antibiotic usage policies.

AB  == the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (t.e.s.t.) commenced in 2004 to longitudinally monitor global changes in bacterial susceptibility to a suite of antimicrobial agents. the current study examined the activity of tigecycline and  comparators against isolates collected across eastern europe between 2004 and 2010. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution methodologies. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using clsi interpretive criteria, and tigecycline susceptibility was established using european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) breakpoints. this study included 10 295 gram-negative and 4611 gram-positive isolates from 42 centres. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) were reported among 15.3% of escherichia coli and 39.3% of klebsiella pneumoniae isolates; the highest rates were observed in turkey (30.9%) and bulgaria (53.8%), respectively. imipenem-non-susceptible k. pneumoniae were identified only in turkey. esbl-positive e. coli were highly susceptible to imipenem (95.1%), meropenem (98.0%) and tigecycline (98.5%). most antimicrobials showed poor activity against acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. vancomycin resistance was noted among 0.9% of enterococcus faecalis and 11.7% of enterococcus faecium isolates. high rates of susceptibility were reported for linezolid (99.7%) and tigecycline (100%) against e. faecium. one-quarter of staphylococcus aureus isolates were meticillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), with the highest rate in romania (51.5%); all mrsa were susceptible to linezolid, tigecycline and vancomycin. antimicrobial resistance is high in much of eastern europe, with considerable variation seen among countries. tigecycline and the carbapenems retain excellent activity against many pathogens from eastern europe; linezolid and vancomycin are active against most gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == one-year surveillance of eskape pathogens in an intensive care unit of monterrey, mexico.
AB  == background: bacterial species from the eskape group (i.e. enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter species) are frequently resistant to antibiotics. the purpose of this study was to monitor the incidence of eskape pathogens at the intensive care unit (icu) of a tertiary care hospital in monterrey, mexico. methods: all clinically relevant organisms isolated from june  2011 to june 2012 were included. identification and susceptibility testing was performed using panels from sensititre. resistance to oxacillin, for s. aureus, and the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), for k. pneumonia, were determined as defined by the clinical laboratory standards institute. also, the presence of vana and vanb genes was determined in e. faecium vancomycin (van)-resistant isolates. results: the majority of pathogens (64.5%) isolated in the icu unit were from the eskape group. the organisms most frequently isolated were a. baumannii (15.8%) and p. aeruginosa (14.3%). a high resistance to carbapenems was detected for a. baumannii (75.3%) while 62% of s. aureus isolates were confirmed to be methicillin resistant. of the k. pneumoniae  isolates, 36.9% were esbl producers. we detected three e. faecium van-resistant isolates, all of which contained the vana gene. conclusion: the presence of the eskape group of pathogens is a major problem in the icu setting. the results of this study support the implementation of special antimicrobial strategies to specifically target these microorganisms.

TI  == clinical relevance of the eskape pathogens.
AB  == in recent years, the infectious diseases society of america has highlighted a faction of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp.) - acronymically dubbed 'the eskape pathogens' - capable of 'escaping' the biocidal action of antibiotics and mutually representing new paradigms in pathogenesis, transmission and resistance. this review aims to consolidate clinically relevant background information on the eskape pathogens and provide a contemporary summary of bacterial resistance, alongside pertinent microbiological considerations necessary to face the mounting threat of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == recent trends in resistance to cell envelope-active antibacterial agents among key bacterial pathogens.
AB  == cell envelope-active agents, particularly beta-lactams, play a pivotal role in the treatment of bacterial infections and the extent to which their activity is affected by the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms is of concern. we analyzed the surveillance network (tsn) database to evaluate resistant trends for key cell envelope-active drugs among eskape pathogens. analysis demonstrated that the activity of these drugs has been notably influenced by the emergence of multidrug resistance; this was especially evident for the beta-lactam drugs. for  example, acinetobacter baumannii resistance to imipenem increased from 23.9% to 34.3%, and resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam increased from 37.0% to 49.7% between 2007 and 2011. during the same time period klebsiella pneumoniae resistance to imipenem increased from 0.8% to 3.8%. as beta-lactams are a cornerstone of anti-infective therapy, it is important to closely monitor the activity of the agents being used today and to aggressively pursue new strategies that can augment current drugs and thwart ever-emerging beta-lactam resistance mechanisms that are continuously encountered.

TI  == using rapid diagnostic tests to optimize antimicrobial selection in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
AB  == new advances in rapid diagnostic tests provide several collaborative opportunities for stewardship teams, particularly in processes where delay in the initiation of appropriate therapy has significant consequences for patient outcomes. rapid molecular tests enhance one of the key functions of microbiology  laboratories, which is to produce accurate organism identification and timely antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. these data are used to guide the choice of antimicrobial agents for treating infections in individual patients, and the aggregate data (i.e., hospital's antibiogram) are used to guide empiric therapy for infections before the availability of the patient's culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. in addition, accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing data are critical for the overall success of a health care institution's antimicrobial stewardship program. tests that provide accurate organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility not only benefit the individual patient but also increase the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programs. this review focuses on the use of molecular diagnostic methods to rapidly identify staphylococcus species, enterococcus faecalis,enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli,klebsiella pneumoniae,pseudomonas aeruginosa,clostridium difficile, and candida species from clinical samples and summarizes studies that describe the application of rapid diagnostic tests in antimicrobial stewardship programs.

TI  == analysis of bacterial diversity during the fermentation of inyu, a high-temperature fermented soy sauce, using nested pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and the plate count method.
AB  == the diversity of bacteria associated with the fermentation of inyu, also known as black soy sauce, was studied through the nested pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of samples collected from the fermentation stages of the inyu production process. the dgge profiles targeted the bacterial 16s rdna and revealed the presence of citrobacter farmeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter  hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, pantoea agglomerans, salmonella enterica, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus sciuri and weissella confusa. the bacterial compositions of 4 fermented samples were further elucidated using the plate count method. the bacteria isolated from the koji-making stage exhibited the highest diversity; brachybacterium rhamnosum, e.  hormaechei, k. pneumoniae, kurthia gibsonii, pantoea dispersa, staphylococcus gallinarum, staphylococcus kloosii and s. sciuri were identified. koji collected  during the preincubation stage presented the largest cell counts, and e. hormaechei, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and enterobacter pulveris were identified.  in brine samples aged for 7 and 31 days, the majority of the bacteria isolated belonged to 4 bacillus species, but 4 staphylococcus species and delftia tsuruhatensis were also detected. this study demonstrates the benefits of using a combined approach to obtain a more complete picture of microbial populations and  provides useful information for the control or development of bacterial flora during inyu fermentation.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides containing unnatural amino acid exhibit potent bactericidal activity against eskape pathogens.
AB  == a series of 36 synthetic antimicrobial peptides containing unnatural amino acids  were screened to determine their effectiveness to treat enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pnemoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species (eskape) pathogens, which are known to commonly infect chronic wounds. the primary amino acid sequences of these peptides incorporate either three or six dipeptide units consisting of the unnatural amino acids tetrahydroisoquinolinecarboxylic acid (tic) and octahydroindolecarboxylic acid (oic). the tic-oic dipeptide units are separated by spacer amino acids with specific physicochemical properties that control how these peptides interact with bacterial cell membranes of different chemical compositions. these peptides exhibited minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) against these pathogens in the range from >100 to 6.25 mug/ml. the observed diversity of mic values for these peptides against the various bacterial strains  are consistent with our hypothesis that the complementarity of the physicochemical properties of the peptide and the lipid of the bacteria's cell membrane determines the resulting antibacterial activity of the peptide.

TI  == [in vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
AB  == postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (lvfx) has been conducted continuously since 1992. the present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in japan to 30 selected antibacterial  agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (fqs). the common respiratory pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to fqs. in contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among s pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. regarding h. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to fqs, however, prevalence of lvfx-resistant escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of lvfx-resistant e. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence  of lvfx 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. another enterobacteriaceae member, klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to fqs, in contrast with e.  coli. in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), the percentage of fq-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other fqs. however, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) isolates were highly susceptible to fqs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. the prevalence of fqs-resistant  isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of fq-resistance in mrsa. the prevalence of fqs-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (utis) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in p. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (rtis). while this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were  noted in the prevalence of fq-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates derived from utis. the prevalence of multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from utis and 0.3% among isolates from rtis, a decrease from the results  of 2007. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a  prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance  of 81.3-82.5%, to fqs. ceftriaxone (ctrx) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to ctrx in some clinical isolates. the result of the present survey indicated that although  methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, p. aeruginosa from utis, n. gonorrhoeae, and e. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the fqs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. while fq resistance has been prevailing in e. coli, e. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to fqs. the other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against fqs.

TI  == estimating the burden of healthcare-associated infections caused by selected multidrug-resistant bacteria finland, 2010.
AB  == background: knowledge of the burden of healthcare-associated infections (hai) and antibiotic resistance is important for resource allocation in infection control.  although national surveillance networks do not routinely cover all hais due to multidrug-resistant bacteria, estimates are nevertheless possible: in the eu, 25,000 patients die from such infections annually. we assessed the burden of hais due to multidrug-resistant bacteria in finland in 2010. methods: by combining data from the national infectious disease registry on the numbers of bacteremias  caused by staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp., and susceptibility data from the national antimicrobial resistance network and the finnish hospital infection program, we assessed the numbers of healthcare-associated bacteremias due to selected multidrug-resistant  bacteria. we estimated the number of pneumonias, surgical site and urinary tract  infections by applying the ratio of these infections in the first national prevalence survey for hai in 2005. attributable hai mortality (3.2%) was also derived from the prevalence survey. results: the estimated annual number of the most common hais due to the selected multidrug-resistant bacteria was 2804 (530 hais per million), 6% of all hais in finnish acute care hospitals. the number of  attributable deaths was 89 (18 per million). conclusions: resources for infection control should be allocated not only in screening and isolation of carriers of multidrug-resistant bacteria, even when they are causing a small proportion of all hais, but also in preventing all clinical infections.

TI  == adenylate kinase release as a high-throughput-screening-compatible reporter of bacterial lysis for identification of antibacterial agents.
AB  == adenylate kinase (ak) is a ubiquitous intracellular enzyme that is released into  the extracellular space upon cell lysis. we have shown that ak release serves as  a useful reporter of bactericidal agent activity and can be exploited for antimicrobial screening purposes. the ak assay exhibits improved sensitivity over that of growth-based assays and can detect agents that are active against bacteria in clinically relevant growth states that are difficult to screen using  conventional approaches, such as small colony variants (scv) and bacteria within  established biofilms. the usefulness of the ak assay was validated by screening a library of off-patent drugs for agents that exhibit antimicrobial properties toward a variety of bacterial species, including escherichia coli and all members of the "eskape" pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species). the assay detected antibiotics within the library that were expected to be active against the organism screened. moreover, 38 drugs with no previously reported antibacterial activity elicited ak release. four of these  were acquired, and all were verified to exhibit antimicrobial activity by standard susceptibility testing. two of these molecules were further characterized. the antihistamine, terfenadine, was active against s. aureus planktonic, scv population, and biofilm-associated cells. tamoxifen, an estrogen  receptor antagonist, was active toward e. faecium in vitro and also reduced e. faecium pathogenesis in a galleria mellonella infection model. our data demonstrate that the ak assay provides an attractive screening approach for identifying new antimicrobial agents. further, terfenadine and tamoxifen may represent novel antimicrobial drug development scaffolds.

TI  == experience with fosfomycin for treatment of urinary tract infections due to multidrug-resistant organisms.
AB  == fosfomycin has shown promising in vitro activity against multidrug-resistant (mdr) urinary pathogens; however, clinical data are lacking. we conducted a retrospective chart review to describe the microbiological and clinical outcomes  of urinary tract infections (utis) with mdr pathogens treated with fosfomycin tromethamine. charts for 41 hospitalized patients with a urine culture for an mdr pathogen who received fosfomycin tromethamine from 2006 to 2010 were reviewed. forty-one patients had 44 urinary pathogens, including 13 carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae (cr-kp), 8 pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 7 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) isolates, 7 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers, and 9 others. in vitro fosfomycin susceptibility was 86% (median mic, 16 mug/ml; range, 0.25 to 1,024 mug/ml). patients received an average of 2.9 fosfomycin doses per treatment course. the overall microbiological cure was 59%; failure was due to either relapse (24%) or reinfection uti (17%). microbiological cure rates by pathogen were 46% for cr-kp, 38% for p. aeruginosa, 71% for vre, 57% for esbl producers, and 100% for others.  microbiological cure (n = 24) was compared to microbiological failure (n = 17). there were significantly more solid organ transplant recipients in the microbiological failure group (59% versus 21%; p = 0.02). none of the patients in the microbiological cure group had a ureteral stent, compared to 24% of patients  within the microbiological failure group (p = 0.02). fosfomycin demonstrated in vitro activity against utis due to mdr pathogens. for cr-kp, there was a divergence between in vitro susceptibility (92%) and microbiological cure (46%).  multiple confounding factors may have contributed to microbiological failures, and further data regarding the use of fosfomycin for utis due to mdr pathogens are needed.

TI  == rapid identification of eskape bacterial strains using an autonomous microfluidic device.
AB  == this article describes bacteria id chips ('bacchips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. bacchips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (pdms). each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. pressing the layer of pdms into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). after assembly, bacchips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. to use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased pdms draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. after the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air  is drawn into the bacchip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. a ph indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. importantly, bacchips operate  without external equipment or instruments. by visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that bacchips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the eskape panel of pathogens, including strains of: enterococcus faecalis, enteroccocus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. this article describes a bacchip for point-of-care detection of eskape pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.

AB  == objectives: this study is aimed at evaluation of bacterial air contamination in intensive poultry breeding. the evaluation was based on the determined levels of  bacterial concentrations and qualitative identification of isolated microorganisms. materials and methods: the study covered 5 poultry houses: two hatcheries and three hen houses with the litter bed system. the air was sampled in three measurement series in the central part of the investigated workplace at  the height of about 1.5 m over the ground, using portable measuring sets consisting of a gilair 5 (sensidyne, usa) pump and a measuring head filled with a glass microfibre filter (whatman, uk). for the quantitative and qualitative analysis of microorganisms were used appropriate microbiological media. results:  the total concentrations of airborne mesophilic bacteria inside the poultry breeding houses ranged from 4.74 x 10(4) cfu/m(3) to 1.89 x 10(8) cfu/m(3). for gram-negative bacteria, the range comprised the values from 4.33 x 10(2) cfu/m(3) to 4.29 x 10(6) cfu/m(3). the concentrations of the cocci of enterococcus genus ranged from 1.53 x 10(4) cfu/m(3) to 1.09 x 10(7) cfu/m(3), whereas those of other gram-positive bacteria from 3.78 x 10(4) cfu/m(3) to 6.65 x 10(7) cfu/m(3). the lowest concentrations of each group of the examined microorganisms were noted in the second measurement series when the air exchange in the breeding houses was over twice higher than in first and third measurement series because the mechanical ventilation was supported by natural ventilation (opened gates in the  buildings). the lowest concentrations of total bacteria were obtained in those buildings where one-day old chickens were kept. gram-positive bacteria of the genera: staphylococcus, enterococcus, corynebacterium, brevibacterium, micrococcus, cellulomonas, bacillus, aerococcus, and gram-negative bacteria of the genera: pseudomonas, moraxella, escherichia, enterobacter, klebsiella, pasteurella, pantoea were isolated. it was shown that for most of the investigated livestock premises the total bacteria concentrations exceeded the reference value of 1.0 x 10(5) cfu/m(3). furthermore, pathogenic microorganisms which are a potential threat to human health (escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. ozaenae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus  faecium) were found among the identified bacteria. conclusions: the results indicate that the hygienic conditions of the working environment connected with litter bed system production of poultry are affected by changes of the efficiency of ventilation and create a direct health risk to employees. they should use personal protective measures to protect their respiratory tract, especially when  the gates in the hen houses are closed.

TI  == costs of healthcare- and community-associated infections with antimicrobial-resistant versus antimicrobial-susceptible organisms.
AB  == objective: we compared differences in the hospital charges, length of hospital stay, and mortality between patients with healthcare- and community-associated bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia due to antimicrobial-resistant versus -susceptible bacterial strains. methods: a retrospective analysis of an electronic database compiled from laboratory, pharmacy, surgery, financial, and patient location and device utilization sources was undertaken on 5699 inpatients who developed healthcare- or community-associated infections between 2006 and 2008 from 4 hospitals (1 community, 1 pediatric, 2 tertiary/quaternary care) in manhattan. the main outcome measures were hospital charges, length of stay, and mortality among patients with antimicrobial-resistant and -susceptible infections caused by staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii. results: controlling for multiple confounders using linear regression and nearest neighbor matching based on propensity score estimates, resistant healthcare- and community-associated infections, when compared with susceptible strains of the same organism, were associated with significantly higher charges ($15,626; confidence interval [ci], $4339-$26,913 and $25,573; ci, $9331-$41,816, respectively) and longer hospital stays for community-associated infections (3.3; ci, 1.5-5.4). patients with resistant healthcare-associated infections also had a significantly higher death rate (0.04; ci, 0.01-0.08). conclusions: with careful  matching of patients infected with the same organism, antimicrobial resistance was associated with higher charges, length of stay, and death rates. the difference in estimates after accounting for censoring for death highlight divergent social and hospital incentives in reducing patient risk for antimicrobial resistant infections.

TI  == minim typing--a rapid and low cost mlst based typing tool for klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == here we report a single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) based genotyping method for klebsiella pneumoniae utilising high-resolution melting (hrm) analysis of fragments within the multilocus sequence typing (mlst) loci. the approach is termed mini-mlst or minim typing and it has previously been applied to streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium. six snps  were derived from concatenated mlst sequences on the basis of maximisation of the simpsons index of diversity (d). dna fragments incorporating these snps and predicted to be suitable for hrm analysis were designed. using the assumption that hrm alleles are defined by g+c content, minim typing using six fragments was predicted to provide a d = 0.979 against known sts. the method was tested against 202 k. pneumoniae using a blinded approach in which the mlst analyses were performed after the hrm analyses. the hrm-based alleles were indeed in accordance with g+c content, and the minim typing identified known sts and flagged new sts.  the tonb mlst locus was determined to be very diverse, and the two minim fragments located herein contribute greatly to the resolving power. however these fragments are refractory to amplification in a minority of isolates. therefore, we assessed the performance of two additional formats: one using only the four fragments located outside the tonb gene (d = 0.929), and the other using hrm data from these four fragments in conjunction with sequencing of the tonb mlst fragment (d = 0.995). the hrm assays were developed on the rotorgene 6000, and the method was shown to also be robust on the lightcycler 480, allowing a 384-well high through-put format. the assay provides rapid, robust and low-cost typing with fully portable results that can directly be related to current mlst data. minim typing in combination with molecular screening for antibiotic resistance markers can be a powerful surveillance tool kit.

TI  == ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by eskape organisms: cause, clinical features, and management.
AB  == purpose of review: despite important geographical variations, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter species (eskape) pathogens constitute more than 80% of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) episodes. their clinical importance relies on their virulence and ability in developing mechanisms to decrease susceptibility to antimicrobials, increasing inappropriate therapy and affecting negatively on icu patients' outcome. this review updates information on vap due to eskape pathogens. recent findings: although methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus vap may be clinically similar to that caused by susceptible strains, it is associated with poorer outcomes despite adequate treatment. local  colonization determines treatment options. the contribution of tracheobronchitis  is an important issue. minimum inhibitory concentration should be considered for  nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria vap to prescribe extended infusion beta-lactam treatment due to an increase of resistant strains. strategies promoting antimicrobial diversity may protect against emergence and spread of resistance by eskape pathogens. summary: vap due to eskape pathogens represents a global challenge that can be prevented using stewardship programmes promoting diversity.

TI  == [microbial "friend-foe" identification in human intestine microsymbiocenosis].
AB  == aim: development of methodical approach of evaluation of microbial "friend-foe" identification in human intestine microsymbiocenosis. materials and methods: 9 bifidobacteria cultures (dominants) and 18 opportunistic microorganism strains (associants) isolated from patients during examination for intestine dysbiosis and identified by conventional methods were used. evaluation of microbial "friend-foe" identification in microsymbiocenosis was performed by author developed technique that is based on determination of growth factors (gf), anti-lysozyme activity (ala) and formation of biofilms (bff) of associants co-incubated with exometabolites of dominants. gf, ala, bff were studied photometrically (bukharin o.v., 1999, 2009; o'toole g.a., 2000). the data were statistically analyzed by fisher-student criteria. results: the detected opposite (increase/reduction) phenomenon of the "dominant-associant" pair allowed realization of the "friend-foe" identification in microsymbiocenosis. associants  (e. coli and enterococcus faecium) were "friend" species, in which bifidobacteria exometabolites did not change growth properties and stimulated ala (by 17,5--32%) and bff (by 25 - 39%). associants (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans) were "foe" microsymbiont species, in which bifidoflora exometabolites decreased gf (by 20,7--68%), ala (by 22,7--54%)  and bff (by 22,5 --39%). conclusion: indigenous microflora during microsymbiocenosis formation can participate in "friend-foe" identification, the  basis of which is determined by microsymbiont exometabolites. the data obtained open a perspective of understanding mechanisms of intramicrobial interactions and can be used for both diagnostics and optimal selection of "candidates" during creation of new probiotics and synbiotics.

TI  == trends in the susceptibility of clinically important resistant bacteria to tigecycline: results from the tigecycline in vitro surveillance in taiwan study,  2006 to 2010.
AB  == the tigecycline in vitro surveillance in taiwan (tist) study, a nationwide, prospective surveillance during 2006 to 2010, collected a total of 7,793 clinical isolates, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (n = 1,834), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp) (n = 423), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) (n = 219), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli (n = 1,141), esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1,330), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1,645), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 903), from different specimens from 20 different hospitals in taiwan. mics of tigecycline were determined following the  criteria of the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast-2011). among drug-resistant gram-positive pathogens, all of the prsp isolates were susceptible to tigecycline (mic(90), 0.03 mug/ml), and only one mrsa isolate (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml) and three vre isolates (mic(90), 0.125 mug/ml) were nonsusceptible to tigecycline. among the gram-negative bacteria, the tigecycline susceptibility rates were 99.65% for esbl-producing e. coli (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml) and 96.32% for esbl-producing k. pneumoniae (mic(90), 2 mug/ml) when interpreted by fda criteria but were 98.7% and 85.8%, respectively, when interpreted by eucast-2011 criteria. the susceptibility rate for a. baumannii (mic(90), 4 mug/ml) decreased from 80.9% in 2006 to 55.3% in 2009 but increased to 73.4% in 2010. a bimodal mic distribution was found among carbapenem-susceptible a. baumannii isolates, and a  unimodal mic distribution was found among carbapenem-nonsusceptible a. baumannii  isolates. in taiwan, tigecycline continues to have excellent in vitro activity against several major clinically important drug-resistant bacteria, with the exception of a. baumannii.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
AB  == the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different ph values. consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (sa) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (scmc) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa, mdr vibrio sp, mdr stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl) producing salmonella sp, esbl producing klebsiella pneumoniae, esbl producing proteus mirabilis, esbl producing escherichia coli and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (czoi)]. the mean overall czoi for  the gram-positive isolates at a ph of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. a mean czoi of 5 mm was recorded for the scmc dressing, which was slightly higher,  at 5.4 mm for the sa dressing. at a ph of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed  a similar activity. however, at a ph of 8.5 the mean czoi of the scmc dressing was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the sa dressing for a select number of isolates. the mean overall czoi for the gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the gram-positive bacteria. susceptibility to  silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. interestingly, when ph was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (p < 0.05). overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all ph ranges. in addition, the study showed that the performance  of both dressings apparently increased when ph became more acidic. the findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role ph plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.

TI  == identification of new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase gene (ndm-1) from a clinical isolate of acinetobacter junii in china.
AB  == new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (ndm-1) is a novel type of metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl) responsible for bacterial resistance to beta-lactam  antibiotics. acinetobacter junii was previously shown to possess a mbl phenotype; however, the genes responsible for this phenotype were not identified. in this study, we reported the identification of ndm-1 gene in a clinical isolate of a. junii from a child patient in china, which was resistant to all beta-lactams except aztreonam but sensitive to aminoglycosides and quinolones. the cloned ndm-1 gene contained an open reading frame of 813 bp and had a nucleotide sequence 99.9% identical (812/813) to reported ndm-1 genes carried by acinetobacter baumannii , enterococcus faecium , escherichia coli , and klebsiella pneumoniae . recombinant ndm-1 protein was successfully expressed in e. coli bl21, and antibiotic sensitivities of the ndm-1-producing e. coli were largely similar to the a. junii 1454 isolate. the findings of this study raise attention to the emergence and spread of ndm-1-carrying bacteria in china.

AB  == the tigecycline in vitro surveillance in taiwan (tist) study, initiated in 2006,  is a nationwide surveillance program designed to longitudinally monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline against commonly encountered drug-resistant bacteria. this study compared the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 3,014  isolates of clinically important drug-resistant bacteria using the standard broth microdilution and disk diffusion methods. species studied included methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; n = 759), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre; n = 191), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli (n = 602), esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 736), and acinetobacter baumannii (n = 726) that had been collected from patients treated between 2008 and 2010 at 20 hospitals in taiwan. mics and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted according to the currently recommended u.s. food and drug administration (fda) criteria and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) criteria. the mic(90) values of tigecycline against mrsa, vre, esbl-producing e. coli, esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, and a. baumannii were 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 2, and 8 mug/ml, respectively. the total error rates between the two methods using the fda criteria were high: 38.4% for esbl-producing k. pneumoniae and 33.8% for a. baumannii. using the eucast criteria, the total error rate was also high (54.6%) for a. baumannii isolates. the total error rates between these two methods were <5% for mrsa, vre, and esbl-producing e. coli. for routine susceptibility testing of esbl-producing  k. pneumoniae and a. baumannii against tigecycline, the broth microdilution method should be used because of the poor correlation of results between these two methods.

AB  == in this research, synthesis, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of a series of catecholthioethers having benzoxazole and tetrazole moieties are described. antimicrobial activity was evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) assay. the synthesized compounds were tested in vitro against three gram-positive bacteria including staphylococcus aureus (clinical isolated), staphylococcus aureus atcc 25922, enterococcus faecium (clinical isolated), and two gram-negative bacteria including klebsiella pneumoniae (clinical isolated) and pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853 and the yeast candida albicans in comparison with control drugs. microbiological results indicated that the synthesized compounds possessed a broad spectrum of activity against the tested microorganisms at mic values between 4-256 mug/ml. this shows compounds having tetrazole moiety were the most active against gram-negative strains, whereas compounds having benzoxazole moiety were more active against gram-positive ones. also both of them showed significant antifungal activity against candida albicans and had lower activity than the compared control drugs (sulfamethoxazole and fluconazole). the  antioxidant activity was assessed using two methods, including, 1,1-biphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) radical scavenging, and reducing power assays. some of the catecholthioether derivatives showed antioxidant activity more than trolox and butylated hydroxyanisole (bha) as reference antioxidants.

TI  == controlled performance evaluation of the diversilab repetitive-sequence-based genotyping system for typing multidrug-resistant health care-associated bacterial pathogens.
AB  == fast, reliable, and versatile typing tools are essential to differentiate among related bacterial strains for epidemiological investigation and surveillance of health care-associated infection with multidrug-resistant (mdr) pathogens. the diversilab (dl) system is a semiautomated repetitive-sequence-based pcr system designed for rapid genotyping. the dl system performance was assessed by comparing its reproducibility, typeability, discriminatory power, and concordance with those of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and multilocus sequence typing (mlst) and by assessing its epidemiological concordance on well-characterized mdr bacterial strains (n = 165). these included vana enterococcus faecium, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii, and esbl- or metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. the dl system showed very good performance for e. faecium and k. pneumoniae and good performance for other species, except for a discrimination index of <95% for a. baumannii and e. coli (93.9% and 93.5%, respectively) and incomplete concordance with mlst for p. aeruginosa (78.6%) and e. coli (97.0%). occasional violations of mlst assignment by dl types were noted for e. coli. complete epidemiological concordance was observed for all pathogens, as all outbreak-associated strains clustered in identical dl types that were distinct from those of unrelated strains. in conclusion, the dl system showed good to excellent performance, making it a reliable typing tool for investigation of outbreaks caused by study pathogens, even though it was generally less discriminating than pfge analysis. for e. coli and p. aeruginosa, mlst cannot be  reliably inferred from dl type due to phylogenetic group violation or discordance.

TI  == a call to arms: the imperative for antimicrobial stewardship.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance is a major public health crisis. the prevalence of drug-resistant organisms, such as the emerging nap1 strain of clostridium difficile, now highly resistant to fluoroquinolones, acinetobacter species, klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing organisms, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, is increasing nationwide. the sources of antimicrobial resistance are manifold, but there is a well-documented  causal relationship between antimicrobial use and misuse and the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. as the development of new antimicrobial agents is on the decline, the medical community, across all specialties and in conjunction with public health services, must develop and implement programs and  strategies designed to preserve the integrity and effectiveness of the existing antimicrobial armamentarium. such strategies are collectively known as antimicrobial stewardship programs and have the potential to minimize the emergence of resistant pathogens.

AB  == earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system) is the biggest antimicrobial resistance surveillance project in the world financed from public finds, aiming to provide validated and comparable official data on antimicrobial  resistance of invasive microbial strains (isolated from blood and csf), belonging to 6 indicator bacterial species, i.e.: s. aureus, e. coli, e. faecium/faecalis,  str. pneumoniae, ps. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae. romania reported data to earss since 2002 so far. though the number of participating laboratories increased progressively from 12 to 35, the number of hospitals which reported for earss. as the number of strains included in the data base remained steady and relatively low. this issue is related to the particular position of romania in the european  context, in respect of the very low number of blood cultures performed in hospitals. our paper is presenting the trends of antimicrobial resistance in the  indicator strains in the 2002-2008 interval. during the 2002-2008 interval, romania reported to earss a total number of 1276 bacterial strains, distributed by species as follows: 513 s aureus, 369 e. coli, 128 streptococcus pneumoniae, 127 enterococcus spp.. 71 klebsiella pneumoniae, 68 pseudomonas aeruginosa. klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were reported, according to the  earss protocol, only for the 2005-2008 interval. it is difficult to describe trends, specially in enterococcus, streptococcus pneumonaie and the 2 species collected only since 2005, because of the low number of isolates, but there are several results that are supporting us to claim that antimicrobial resistance in  invasive isolates is a real problem in romanian hospitals, like in other central, southern and south eastern european countries: more than 25% of s. aureus strains resistant to methicilline, with more than 50% in some years, high aminoglycozides resistance in more than 70-80% of enterococcus faecium invasive strains, more than 80% of strains resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporines etc.

TI  == the activity of antimicrobial peptide s-thanatin is independent on multidrug-resistant spectrum of bacteria.
AB  == in this study, the activity of s-thanatin (an analog of antimicrobial peptide derived from thanatin) against different bacterial pathogens frequently which can cause therapeutic problems was tested. the result showed minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of s-thanatin against all isolates of the escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella ornithinolytica and klebsiella oxytoca were in the range of 4-16mug/ml, no matter which antibiotic the bacterial was resistant or susceptible, while almost all mics to gram-positive bacterial were >128mug/ml except enterococcus faecium. s-thanatin was more effective toward gram-negative strains, especially for enterobacter and klebsiella. the mics of s-thanatin were no significantly different in the same species regardless of antibiotic sensitive or -resistant isolates to single or multiple antibiotic (p>0.05). likewise, no notable difference could be observed between e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, k. ornithinolytica which were sensitive to s-thanatin (p>0.05). it was implied that the antimicrobial activity of s-thanatin was independent on multi-drug resistance spectrum of bacteria.

TI  == design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of beta-lactam antibiotic-based imidazolium- and pyridinium-type ionic liquids.
AB  == we herein report the preparation and investigation of antibacterial activity of biocidal ionic liquids (ils) consisting of cationic imidazolium or pyridinium and an anionic beta-lactam antibiotic. the antibacterial properties were quantified by measuring the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration against escherichia coli o157:h7, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecium. in general, the ils had improved antibacterial activity than their parent materials, whether individually or in combination. in 83% of the experiments, the ampicillin ils (amp-ils) had better antibacterial activities than their quaternary halide parent materials, whereas in 92% of the experiments, amp-ils outperformed the commercially available sodium ampicillin salt. amp-ils had up to 43 times improved antibacterial activity than  sodium ampicillin. overall, when normalized for ampicillin content, ils had greater antimicrobial activity against e. coli o157:h7, k. pneumoniae, s. aureus, and e. faecium than sodium ampicillin alone.

TI  == short term urinary catheterized patients in intensive care unit (icu)--a need to  screen.
AB  == catheter-associated urinary tract infection (cauti) is the second most commonly reported healthcare associated infection, accounting for upto 40% of all nosocomial infections. silent catheter associated bacteriuria comprises a huge reservoir of resistant organism in hospitals particularly in critical care units. we prospectively studied 100 newly short-term catheterized patients in a tertiary care hospital. samples collected on day three and daily thereafter for semi quantitative urine culture and pus cell count. antibiotic sensitivity was tested  using kirby-bauer disc diffusion method. out of hundred patients, 32 showed growth on fifth day and remaining 68 samples were culture negative up to seventh  day. none of the culture positive samples had pus cells. escherichia coli (35%) was the predominant isolate followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, candida spp (15% each) and coagulase negative staphylococcus (5%). among the gram negative organisms, four strains of escherichia coli and two strains of klebsiella pneumonia were extended spectrum beta lactamases (esbl) producers and 33.3% were multidrug resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa. multidrug resistant pathogens in an asymptomatic short-term catheterized patient are a major reservoir in hospitals. this emphasizes the importance of periodic surveillance for nosocomial infections in hospital and the periodic screening will also help us to frame antibiotic policy in a new tertiary care hospital.

TI  == [causative agents of intravenous catheter-related infections and their antibiotic susceptibilities].
AB  == intravenous catheterization can lead to colonization as well as a broad spectrum  of infections ranging from catheter site infections to catheter-related blood stream infections (crbsis). the aim of this study was to evaluate the distribution of causative agents and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in  crbsis and catheter site infections along with the colonization rates and colonizing microorganisms in zonguldak karaelmas university hospital, turkey. the results of cultures from catheter tips and/or intracatheter blood cultures and simultaneously taken peripheral blood cultures were sent to medical microbiology  laboratory and were retrospectively investigated for 201 patients hospitalized between september 2007 and september 2009. the catheter tips were cultured by semi-quantitative and quantitative culture methods. blood cultures from the catheters and peripheral veins were performed in bactec 9120 (becton dickinson, usa) blood culture systems. the antibiotic susceptibility tests were done by kirby-bauer disk diffusion method according to the guidelines of the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi). out of 201 patients included, 28 (13.9%) had crbsis and 13 (6.4%) had catheter site infections while colonization was defined for 55 (27.3%) patients. of 28 patients with crbsis, acinetobacter spp. were isolated from 11 including five carbapenem-resistant strains, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mrcns) from eight, methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (mscns) from two, klebsiella pneumoniae from two patients and one of each patient's cultures yielded methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), carbapenem-resistant  pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp., escherichia coli and mrcns + enterococcus faecium. of 13 patients with catheter site infections, five mscns, two methicillin-susceptible s.aureus (mssa), two e.coli, and one of each k.pneumoniae, mrcns, enterococcus spp., k.pneumoniae + p.aeruginosa were isolated. no resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin were detected among the staphylococci isolated from crbsis and catheter site infections. the distribution of the 55 colonizing microorganisms were as follows; 18 mscns, 18 mrcns, four acinetobacter spp., five k.pneumoniae, three e.coli, two mssa, and one of each mrsa, p.mirabilis, p.aeruginosa, corynebacterium spp., candida albicans. in this  study, the predominant microorganism isolated from crbsis was acinetobacter spp., followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci. this unexpected distribution of the agents was related to the acinetobacter spp. that have gained endemic potential following an acinetobacter outbreak in our hospital in 2006. we emphasize that it is critical for any individual hospital to assess periodically the distribution and susceptibility profiles of isolates obtained from catheter-related infections to set out rational empirical treatment strategies.

TI  == prevalence of hospital-acquired enterococci infections in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo, southwestern nigeria.
AB  == enterococci are opportunistic bacteria that become pathogenic when they colonize  niches where they are not normally found. of recent, they have become major cause of nosocomial infections, especially of the bloodstream, urinary tract and surgical sites. the aim of this study is to determine the point-prevalence rate of human enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in osogbo, nigeria. the study was conducted between january and june 2009 in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo and involved a total of 118 patients who developed clinical evidence of infection at least 48 hours after hospital admission. appropriate clinical samples were collected from the patients after an informed consent and cultured for isolation/biochemical identification of enterococcus species at the  bacteriology laboratory of ladoke akintola university of technology, osogbo using standard microbiological methods. there were 525 hospital admissions within the time frame of the study of which 118 (22.5%) developed hospital acquired infection (hai); 58 (49.2%) of which cultured positive for bacterial pathogens. enterococci were isolated from infective focus in 7 patients, giving a prevalence rate of hospital-acquired enterococci infection of 5.9%. two species of enterococcus were identified; enterococcus faecalis from urinary tract infection  (uti) and surgical site infection (ssi) of 6 (85.7%) patients and enterococcus faecium from uti in 1 (14.3%) patient. other bacteria recovered from other infective foci were klebsiella spp 31.0%, pseudomonas spp 20.7%, staphylococcus aureus 17.2%, escherichia coli 12.1%, staphylococcus epidermidis 3.4%, streptococcus pneumoniae 1.7% and serratia spp 1.7%. all the enterococci isolates were multiply antibiotic resistant, and 42.9% were vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) with the vre strains showing resistance to wider range of antibiotics than the vancomycin-sensitive strains. other gram-positive and gram negative bacterial isolates also demonstrated multiple resistance to all commonly available antibiotics in this community except e. coli and pseudomonas spp which  were relatively sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. this limited study demonstrated a high prevalence rate of multiple antibiotic resistant enterococci  infections among hospitalized patients in this environment. there is need for systematic surveillance of hospitals for enterococci infections; prudent use and  rational prescription of antibiotics and stringent measures to reduce the prevalence rate by health education on infection control measures such as isolation, cleaning, disinfection and sterilization.

TI  == progress and challenges in implementing the research on eskape pathogens.
AB  == the eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) are responsible for a substantial percentage of nosocomial infections in the modern hospital and represent the vast majority of isolates whose resistance  to antimicrobial agents presents serious therapeutic dilemmas for physicians. over the years, improved molecular biology techniques have led to detailed information about individual resistance mechanisms in all these pathogens. however, there remains a lack of compelling data on the interplay between resistance mechanisms and between the bacteria themselves. in addition, data on the impact of clinical interventions to decrease the prevalence of resistance are also lacking. the difficulty in identifying novel antimicrobial agents with reliable activity against these pathogens argues for an augmentation of research  in the basic and population science of resistance, as well as careful studies to  identify optimal strategies for infection control and antimicrobial use.

TI  == increase of ceftazidime- and fluoroquinolone-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae and  imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. in korea: analysis of konsar study data from 2005 and 2007.
AB  == purpose: antimicrobial resistance monitoring could be a useful source of information for treating and controlling nosocomial infections. we analyzed antimicrobial resistance data generated by korean hospitals and by a commercial laboratory in 2005 and 2007. materials and methods: susceptibility data for 2005  and 2007 were collected from 37 and 41 hospitals, respectively, and from one commercial laboratory. intermediate susceptibility was not included in the calculation of resistance rates. results: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (64%), third-generation cephalosporin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae (29%), fluoroquinolone-resistant escherichia coli (27%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (33%), and acinetobacter spp. (48%), and amikacin-resistant p. aeruginosa (19%) and acinetobacter spp. (37%) were prevalent in hospitals in 2007. a gradual increase of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. was observed. higher incidences of thirdgeneration cephalosporin-resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae and imipenemresistant p. aeruginosa were found in the commercial laboratory than in the hospitals. conclusion: methicillin-resistant s. aureus, third-generation cephalosporin- resistant k. pneumoniae, and fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli, p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. remain prevalent in korea, while the incidence  of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. has  increased gradually. the higher prevalences of third-generation cephalosporinresistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa in the commercial laboratory are a new concern.

TI  == isolation, characterization and phylogeny of sponge-associated bacteria with antimicrobial activities from brazil.
AB  == bacteria associated with marine sponges represent a rich source of bioactive metabolites. the aim of this study was to isolate and characterize bacteria with  antimicrobial activities from brazilian sponges. a total of 158 colony-forming units were isolated from nine sponge species. among these, 12 isolates presented  antimicrobial activities against pathogenic bacteria. based on comparative sequence analysis of their 16s rrna genes, the sponge-associated bacterial strains could be subdivided into three phylogenetically different clusters. five  strains were affiliated with firmicutes (genera bacillus and virgibacillus), three with alpha-proteobacteria (pseudovibrio sp.) and four with gamma-proteobacteria (genera pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas). the sponge-associated bacterial strains pseudomonas fluorescens h40 and h41 and pseudomonas aeruginosa h51 exhibited antimicrobial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including strains such as vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and multiresistant klebsiella pneumoniae. bacillus pumilus pc31 and pc32, pseudovibrio ascidiaceicola pm31 and  ca31 and pseudovibrio denitrificans mm37 strains were more effective against gram-positive bacteria. these findings suggest that the identified strains may contribute to the search for new sources of antimicrobial substances, an important strategy for developing alternative therapies to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
AB  == human beta-defensin 2 (hbd-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. we determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hbd-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to  eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. the native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hbd-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hbd-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. characteristically, a. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (mdr) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hbd-2 (vld(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-mdr (wild-type) a. baumannii  strains (vld(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). bactericidal activity of hbd-2 was less pronounced against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis  strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. these observations give  indications that the natural hbd-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting mdr phenotypes.

TI  == dramatic increase of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant e. coli in german intensive care units: secular trends in antibiotic drug use and bacterial resistance, 2001 to 2008.
AB  == introduction: the objective of the present study was to analyse secular trends in antibiotic consumption and resistance data from a network of 53 intensive care units (icus). methods: the study involved prospective unit and laboratory-based surveillance in 53 german icus from 2001 through 2008. data were calculated on the basis of proportions of nonduplicate resistant isolates, resistance densities (that is, the number of resistant isolates of a species per 1,000 patient-days) and an antimicrobial usage density (ad) expressed as daily defined doses (ddd) and normalised per 1,000 patient-days. results: total mean antibiotic use remained stable over time and amounted to 1,172 ddd/1,000 patient-days (range 531 to 2,471). carbapenem use almost doubled to an ad of 151 in 2008. significant increases were also calculated for quinolone (ad of 163 in 2008) and third-generation and fourth-generation cephalosporin use (ad of 117 in 2008). aminoglycoside consumption decreased substantially (ad of 86 in 2001 and 24 in 2008). resistance proportions were as follows in 2001 and 2008, respectively: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) 26% and 20% (p = 0.006; trend  test showed a significant decrease), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) faecium 2.3% and 8.2% (p = 0.008), third-generation cephalosporin (3gc)-resistant escherichia. coli 1.2% and 19.7% (p < 0.001), 3gc-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae 3.8% and 25.5% (p < 0.001), imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii 1.1% and 4.5% (p = 0.002), and imipenem-resistant k. pneumoniae 0.4% and 1.1%. the resistance densities did not change for mrsa but increased significantly for vre  faecium and 3gc-resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae. in 2008, the resistance density for mrsa was 3.73, 0.48 for vre, 1.39 for 3gc-resistant e. coli and 0.82  for k. pneumoniae. conclusions: although total antibiotic use did not change over time in german icus, carbapenem use doubled. this is probably due to the rise in  3gc-resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae. increased carbapenem consumption was associated with carbapenem-resistant k. pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing bacteria and imipenem-resistant a. baumannii.

TI  == emergence of resistant klebsiella pneumoniae in the intestinal tract during successful treatment of klebsiella pneumoniae lung infection in rats.
AB  == antibiotic treatment of lung infections may lead to the emergence of resistance in the gut flora. appropriate dosing regimens could mitigate this adverse effect. in gnotobiotic rats harboring intestinal escherichia coli and enterococcus faecium populations, a lung infection by klebsiella pneumoniae was instigated with two different sizes of inoculum to represent an early or a late initiation of antibiotic treatment. the rats were treated with marbofloxacin, an expanded-spectrum fluoroquinolone, by a single-shot administration or a fractionated regimen over 4 days. intestinal bacterial populations were monitored during and after treatment. at the infection site, bacterial cure without any selection of resistance was observed. whatever the dosage regimen, fluoroquinolone treatment had a transient negative impact on the e. coli gut population but not on that of e. faecium. the intestinal flora was colonized by the pathogenic lung bacteria, and there was the emergence of intestine-resistant  k. pneumoniae, occurring more often in animals treated with a single marbofloxacin dose than with the fractionated dose. bacterial cure without resistance selection at the infection site with fluoroquinolone treatment can be  linked to colonization of the digestive tract by targeted pulmonary bacteria, followed by the emergence of resistance.

TI  == [investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  == sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. the aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. a total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. the antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in mueller-hinton broth according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guideline. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for  10 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 enterobacter aerogenes strains. the mic values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 32 microg/ml for k. pneumoniae atcc 700603, 32 microg/ml for e. coli atcc 25922 and  > 128 microg/ml for p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. sertralin has showed antibacterial  activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that mic values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

AB  == activity of tigecycline against nosocomial secondary peritonitis isolates collected along 18 months in 29 spanish hospitals was tested by etest in a central laboratory, considering food and drug administration (fda)/british society for antimicrobial chemotherapy (bsac)/european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) breakpoints. a total of 600 facultative/aerobic isolates (392 gram negative, 208 gram positive) and 100 anaerobes were tested. none of the 220 escherichia coli isolates was resistant to tigecycline (mic(50)/mic(90) = 0.25/0.5 microg/ml), with 0.5% (fda breakpoint) and 3.6% (bsac/eucast breakpoint) intermediate strains. all extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing e. coli isolates (15 strains), all klebsiella pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca isolates (42 strains) were susceptible to tigecycline. no isolates resistant to tigecycline were found among streptococcus  viridans, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecium, but 18.9% of enterococcus faecalis strains were intermediate following bsac/eucast breakpoints. all (but 1) isolates of the bacteroides fragilis group (n = 45) were tigecycline susceptible, as well as gram-positive anaerobes. tigecycline offers an adequate activity profile against isolates from secondary peritonitis when tested by etest regardless of the breakpoints used for categorization.

TI  == impact of a change in antibiotic prophylaxis on total antibiotic use in a surgical intensive care unit.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of reducing the length of antibiotic prophylaxis for cerebro spinal shunts on total antibiotic use and key resistant pathogens. methods: in january 2004, the use of antibiotic  prophylaxis was reduced to a single shot dose with cefuroxime in an intensive care unit (icu). prior to this intervention, prophylaxis with second-generation cephalosporins was administered during the entire period of external cerebro spinal fluid (csf) drainage. the effect on the antibiotic use density (ad: ddd [defined daily doses] per 1,000 patient-days[pd]) was calculated prior to (january 2002-december 2003) and following implementation of the intervention(january 2004-december 2006) by segmented regression analysis of an interrupted time series. resistance proportions(rp) and resistance densities (rd), defined as resistant pathogen/1,000 pd of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis or e. faecium, third-generation-resistant (3gc) escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant pseudomonus aeruginosa, were compared by the fisher's exact test before and after the intervention. results: total antibiotic  use by 147 ddd/1,000 pd decreased after the intervention when pre-operative prophylaxis was changed into single shot prophylaxis, from an estimated mean of 1,036 ddd/1,000 pd before the intervention to 887ddd/1,000 pd post-intervention.  this decrease was primarily due to a significant reduction in the amount of cefuroxime used for prophylaxis. the reduction in total antibiotic consumption was sustainable, and it did not increase again during the next 36 months. the rr  and rd of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant e. coli increased after january 2004, whereas the percentage of mrsa significantly decreased. conclusion: change to single shot prophylaxis along with an ongoing antibiotic stewardship program resulted in a cut-back in total antibiotic use amounting to as much as 15%. it would therefore appear that targeting interventions aimed at reducing antibiotic prophylaxis in surgical icus may be very worthwhile.

TI  == c-reactive protein and interleukin-6 responses for differentiating fungal and bacterial aetiology in late-onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  == fungal infections are increasingly frequent causes of neonatal sepsis (ns). this  study examined the predictive value of the combined evaluation of the c-reactive  protein (crp) and interleukin-6 (il-6) responses for differentiating fungal and bacterial aetiologies in patients with ns. from january to september 2007, neonates who were diagnosed with ns and had their crp and il-6 levels measured were selected. based on their blood culture results, the neonates were divided into two groups: group of fungal sepsis (fs) and group of bacterial sepsis (bs).  fs included 14 candida albicans and one non-albicans candida isolates and bs included five klebsiella pneumoniae, three pseudomonas aeruginosa, three enterococcus faecalis, two coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, one enterococcus faecium and one acinetobacter species. significant differences were  observed in the crp (fs vs. bs: 28.10 +/- 11.03 vs. 11.39 +/- 2.94 mg l(-1), p =  0.026) and il-6 (fs vs. bs: 38.60 +/- 24.24 vs. 392.82 +/- 102.46 ng l(-1), p = 0.000) levels between groups. the combined evaluation of the crp and il-6 responses better predicted the causative micro-organism in ns.

TI  == intraoperative blood salvage and leukocyte depletion during liver transplantation with bacterial contamination.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination is considered to be a contraindication for intraoperative blood salvage (ibs) during olt. the aims of this study were to evaluate the efficiency of the autotransfusion device with an additional leukocyte depletion filter (ldf) for eliminating bacterial contaminations, and its clinical outcomes in terms of post-operative infections during olt. methods:  forty-five patients with end-stage liver disease and cirrhotic ascites were enrolled in this study. the blood from the surgical field was collected and processed by an autotransfusion device (cell saver 5) and a ldf for bacteriological analysis. among them, 12 patients with chronic severe hepatitis b received autologous transfusion for analysis of the effect on post-operative infections. results: spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (sbp) (p < 0.05, or = 20.1) and a long duration of operation (p < 0.01, or = 8.3) were found to be critical risk factors for contamination. autotransfusion devices with an additional ldf significantly eliminated bacterial contaminants from shed blood (p < 0.05). about 33% (4/12) of the patients who received autologous transfusion with salvaged and filtered erythrocytes got post-operative bacterial infection. conclusions: autotransfusion devices with an additional ldf could significantly eliminate bacterial contaminants of shed blood during olt. the new mode of ibs might be a good option in reducing post-operative infections, and deserves a large-scale clinical trial.

TI  == is there an association between nosocomial infection rates and bacterial cross transmissions?
AB  == objective: surveillance data of nosocomial infection rates are increasingly used  for public reporting and interhospital comparisons. approximately 15% of nosocomial infections on intensive care units are the result of patient-to-patient transmissions of the causative organisms. these exogenous infections could be prevented by adherence to basic infection control measures. the association between bacterial cross transmissions and nosocomial infection rates was analyzed. design: prospective cohort study during 24 months. setting: eleven intensive care units from two university hospitals. patients: all inpatients. interventions: none. measurements and main results: primary isolates  of six indicator organisms (acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus) cultured from clinical samples or methicillin-resistant s. aureus surveillance testing of all inpatients were genotyped. indistinguishable isolates in > or =2 patients defined potential episodes of transmissions. surveillance of nosocomial  infection rates was performed according to the german nosocomial infection surveillance system, krankenhaus infektions surveillance system. transmission events and nosocomial infection rates were pooled by intensive care unit to calculate spearman's rank-correlation test. during 100,781 patient days, 100,829  microbiological specimens from 24,362 patients were sampled (average investigation density: 1.0 sample per patient and day) and 3419 primary indicator organisms were cultured. altogether, 462 transmissions (incidence density of 4.6  transmissions per 1000 patient days; range, 1.4-8.4 days) and 1216 nosocomial infections (incidence density of 12.1 per 1000 patient days; range, 6.2-16.6 days) were discerned. correlation analysis was unable to reveal any association between the incidence of cross transmissions and nosocomial infections, duration  of hospitalization, or device use. conclusions: differences in nosocomial infection rates between study intensive care units are not explained solely by cross transmissions. other factors, like the severity of the patient's underlying diseases, the patient's endogenous flora, or invasive procedures, likely have a dominant effect on the magnitude of nosocomial infection rates.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms: tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial 2004 to 2007.
AB  == the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. against gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline mic(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/l for escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for pseudomonas aeruginosa). against gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline mic(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. the in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant a. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing e. coli  (7.0%) and k. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing h. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (45.9%)  and e. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (13.8%). tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult  to treat organisms.

TI  == new antimicrobial agents for use in the intensive care unit.
AB  == timely provision of adequate antimicrobial coverage in an initial anti-infective  treatment regimen results in optimal outcomes for bacterial and fungal infections. however, selection of appropriate antimicrobial regimens for treatment of infections in the intensive care unit (icu) can be challenging due to expansion of resistance, which typically requires use of multidrug anti-infective regimens to provide adequate coverage of important pathogens commonly seen in the icu setting. indeed, a recent additional call to action by the infectious diseases society of america (idsa) has enforced the impact that antimicrobial-resistant pathogens can have on patient care. the term eskape has been coined by this idsa group to refer to enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumanii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species, the etiologic causes of the majority of hospital-acquired infections in the united states that are able to effectively "escape" our antibiotic arsenal and that also mandate discovery of new antimicrobial agents. this article reviews select antibacterial agents and an antifungal agent in late stages of clinical development that appear to have potential for treatment of infections in the icu.

TI  == bacteriocin production by pediococcus pentosaceus isolated from marula (scerocarya birrea).
AB  == strain st44am, isolated from marula, was identified as pediococcus pentosaceus based on biochemical tests, sugar fermentation reactions (api 50chl), pcr with species-specific primers and 16s rdna sequencing. strain st44am produces a 6.5 kda class iia bacteriocin, active against lactic acid bacteria, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, listeria innocua, listeria ivanovii subsp. ivanovii and listeria monocytogenes. the peptide is inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, triton x-100, triton x-114, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea, nacl and edta. no change in activity was recorded after 2 h at ph values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at  100 degrees c for 120 min or 121 degrees c for 20 min. the mode of activity against l. ivanovii susbp. ivanovii atcc19119 and enterococcus faecium hklhs is bactericidal, resulting in cell lyses and enzyme- and dna-leakage. no significant differences in cell growth and bacteriocin production were observed when strain st44am was cultured in mrs broth at 26 degrees c, 30 degrees c and 37 degrees c for 24 h and tested against the same target strain. l. ivanovii subsp. ivanovii atcc 19119 and e. faecium hklhs did, however, differ in sensitivity to bacteriocin st44am (3.3x10(6) au/ml and 2.6x10(4) au/ml, respectively). peptide st44am adsorbs at high levels (1600 au/ml) to producer cells. bacteriocin st44am  may be a derivative of pediocin pa-1. this is the first report on the presence of p. pentosaceus in marula and a pediocin pa-1 derivative produced by this species. we are also the first to report on the synergetic effect ciprofloxacin has on a pediocin-like bacteriocin.

TI  == identification and characterization of a bioactive lantibiotic produced by staphylococcus warneri.
AB  == lantibiotics are a group of potent antibacterial agents that contain unusual amino acids, such as the thioether amino acids lanthionine and methyllanthionine, and the didehydroamino acids didehydroalanine and didehydro-aminobutyric acid. here, we report on an antibacterial lantibiotic peptide named swlp1 (staphylococcus warneri lantibiotic peptide 1), which is secreted from staphylococcus warneri (deposited with dsmz, accession number dsm 16081). swlp1 was purified from growth media. the purified peptide displays antibacterial activity against several species, including staphylococcus epidermidis. the molecular mass of swlp1 is 2998.9 da as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. the sequence and possible structure was elucidated by combining electrospray ionization mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry data of ethanethiol-treated and non-ethanethiol-treated tryptic fragments of the swlp1. swlp1 contains three thioether bridges, one didehydroalanine, and three didehydroaminobutyric acids. this peptide has the potential to be used in treatment of several gram-positive bacterial infections.

TI  == tigecycline in combination with other antimicrobials: a review of in vitro, animal and case report studies.
AB  == tigecycline has been investigated in combination with other antibacterials against a wide range of susceptible and multiresistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. combinations have been analysed in vitro, in animal models and in human case reports. in vitro, tigecycline combined with other antimicrobials produces primarily an indifferent response (neither synergy nor antagonism). nevertheless, synergy occurred when tigecycline was combined with rifampicin against 64-100% of enterococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacter spp. and brucella melitensis isolates. combinations of tigecycline with amikacin also showed synergy for 40-100% of enterobacter spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp. and stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates. moreover, bactericidal synergisms occurred with tigecycline plus amikacin against problematic acinetobacter baumannii and proteus vulgaris, and with colistin against k. pneumoniae. data from animal experiments and case reports, although limited, displayed consistent beneficial activity of tigecycline in combination with other antibacterials against multiresistant organisms, including vancomycin  against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae in experimental meningitis, gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa in experimental pneumonia, daptomycin against enterococcus faecium endocarditis, and colistin against k. pneumoniae bacteraemia and p. aeruginosa osteomyelitis. antagonism was extremely rare in vitro and was not reported in vivo. thus, tigecycline may be combined with a second antimicrobial as part of a combination regimen.

TI  == infections in a surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital in greece.
AB  == objectives: we aimed to evaluate the clinical and microbiological characteristics of the patients who developed an infection in our surgical intensive care unit (sicu). methods: this was a prospective study of all patients who sustained an icu-acquired infection from 2002 to 2004. results: among 683 consecutive sicu patients, 123 (18.0%) developed 241 infections (48.3 infections per 1000 patient-days). the mean age of patients was 66.7+/-3.8 years, the mean apache ii  score (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) on sicu admission was 18.2+/-2.4, and the mean sofa score (sepsis-related organ failure assessment) at  the onset of infection was 8.8+/-2. of the study patients, 51.2% were women. infections were: bloodstream (36.1%), ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap; 25.3%, 20.3/1000 ventilator-days), surgical site (18.7%), central venous catheter (10.4%, 7.1/1000 central venous catheter-days), and urinary tract infection (9.5%, 4.6/1000 urinary catheter-days). the most frequent microorganisms found were: acinetobacter baumannii (20.3%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.7%), candida albicans (13.2%), enterococcus faecalis (10.4%), klebsiella pneumoniae (9.2%), enterococcus faecium (7.9%), and staphylococcus aureus (6.7%). high resistance to the majority of antibiotics was identified. the complication and mortality rates  were 58.5% and 39.0%, respectively. multivariate analysis identified apache ii score on admission (odds ratio (or) 4.63, 95% confidence interval (ci) 2.69-5.26, p=0.01), peritonitis (or 1.85, 95% ci 1.03-3.25, p=0.03), acute pancreatitis (or  2.27, 95% ci 1.05-3.75, p=0.02), previous aminoglycoside use (or 2.84, 95% ci 1.06-5.14, p=0.03), and mechanical ventilation (or 3.26, 95% ci: 2.43-6.15, p=0.01) as risk factors for infection development. age (or 1.16, 95% ci 1.01-1.33, p=0.03), apache ii score on admission (or 2.53, 95% ci 1.77-3.41, p=0.02), sofa score at the onset of infection (or 2.88, 95% ci 1.85-4.02, p=0.02), and vap (or 1.32, 95% ci 1.04-1.85, p=0.03) were associated with mortality. conclusions: infections are an important problem in sicus due to high  incidence, multi-drug resistance, complications, and mortality rate. in our study, apache ii score on admission, peritonitis, acute pancreatitis, previous aminoglycoside use, and mechanical ventilation were identified as risk factors for infection development, whereas age, apache ii score on admission, sofa score  at the onset of infection, and vap were associated with mortality.

TI  == effectiveness and kinetics of ferrate as a disinfectant for ballast water.
AB  == this study examined whether ferrate could meet the international standards for successful ballast water treatment, including final concentrations of less than 1 cfu/ml of enterococci, less than 2.5 cfu/ml of escherichia coli, and less than 1  cfu/100 ml of vibrio cholerae. pure cultures of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and v. cholerae, and a mixed culture of enterococcus faecium and e. faecilis were grown in saline solution to simulate ballast water and were treated with dosages  of ferrate ranging from 0.25 to 5.0 mg/l. a ferrate dose of 5 mg/l resulted in complete disinfection of all organisms tested, and smaller dosages were also very effective. tailing was consistently observed, and the hom's model (1972) appeared to most accurately represent the action of ferrate on these organisms. salinity and ph did not adversely affect results, and regrowth was not a problem. ferrate  shows good potential as an effective disinfectant in the treatment of ballast water.

TI  == differential correlation between rates of antimicrobial drug consumption and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in a tertiary care hospital in greece.
AB  == objective: to investigate whether there is a correlation between the rates of antimicrobial drug consumption in hospital departments and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among clinically important bacteria recovered in the hospital. design: retrospective study. setting: tertiary care hospital in greece. methods: data on antimicrobial consumption (from january 2001 through december 2004) were expressed as defined daily doses per 100 bed-days. the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and enterococcus faecium recovered during the same time period were calculated by the microbiology department. we then performed the following analyses: (1) a comparison of the consumption rates for different antimicrobial groups in individual hospital departments, (2) a comparison of the prevalence of resistance to different antimicrobials, and (3) a correlation analysis of antimicrobial consumption rates and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance. results: the rates of antimicrobial consumption and the prevalence of resistance varied substantially among the hospital's departments. the annual rate of consumption for carbapenems  correlated with the rate of consumption for glycopeptides and third-generation cephalosporins (p < .05). among p. aeruginosa isolates, the prevalence of imipenem resistance correlated with the prevalence of resistance to amikacin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftazidime (p < .05). the rate of carbapenem consumption correlated with the prevalence of imipenem resistance among p. aeruginosa and a.  baumannii isolates (p < .05). the rate of aminoglycoside consumption correlated with the prevalence of amikacin resistance among p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. coli isolates (p < .05). however, the rate of consumption for fluoroquinolones and glycopeptides had no correlation with the prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance among gram-negative bacteria or vancomycin resistance among e. faecium isolates. conclusions: these data are suggestive of a differential relationship between antimicrobial consumption and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among various species and for various antimicrobial agents. these findings may help to optimize antimicrobial prescription policies in the hospital, especially in departments that have both high rates of antimicrobial consumption and a high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole, a novel anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin, tested against contemporary pathogens: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2005-2006).
AB  == ceftobiprole is a 1st-in-class anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) extended-spectrum cephalosporin currently in clinical trials for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssis) and nosocomial pneumonia. this agent is also active against other prominent gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, making it an attractive candidate for  broad-spectrum therapy. we evaluated the in vitro potency of ceftobiprole tested  against the most commonly occurring bacterial pathogens as part of a global surveillance study for the years 2005 to 2006 (>60 medical centers in north america, latin america, and europe). all isolates (40 675) were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. ceftobiprole inhibited 100% and >99% of tested s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at < or =4 and  < or =8 microg/ml, respectively, although mic90 values for oxacillin-resistant strains were 4-fold and 8-fold higher than oxacillin-susceptible isolates for the 2 groups. ceftobiprole was also broadly active against streptococcus pneumoniae,  beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, inhibiting >98% of isolates at <  or =0.5 microg/ml. although ceftobiprole was generally inactive against enterococcus faecium, the majority of enterococcus faecalis strains (95.7%) were  inhibited at < or =4 microg/ml. this agent was similar in potency to the "3rd- and 4th-generation" cephems (mic50 values, < or =0.06 microg/ml) for all tested enterobacteriaceae. although cefepime provided enhanced coverage against klebsiella spp. (86.5% at < or =8 microg/ml versus 76.9-81.7% for ceftobiprole and ceftazidime), ceftobiprole and cefepime were superior to ceftazidime against  enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftobiprole was equal in potency to ceftazidime (mic50, 2 microg/ml) and 2-fold  more potent than cefepime. none of these agents inhibited >45% of acinetobacter spp. at 8 mug/ml. ceftobiprole is a new anti-mrsa beta-lactam with recognized activity against the most commonly occurring enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, similar to that of extended-spectrum cephems. these characteristics warrant continued evaluation of the agent as empiric therapy for csssis, and in pneumonia, especially in those institutions/regions where mrsa and p. aeruginosa  may be prevalent.

TI  == empiric antibiotic therapy for seawater injuries: a four-seasonal analysis.
AB  == background: previous seawater studies found vibrio species associated with morbidity, suggesting that seawater-contaminated wounds should be treated early.  the purpose of this study was to identify common seawater pathogens and antibiotic sensitivities to provide empiric antibiotic therapy until patient-specific culture results are available. methods: seasonal samples were collected from 25 galveston beach locations and cultured. colonies were identified and sensitivities were performed using microscan positive and negative breakpoint combo panels. results: in the fall (28.3 degrees c), of 15 species isolated, the three most common isolates were escherichia coli, enterococcus faecium, and klebsiella pneumoniae. gram-negative isolates were sensitive to levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, and cefepime. gram-positive isolates were sensitive to penicillin and ampicillin. in the winter (11.1 degrees c), of 14 species isolated, the three most common isolates were enterobacter agglomerans, e. faecium, and e. coli. gram-negative isolates were sensitive to levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, and cefepime. most gram-positive isolates were sensitive to vancomycin, levofloxacin, penicillin, and ampicillin. in the spring (26.6 degrees c), of 14 species isolated, the three most common isolates were e. coli, bacillus species, and e. faecium. gram-negative isolates were sensitive to levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, and cefepime. most gram-positive isolates were sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. in the summer (29.7 degrees c), of 17 bacterial species isolated, the three most common isolates were bacillus species, enterobacter cloacae, and k. pneumoniae. gram-negative isolates were sensitive to cefepime, lomefloxacin, and levofloxacin. gram-positive isolates were sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and  chloramphenicol. conclusions: cultured pathogens were sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin, or levofloxacin. the authors recommend a combination of penicillin or ampicillin with levofloxacin for empiric antibiotic coverage for seawater-contaminated injuries.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of twenty lysine-peptoid hybrids against clinically relevant bacteria and fungi.
AB  == background: this paper describes the antimicrobial activities of 20 lysine-peptoid hybrids against a selection of clinically relevant bacteria and fungi. methods: minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (atcc 33591), vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (atcc 700699 mu50), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (atcc 700221), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853), salmonella typhimurium (clinical isolate), klebsiella pneumoniae (clinical isolate), amphotericin-b-resistant c. albicans (atcc 200955) and cryptococcus neoformans (clinical isolate). results: the lysine-peptoid hybrids proved to be active against all strains tested, except k. pneumoniae. for each susceptible strain, we identified at least 4 lysine-peptoid hybrids showing excellent activity. the most active compounds displayed minimal inhibitory concentrations ranging from < or =1.6 to 6.25 microm. conclusion: this study demonstrates that lysine-peptoid hybrids show activity against drug-resistant pathogens.

TI  == ability of organic and inorganic bedding materials to promote growth of environmental bacteria.
AB  == the major objective of this study was to contrast the ability of 4 commonly utilized bedding materials to promote growth of environmental bacteria under controlled conditions. a second objective was to describe the relationship between bacterial growth and specific biochemical or nutritional properties of these bedding materials. unused samples of clean sand (cs; n = 20), recycled sand (rs; n = 21), digested manure solids (ds; n = 15), and shavings (sh; n = 15) were collected from bedding storage areas on 49 commercial minnesota and wisconsin dairy farms. sterilized bedding samples were inoculated with klebsiella pneumoniae and enterococcus faecium then incubated, in triplicate, for 72 h at 37 degrees c. subsamples were collected after 0, 24, 48, and 72 h of incubation for  culture and enumeration of bacteria. subsamples of bedding were also tested for ph, total c content (%), and total n content (%). if bacterial growth occurred, peak levels were typically achieved within 24 h. digested manure solids promoted  the greatest amounts of growth of k. pneumoniae, followed by rs and then sh, whereas cs promoted the least. there would seem to be a tradeoff in selecting sh  as a bedding material, because it supported moderate growth of k. pneumoniae but  caused a rapid decline in the numbers of e. faecium. however, rs, cs, and ds each only supported relatively small amounts of growth of e. faecium, so the benefit of sh relative to other bedding materials is limited. high bedding ph may partially explain why some bedding materials supported growth of e. faecium (e.g., ds and rs). both high bedding ph (e.g., as for ds or rs) and high total c  (%) content (e.g., as for ds and sh) may partially explain why some bedding materials supported growth of k. pneumoniae.

TI  == [microorganisms isolated from blood cultures and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns at a university hospital during 1994-2003].
AB  == background: blood culture is important for the determination of the etiologic agent of bacteremia. analysis of blood culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility trend can provide clinicians with relevant information for the empirical treatment of patients. methods: the species and antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates from blood cultures at the severance hospital during 1994-2003 were analysed. blood specimens were cultured for 7 days using tryptic soy broth and thioglycollate medium. identification of organism was based on conventional methods or commercial kit systems. antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by a disk diffusion method. results: of 536,916 blood specimens cultured, 24,877 (4.6%) from 13,102 patients were positive. among the isolates, 93.1% were aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria, 3.3% anaerobes, and 3.6% fungi. escherichia coli was isolated most frequently, followed by staphylococcus  aureus, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, enterococcus spp., and klebsiella pneumoniae. the proportion of patients with enterococcus faecium and k. pneumoniae gradually increased during this study. enterococcus, s. aureus and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus were frequently isolated from the age group of less than 2 yr. e. coli, enterococcus spp., k. pneumoniae and s. aureus from the age group of over 50 yr. oxacillin-resistant s. aureus decreased, whereas vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and imipenemresistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and  acinetobacter baumannii increased. conclusions: e. coli was the most common cause of bacteremia and s. aureus, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, and k. pneumoniae were frequently isolated pathogens. the bacteremia due to enterococcus, k. pneumoniae, fungi, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii gradually increased during this period.

TI  == isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as  antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis,  s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20  other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment  with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability  by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized  with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in 11 hospitals in puerto rico: results of an antimicrobial resistance management (arm) program.
AB  == purpose: the antimicrobial resistance management program (armp) was established in 1997 at the university of florida as an ongoing project to document trends in  antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in inpatient/outpatient isolates and track  resistance that may occur with specific antibiotic use. methods: institutions are enrolled at no charge and provide a minimum of 3 years of antibiogram/sensitivity report data, which are reviewed to create a customized analysis of antimicrobial  susceptibility trends benchmarked against national/regional comparators. the data, in a hipaa-compliant non-identifying format, comprise a national aggregate  database of 28.4 million isolates from 358 institutions. this database was interrogated to determine resistance rates for eleven hospitals in puerto rico from 1998-2003 and, as comparators, those in the database from the state of florida and all u.s. institutions. results: between 1996-2003, data on 328,837 isolates collected from 11 hospitals throughout puerto rico, 5,388,897 isolates from 46 institutions in florida, and 24,951,098 isolates from 358 u.s. institutions for the following organisms (number of antibiotics tested against) were reviewed for susceptibility: coagulase-negative staphylococci (14)/staphylococcus epidermidis (18), enterococcus faecalis (7), enterococcus faecium (5), enterococcus species (4), escherichia coli (24), klebsiella pneumoniae (24), proteus mirabilis (22), pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), serratia marcescens (22), staphylococcus aureus (23), and streptococcus pneumoniae (9). antimicrobial resistance in puerto rico varied organism to organism from that observed in florida and nationally. conclusions: this first broad analysis of antimicrobial resistance in puerto rico provides important baseline data, both for sentinel surveillance programs and for determining strategies for intervention.

TI  == composition of intestinal enterobacteriaceae populations of healthy domestic pigs.
AB  == in this study, the enterobacteriaceae microbiota, including their diversity as well as the distribution of haemolytic and virulence gene-harbouring escherichia  coli of 56-day-old healthy piglets, was characterized. both the composition and the diversity of enterobacteriaceae populations varied considerably between individual pigs and intestinal sections. e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and klebsiella pneumoniae dominated the enterobacteriaceae microbiota. however, mucosa-associated enterobacteriaceae were scarce or in some  cases undetectable. the majority of e. coli clones from the jejunum were also found in the colon, with up to 10 different e. coli clones in one intestinal section. other enterobacteriaceae species were represented by only one clone localized to one intestinal section. while several piglets did not harbour virulence gene-positive or haemolytic e. coli, such strains dominated intestinal  sections of other animals. this study reveals that the diversity of intestinal enterobacteriaceae is clearly individual. in general, enterobacteriaceae do not appear to be a consistent fraction of the microbiota of the jejunum. high numbers of adherent bacteria do not appear to be essential for successful intestinal colonization, and e. coli clones do not necessarily colonize distinct intestinal  sections based on the particular phylogenetic affiliation. furthermore, dominance of haemolytic or virulence gene-positive e. coli does not correlate with disease. finally, probiotic enterococcus faecium feed supplementation does not affect the  enterobacteriaceae microbiota.

AB  == background: ceftaroline (ppi-0903m, t-91825) is a novel cephalosporin, administered as an n-phosphono prodrug. we investigated its in vitro activity and resistance selection potential. methods: mics were determined by clsi agar dilution, but with varied inocula. mutant selection was investigated in single- and multi-step procedures. results: mics for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were 0.5-2 mg/l, compared with 0.12-0.25 mg/l for methicillin-susceptible s. aureus; corresponding values for coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.25-2 and 0.06-0.12 mg/l, respectively. even with 2% nacl added, all mrsa were susceptible at 2 mg/l. mics for enterococcus faecalis were from 0.25 to 8 mg/l; e. faecium was resistant. mics for escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., morganella morganii and proteeae without acquired resistance were 0.06-0.5 mg/l versus 0.12-1 mg/l for enterobacter, serratia and citrobacter  spp. and 2-8 mg/l for acinetobacter spp. mics rose to 1-2 mg/l for many enterobacteriaceae with classical tem beta-lactamases, and were much higher for those with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), hyperproduced ampc or k1 enzymes. mics for strains with classical tem/shv beta-lactamases rose if the inoculum was increased to 10(6) cfu/spot; this effect was even more marked for those with esbls. resistance due to class a beta-lactamases was reversed by clavulanate. geometric mean mics were 0.005, 0.05 and 0.09 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, respectively-lower than for any comparator beta-lactam. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible, although with marginally raised mics for beta-lactamase-positive moraxella strains and for haemophili with chromosomal ampicillin resistance. ceftaroline selected ampc-derepressed enterobacter mutants similarly to cefotaxime in single-step experiments; in multi-step procedures it selected esbl variants of blatem in e. coli. resistance selection was not seen with s. aureus, h. influenzae or pneumococci. conclusions: ceftaroline has impressive anti-mrsa and anti-pneumococcal activity. slight lability to classical tem and shv beta-lactamases is exceptional for an oxyimino-cephalosporin, but was reversible  with clavulanate, as was the greater resistance mediated by esbls. resistance selection occurred with enterobacteriaceae, not mrsa.

AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == detection of aortic graft infection by 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography.
AB  == functional in vivo molecular imaging is provided with 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (fdg-pet), which can detect cells with high glucose  turnover. fdg-pet is an established imaging tool in oncology but has also been used in infectious and inflammatory diseases. pet combined with computed tomography (pet/ct) shows the metabolic activity with precise anatomic localization. more than 2000 scanners have now been installed worldwide, and with better availability, this hybrid method has the potential to become an important  imaging tool in the management of suspected aortic graft infections, especially in patients with low-grade graft infection. we report a patient with a suspected  aortic graft infection that was confirmed and anatomically localized by fdg-pet/ct. an extra-anatomic bypass and extirpation of the aortic graft was performed. the perioperative location of the graft infection coincided exactly with the place of fdg uptake shown on pet/ct. the patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and did well during 6 months of follow-up.

TI  == bacterial isolates from severe infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in italy: a nationwide study in the hospital setting.
AB  == the most frequent agents of severe bacterial infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns were determined in patients admitted to 45 italian hospitals over the years 2002-2003. the most common diagnoses were: sepsis (33.8%), pneumonia (9.4%), intravascular catheter-associated infections (9.3%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (8.1%). overall, 5115 bacterial isolates were identified from 4228 patients. three bacterial species, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli, accounted for more than 50% of the isolates. other prevalent bacterial isolates were staphylococcus epidermidis and  enterococcus faecalis, while acinetobacter baumanii ranked third among all intensive care unit (icu) isolates. 7% of s. aureus had intermediate resistance to vancomycin. although e. faecalis displayed no vancomycin resistance, 34% of vancomycin-resistant isolates were found among enterococcus faecium, one of the highest rates found to date, emphasizing the difference between these two enterococcal species. all the gram-positive pathogens were susceptible to linezolid, with the exception of approximately 2% of the enterococcal isolates that were intermediate with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)=4 microg/ml. almost 10% of escherichia coli, 14% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 22% of serratia marcescens and 50% of enterobacter cloacae were non-susceptible to cefotaxime. amikacin was the most active antibiotic against p. aeruginosa that showed lack of susceptibility to ceftazidime, gentamicin, piperacillin and ciprofloxacin ranging from 20 to 35%. finally, acinetobacter baumanii showed a high level of resistance to all the antibiotics tested including imipenem (58%). the results obtained in this study, the first of its kind in italy, offer indications for guiding empirical therapy and implementing specific interventions to fight antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and their transmission in the hospital  setting in italy.

TI  == comparison of bactec plus blood culture media to bact/alert fa blood culture media for detection of bacterial pathogens in samples containing therapeutic levels of antibiotics.
AB  == blood culture bottles with antimicrobial removal systems are recommended for patients who develop fever while on antibiotics. this study compared the ability  of becton dickinson (sparks, md) bactec plus bottles and biomerieux (durham, nc)  bact/alert fa bottles to effectively remove vancomycin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, and a combination of gentamicin/penicillin, thus allowing bacterial pathogens to grow.  each bottle was spiked with 10 ml of human blood, antibiotic, and strains of organisms susceptible to the antibiotic evaluated. the organisms used were type strains and clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible and resistant), streptococcus pneumoniae, a viridans streptococcus, enterococcus  faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. testing was completed in triplicate, using 10 to 100 cfu/ml of organisms with various concentrations of each antibiotic. two rounds of testing were completed per antibiotic/organism combination. bottles were mixed and loaded onto their respective instruments as per the manufacturer's instructions. antimicrobial removal was evaluated on the basis of time to detection of organism growth, for up to 5 days of incubation. overall, the bact/alert fa system recovered 25.1% of strains from test bottles and 96.9% of strains from growth control bottles (no antibiotic added), and the bactec plus system recovered 95.1% of strains from test bottles and 100% of strains from growth control bottles. both systems performed well in the detection of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of gentamicin. in the presence of ceftriaxone, neither system was able to recover streptococcus pneumoniae. the ability to remove vancomycin and cefoxitin was also determined by measuring antibiotic levels remaining in bottles after 1 h of incubation. the results demonstrated remaining levels of 72 to 90% of vancomycin and 71 to 72% of cefoxitin in the bact/alert system. for the bactec system, remaining levels were 0 to 30% of vancomycin and 0% of cefoxitin. under these simulated conditions, the bactec plus system was superior to the bact/alert fa system in recovering gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics, gentamicin/penicillin, and vancomycin.

TI  == five-year surveillance of nosocomial infections in ankara training and research hospital.
AB  == the objective of this study was to assess the rate of nosocomial infections (nis), frequency of nosocomial pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility changes in a 530-bed hospital over a five-year period. hospital-wide laboratory-based ni  surveillance was performed prospectively between 1999 and 2003. the centers for disease control and prevention's definitions were used for nis and nosocomial surgical site infections, and ni rates were calculated by the number of nis per number of hospitalized patients on an annual basis. ni rates ranged between 1.4%  and 2.4%. higher rates were observed in the neurology, neurosurgery, paediatric and dermatology departments; the low rate of nis overall may be due to the surveillance method used. the most commonly observed infections were urinary tract, surgical site and primary bloodstream infections, and the most frequently  isolated pathogens were escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus spp. and staphylococcus aureus. carbapenems were the most effective agents against enterobacteriaceae. meticillin resistance among s. aureus isolates was less than 50%, and all s. aureus and enterococcus spp. isolates were susceptible  to glycopeptides apart from one glycopeptide-resistant e. faecium isolate identified in 2003. data obtained by the same method enabled comparison between years and assisted in the detection of recent changes. antimicrobial susceptibility data on nosocomial pathogens provided valuable guidance for empirical antimicrobial therapy of nis.

TI  == morphine withdrawal lowers host defense to enteric bacteria: spontaneous sepsis and increased sensitivity to oral salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium infection.
AB  == understanding the consequences of drug withdrawal on immune function and host defense to infection is important. we, and others, previously demonstrated that morphine withdrawal results in immunosuppression and sensitizes to lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock. in the present study, the effect of morphine withdrawal on spontaneous sepsis and on oral infection with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium was examined. mice were chronically exposed to morphine for 96 h by implantation of a slow-release morphine pellet. abrupt withdrawal was induced by removal of the pellet. in the sepsis model, bacterial colonization was examined and bacterial species were identified by necropsy of various tissues. it was found that at 48 h postwithdrawal, morphine-treated mice  had enteric bacteria that were detected in the peyer's patches (4/5), mesenteric  lymph nodes (4/5), spleens (4/10), livers (6/10), and peritoneal cavities (8/10). in placebo pellet-withdrawn mice, only 2/40 cultures were positive. the most frequently detected organisms in tissues of morphine-withdrawn mice were enterococcus faecium followed by klebsiella pneumoniae. both organisms are part of the normal gastrointestinal flora. in the infection model, mice were orally inoculated with s. enterica 24 h post-initiation of abrupt withdrawal from morphine. withdrawal significantly decreased the mean survival time and significantly increased the salmonella burden in various tissues of infected mice compared to placebo-withdrawn animals. elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokines were observed in spleens of morphine-withdrawn mice, compared to placebo-withdrawn mice. these findings demonstrate that morphine withdrawal sensitizes to oral infection with a bacterial pathogen and predisposes mice to bacterial sepsis.

TI  == [occurrence of oral subclinical infections in insulin treated diabetics].
AB  == the purpose of this study was to examine oral cavity condition, identify microorganisms and evaluate interrelation between protozoans, bacteria and fungi  occurring in mouths of insuline treated diabetics. 30 men and women, 25-60 years  old, were clinically assessed for their oral cavity condition including ph range. fifteen of them were the insuline treated diabetics. swabs taken of different sites of periodontium, dental plaques and dental pockets collected from each patients were used for detection and identification of protozoans, bacteria and fungi. mucosal inflammation, dental caries, loose teeth, periodontitis were observed in the diabetic patients, whereas the oral cavities were generally in better condition in the control patients. prevalence of the protozoan parasites entamoeba gingivalis and trichomonas tenax was higher in the control patients than in the diabetics (26.6% and 13.3%, respectively). fecal bacteria enterococcus fecalis, e. faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae occurred with significantly higher frequency in the insuline treated patients (60%) than in the control (6.6%). various candida albicans strains were more often found in the diabetic (53.2%) than in the control patients (13.3%). the results of our studies show a clear interrelation between alteration of oral health and the occurrence of microorganisms in the insuline treated diabetics. metabolic disease that causes serious multi-organ disturbances as well as insulinotherapy are the very important factors changing oral cavity ecology of the persons with diabetes mellitus; decresed ph (the average 5.5) may inhibit development of infection with protozoans in the oral cavity of these patients and favour subclinical infections with other microorganisms. thus, in the insuline treated diabetics, examination of mouths with regard to the occurrence of opportunistic fecal bacteria and fungi, particularly before a therapy with antibiotics is strongly recommended.

TI  == [antibiotic-resistance in italy: activity of the first year of the surveillance project ar-iss].
AB  == the antibiotic resistance surveillance project ar-iss, started in 2001, is based  on a network of 62 sentinel microbiological laboratories throughout the country.  the laboratories collect and transmit data to the istituto superiore di sanita on the antibiotic susceptibility of bloodstream isolates of 7 species: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis/faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca ed escherichia coli. they also send selected bacterial strains for further characterization. results of the first year of surveillance are presented and are compared with data from the previous study earss-italia and from other european countries. oxacillin resistance in s. aureus appears to be stable, however, it remains one of the highest in europe (41,5%). no strain with intermediate susceptibility or resistance to vancomycin has been isolated. in s. pneumoniae, the level of penicillin resistance is moderate (10,8%), but macrolide resistance has increased greatly (37,6% versus 28,6% of the previous study), following a tendency common to several european countries. unexpectedly, vancomycin resistance in e. faecium was found to be 18%, the highest in europe. presumptive esbl production in gram-negative organisms can be  estimated at 20% in klebsiella and 1% in e. coli. ampicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance in e. coli (respectively 50% and 18%) are among the highest in europe. in conclusion, the rate of antibiotic resistance in the species studied is worrisome and requires continuing monitoring. although some activities of ar-iss  need improvements, the surveillance has the potentiality to produce relevant and  representative data about antibiotic resistance in italy that can be used for comparison at the european level.

TI  == predominance of gram-negative bacilli and increasing antimicrobial resistance in  nosocomial bloodstream infections at a university hospital in southern taiwan, 1996-2003.
AB  == background and purpose: while nosocomial infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality, the availability of timely and accurate epidemiological information on nosocomial pathogens is essential to the appropriate selection of  empirical therapy. this study analyzed nosocomial bloodstream infections (nbsis)  surveillance data to determine trends in the distribution of pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibilities of these pathogens. methods: during the period from 1996 to 2003 at national cheng kung university hospital, patients with nbsis were enrolled in the study, and the ranking of pathogens and status of antimicrobial resistance were determined. results: from 1996 to 2003, there were  4,038 episodes of nbsis. the overall incidence was 1.79 episodes per 1,000 inpatient-days. aerobic gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive cocci, fungi, and anaerobes were responsible for 51%, 37%, 10%, and 1.6% of nbsis, respectively. the 5 leading pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (16% of nbsis), staphylococcus aureus (13%), candida spp. (10%), acinetobacter baumannii (8%), and escherichia coli (8%). oxacillin resistance was found in 90% of coagulase-negative staphylococci and 75% of s. aureus isolates. in contrast to enterococcus faecalis, in which only 1% of isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 78% of enterococcus faecium isolates were resistant to ampicillin. the emerging antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative pathogens included multidrug-resistant a. baumannii, cephalosporin- or fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae and e. coli. despite the annual increase in the use of fluconazole, candida albicans (54%) remained the most common causative pathogen of nosocomial candidemia. conclusions: in summary, gram-negative bacilli predominated among pathogens causing nbsis and an upsurge in the threat of antimicrobial resistance in our hospital occurred during the 8-year period. surveillance of the characteristics of nbsis and antimicrobial resistance patterns, together with appropriate antibiotic and infection control measures, should be reinforced.

AB  == monitoring temporal trends of antimicrobial resistance can provide useful information for the empirical selection of antimicrobial agents to treat infected patients and for the control of nosocomial infections. in this study, we analyzed antimicrobial resistance of clinically relevant bacteria in 2003 at korean hospitals and at a commercial laboratory. the following organism-antimicrobial agent resistance combinations were very prevalent: oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (68%), expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), and fluoroquinolone-resistant escherichia coli (33%), acinetobacter spp. (58%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (40%). moreover, gradual increases in vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (20%), cefoxitin-resistant e. coli (10%) and k. pneumoniae (23%), and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa (20%) and acinetobacter spp. (13%) were also observed. the resistance rates of acinetobacter spp. to most antimicrobial agents at hospitals and at the commercial laboratory were similar. among the acinetobacter spp. isolated at a tertiary-care hospital, 46.2% were multidrug-resistant to 9-12 of 13 antimicrobial agents, and 18.3% were panresistant. the exclusion of duplicate isolates at a tertiary-care hospital significantly lowered the proportion of oxacillin-resistant s. aureus, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, and fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli.

AB  == background: alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against cd52, a cell surface antigen expressed on b and t lymphocytes, monocytes and nk cells.  its use results in a profound decrease in cd4 positive t lymphocytes. alemtuzumab is used as induction immunosuppression and therapy for rejection in organ transplant recipients in some centers. we followed a cohort of 449 consecutive transplant recipients who received alemtuzumab to determine the occurrence of bloodstream infections, particularly those previously associated with decrease in cd4 positive t lymphocytes. patients and methods: fifteen percent (69/449) patients had at least one episode of bloodstream infection. however, no patient had bacteremia with streptococcus pneumoniae, listeria monocytogenes, non-typhoidal salmonella or mycobacterium avium complex. fungaemia was rare, occurring in 1.5% of patients. the most common organisms isolated from the blood  were staphylococcus aureus (21 episodes), coagulase negative staphylococcus (14 episodes), klebsiella pneumoniae (12 episodes), enterococcus faecium (11 episodes), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 episodes), enterococcus faecalis (9 episodes) and escherichia coli (7 episodes). discussion: we conclude that although alemtuzumab use is associated with profound cd4 positive t lymphocyte depletion, alemtuzumab does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of bloodstream infection with pathogens typically seen in other disorders of cd4 cell depletion, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

AB  == the spectrum of activity and potency of doripenem, a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem currently in clinical development, was evaluated using 16 008 clinical bacterial isolates collected as part of an international surveillance project during 2003. using reference broth microdilution methods, doripenem was found to  be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2705 and 297 isolates, respectively; mic90s 0.06 mg/l), with a potency greater than that of other carbapenem antibiotics. against enterococci (1474 isolates), with the exception of enterococcus faecium,  doripenem displayed modest activity (mic50 4). doripenem was among the most potent agents tested against streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci and beta-haemolytic streptococci (885, 140 and 397 isolates; mic(90)s 0.5, 0.5 and 0.03 mg/l, respectively). for enterobacteriaceae (> 6200 isolates), doripenem was four- to 32-fold more active than imipenem against wild-type isolates (mic90s 0.03-0.5 mg/l). mic90s for confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae (121 and 155  isolates; 0.06 and 0.12 mg/l, respectively) were two-fold higher than for wild-type isolates. doripenem was also active against citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp. and serratia spp. (mic90s 0.06-0.25 mg/l), including ceftazidime-resistant isolates. doripenem and meropenem were the most active agents among all beta-lactams against pseudomonas aeruginosa (829 isolates; mic50/90s 0.5/8 and 0.5/16 mg/l, respectively), whereas doripenem and imipenem were the most active agents against acinetobacter spp. (155 isolates; mic50/90s 0.5/4 and <or= 0.5/2 mg/l, respectively). doripenem was slightly more potent (mic50 2 mg/l) than ertapenem and imipenem (mic50 4 mg/l), and had a potency similar to that of meropenem (mic50 2 mg/l), against burkholderia cepacia (20 isolates). both haemophilus influenzae (1824 isolates) and moraxella catarrhalis  (108 isolates), including beta-lactamase-positive isolates, were susceptible to doripenem (mic90s 0.25 and 0.03 mg/l, respectively). doripenem displays the favourable characteristics of other carbapenems, and appears to offer certain advantages in terms of potency, spectrum and beta-lactamase stability when compared with some carbapenems used currently to treat nosocomial infections.

TI  == correlation between the genetic diversity of nosocomial pathogens and their survival time in intensive care units.
AB  == bacteria differ in their ability to survive in the hospital environment outside the human host. species remaining viable and infectious have a higher chance of being transmitted, giving them a fitness advantage in hospitals. this differential fitness could be expected to alter the genetic population structure  of bacterial populations in hospitals, and should be reflected by the relative abundance of several successful clones. the objective of this study was to test for a potential correlation between tenacity, i.e. environmental survival, and clonal abundance determined by the genetic diversity in different bacterial species from prospectively collected isolates of intensive care patients. a literature review was performed to identify mean environmental survival times for the most important pathogens in intensive care units (icus): staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, acetinobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. to determine the genetic diversity of the natural population of these species in icus, a prospective 18-month study was conducted in five units with median nosocomial infection rates. all clinical isolates were collected, and highly discriminatory dna fingerprinting techniques were used to identify specific clones. a diversity index for each species was calculated as the number  of distinguishable genotypes in the population divided by size. the correlation between survival times and the diversity indices for the individual pathogens was investigated using non-parametric methods. although 21 studies were identified in the literature, only two were relevant. they showed median survival times between 1.5 days (p. aeruginosa) and 60.0 days (enterococcus faecium). during the prospective icu study, 1264 pathogens were investigated and simple diversity indices between 49.1 (enterococcus faecalis) and 89.8 (e. coli) were found. a correlation between survival times and the diversity indices for the individual pathogens was found (correlation coefficient 0.821, p=0.024). environmental survival may be an important factor contributing to the ecological fitness of some nosocomial pathogens in icus. infection control measures should consider this finding.

AB  == bacteriophage (phage) therapy involves using phages or their products as bioagents for the treatment or prophylaxis of bacterial infectious diseases. much evidence in support of the effectiveness of phage therapy against bacterial infectious diseases has accumulated since 1980 from animal model studies conducted in western countries. reports indicate that appropriate administration  of living phages can be used to treat lethal infectious diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, vibrio vulnificus, and salmonella spp., and gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus. the phage display system and genetically modified nonreplicating phages are also effective for treatment of helicobacter pylori and p. aeruginosa, respectively. in addition to phage particles per se, purified phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolase (lysin) is also reported to be effective for the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria such  as streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, bacillus anthracis, and group b streptococci. all phage lysins that have been studied to date exhibit immediate and strong bacteriolytic activity when applied exogenously. furthermore, phage-coded inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis (protein antibiotics), search methods for novel antibacterial agents using phage genome informatics, and vaccines utilizing phages or their products are being developed. phage therapy will compensate for unavoidable complications of chemotherapy such as the appearance of multidrug resistance or substituted microbism.

AB  == in 2003, 826 uropathogenic strains were obtained from the urine of our patients.  we assessed their activities to antibacterial agents based on the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints recommended by the national committee  for clinical standards (nccls). methicillin-resistant strains accounted for about 70% of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the most common gram-positive species was enterococcus faecalis (15.6%). enterococcus faecium was the most resistant of the enterococcal species, and the rate of susceptibility to beta-lactams (bls), fluoroquinolones (fqs), and tetracyclines (tcs) was 0%, 6%, and less than 18%, respectively. escherichia coli accounted for over 50% of the gram-negative bacilli. the proportion of fq-resistant or intermediate strains was over 20%, and four of these strains (1.1%) were suspected of producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl). all the esbl-producing strains (esbls) possess resistance to fqs. over 95% of klebsiella pneumoniae was susceptible to all agents. the distribution of antimicrobial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa indicated a decrease in the number of multidrug-resistant strains and  an increase in strains susceptible to all agents. some differences existed in the resistance to antibacterial agents among proteus species. no esbl-producing or multidrug-resistant strain was isolated from serratia marcescens. this survey suggests that serious clinical problems will result from the increasing number of enterococcal species with multidrug resistance in gram-positive cocci, and isolates of esbl-producing or fqs-resistant strains in gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == determining incidence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 38 centres from 17 countries: the  pearls study 2001-2002.
AB  == the pearls study prospectively monitored selected nosocomial pathogens from 38 centres in 13 european, three middle eastern countries and south africa during 2001-2002. extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production rates among escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter spp. were 5.4% (142/2609), 18.2% (401/2,206) and 8.8% (204/2,328), respectively, for all study sites. the overall esbl production rate for the combined enterobacteriaceae was 10.5% (747/7,143), highest in egypt, 38.5%, and greece, 27.4%, and lowest in the  netherlands, 2.0%, and germany, 2.6%. ief, pcr and dna sequencing determined 10.7% false positives among enterobacter spp. when using nccls guidelines to screen for esbl production. the prevalence of nosocomial methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium was 32.4% (294/908) and 8.7% (83/949), respectively. pearls provides baseline data against  which prospective changes in resistant determinants and outcomes can be measured  in this ongoing study.

TI  == evaluation of the hyplex bloodscreen multiplex pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  == we evaluated the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) system (bag, lich, germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification  of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive bactec 9240 blood culture bottles. the test involves amplification of the bacterial dna by multiplex pcr and subsequent hybridization  of the pcr product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an elisa-based format. the available probes allow the separate detection of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal meca  gene. the hyplex bloodscreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (s. aureus, 100%; s. epidermidis, 97.2%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). the specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (escherichia coli, 92.5%; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; klebsiella spp., 100%; enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; s. aureus, 100%, s. epidermidis, 97.7%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus  faecium, 99.6%; streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). the result of the meca gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of staphylococcus aureus investigated. in conclusion, the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-elisa system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the meca gene of staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.

TI  == increased susceptibility to vancomycin-resistant enterococcus intestinal colonization persists after completion of anti-anaerobic antibiotic treatment in  mice.
AB  == background: antibiotic-associated disruption of the indigenous intestinal microflora may persist beyond the treatment period. although piperacillin/tazobactam inhibits the establishment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) stool colonization in mice during treatment, we hypothesized that this agent and other anti-anaerobic antibiotics would increase susceptibility to colonization during the period of recovery of the intestinal microflora. design: mice received 10(4) colony-forming units of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium by orogastric inoculation 2, 5, or 10 days after  completing 5 days of subcutaneous antibiotic treatment, or both during and 2 days after the completion of treatment. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) was performed to assess changes in the intestinal microflora. results: anti-anaerobic antibiotics (ie, piperacillin/ tazobactam, cefoxitin, and clindamycin) caused significant disruption of the indigenous microflora (mean dgge similarity indices < or = 27% in comparison with saline controls) and promoted the establishment of high-density colonization when vre was inoculated 2 or 5, but not 10, days following treatment (p < .001). piperacillin/tazobactam exhibited a biphasic effect on the establishment of colonization (ie, inhibition  when exposed to vre during treatment and promotion when exposed to vre after discontinuation of treatment), resulting in greater overall promotion of colonization than did agents with minimal anti-anaerobic activity (ie, levofloxacin, cefepime, and aztreonam) when vre was inoculated both during and 2  days after treatment (p < .001). conclusion: patients receiving anti-anaerobic antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, may be susceptible to the establishment of high-density vre colonization during the period of recovery of the anaerobic microflora.

TI  == prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from blood cultures of hospitalized patients in the united states in 2002.
AB  == background: bloodstream infections are associated with significant patient morbidity and mortality. antimicrobial susceptibility patterns should guide the choice of empiric antimicrobial regimens for patients with bacteremia. methods: from january to december of 2002, 82,569 bacterial blood culture isolates were reported to the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa by 268 laboratories. susceptibility to relevant antibiotic compounds was analyzed using national committee for clinical laboratory standards guidelines. results: coagulase-negative staphylococci (42.0%), staphylococcus aureus (16.5%), enterococcus faecalis (8.3%), escherichia coli (7.2%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.6%), and enterococcus faecium (3.5%) were the most frequently isolated bacteria from blood cultures, collectively accounting for >80% of isolates. in vitro susceptibility to expanded-spectrum beta-lactams such as ceftriaxone were high for oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (98.7%), oxacillin-susceptible s. aureus (99.8%), e. coli (97.3%), k. pneumoniae (93.3%),  and streptococcus pneumoniae (97.2%). susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones were variable for k. pneumoniae (90.3-91.4%), e. coli (86.0-86.7%), oxacillin-susceptible s. aureus (84.0-89.4%), oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (72.7-82.7%), e. faecalis (52.1%), and e. faecium (11.3%). combinations of antimicrobials are often prescribed as empiric therapy for bacteremia. susceptibilities of all blood culture isolates to one or  both agents in combinations of ceftriaxone, ceftazdime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam or ciprofloxacin plus gentamicin were consistent (range,  74.8-76.3%) but lower than similar beta-lactam or ciprofloxacin combinations with vancomycin (range, 93.5-96.6%). conclusion: ongoing surveillance for antimicrobial susceptibility remains essential, and will enhance efforts to identify resistance and attempt to limit its spread.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogens of bacteraemia in the uk and ireland 2001-2002: the bsac bacteraemia resistance surveillance programme.
AB  == objectives: to describe the current patterns of antimicrobial resistance in the major pathogens of bacteraemia in the uk and ireland, to highlight any unexpected resistance patterns and to act as a reference baseline for future studies. methods: in 2001 and 2002, 5092 blood culture isolates were collected by 29 laboratories distributed across the uk and ireland. a single central laboratory re-identified the isolates and measured mics by the bsac agar dilution method. results: oxacillin resistance was found in 42% of staphylococcus aureus and 76% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. streptococci were generally susceptible to beta-lactams, but tetracycline resistance was common (except in streptococcus pneumoniae) and particularly common among group b isolates (82% resistant). nine  percent of s. pneumoniae had reduced susceptibility to penicillin (mics 0.12-1 mg/l), but none required >/=2 mg/l for inhibition. high-level gentamicin resistance was seen in 43% of enterococcus faecalis, often in combination with raised ciprofloxacin mics (>/=32 mg/l), but these isolates remained susceptible to ampicillin and imipenem. only linezolid and tigecycline showed in vitro potency against a large proportion of enterococcus faecium. vancomycin resistance was restricted to enterococci (20% of e. faecium, 3% of e. faecalis) and a single isolate of coagulase-negative staphylococci (0.2%, mic of 8 mg/l). escherichia coli isolates were commonly resistant to amoxicillin (56%) and tetracycline (88%) but remained susceptible to ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in 2% of e. coli (none in 2001, 3.2% in 2002), 5% of klebsiella spp. and 8% of enterobacter spp. resistance rates of pseudomonas aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were between 4% and 7%. among the newly licensed and developmental agents, there was no resistance to linezolid in gram-positive organisms. ertapenem had a wide spectrum, covering enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci. mics of tigecycline were low for gram-positive species and enterobacteriaceae except proteeae and enterobacter spp. conclusion: antimicrobial resistance among major bloodstream pathogens to those antimicrobials often selected for empirical therapy was relatively uncommon in 2001-2002, usually <10%. an important exception was oxacillin resistance in s. aureus.

TI  == antimicrobial activity in methanolic extracts of several plant species from northern argentina.
AB  == thirty-nine native plant species were collected from the provinces of chaco and formosa, in northern argentina, and were screened for antimicrobial activity. the plants were dried and extracted thoroughly with methanol. the dry extracts, dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, were tested for inhibition of microbial growth via microplate assay with an oxidation-reduction dye. the test organisms were: escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium. inhibition of respiratory activities in some of these microbial species was produced by the extracts of astronium balansae, geoffroea decorticans, peltophorum dubium, geoffroea spinosa, lantana balansae, prosopis kuntzei, prosopis ruscifolia and bulnesia sarmientoi, with minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) ranging from 0.08 to 0.5 mg dry matter/ml. further in vitro experiments measuring the growth of s. aureus in liquid culture confirmed that all of the above extracts at 2 x mic were able to inhibit bacterial growth effectively, and that some of them (a.  balansae, g. decorticans, p. dubium, g. spinosa, p. kuntzei and b. sarmientoi) were able to reduce the initial number of viable counts by at least one order of  magnitude in 10 hours, indicating that these extracts should be investigated further for the possible presence of bactericidal components.

TI  == comparative study of the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, abt-492.
AB  == objectives: the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, abt-492, was determined. methods: mics were compared with those of two beta-lactams, telithromycin, ciprofloxacin and four later generation fluoroquinolones. the effects of human serum and of inoculum concentration were also investigated. results: mic data indicate that abt-492 has potent activity against gram-positive organisms with enhanced anti-staphylococcal activity compared with earlier fluoroquinolones, in addition to activity against beta-haemolytic streptococci, pneumococci including penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococcus faecalis but not enterococcus  faecium. abt-492 was the most active agent tested against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis, fluoroquinolone-susceptible neisseria gonorrhoeae and anaerobes. good activity was observed for abt-492 amongst the enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes tested, but ciprofloxacin showed superior activity for species of proteus, morganella and providencia, as well as  for pseudomonas spp. in common with the other fluoroquinolones tested, organisms  with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin had raised mic(90)s to abt-492. the  one isolate of h. influenzae tested with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility had an abt-492 mic close to that of the population lacking a mechanism of quinolone resistance. abt-492 was more active than ciprofloxacin against chlamydia spp. an inoculum effect was observed with a number of isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, e. faecium, klebsiella spp. and  escherichia coli, in addition to moderately raised mics in the presence of 70% serum protein. the clinical significance of these findings is yet to be determined. conclusions: abt-492 is a new fluoroquinolone with excellent activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, with many potential clinical uses.

TI  == increasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa in korea: konsar study in 2001.
AB  == the 5th year konsar surveillance in 2001 was based on routine test data at 30 participating hospitals. it was of particular interest to find a trend in the resistances of enterococci to vancomycin, of enterobacteriaceae to the 3rd generation cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone, and of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacters to carbapenem. resistance rates of gram-positive cocci were: 70% of staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin; 88% and 16% of enterococcus faecium to ampicillin and vancomycin, respectively. seventy-two percent of pneumococci were  nonsusceptible to penicillin. the resistance rates of enterobacteriaceae were: escherichia coli, 28% to fluoroquinolone; klebsiella pneumoniae, 27% to ceftazidime, and 20% to cefoxitin; and enterobacter cloacae, > or =40% to cefotaxime and ceftazidime. the resistance rates of p. aeruginosa were 21% to ceftazidime, 17% to imipenem, and those of the acinetobacters were > or =61% to ceftazidime, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolone and cotrimoxazole. thirty-five percent of non-typhoidal salmonellae were ampicillin resistant, and 66% of haemophilus influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. notable changes over the 1997-2001 period were: increases in vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, and amikacin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant acinetobacters. with the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria, nationwide surveillance has become more important for optimal patient management, for the control of nosocomial infection, and for the conservation of the newer antimicrobial agents.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of novel 2-(thiazol-2-ylthio)-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the c-2 side chain. in agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) with a mic(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. furthermore, sm-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against mrsa, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the mic. sm-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of mrsa in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. the mics of sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and  penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. these drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against enterococcus faecium, and the mic(90) s for ampicillin-resistant e. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. however, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity  of sm-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an e. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in cfu at four times the mic after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. in addition, sm-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the e. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the mics (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), moraxella catarrhalis, and bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus spp. thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including mrsa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

TI  == persistent silver disinfectant for the environmental control of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: contaminated surfaces can act as a reservoir for pathogenic microorganisms and potentially exacerbate the risk of infection. surface disinfection and decontamination provide temporary amelioration against bacterial colonization. disinfected surfaces eventually become contaminated, thus, mitigating the benefit of the initial disinfection. it is hypothesized that to improve on the current state of the art, a disinfectant should not only immediately disinfect a surface but also provide persistent antimicrobial action  after the product has been applied. we describe here a silver-based disinfectant  technology designed to provide long-lasting sanitization and disinfection to treated surfaces as evaluated on hard surfaces after repeated environmental insults. methods: a comparative evaluation of 6 disinfectant formulations for residual antimicrobial activity after water rinsing was performed. log reduction  of bacterial populations on disinfectant-treated substrates were measured after 30 minutes to 8 hours of exposure and compared with an untreated control. in a similar study, the residual antimicrobial activity of a silver disinfectant was evaluated against antibiotic- and biocide-resistant bacteria also after water rinsing. further, residual antimicrobial activity of the silver disinfectant was  measured after 5 cycles of rinsing, abrasion, and contamination against representative household and nosocomial pathogens (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecium, or salmonella choleraesuis) after 10-minute exposure times. results: in the comparative assay, only the silver disinfectant and a persistent  quaternary ammonium compound disinfectant demonstrated significant residual activity (> or =3.0 log(10) reduction to control) against s aureus whereas only the silver disinfectant demonstrated activity against pseudomonas. no residual activity (< or = 0.5 log reduction to untreated control) was observed for the other disinfectant products. the silver-based disinfectant also showed significant and equivalent efficacy against antibiotic- and silver-resistant bacteria. in addition, the silver disinfectant was able to achieve significant residual activity in 10 minutes against all organisms tested after 1, 3, and 5 cycles of water rinse, abrasion, and microbial contamination. conclusions: the findings show the ability of a new silver-based disinfectant to reduce bacterial  populations that contact treated surfaces within minutes, highlight the potential to interrupt cross-contamination from environmental surfaces, and reduce the risk of infection within the home and health care settings.

TI  == emerging bacterial pathogens: a consensus of the scientific data and the risk for development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
AB  == antibiotic resistance in the hospital setting is continuing to increase, particularly in intensive care units (icus) and other areas of the hospital such  as oncology units, where the use of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics is common. the problem of antibiotic resistance is also compounded in the immunocompromised  patient. multi-drug resistance is common among both gram-positive and -negative bacteria, and becoming more prevalent among fungi (yeast). two major antibiotic-resistant pathogens include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl-kp) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). when  infections occur with esbl-kp, a carbapenem antibiotic is usually the drug of choice. when infection occurs with vre, specific therapy is bacteriostatic, and the clinician may have to rely on empirically selected antibiotics or combinations of antibiotics to achieve a positive outcome. two newly-approved agents, linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin can be used to treat infections caused by resistant gram-positive cocci, but the latter is approved for use against vr-e. faecium. risk factors for the development of esbl-kp include the use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins such as ceftazidime. risk factors for the development of vre include inappropriate use of vancomycin, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and antianaerobic drug therapy such as clindamycin. several institutions have documented a reduction in one or both of these resistant pathogens following a decrease in the use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins combined with the increased use of extended-spectrum penicillins/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, such as piperacillin/tazobactam, for the empiric therapy  of infections. for vre, a reduction in the inappropriate use of vancomycin is also an important interventional strategy along with improved infection control practice.

TI  == evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the newly developed rapid lumi eiken/is60 (rl/is60) system automatically determines mics by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. the present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility  testing. chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with mics determined by the reference microdilution method. when the mics of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (qc) strains (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the rl/is60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the qc limits  proposed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the system  was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including e. coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, p. aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae. overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the rl/is60 system and the reference microdilution method. our  results suggest that the rl/is60 system provides rapid and reliable mics of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as qc strains.

TI  == strategies to control antibiotic resistance.
AB  == antibiotic resistance is becoming a worldwide concern. antibiotic resistance may  be caused by sporadic mutations, which are not important unless spread clonally.  clonal resistance may disseminate a highly resistant clone to widespread geographic areas. the most effective interventions to limit the clonal spread of  resistant organisms are effective infection control measures. hospital antibiotic formulary restriction is the only control measure with proven effectiveness to control resistance related to antibiotic use. hospital formularies should eliminate or restrict antibiotics with a high-resistance potential (eg, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, and imipenem), and should be replaced with equivalent antibiotics with a low-resistance potential (eg, cefe-pime, levofloxacin, and meropenem). such low-resistance-potential antibiotics can either prevent or eliminate resistance problems associated with klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter species, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. high-resistance-potential antibiotics, particularly ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime, also may indirectly increase the prevalence of highly resistant organisms (eg, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus [mrsa], vancomycin-resistant enterococci [vre]). vancomycin use should be restricted, not because it increases enterococcal resistance per se, but because it selects out naturally resistant enterococcal strains (eg, enterococcus faecium that are vancomycin resistant). linezolid does not increase  the prevalence of vre. clinicians in the outpatient setting should also preferentially use oral antibiotics with a low-resistance potential (eg, clindamycin, metronidazole, doxycycline, minocycline, fluoroquinolones except ciprofloxacin, linezolid, and oral cephalosporins) in preference to their high-resistance-potential counterparts. for antibiotic resistance control interventions to be effective, they must be applied simultaneously to all antibiotics with activity against the specific resistance pathogen at the hospital formulary level. multiple antibiotic substitutions are usually necessary to eradicate resistance problems caused by a particular pathogen. multiple drugs  of the same spectrum and low-resistance potential are necessary to eliminate resistance problems; single antibiotic substitutions are not effective.

AB  == a susceptibility surveillance study of 1,274 bacterial isolates recovered from various clinical specimens from patients in intensive care units (icus) of five major teaching hospitals was carried out from march, 2000, to june, 2000, in taiwan. this study demonstrated a high rate (66%) of oxacillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus (orsa), a high rate of nonsusceptibility to penicillin (intermediate, 50% and highly resistant, 8%), and high rates of cefotaxime nonsusceptibility for s. pneumoniae (intermediate, 29% and resistant, 4%), enterobacter cloacae (57%), serratia marcescens (34%), and citrobacter freundii (60%). high rate of ceftazidime nonsusceptibility for pseudomonas aeruginosa (22%), and high rates of imipenem nonsusceptibility for p. aeruginosa (15%) and acinetobacter baumannii (22%) were also found. the percentage (11.9%) of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli was greater than that (11.3%) for klebsiella pneumoniae. rates of quinupristin-dalfopristin nonsusceptibility for s. pneumoniae (42%), enterococcus faecium (71%), and orsa (39%) were high, but no vancomycin-resistant enterococci were found in this study. the resistance rates of some pathogen varied by institution or type of icus. surveillance for antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens in hospitals, particularly in icu settings with a preexisting higher resistance burden, is mandatory in establishing and/or modifying guidelines for empirical treatment of severe infections in icu patients caused by these antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.

TI  == ability of laboratories to detect emerging antimicrobial resistance: proficiency  testing and quality control results from the world health organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility data submitted by microbiology laboratories to national and international surveillance systems has been debated  for a number of years. to assess the accuracy of data submitted to the world health organization by users of the whonet software, the centers for disease control and prevention distributed six bacterial isolates representing key antimicrobial-resistance phenotypes to approximately 130 laboratories, all but one of which were outside of the united states, for antimicrobial susceptibility  testing as part of the world health organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. each laboratory also was asked to submit 10 consecutive quality control values for several key organism-drug combinations. most laboratories were able to detect methicillin (oxacillin) resistance in staphylococcus aureus, high-level vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium, and resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in klebsiella pneumoniae. many laboratories, particularly those using disk diffusion tests, had difficulty in recognizing reduced susceptibility to penicillin in an isolate of streptococcus pneumoniae. the most difficult phenotype for laboratories to detect was reduced susceptibility to vancomycin in an isolate of  staphylococcus epidermidis. the proficiency testing challenge also included a request for biochemical identification of a gram-negative bacillus, which most laboratories recognized as enterobacter cloacae. although only a small subset of  laboratories have submitted their quality control data, it is clear that many of  these laboratories generate disk diffusion results for oxacillin when testing s.  aureus atcc 25923 and s. pneumoniae atcc 49619 that are outside of the acceptable quality control range. the narrow quality control range for vancomycin also proved to be a challenge for many of the laboratories submitting data; approximately 27% of results were out of range. thus, it is important to establish the proficiency of laboratories submitting data to surveillance systems in which the organisms are tested locally, particularly for penicillin resistance in pneumococci and glycopeptide resistance in staphylococci.

TI  == [sensitivity to antibiotics of bacteria from nosocomial infections. evolution in  resuscitation services of military hospitals].
AB  == objective: the aim of this study, conducted in the french military hospitals, was to monitor the course of the antimicrobial sensibility of bacteria isolated from  nosocomial infection in intensive care units. patients and methods: a prospective study has been conducted from january to december 1998 in all the intensive care  units of the french army. all the non-repetitive strains isolated from nosocomial infection were collected and sent to a reference centre. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the agar dilution method. beta-lactamase were identified by iso-electro-focalisation. antibiotics choice and interpretative criteria were those of the "comite francais de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie". results: a total of 849 strains are included in this study. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated bacterium (20%) followed by escherichia coli (19%) staphylococcus aureus (15%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (11%) and enterococci (7%). imipenem was  the most effective antibiotic against enterobacteriaceae (336 isolates; 100% susceptibility). gentamicin (92%), amikacin (92%) third generation cephalosporins (83%), aztreonam (83%) and ciprofloxacin (78%) were also very effective. resistance to iii generation cephalosporins was correlated with an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (blse) in 36% of cases. this blse could be associated with an over production of the constitutive cephalosporinase. the most frequent species producing blse were enterobacter aerogenes (75% of blse) and klebsiella pneumoniae (17%). among the 172 p. aeruginosa isolated, antimicrobial susceptibility were respectively: 71% for imipenem, 62%: tobramycin, 60%: amikacin 59%: ciprofloxacin 59% piperacillin + tazobactam, 55% piperacillin, 53%: ceftazidime and 44% for ticarcillin. seventy per cent of the 96 cons and 50.2% of the 126 s. aureus isolated were resistant to methicillin. a strain of s. aureus and 2 cons strains had intermediate resistance to teicoplanin. twenty per cent of the 59 enterococci strains isolated were resistant to aminopenicillins (10/11 strains of e. faecium), and 9% presented a high level of resistance to gentamicine. one strain of e. faecium was resistant to vancomycin. conclusion: the evolution of the susceptibility to antibiotics in intensive care units reflects the antibiotic pressure and level of cross-transmission. high rates of meticillin-resistance among staphylococci, of resistance to beta-lactams antibiotics among p. aeruginosa and of ciprofloxacin among enterobacteriaceae are shown in this study. the implementation of appropriate strategies for surveillance and prevention is necessary.

AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == bacteriology of infected cavitating lung tumor.
AB  == differentiation between in situ infection and simple tumor necrosis in cavitating lung tumors by means of imaging studies is difficult. in this study, we prospectively investigated the role of ultrasound (us)-guided transthoracic aspiration for bacteriologic examination of infected cavitating lung tumors, and  the influence of the culture results on the treatment of patients. twenty-two patients (18 men and four women) with cavitating lung tumors treated from january 1996 to october 1998 were included. all patients underwent us-guided transthoracic aspiration for bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures. microorganisms were isolated from six of seven febrile patients and one of 15 nonfebrile patients. a total of nine pathogens were isolated from seven patients: klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3); haemophilus influenzae (n = 2); enterococcus faecium (n = 1); bifidobacterium (n = 1); shewanella putrefaciens (n = 1); and mycobacterium tuberculosis (n = 1). two pathogens were isolated from the aspirate cultures in two patients, while the others had monomicrobial infection. the six febrile patients who had positive lung aspirate cultures were treated with empiric antimicrobial agents before the culture results were available, and the culture results led to adjustment of the antibiotic regimen in five of these. the clinical conditions of the six patients with infected cavitating lung tumors improved after the initiation of individualized antimicrobial treatment. pneumothorax occurred in one patient, and was the sole procedure-related complication. in conclusion, us-guided transthoracic aspiration is helpful for differentiating infected cavitating lung tumors from simple tumor necrosis. infection in cavitating lung tumors is common among febrile patients, and the culture results can guide modification of the antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility and frequency of occurrence of clinical blood isolates in europe from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, 1997 and 1998.
AB  == as part of the european arm of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, 25  european university hospitals referred 9613 blood isolates for in vitro testing against >20 antimicrobial agents. escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were the 5 most frequent isolates and accounted for two-thirds of all  referrals, with minor regional variation. of these, approximately 0.36% of e. coli and 16.7% of k. pneumoniae isolates proved to be potential extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers, and their incidence clearly varied regionally. quinolone resistance was detected among gram-negative species; in particular, p.  aeruginosa and acinetobacter species. considerable regional variation was observed in the incidences of methicillin resistance in s. aureus and penicillin  resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae. the incidence of vancomycin resistance in enterococci was relatively low overall and primarily associated with enterococcus faecium. however, extrapolation of these data to smaller and nonteaching hospitals should be undertaken with caution, since resistance rates may be lower  in these facilities.

TI  == surveillance of antibiotic resistance in taiwan, 1998.
AB  == for the first national surveillance of antibiotic resistance in taiwan, we collected in 1998 from 22 hospitals (6 medical centers, 15 regional hospitals, and 1 local hospital) 3,211 isolates in all parts of the country. besides 50 random successive isolates from inpatients, each hospital was requested to collect 25 isolates each from positive blood cultures, hospital-acquired infections, outpatients and the pediatric department. we re-speciated all the submitted specimens and determined their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. the  most common isolates were enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae), staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. among hospital-acquired infections, acinetobacter spp. were among those which accounted for over 10% of the isolates. the oxacillin resistance of s. aureus was 82% in isolates from hospital-acquired infections, and 40% from outpatients. among enterococcus spp., 85% were either e. faecalis or e. faecium. they were 14% resistant to vancomycin. among gram-negative bacteria, k. pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumanii were hospital-acquired isolates that were most clearly more resistant than community acquired isolates. this difference was less apparent in the case of enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and p. aeruginosa. these bacteria were generally more resistant from all sources. fifty-one percent of salmonella were resistant to ampicillin; however, these were all sensitive to ciprofloxacin. isolates from the east were least resistant. plotting the disc zone diameters of antibiotics within the susceptible range, we  identified subpopulations with smaller diameters in the case of vancomycin against s. aureus, ciprofloxacin against e. coli, and ciprofloxacin against salmonella spp. these findings represent one of the purposes of this surveillance as they may portend developing resistances which bear careful watching in the future.

TI  == activities of a nitrofurazone-containing urinary catheter and a silver hydrogel catheter against multidrug-resistant bacteria characteristic of catheter-associated urinary tract infection.
AB  == the in vitro inhibitory activity of a nitrofurazone-coated urinary catheter (nfc) against 86 recently obtained susceptible and multidrug-resistant (mdr) clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and enterococcus faecium, which are species implicated in catheter-associated urinary tract infection and which traditionally have been susceptible to nitrofuran derivatives, was determined using an agar diffusion assay. in a subset of these strains, the activity of the nfc was compared with that of a silver hydrogel urinary catheter (shc), and the durability of each catheter's inhibitory activity was assessed during serial daily transfers of catheter segments to fresh culture  plates. except for vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, the nfc was active against all isolates tested and showed comparable inhibition zones with susceptible and mdr strains of each species. in contrast, the shc inhibited only certain staphylococci (p < 0.01 versus the nfc), and among these strains, the shc produced smaller inhibition zones than did the nfc (p < 0.01). inhibition was evident for up to 5 days with the nfc, but for only 1 day (if at all) with the shc (p < 0.01). these data document that, for most genera which traditionally have been susceptible to nitrofuran derivatives, the nfc remains active against contemporary mdr isolates. they also demonstrate that the in vitro antibacterial  activity of the nfc is markedly superior to that of the shc in several respects.  thus, the nfc shows promise for clinical use in the current era of mdr bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in key bloodstream bacterial isolates: electronic surveillance with the surveillance network database--usa.
AB  == to assess the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens among the most common bloodstream isolates, we examined antimicrobial susceptibility data from the surveillance network database-usa, an electronic surveillance system that collects data from 118 clinical microbiology laboratories across the united states. between 1995 and 1997, resistance to both vancomycin and ampicillin was much more prevalent among enterococcus faecium than enterococcus faecalis, suggesting the need for laboratories to identify to species. when staphylococcal  isolates were examined for reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (minimum inhibitory concentration = 4 microg/ml), the frequency was highest in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci. we also learned that nonsusceptibility to ceftazidime in klebsiella pneumoniae was more prevalent among isolates from blood (12.7%) than among isolates from urine (7.1%) or respiratory sources (9.3%). although antimicrobial resistance is low overall for  isolates of escherichia coli from blood, the prevalence of cefoxitin resistance among ceftazidime-resistant strains (61.9%) suggests the action of mechanisms other than extended-spectrum beta-lactamase.

TI  == the effect of ph on the inhibition of bacterial growth by physiological concentrations of butyric acid: implications for neonates fed on suckled milk.
AB  == butyric acid is released from milk by pre-intestinal lipases during suckling. it  is also known to inhibit bacterial growth. to investigate whether butyric acid may be a significant factor in controlling bacterial growth in the stomach of pre-weaned animals, the ability of butyric acid to inhibit growth of selected bacteria was tested over physiological ranges of ph and butyric acid concentrations. six enteric and environmental strains of bacteria were used: two  strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus casseliflavus. at ph 4.5 and 5.0, the growth of all organisms was significantly inhibited in the presence of butyrate,  and in some cases growth was completely arrested. at ph 6.0, butyric acid did not affect bacterial growth until the concentration reached 40 mm. the maximum concentration of butyric acid available in cow's milk after incubation with pre-gastric lipase is approximately 16 mm, which would be sufficient to prevent growth of the organisms tested at ph values occurring in the stomach. therefore,  butyric acid inhibition of bacterial growth may explain in part, the role of pre-intestinal lipases in young animals' natural defenses against bacteria in ingested food prior to weaning.

TI  == study of the comparative activity of piperacillin/tazobactam with currently available antibiotics against 8206 aerobic isolates.
AB  == objectives: to compare the activity of piperacillin-tazobactam with piperacillin  and other parenterally administered antibiotics against aerobic gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci isolated from across canada, and to determine the prevalence of resistance mediated by extended-spectrum cephalosporinases. methods: sixty-one laboratories participated. disk diffusion testing was performed in accordance with methods outlined by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. susceptibilities were performed on 8206 strains. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae with reduced susceptibilities to third-generation cephalosporins were screened for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). results: piperacillin-tazobactam was active against 92%  of the strains, piperacillin against 81% and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid against  88%. few differences were observed in the relative susceptibility of strains from teaching or community hospitals, from different anatomic sites or from different  regions of the country. aerobic gram-negative bacilli tested tended to be more susceptible to all the agents than was recently reported in a similar american study. only 43% of enterococcus faecium were susceptible to ampicillin and 42% to piperacillin piperacillin with and without tazobactam. only two enterococcal strains were resistant to vancomycin, and 19 had intermediate zone sizes. of the  10 strains of e coli and eight strains of k pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to extended spectrum cephalosporins, only one demonstrated typical esbl activity. conclusions: canadian aerobic gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli remain highly susceptible to many currently available antibiotics. the findings confirm a broad spectrum of activity of piperacillin-tazobactam and indicate that the pattern of susceptibility is quite  uniform from different body sites, in both teaching and community hospitals, and  across the country.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheter.
AB  == the main objective of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel indwelling bladder catheter impregnated with minocycline and rifampin. thirty antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheters were inserted transurethrally in spinal cord-injured patients and removed, in six groups of five catheters each, at 3, 7, 10, 14, 17 or 21 days. removed catheters had detectable zones of inhibition against two different clinical isolates of each of the 10 tested uropathogens (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus saprophyticus and candida albicans) for greater than 14 days after catheter insertion. the residual zones of inhibition and levels of antimicrobial agents in removed catheters were  both inversely related to the duration of catheter placement. minocycline and rifampin were undetectable in serum and urine. these results support the ongoing  efforts for examining the clinical efficacy of these experimental bladder catheters.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
