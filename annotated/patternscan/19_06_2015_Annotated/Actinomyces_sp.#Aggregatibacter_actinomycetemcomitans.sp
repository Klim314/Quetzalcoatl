TI  == periodontal bacteria and prediabetes prevalence in origins: the oral infections,  glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance study.
AB  == periodontitis and type 2 diabetes mellitus are known to be associated. the relationship between periodontal microbiota and early diabetes risk has not been  studied. we investigated the association between periodontal bacteria and prediabetes prevalence among diabetes-free adults. origins (the oral infections,  glucose intolerance and insulin resistance study) cross sectionally enrolled 300  diabetes-free adults aged 20 to 55 y (mean +/- sd, 34 +/- 10 y; 77% female). prediabetes was defined as follows: 1) hemoglobin a1c values ranging from 5.7% to 6.4% or 2) fasting plasma glucose ranging from 100 to 125 mg/dl. in 1,188 subgingival plaque samples, 11 bacterial species were assessed at baseline, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and actinomyces naeslundii. full-mouth clinical periodontal examinations were performed, and participants were defined as having no/mild periodontitis vs. moderate/severe periodontitis per the definition of the centers for disease control and prevention / american academy of periodontology. modified poisson regression evaluated prediabetes prevalence across bacterial tertiles. prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals for third vs. first tertiles are presented. all analyses were adjusted for cardiometabolic risk factors. all results presented currently arise from the baseline cross section. prediabetes prevalence was 18%, and 58% of participants had moderate/severe periodontitis. prevalence ratios (95% confidence intervals) summarizing associations between bacterial levels and prediabetes were as follows: a. actinomycetemcomitans, 2.48 (1.34, 4.58), p = 0.004; p. gingivalis, 3.41 (1.78, 6.58), p = 0.0003; t. denticola, 1.99 (0.992, 4.00), p = 0.052; t. forsythia, 1.95 (1.0, 3.84), p = 0.05; a. naeslundii, 0.46 (0.25, 0.85), p = 0.01. the prevalence ratio for prediabetes among participants with moderate/severe vs. no/mild periodontitis was 1.47 (0.78, 2.74), p = 0.23. higher colonization levels of specific periodontal microbiota are associated with higher prediabetes prevalence among diabetes-free adults.

TI  == influence of complement on neutrophil extracellular trap release induced by bacteria.
AB  == background and objectives: neutrophil extracellular trap (net) release has generally been studied in the absence of serum, or at low concentrations of untreated or heat-inactivated serum. the influence of serum complement on net release therefore remains unclear. we examined the dna release induced by staphylococcus aureus and three oral bacteria: actinomyces viscosus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincettii. material and methods: bacteria-stimulated net release from the neutrophils of healthy donors was measured fluorometrically. various complement containing and complement blocking conditions were used, including heat inactivation of the serum and antibody blockade of complement receptors 1 (cr1, cd35) and 3 (cr3, cd11b/cd18). results: while the presence of serum markedly enhanced net release induced by s. aureus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and to a lesser extent by a. viscosus, there was no enhancement of net release induced by  f. nucleatum. the serum-mediated enhancement of net release by a. actinomycetemcomitans was neutralized by heat inactivation of serum complement, while this was not the case for s. aureus. blockade of cr1, significantly reduced net release induced by s. aureus, a. actinomycetemcomitans and a. viscosus, while blockade of cr3, had no effect. however, opsonization of s. aureus with antibodies may also have contributed to the enhancing effect of serum, independently of complement, in that purified igg promoted net release. conclusions: in conclusion, complement opsonization promotes net release induced  by a variety of bacteria, including a. actinomycetemcomitans, and cr1 plays a dominant role in the process. complement consumption or deficiency may compromise netosis induced by some bacterial species, including a. actinomycetemcomitans. within biofilms, the complement-inactivating abilities of some bacteria may protect other species against netosis, while these are more vulnerable when adopting a planktonic lifestyle.

TI  == periodontal therapy effects on nitrite related to oral bacteria: a 6-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  == background: nitrite is a biological factor relevant to oral and systemic homeostasis. through an oral bacteria reduction process it was suggested that periodontal therapy and chlorhexidine rinse could impact nitrite levels leading to negative effects such as increase in blood pressure. this 6-month randomized clinical trial evaluated the effects of periodontal therapeutic protocols on salivary nitrite and its relation to subgingival bacteria. methods: 90 periodontitis patients were randomly allocated to debridement procedures in 4 weekly sections (quadrant scaling-qs) or within 24 hours (full-mouth scaling-fms) in conjunction with a 60-day chlorhexidine (chx) (qs+chx and fms+chx), placebo (qs+placebo and fms+placebo), or no mouth rinse (qs+none and fms+none) use. real-time pcr determined total bacterial, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, streptococcus oralis, and actinomyces naeslundi levels. salivary nitrite concentration was determined with griess reagent. data were statistically analyzed at baseline, 3, and 6 months by anova (analysis of variance), kruskal-wallis, mann-whitney, and spearman correlation tests (p<0.05). results: nitrite concentrations did not tend to change over time. regarding chx use, there was a negative correlation between nitrite and total bacterial load at 6 months (fms+chx) and one positive correlation between p.gingivalis and nitrite at baseline (qs+chx). independently of rinse type, in the fms group nitrite negatively correlated with several microbial parameters and also with a higher percentage of deep periodontal pockets. conclusions: the relation between nitrite and bacterial levels appear weak. short-term scaling exhibited a greater influence on nitrite concentrations then the long-term chx use.

TI  == intracranial bacterial infections of oral origin.
AB  == brain abscesses are rare but potentially deadly complications of odontogenic infections. this phenomenon has been described mainly in the form of case reports, as large-scale studies are difficult to perform. we compiled a total of  60 previously published cases of such a complication to investigate the predisposing factors, microbiology, and clinical outcomes of intracranial abscesses of odontogenic origin. a systematic review of the literature using the  pubmed database was performed. men accounted for 82.1% of cases, and the mean age was 42.1 years. caries with periapical involvement and periodontitis were the two most common intra-oral sources, and wisdom tooth extraction was the most common preceding dental procedure. in 56.4% of cases, there were obvious signs of dental disease prior to development of intracranial infection. commonly implicated microorganisms included streptococcus viridans (especially the anginosus group),  actinomyces, peptostreptococcus, prevotella, fusobacterium, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and eikenella corrodens. there was an 8.3% mortality rate.  intracranial abscesses can form anywhere within the brain, and appear unrelated to the side of dental involvement. this suggests that hematogenous spread is the  most likely route of dissemination.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of synthetic antimicrobial decapeptide against oral bacteria].
AB  == objective: this study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide, a novel antimicrobial peptide, against several major cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria in vitro. methods in this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide against streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and saccharomyces albicans in vitro using the agar diffusion method and broth dilution method. furthermore, a time-kill kinetic study of decapeptide against s. mutans was performed. results: the results showed that decapeptide exhibited antimicrobial activity against various  oral bacteria and fungi. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of main cariogenic bacteria ranged from 62.5 mug . ml(-1) to 125 mug . ml(-1), and the mic of periodontopathogenic bacteria tested ranged from 250 mug . ml(-1) to 1,000 mug . ml(-1). among the bacteria tested, decapeptide had a strong inhibitory effect on cariogenic s. mutans. results of the time-kill kinetic studies showed that decapeptide reduced the viable counts of s. mutans by more than one order of magnitude after 20 min of incubation, and thoroughly killed s. mutans after 30 min. no viable cells could be detected after 24 h of incubation. conclusion: this study suggest that decapeptide might have potential clinical application in treating dental caries by killing s. mutans within dental plaque.

TI  == the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity of one-year-old infants delivered pre-term with very low birthweights: a case control study.
AB  == background: recently, the dental literature has focused mainly on the microbial colonization of healthy full-term infants and their mothers or caretakers. however, oral microbial acquisition by premature infants has not been adequately  investigated, and the correlation between pre-term birth and the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens has not been determined. the aim of this study was to identify the presence and quantities of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of 12-month-old infants and compare the occurrence of these microbes between a cohort of pre-term infants with very low birthweights and a control cohort comprising full-term infants. methods: the research cohort was composed of 69 one-year-old infants, of whom 24  were born prematurely with very low birthweights and 45 of whom were carried to full term. information regarding the infants' gestational age, mode of delivery,  general health status, birthweight and antibiotic use were obtained from hospital records and through oral interviews. at 12 months of age, both groups of infants  were examined, and unstimulated saliva samples from the dorsum of the tongue and  dental plaque samples were collected. the microorganisms (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., actinomyces spp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum) were identified and their quantities were evaluated using a pcr-based method. the chi-squared and fisher's factorial tests were used for the statistical evaluations. results: the infants had a high prevalence of cariogenic microbes and of fusosbacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. cariogenic microbes were detected in 91.7% of the very low birthweight infants and in all full-term infants. periodontal pathogens were present in 83% of the pre-term infants and in 96% of the full-term infants. a significant difference was found between the cohorts in terms of the presence of s. mutans. most of the  very low birthweight infants had negative values of this microbe, while the full-term infants had positive values. conclusions: this study confirms the early transmission of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens to the oral cavity of one-year-old infants and a higher prevalence of s. mutans in full-term  infants than in premature infants.

TI  == evaluation of a new oral health scale of infectious potential based on the salivary microbiota.
AB  == objectives: the objective of this study is to analyse the correlation of our own  design of oral health scale (grades 0 and 1-better oral health vs. grades 2 and 3-poorer oral health) with the salivary microbiota. patients and methods: the oral health scale we elaborated was evaluated in 100 adults (25 patients from each global oral health grade). saliva samples collected from these patients were analysed using microbiological culture techniques, determining the presence/absence and the concentrations of some odontopathogens and periodontopathogens. results: in comparison with the global oral health grades 0-1, the grades 2-3 presented significantly higher values for the presence of odontopathogens (78 vs. 38 %; streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp. and actinomyces spp.) and periodontopathogens (100 vs. 90 %; aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter spp., fusobacterium spp. and prevotella gingivalis). in comparison with the grades 0-1, the grades 2-3 presented significantly higher values for the concentrations (cfu/ml log10) of facultative  anaerobes, strict anaerobes, odontopathogens (s. mutans, lactobacillus spp. and actinomyces spp.) and periodontopathogens (a. actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp., campylobacter spp. and fusobacterium spp.). conclusion: our  new global oral health scale shows a positive correlation with the detection and  quantification of certain odontopathogens and periodontopathogens present in the  saliva, confirming their possible infectious potential. clinical relevance: our own design of oral health scale could be particularly useful for the epidemiological study of different populations, the evaluation of the influence of oral health on the development of certain systemic diseases as well as the analysis of inter- and intra-individual variability of the oral microbiota in relation to the different grades of the oral health scale.

TI  == an in vitro biofilm model associated to dental implants: structural and quantitative analysis of in vitro biofilm formation on different dental implant surfaces.
AB  == objectives: the impact of implant surfaces in dental biofilm development is presently unknown. the aim of this investigation was to assess in vitro the development of a complex biofilm model on titanium and zirconium implant surfaces, and to compare it with the same biofilm formed on hydroxyapatite surface. methods: six standard reference strains were used to develop an in vitro biofilm over sterile titanium, zirconium and hydroxyapatite discs, coated with saliva within the wells of pre-sterilized polystyrene tissue culture plates. the  selected species used represent initial (streptococcus oralis and actinomyces naeslundii), early (veillonella parvula), secondary (fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). the developed biofilms (growth time 1 to 120h) were studied with confocal laser scanning microscopy using a vital fluorescence technique and with low-temperature scanning electron microscopy. the number (colony forming units/biofilm) and kinetics of the bacteria within the biofilm were studied with quantitative pcr (qpcr). as outcome variables, the biofilm thickness, the percentage of cell vitality and the number of bacteria were compared using the analysis of variance. results: the bacteria adhered and matured within the biofilm over the three surfaces with similar dynamics. different surfaces, however, demonstrated differences both in the thickness, deposition of the extracellular polysaccharide matrix as well as in the organization of the bacterial cells. significance: while the formation and dynamics of an in vitro biofilm model was similar irrespective of the surface of  inoculation (hydroxyapatite, titanium or zirconium), there were significant differences in regards to the biofilm thickness and three-dimensional structure.

TI  == aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans infection mimicking lung cancer: a case report.
AB  == pulmonary infections can mimic a pulmonary neoplasm. multiple organisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, can present with similar clinical, radiographic, and surgical findings as neoplastic processes. because treatment and the prognosis are completely different, an accurate diagnosis is crucial, and lung biopsy is usually required. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is part of the normal oral flora and is a rare cause of invasive infection due to hematogenous dissemination or aspiration, particularly infective endocarditis. we present a case of a. actinomycetemcomitans and actinomyces co-infection that presented as a mediastinal mass, with surgical findings similar to lung malignancy but with biopsy and culture showing an infectious origin. after antibiotic treatment, follow-up images showed resolution of the mass.

TI  == improving photodynamic inactivation of bacteria in dentistry: highly effective and fast killing of oral key pathogens with novel tooth-colored type-ii photosensitizers.
AB  == increasing antibiotic resistances in microorganisms create serious problems in public health. this demands alternative approaches for killing pathogens to supplement standard treatment methods. photodynamic inactivation of bacteria (pib) uses light activated photosensitizers (ps) to generate reactive oxygen species immediately upon illumination, inducing lethal phototoxicity. positively  charged phenalen-1-one derivatives are a new generation of ps for light-mediated  killing of pathogens with outstanding singlet oxygen quantum yield phidelta of >97%. upon irradiation with a standard photopolymerizer light (bluephase c8, 1260 +/- 50 mw/cm(2)) the ps showed high activity against the oral key pathogens enterococcus faecalis, actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. at a concentration of 10 mum, a maximum efficacy of more than 6 log10 steps (>/= 99.9999%) of bacteria killing is reached in less than 1 min (light dose 50 j/cm(2)) after one single treatment. the pyridinium substituent as positively charged moiety is especially advantageous for antimicrobial action.

TI  == antibacterial action of chlorhexidine/thymol containing varnishes in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == objectives: the antibacterial activity of two different formulations of a chlorhexidine/thymol varnish should be elucidated in vitro and in vivo. methods:  the agar diffusion assay with cervitec((r)) and cervitecplus((r)) and three reference strains each of streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and periodontal pathogens was performed. in a split-mouth study, 40 volunteers applied the test (cervitecplus((r)), solvent water and ethanol) and control (cervitec((r)), solvent ethyl acetate) varnish at buccal recessions of premolar teeth at baseline as well as after two, four and seven days. supra- and subgingival plaques were collected 2 weeks before baseline and at the screening appointments. supragingival plaque was analysed for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and subgingival samples for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas intermedia. friedman/wilcoxon tests and u-test were used for statistical analysis (p < 0.05). results: most reference strains were susceptible with inhibition zones (mm) as follows: cervitec((r))/cervitecplus((r)) streptococci 27 +/- 1.7/21.3 +/- 2.5, lactobacilli 26 +/- 9.2/23.7 +/- 4.9, actinomyces 36.3 +/- 6.6/27.3 +/- 1.5, periodontal pathogens 18.7 +/- 7.6/18 +/- 1.7. both varnishes reduced significantly the counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the patients. however, no significant differences were found between test and control sides at  any time. the total counts of periodontal pathogens were low. a tendency to higher counts of a. actinomycetemcomitans at the control side could be shown; the test side did not harbour significantly higher counts. conclusion: both varnishes may influence the plaque formation and reduce mutans streptococci in supragingival plaque.

TI  == the effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  == objectives: orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. the aim of this  study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. materials and methods: twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into  the study. each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. all patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor  bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. results: plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. the greatest differences in plaque composition were seen  with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and eubacterium nodatum, while campylobacter rectus, parvimonas micra, and actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. conclusions: the results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.

TI  == dental caries and microbiota in children with black stain and non-discoloured dental plaque.
AB  == aim: we aimed to assess caries experience and microbiota in systemically healthy  children with black stain (bs) and non-discoloured plaque. methods: forty-six children with bs and 47 counterparts with non-discoloured plaque aged 7.9 +/- 1.3 years were clinically examined. dental caries was scored using who criteria. samples of bs and non-discoloured dental plaque were collected from tooth surfaces. the dna of the samples was extracted and real-time pcr was performed to determine the total number of bacteria and the species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus sp., actinomyces naeslundii, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. results: children with bs had lower dmft (p = 0.013), lower dt values (p = 0.005) and a tendency to lower caries prevalence (p = 0.061) than children with non-discoloured plaque. plaque samples of the bs group contained higher numbers of a. naeslundii (p = 0.005) and lower numbers of f. nucleatum (p = 0.001) and lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.001) compared to the non-discoloured plaque samples of the control group. comparing the children with  bs and non-discoloured plaque, higher counts for a. naeslundii (p = 0.013) were observed in caries-free children with bs while in caries-affected children with bs, lower counts of f. nucleatum (p = 0.007) were found. counts of lactobacillus  sp. were higher in non-discoloured plaque samples than in bs of caries-free and caries-affected children. conclusion: results suggest that the different microbial composition of bs might be associated with the lower caries experience  in affected subjects. the role of black-pigmented bacteria associated with periodontitis needs further studies.

TI  == smoking-related cotinine levels and host responses in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: smoking has been reported to increase the risk of periodontal disease by disrupting the balance of immune responses and tissue repair processes; however, this risk varies among smokers. cotinine levels in saliva are routinely used to measure the level of smoking, and reflect the quantity of nicotine, and other smoking-related xenobiotics that challenge host systems. this study delineated characteristics of inflammatory mediators in saliva and serum antibody responses to both periodontal pathogens and commensal bacteria in smokers as they related to cotinine levels. materials and methods: this case-control study (n = 279) examined salivary inflammatory mediator responses [interleukin (il)-1ss, il-10, prostaglandin e2, myeloperoxidase and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1], and serum igg antibody responses to three periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomyce-temcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola) and five commensal oral microorganisms (veillonella parvula, streptococcus sanguis, prevotella loescheii, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga ochracea). results: the patients were stratified into  health (n = 30), gingivitis (n = 55) and periodontitis (n = 184); cotinine levels correlated with reported smoking habits in health, less so with gingivitis, and were not correlated in periodontitis. of the inflammatory mediators/acute phase proteins, only il-1ss levels were positively associated (p < 0.001) with the pack years and cotinine levels. as might be predicted, patients with periodontitis smoked more (p < 0.001) and had higher levels of cotinine. il-1ss and antibody to a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were significantly higher in the patients with periodontitis than either patients with gingivitis or who were healthy. conclusions: generally, antibody to the pathogens and commensals was lower with decreased cotinine levels. smoking exacerbated differences in both inflammatory mediators and three antibody in periodontal disease compared to healthy subjects.

TI  == microbial analysis of subgingival plaque samples compared to that of whole saliva in patients with periodontitis.
AB  == background: the detection of special bacterial species in patients with periodontitis is considered to be useful for clinical diagnosis and treatment. the collection of subgingival plaque samples is the common way for the determination of periodontopathic bacteria. however, recently, salivary analysis  has been discussed as an advantageous future diagnostic method for periodontitis  because it offers simple quantitative sampling and the possibility to assess various bacteria. the aim of this cross-sectional study is to investigate whether there is a correlation between the results of different bacterial species in saliva and subgingival plaque samples from individuals with aggressive periodontitis (agp) and chronic periodontitis (cp). methods: whole saliva and subgingival plaque samples from the deepest pocket of each quadrant were collected from 43 patients with cp and 33 patients with agp. twenty different bacterial species from both samplings were determined by the 16s ribosomal rna-based polymerase chain reaction with microarray technique. results: all bacterial species were detected in salivary and subgingival plaque samples. for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, as well as actinomyces viscosus, campylobacter rectus/showae, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, eubacterium nodatum, and campylobacter gracilis, a significant positive correlation between salivary and subgingival plaque samples was detected in patients with both types  of periodontitis. there were no significant differences in bacteria in salivary and subgingival plaque samples between agp and cp. conclusion: salivary analysis  might be discussed as a potential alternative to subgingival plaque sampling for  microbiologic analysis in both agp and cp.

TI  == pro-oxidative synergic bactericidal effect of no: kinetics and inhibition by nitroxides.
AB  == no plays diverse roles in physiological and pathological processes, occasionally  resulting in opposing effects, particularly in cells subjected to oxidative stress. no mostly protects eukaryotes against oxidative injury, but was demonstrated to kill prokaryotes synergistically with h2o2. this could be a promising therapeutic avenue. however, recent conflicting findings were reported  describing dramatic protective activity of no. the previous studies of no effects on prokaryotes applied a transient oxidative stress while arbitrarily checking the residual bacterial viability after 30 or 60min and ignoring the process kinetics. if no-induced synergy and the oxidative stress are time-dependent, the  elucidation of the cell killing kinetics is essential, particularly for survival  curves exhibiting a "shoulder" sometimes reflecting sublethal damage as in the linear-quadratic survival models. we studied the kinetics of no synergic effects  on h2o2-induced killing of microbial pathogens. a synergic pro-oxidative activity toward gram-negative and gram-positive cells is demonstrated even at sub-mum/min  flux of no. for certain strains, the synergic effect progressively increased with the duration of cell exposure, and the linear-quadratic survival model best fit the observed survival data. in contrast to the failure of sod to affect the bactericidal process, nitroxide sod mimics abrogated the pro-oxidative synergy of no/h2o2. these cell-permeative antioxidants, which hardly react with diamagnetic  species and react neither with no nor with h2o2, can detoxify redox-active transition metals and catalytically remove intracellular superoxide and nitrogen-derived reactive species such as (*)no2 or peroxynitrite. the possible mechanism underlying the bactericidal no synergy under oxidative stress and the potential therapeutic gain are discussed.

TI  == characterization and application of a flow system for in vitro multispecies oral  biofilm formation.
AB  == background and objective: bacteria in the oral cavity grow in the form of biofilms; these structures are subject to constant saliva or gingival crevicular  fluid flow conditions. the aims of this study were: (i) to develop and to characterize an in-vitro biofilm model with oral bacteria growing under flow and  shear conditions; and (ii) to demonstrate the usefulness of the model for evaluating the activity of three antiplaque agents. material and methods: we used a bioreactor to grow the oral bacteria streptococcus oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis under planktonic conditions. biofilms were established using a modified robbins device on hydroxyapatite (hap) discs. three- to 7-d-old biofilms were analysed using culture methods, scanning electron microscopy, live/dead staining and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (confocal laser scanning microscopy). finally, we assessed the antimicrobial activity of three mouthrinses [0.12% chlorhexidine (chx), 0.12% chlorhexidine and sodium fluoride (chx+naf) and 0.12% chlorhexidine and 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride (chx+cpc)] using a planktonic test (short interval-killing test) and in  our 4-d biofilm model. results: the viable cell counts showed that each species was consistently found in the biofilms throughout the study. the architecture and cell distribution were similar to those described for biofilms in situ, with the  exception of a thin layer of living cells that was found close to the hap. the effectiveness test of the mouthwashes demonstrated that cells in biofilms showed  more tolerance compared with planktonic cells. moreover, it was observed that in  4-d biofilm formed in vitro, chx+cpc caused significantly higher mortality compared with chx (p = 0.003) and chx+naf (p < 0.001). conclusion: our results suggest that we have a highly reproducible system for multispecies oral biofilm formation and that it is a useful tool for assessing antibacterial molecules before their clinical evaluation. it also has great potential to be used in basic research on supragingival and subgingival biofilms.

AB  == aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-induced localized aggressive periodontitis  (lap) in african-american adolescents has been documented but is poorly understood. two thousand fifty-eight adolescents aged 11 to 17 years were screened for their periodontal status and the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans in their oral cavity. seventy-one a. actinomycetemcomitans-negative and 63 a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive periodontally healthy subjects were enrolled, sampled, examined, and radiographed yearly for 3 years. gingival and periodontal pocket depth and attachment levels were recorded. disease presentation was characterized by bone loss (bl). subgingival sites were sampled every 6 months to assess (i) the role of a. actinomycetemcomitans in bl and (ii) the association of a. actinomycetemcomitans  and other microbes in their relationships to bl. sixteen of 63 subjects with a. actinomycetemcomitans developed bl (the other 47 subjects with a. actinomycetemcomitans had no bl). no a. actinomycetemcomitans-negative subjects developed bl. human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) was used for subgingival microbial assessment. on a subject level, pooled data from a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive subjects who remained healthy had higher prevalences of streptococcus and actinomyces species, while a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive subjects with bl had higher prevalences of parvimonas micra, filifactor alocis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and peptostreptococcus sp. human oral taxon 113 (hot-113). at vulnerable sites, a. actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus parasanguinis, and f. alocis levels were elevated prior to bl. in cases where the three-organism consortium (versus a. actinomycetemcomitans alone) was detected, the specificity for detecting sites of future bl increased from 62% to 99%, with a sensitivity of 89%. we conclude that  detecting the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, s. parasanguinis, and f. alocis together indicates sites of future bl in lap. a synergistic interaction of this consortium in lap causation is possible and is the subject of ongoing research.

TI  == effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy  agar (tsa) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. the autofluorescence was then assessed at  405 nm excitation. on the tsa without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. on the tsa containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from parvimonas micra. when the tsa was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin k, red autofluorescence was observed  from actinomyces naeslundii, bifidobacterium dentium, and streptococcus mutans. finally, on the tsa supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a. naeslundii, enterococcus  faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus salivarius, s. mutans, and veillonella parvula. we conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. the autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as  metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr combined with propidium monoazide for the selective quantification of viable periodontal pathogens in an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objectives: differentiation of live and dead cells is an important challenge when using molecular diagnosis for microbial identification. this is particularly relevant when bacteria have been exposed to antimicrobial agents. the objective of this study was to test a method using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) combined with propidium monoazide (pma), developed for the selective quantification of viable p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and total bacteria in an in vitro biofilm model after antimicrobial treatment. material and methods: pma-qpcr method was tested in an in vitro biofilm model, using isopropyl alcohol as the antimicrobial agent. matured biofilms were exposed for 1, 5, 10 and 30 min to isopropyl alcohol by immersion. biofilms were disrupted and pma added (final concentration of 100 mum). after dna isolation, qpcr was carried out using specific primers and probes for the target bacteria. the differentiation of live and dead cells was tested by analysis of variance. results: when pma was used in the presence of viable target bacterial cells, no statistically significant inhibition of qpcr amplification was detected (p > 0.05 in all cases). conversely, after immersion in isopropyl alcohol of the biofilm, pma resulted in a significant total reduction of qpcr amplification of about 4 log10 . p. gingivalis showed a vitality reduction in the biofilm of 3 log10 , while a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum showed a 2 log10 reduction. conclusion: these results demonstrate the efficiency of pma for  differentiating viable and dead p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum cells, as well as total bacteria, in an in vitro biofilm model, after being exposed to an antimicrobial agent. hence, this pma-qpcr method may be useful for studying the effect of antimicrobial agents aimed at oral biofilms.

TI  == antibacterial effects of blackberry extract target periodontopathogens.
AB  == background and objective: antimicrobial agents provide valuable adjunctive therapy for the prevention and the control of oral diseases. limitations in their prolonged use have stimulated the search for new, naturally occurring agents with more specific activity and fewer adverse effects. here we sought to determine the antibacterial properties of blackberry extract (bbe) in vitro against oral bacterial commensals and periodontopathogens. material and methods: the effects of whole and fractionated bbe on the metabolism of 10 different oral bacteria were evaluated using the colorimetric water-soluble tetrazolium-1 assay. the bactericidal effects of whole bbe against fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by quantitating the numbers of colony-forming units (cfus). cytotoxicity was determined in oral epithelial (okf6) cells. results: bbe at 350-1400 mug/ml reduced the metabolic activity of porphyromonas gingivalis, f. nucleatum and streptococcus mutans. the reduced metabolic activity observed for f. nucleatum corresponded to a reduction in the numbers of cfus following exposure to bbe for  as little as 1 h, indicative of its bactericidal properties. an anthocyanin-enriched fraction of bbe reduced the metabolic activity of f. nucleatum, but not of p. gingivalis or s. mutans, suggesting the contribution of  species-specific agents in the whole bbe. oral epithelial cell viability was not  reduced following exposure to whole bbe (2.24-1400 mug/ml) for </= 6 h. conclusion: bbe alters the metabolic activity of oral periodontopathogens while demonstrating a minimal effect on commensals. the specific antibacterial properties of bbe shown in this study, along with its previously demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, make this natural extract a promising target as an adjunct for prevention and/or complementary therapy of periodontal infections.

TI  == antimicrobial constituents of artemisia afra jacq. ex willd. against periodontal  pathogens.
AB  == the phytochemical investigation of an ethanol extract of artemisia afra led to the isolation of six known compounds, acacetin (1), 12alpha,4alpha-dihydroxybishopsolicepolide (2), scopoletin (3), alpha-amyrin (4), phytol (5), and a pentacyclic triterpenoid betulinic acid (6). the compounds were evaluated for antimicrobial activity against gram positive (actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, and streptococcus mutans), gram negative bacteria (prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans previously known as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans),  and candida albicans. the crude extract of a. afra inhibited the growth of all tested microbial species at concentration range of 1.6 mg/ml to 25 mg/ml. the compounds 1-6 also showed activity range at 1.0 mg/ml to 0.25 mg/ml. three best compounds (scopoletin, betulinic acid, and acacetin) which showed good antimicrobial activity were selected for further studies. cytotoxicity of extract and compounds was determined using the xtt cell proliferation kit. the antioxidant activity of the extract and compounds was done using the dpph scavenging method. the extract showed good antioxidant activity with an ic(50) value of 22.2 mug/ml. scopoletin had a strong transformation of the dpph radical  into its reduced form, with an ic(50) value of 1.24 mug/ml which was significant  to that of vitamin c (1.22 mug/ml). acacetin and betulinic acid exhibited a decreased scavenging activity with the ic(50) of 2.39 and 2.42 mug/ml, respectively. the extract and compounds showed moderate toxicity on mccoy fibroblast cell line and scopoletin was relatively nontoxic with an ic(50) value  of 132.5 mug/ml. acacetin and betulinic acid also showed a smooth trend of non-toxic effects with ic(50) values of 35.44 and 30.96 mug/ml. the obtained results in this study confirm the use of a. afra in the treatment of microbial infections.

TI  == oral microbiota in swiss adolescents.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of different oral microbes in gingival plaque samples and in samples from the dorsum of the tongue in a swiss adolescent population. materials and methods: ninety-nine adolescents between 15 and 18 years were enrolled. plaque index, bleeding on probing (bop), the periodontal screening index, and decayed missed filled tooth (dmft) index were recorded. samples from subgingival plaque and swabs from the tongue were analyzed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. additionally, counts of streptococus mutans and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were determined by real-time pcr. results: periodontitis was  not diagnosed in any of the subjects but all of them presented signs of gingival  inflammation displaying a mean bop of 28%. ten (10.1%) subjects were tested positive for p. gingivalis, each 22 (22.2%) for a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. forsythia, (47.5%) for t. denticola. t. denticola and s. mutans showed a high affinity to the gingival plaque, whereas t. forsythia was often detected from the dorsum of the tongue. dmft was associated with s. mutans counts, and bop correlated with counts of p. gingivalis and t. denticola. conclusions: the present data indicate that: (a) gingivitis but not periodontitis is a common finding among swiss adolescents, and (b) bacteria associated with periodontitis were frequently detected in the subgingival dental plaque and on the dorsum of the tongue in swiss adolescents with gingivitis. clinical relevance: although gingivitis was a frequent finding in swiss adolescents, periodontitis was not detected in this population. the dorsum of the tongue appears to represent an important reservoir for periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == effect of periodontal pathogens on the metatranscriptome of a healthy multispecies biofilm model.
AB  == oral bacterial biofilms are highly complex microbial communities with up to 700 different bacterial taxa. we report here the use of metatranscriptomic analysis to study patterns of community gene expression in a multispecies biofilm model composed of species found in healthy oral biofilms (actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, and fusobacterium  nucleatum) and the same biofilm plus the periodontopathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the presence of the periodontopathogens altered patterns in gene expression, and data indicate that transcription of protein-encoding genes and small noncoding rnas is stimulated. in the healthy biofilm hypothetical proteins, transporters and transcriptional regulators were upregulated while chaperones and cell division proteins were downregulated. however, when the pathogens were present, chaperones were highly upregulated, probably due to increased levels of stress. we also observed a significant upregulation of abc transport systems and putative transposases. changes in clusters of orthologous groups functional categories as well as gene set enrichment analysis based on kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg) pathways showed that in the absence of pathogens, only sets of proteins related to transport and secondary metabolism were upregulated, while in the presence of  pathogens, proteins related to growth and division as well as a large portion of  transcription factors were upregulated. finally, we identified several small noncoding rnas whose predicted targets were genes differentially expressed in the open reading frame libraries. these results show the importance of pathogens controlling gene expression of a healthy oral community and the usefulness of metatranscriptomic techniques to study gene expression profiles in complex microbial community models.

TI  == garlic allicin as a potential agent for controlling oral pathogens.
AB  == garlic has been used medicinally throughout human history. allicin is considered  the most therapeutic constituent of garlic. this study tested the antimicrobial activity of garlic allicin on oral pathogens associated with dental caries and periodontitis. allicin was found effective against all the tested bacteria. the broth dilution method revealed that planktonic growth of the cariogenic, gram-positive species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, and actinomyces oris was inhibited by an allicin concentration of 600 mug/ml or higher. planktonic growth  of the tested gram-negative periopathogenic species aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum was inhibited by a minimum allicin concentration of 300 mug/ml. porphyromonas gingivalis, an anaerobic, gram-negative pathogen and the bacterium most associated with chronic periodontitis, demonstrated the lowest sensitivity to allicin (2,400 mug/ml). gel zymography and the synthetic chromogenic substrate n(alpha)-benzoyl-l-arginine 4-nitroanilide hydrochloride demonstrated that allicin inhibits the proteases of  p. gingivalis, including the arginine and lysine gingipains known as major virulence factors of this organism. a gingipain-inactivated mutant demonstrated high sensitivity to allicin (<300 mug/ml), revealing that gingipains confer resistance to allicin. live/dead staining followed by analysis with confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that allicin was bactericidal to s. mutans grown in mature biofilms. however, this bactericidal effect was reduced as biofilm depth increased. in conclusion, these results support the traditional medicinal use of garlic and suggest the use of allicin for alleviating dental diseases.

AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to analyse the influence of the microtopography and hydrophilicity of titanium (ti) substrates on initial oral biofilm formation. materials and methods: nine bacterial species belonging to the normal oral microbiota, including: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces israelii, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and streptococcus sanguinis were tested on ti surfaces: pretreatment (pt [r(a) <0.2 mum]), acid-etched (a [r(a) <0.8 mum]), a modified to be hydrophilic (moda), sand-blasted/acid-etched (sla [r(a) =4 mum]), and hydrophilic sla (modsla). disks were incubated for 24 h in anaerobic conditions using a normal culture medium (cm) or human saliva (hs). the total counts of bacteria and the proportion of each bacterial species were analysed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: higher counts of bacteria were observed on all surfaces incubated with cm compared with the samples incubated with hs. pt, sla, and modsla exhibited higher numbers of attached bacteria in cm, whereas sla and modsla had a significant increase in bacterial adhesion in hs. the proportion of the species in the initial biofilms was also influenced by the surface properties and the media used: sla and modsla increased the proportion of species like a. actinomycetemcomitans and s. sanguinis in both media, while the adhesion of a. israelii and p. gingivalis on the same surfaces was affected in the presence of saliva. conclusions: the initial biofilm formation and composition were affected  by the microtopography and hydrophilicity of the surface and by the media used.

TI  == multispecies communities: interspecies interactions influence growth on saliva as sole nutritional source.
AB  == human oral bacteria live in multispecies communities in the biofilm called dental plaque. this review focuses on the interactions of seven species and the ability  of each species individually and together with other species to grow on saliva as the sole source of nutrient. community formation in biofilms in flow cells is monitored using species-specific fluorophore-conjugated immunoglobulin g, and images are captured by confocal microscopy. early colonizing veillonellae emerge  from this review of interspecies interactions in saliva as a critical genus that  guides the development of multispecies communities. highly selective interspecies recognition is evident as initial colonizers pair with early and middle colonizers to form multispecies communities that grow on saliva.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

AB  == background and objective: there are few in vitro models available in the scientific literature for study of the structure, formation and development of the subgingival biofilm. the purpose of this study was to develop and validate an in vitro biofilm model, using representative selected bacteria from the subgingival microbiota. material and methods: six standard reference strains were used to develop biofilms over sterile ceramic calcium hydroxyapatite discs coated with saliva within the wells of presterilized polystyrene tissue culture plates.  the selected species represent initial (streptococcus oralis and actinomyces naeslundii), early (veillonella parvula), secondary (fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). the structure of the biofilm obtained was studied using a vital fluorescence technique in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy. the biofilm bacterial kinetics were studied by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. results: after 12 h, initial and early colonizers were the first microorganisms detected adhering to the calcium hydroxyapatite discs. the intermediate colonizer f. nucleatum was not detected in the model until 24 h of incubation. late colonizers a. actinomycetemcomitans and  p. gingivalis could be measured inside the biofilm after 48 h. the biofilm reached its steady state between 72 and 96 h after inoculation, with bacterial vitality increasing from the hydroxyapatite surface to the central part of the biofilm. conclusion: an in vitro biofilm model was developed and validated, demonstrating a pattern of bacterial colonization and maturation similar to the in vivo development of the subgingival biofilm.

TI  == oxygen tension modulates the cytokine response of oral epithelium to periodontal  bacteria.
AB  == background: there is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. however, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. aim: to investigate the  effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. materials and methods: h400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. interleukin-8 (il-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and nf-kappab activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. results: tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial nf-kappab activation and cytokine responses. an oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest il-8 and tnf-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. conclusions: these data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli  at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.

TI  == aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as an early colonizer of oral tissues: epithelium as a reservoir?
AB  == this study examined in vivo and in vitro colonization by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, an organism highly associated with aggressive periodontitis. thirteen volunteers (5 were a. actinomycetemcomitans positive for  buccal epithelial cells [becs] and teeth, 5 were a. actinomycetemcomitans positive for teeth only, and 3 were a. actinomycetemcomitans-negative controls) had two mandibular stents fabricated. each stent contained 3 removable hydroxyapatite (ha) tooth surrogates. one ha square was removed from a stent at 5 time points over 7 h to assess the transfer of a. actinomycetemcomitans from teeth or becs to ha. streptococcus, actinomyces, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and total anaerobic counts were evaluated on each square over time. in vitro experiments evaluated binding, desorption, transfer, and reattachment of a. actinomycetemcomitans wild-type and mutant strains to becs and saliva-coated ha (sha). streptococcus and actinomyces formed 80% of the cultivable flora on ha in  all subjects. transfer of a. actinomycetemcomitans to ha was not seen in subjects with a. actinomycetemcomitans on teeth only. all 5 subjects with a. actinomycetemcomitans on becs showed transfer of a. actinomycetemcomitans to ha.  in vitro, a. actinomycetemcomitans desorbed from becs and transferred to sha. a.  actinomycetemcomitans binding to sha was irreversible and did not transfer to becs. the adhesin aae showed specificity for becs. fimbrial mutants showed the greatest reduction in binding to sha. a. actinomycetemcomitans migrated from becs to ha in vivo and to sha in vitro; however, a. actinomycetemcomitans movement from teeth and sha to becs did not occur. in vivo, a. actinomycetemcomitans colonized ha within 6 h and thus can be considered an early colonizer. becs are a likely reservoir for a. actinomycetemcomitans tooth colonization.

TI  == central role of the early colonizer veillonella sp. in establishing multispecies  biofilm communities with initial, middle, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  == human dental biofilm communities comprise several species, which can interact cooperatively or competitively. bacterial interactions influence biofilm formation, metabolic changes, and physiological function of the community. lactic acid, a common metabolite of oral bacteria, was measured in the flow cell effluent of one-, two- and three-species communities growing on saliva as the sole nutritional source. we investigated single-species and multispecies colonization by using known initial, early, middle, and late colonizers of enamel. fluorescent-antibody staining and image analysis were used to quantify the biomass in saliva-fed flow cells. of six species tested, only the initial colonizer actinomyces oris exhibited significant growth. the initial colonizer streptococcus oralis produced lactic acid but showed no significant growth. the early colonizer veillonella sp. utilized lactic acid in two- and three-species biofilm communities. the biovolumes of all two-species biofilms increased when veillonella sp. was present as one of the partners, indicating that this early colonizer promotes mutualistic community development. all three-species combinations exhibited enhanced growth except one, i.e., a. oris, veillonella sp., and the middle colonizer porphyromonas gingivalis, indicating specificity among three-species communities. further specificity was seen when fusobacterium  nucleatum (a middle colonizer), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a late colonizer), and p. gingivalis did not grow with s. oralis in two-species biofilms, but inclusion of veillonella sp. resulted in growth of all three-species combinations. we propose that commensal veillonellae use lactic acid for growth in saliva and that they communicate metabolically with initial, early, middle, and late colonizers to establish multispecies communities on enamel.

AB  == introduction: fixed orthodontic appliances can alter the subgingival microbiota.  our aim was to compare the subgingival microbiota and clinical parameters in adolescent subjects at sites of teeth treated with orthodontic bands with margins at (obm) or below the gingival margin (obsm), or with brackets (obr). methods: microbial samples were collected from 33 subjects (ages, 12-18 years) in treatment more than 6 months. the microbiota was assessed by the dna-dna checkerboard hybridization method. results: bacterial samples were taken from 83  obr,103 obsm, and 54 obm sites. probing pocket depths differed by orthodontic type (p <0.001) with mean values of 2.9 mm (sd, 0.6) at obsm sites, 2.5 mm (sd, 0.6) at obm sites, and 2.3 mm (sd, 0.5) at obr sites. only actinomyces israelii (p <0.001) and actinomyces naeslundii (p <0.001) had higher levels at obr sites,  whereas neisseria mucosa had higher levels at sites treated with obsm or obm (p <0.001). aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was found in 25% of sites independent of the appliance. conclusions: different types of orthodontic appliances cause minor differences in the subgingival microbiota (a israelii and  a naeslundii) and higher levels at sites treated with orthodontic brackets. more  sites with bleeding on probing and deeper pockets were found around orthodontic bands.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of commercial dentifrices.
AB  == this investigation compared the effects of a fluoride dentifrice and toothpastes  formulated with antimicrobial ingredients (stannous fluoride and triclosan/copolymer) on oral micro-organisms, including those found in samples taken from the human oral cavity. microbiological techniques determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of each dentifrice necessary to inhibit  the growth of bacterial strains from the healthy oral cavity, as well as those found in dental caries, periodontal disease, and halitosis. ex vivo studies utilized oral rinse samples and supragingival plaque from adults to determine antimicrobial effects on the entire microbial diversity of these samples, including biofilm-derived micro-organisms. the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated the lowest mics and significantly inhibited gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (including the periodontal pathogens aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, and fusobacterium nucleatum). in the  ex vivo tests, the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated substantial inhibition in the oral rinse samples over each treatment period (p > 0.0005) as compared to either the fluoride or stannous fluoride dentifrices. similarly, the  triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated the highest inhibition of micro-organisms in the supragingival plaque biofilm (p < 0.0005). no significant  differences were observed between the fluoride and stannous fluoride dentifrices  (p > 0.5).

TI  == microbial profile of ligature-induced periodontitis in rats.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the biofilm accumulated around ligatures in rats by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization using  probes made from human oral bacterial species. methods: 12 wistar rats were selected for this study. one of the mandibular first molars of each animal received a ligature, while the contralateral tooth was left unligated to be used  as a control. forty-two days later, the ligatures and one sample of biofilm from  each unligated teeth were analyzed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization for 40 human periodontal species. the area of bone loss in the furcation area was determined histometrically. results: the unligated teeth did not present any of the bacterial species tested. twenty five species were detected in the ligatures. streptococcus- and actinomyces-like species were found in high mean counts, followed by fusobacterium-, prevotella nigrescens- and parvimonas micra-like species and porphyromonas gingivalis- and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-like species. greater bone loss was observed in the furcation area of the ligated than of the unligated group (p<0.0001). conclusion: at 42 days, the ligature biofilm in rats presents various bacterial species that  hybridize to probes of periodontal bacterial species commonly observed in human.

TI  == subgingival bacterial colonization profiles correlate with gingival tissue gene expression.
AB  == background: periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by the microbiota of the periodontal pocket. we investigated the association between subgingival bacterial profiles and gene expression patterns in gingival tissues of patients with periodontitis. a total of 120 patients undergoing periodontal surgery contributed with a minimum of two interproximal gingival papillae (range  2-4) from a maxillary posterior region. prior to tissue harvesting, subgingival plaque samples were collected from the mesial and distal aspects of each tissue sample. gingival tissue rna was extracted, reverse-transcribed, labeled, and hybridized with whole-genome microarrays (310 in total). plaque samples were analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridizations with respect to 11 bacterial species. random effects linear regression models considered bacterial levels as exposure and expression profiles as outcome variables. gene ontology analyses summarized the expression patterns into biologically relevant categories. results: wide inter-species variation was noted in the number of differentially expressed gingival tissue genes according to subgingival bacterial levels: using  a bonferroni correction (p < 9.15 x 10(-7)), 9,392 probe sets were differentially associated with levels of tannerella forsythia, 8,537 with porphyromonas gingivalis, 6,460 with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, 506 with eikenella  corrodens and only 8 with actinomyces naeslundii. cluster analysis identified commonalities and differences among tissue gene expression patterns differentially regulated according to bacterial levels. conclusion: our findings  suggest that the microbial content of the periodontal pocket is a determinant of  gene expression in the gingival tissues and provide new insights into the differential ability of periodontal species to elicit a local host response.

TI  == mutualistic biofilm communities develop with porphyromonas gingivalis and initial, early, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is present in dental plaque as early as 4 h after tooth  cleaning, but it is also associated with periodontal disease, a late-developing event in the microbial successions that characterize daily plaque development. we report here that p. gingivalis atcc 33277 is remarkable in its ability to interact with a variety of initial, early, middle, and late colonizers growing solely on saliva. integration of p. gingivalis into multispecies communities was  investigated by using two in vitro biofilm models. in flow cells, bacterial growth was quantified using fluorescently conjugated antibodies against each species, and static biofilm growth on saliva-submerged polystyrene pegs was analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr using species-specific primers. p. gingivalis could not grow as a single species or together with initial colonizer  streptococcus oralis but showed mutualistic growth when paired with two other initial colonizers, streptococcus gordonii and actinomyces oris, as well as with  veillonella sp. (early colonizer), fusobacterium nucleatum (middle colonizer), and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (late colonizer). in three-species flow cells, p. gingivalis grew with veillonella sp. and a. actinomycetemcomitans but not with s. oralis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. also, it grew with veillonella sp. and f. nucleatum but not with s. oralis and f. nucleatum, indicating that p.  gingivalis and s. oralis are not compatible. however, p. gingivalis grew in combination with s. gordonii and s. oralis, demonstrating its ability to overcome the incompatibility when cultured with a second initially colonizing species. collectively, these data help explain the observed presence of p. gingivalis at all stages of dental plaque development.

TI  == oral bacteria induce a differential activation of human immunodeficiency virus-1  promoter in t cells, macrophages and dendritic cells.
AB  == introduction: the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) can integrate into t cells,  macrophages and dendritic cells resulting in a latent infection. reports have also demonstrated that various microbial and host cell factors can trigger hiv reactivation leading to hiv recrudescence, potentially undermining highly active  antiretroviral therapies. methods: this study evaluated the capacity of oral bacteria associated with chronic periodontal infections to stimulate hiv promoter activation in various cell models of hiv latency. results: t cells (1g5) challenged with oral bacteria demonstrated a dose-response of hiv promoter activation with a subset of the bacteria, as well as kinetics that were generally similar irrespective of the stimuli. direct bacterial challenge of the t cells resulted in increased activation of approximately 1.5- to 7-fold over controls. challenge of macrophages (bf24) indicated different kinetics for individual bacteria and resulted in consistent increases in promoter activation of five fold to six fold over basal levels for all bacteria except streptococcus mutans. dendritic cells showed increases in hiv reactivation of 7- to 34-fold specific for individual species of bacteria. conclusion: these results suggested that oral bacteria have the capability to reactivate hiv from latently infected cells, showing a relationship of mature dendritic cells > immature dendritic cells > macrophages > or = t cells. expression of various pattern recognition receptors on these various cell types may provide insight into the primary receptors/signaling pathways used for reactivation by the bacteria.

TI  == microbiological profile of untreated subjects with localized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == aim: the microbial profile of localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) has not yet been determined. therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the subgingival microbial composition of lagp. material and methods: one hundred and  twenty subjects with lagp (n=15), generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp, n=25), chronic periodontitis (chp, n=30) or periodontal health (ph, n=50) underwent clinical and microbiological assessment. nine subgingival plaque samples were collected from each subject and analysed for their content of 38 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: red complex  and some orange complex species are the most numerous and prevalent periodontal pathogens in lagp. the proportions of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were  elevated in shallow and intermediate pockets of lagp subjects in comparison with  those with gagp or chp, but not in deep sites. this species also showed a negative correlation with age and with the proportions of red complex pathogens.  the host-compatible actinomyces species were reduced in lagp. conclusion: a. actinomycetemcomitans seems to be associated with the onset of lagp, and porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum and prevotella intermedia play an important role in disease progression. successful treatment of lagp would involve a reduction in these pathogens and an increase in the actinomyces species.

TI  == the microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. methods: microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the dental school of the university of athens, who were split into three age groups. a total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: all of the test species, except parvimonas micra and porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial  profiles for the different oral surfaces. supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of actinomyces species and  green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the yellow complex. the profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. specifically, the red complex species (tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (p < 0.05) in all sample locations. conclusions: the results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of orange and red  complex species.

TI  == does strontium play a role in the cariostatic activity of glass ionomer? strontium diffusion and antibacterial activity.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of strontium ions on the main pathogens of the oral flora. the leaching of strontium from resin modified glass ionomer cements (rmgic) was evaluated together with its uptake by  superficial dental enamel. methods: the antibacterial activity was measured by the growth inhibition method following exposure of supra- and sub-gingival bacteria to a range of strontium concentrations (0.19 moll(-1), 0.37 moll(-1), 0.74 moll(-1) and 1.11 moll(-1)). strontium concentrations were analyzed chemically and migration at 5 microm and 15 microm depths was quantified by microprobe following fuji ortho lc application on the vestibular enamel of extracted teeth. results: strontium was found in appreciable amounts (0.8 wt.%) in superficial enamel, but in insignificant concentrations deeper in. at the same time, 8% fluoroapatite was formed in the enamel. under our experimental conditions, strontium had no significant antibacterial activity; only one log reduction of activity was observed at the highest concentrations tested. conclusions: rmgic releases strontium ions which are rapidly exchanged for calcium ions in the superficial enamel. no significant antibacterial activity was observed for strontium ions alone at the concentrations considered. however synergistic effects with fluoride could promote antibacterial activity.

TI  == serum antibodies to periodontal bacteria as diagnostic markers of periodontitis.
AB  == background: assessment of periodontal conditions in epidemiologic studies usually requires a clinical examination, which is resource-intensive. we investigated the ability of serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibodies to periodontal bacteria to reflect clinical periodontal status. methods: we used checkerboard immunoblotting to assess serum igg levels to 19 species, including established/putative periodontal pathogens and non-pathogenic bacteria, in 5,747 dentate adults aged > or = 40 years who participated in the third national health and nutrition examination survey between 1988 and 1994. three earlier described alternative definitions of periodontitis were used, based on specific combinations of probing depth and attachment level values. optimized elevated titer thresholds and corresponding sensitivities and specificities were calculated for each definition. titers significantly associated with periodontitis were identified in univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. parsimonious models were subsequently developed using age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, smoking, and diagnosed diabetes. results: in unadjusted models, high titers to porphyromonas gingivalis were most strongly associated with periodontitis across  all definitions (odds ratio, 2.07 to 2.74; p <0.05). in parsimonious models including demographic data, smoking, and diagnosed diabetes, high p. gingivalis titers were consistently associated with periodontitis, whereas high eubacterium  nodatum titers were associated with periodontal health in two of three definitions. receiver operating characteristic curves for the parsimonious multivariable models showed that the area under the curve ranged between 0.72 and 0.78. conclusions: serum igg titers to selected periodontal species, combined with demographic and behavioral characteristics, resulted in a moderately accurate classification of periodontal status in epidemiologic studies. the external validity of these findings must be examined further.

TI  == oral bacteria modulate invasion and induction of apoptosis in hep-2 cells by pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic bacterial pathogen, causing  infections of the respiratory and other organ systems in susceptible hosts. p. aeruginosa infection is initiated by adhesion to and invasion of mucosal epithelial cells. the failure of host defenses to eliminate p. aeruginosa from mucosal surfaces results in p. aeruginosa proliferation, sometimes followed by overt infection and tissue destruction. there is growing evidence that associates poor oral health and respiratory infection. an in vitro model system for bacterial invasion of respiratory epithelial cells was used to investigate the influence of oral bacteria on p. aeruginosa epithelial cell invasion. oral pathogens including porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans increased invasion of p. aeruginosa into hep-2 cells from one- to threefold. in contrast, non-pathogenic oral bacteria such as actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus gordonii showed no significant influence on p. aeruginosa invasion. p. aeruginosa together with oral bacteria stimulated greater cytokine production from hep-2 cells than did p. aeruginosa alone. p. aeruginosa in combination with periodontal pathogens also increased apoptosis of hep-2 cells and induced elevated caspase-3 activity. these results suggest that oral bacteria, especially periodontal pathogens, may foster  p. aeruginosa invasion into respiratory epithelial cells to enhance host cell cytokine release and apoptosis.

TI  == granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (gcp-2/cxcl6) complements interleukin-8 in periodontal disease.
AB  == background and objective: mucosal inflammatory responses are orchestrated largely by pro-inflammatory chemokines. the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (cxcl6) is involved in neutrophil recruitment and migration. previous studies have shown that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 is up-regulated during mucosal  inflammation (e.g. in inflammatory bowel disease), similarly to the functionally  and structurally related chemokine interleukin-8. nevertheless, unlike interleukin-8, a role of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival inflammation has not been yet demonstrated. in this study we aimed to evaluate the expression of the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in clinically healthy vs. diseased gingival tissues and to explore possible correlations with clinical and microbiological markers of periodontitis. material and methods: gene expression in 184 'diseased' and 63 'healthy' gingival tissue specimens from 90 patients with periodontitis was analyzed using affymetrix u133plus2.0 arrays. the expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was further confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while the localization of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. plaque samples from the adjacent periodontal pockets were collected and evaluated for 11 species of periodontal bacteria using checkerboard dna-dna hybridizations. results: among all known chemokines, gcp-2 expression was the most up-regulated (3.8-fold, p < 1.1 x 10(-16)), in 'diseased' vs. 'healthy' tissue as compared to  a 2.6-fold increased expression of interleukin-8 mrna (p < 1.2 x 10(-15)). increased expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlated with higher  levels of 'red' and 'orange' complex pathogens and with increased probing depth,  but not with attachment loss. immunohistochemistry showed that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was expressed in gingival vascular endothelium. conclusion: the level of expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlates with the  severity of periodontitis and appears to act as a hitherto unrecognized functional adjunct to interleukin-8 in diseased gingival tissues.

TI  == quercetin in a lotus leaves extract may be responsible for antibacterial activity.
AB  == in the course of a search for chemotherapeutic agents inhibiting suspected peridontitis bacteria, extracted and purified substances from lotus leaf were identified by antimicrobial activity tests with use of the broth micro-dilution methods on 96-microwell plate. the antimicrobial activity of extracts was tested  against five microorganisms, namely: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4, actinomyces viscosus 19246, porphyromonas gingivalis 33277, fusobacterium nucleatum 25586, and actinomyces naeslundii wvl 45. the most active antimicrobial extract was subjected to spectroscopic analysis using uv, mass spectrometry, and  by (1)h, (13)c-, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. our data showed that the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the most active extract were 0.625, 1.25, 1.25, 0.625 and 2.5 mg/ml for a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. viscosus, p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and a. naeslundii, respectively. the component that had a greatest antimicrobial activity was determined to be quercetin. thus, we conclude that quercetin extracted from lotus leaves may be a potential antibacterial agent for periodontitis.

TI  == bleeding on probing differentially relates to bacterial profiles: the oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study.
AB  == aim: various bacterial species are differentially prevalent in periodontal health, gingivitis or periodontitis. we tested the independent associations between three bacterial groupings and gingival inflammation in an epidemiological study. material and methods: in 706 oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study (invest) participants > or =55 years, bleeding on probing (bop), pocket depth (pd) and subgingival plaque samples (n=4866) were assessed in eight sites per mouth. eleven bacterial species were quantitatively assayed and grouped as follows: (i) aetiologic burden (eb, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella  forsythia); (ii) putative burden (pb, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens,  fusobacterium nucleatum, micromonas micros, prevotella intermedia); (iii) health-associated burden (hab, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula). results: after mutual adjustment for eb, pb and hab, the bop prevalence increased by 45% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of eb while bop decreased by 13% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of hab. mean pd increased 0.8 mm and decreased 0.3 mm from the first to fourth quartiles of eb (p<0.0001) and hab ( p<0.0001), respectively. among 1214 plaque samples with fourth quartile eb, 60% were collected from sites with pd < or =3 mm. conclusion: bacterial species believed to be aetiologically related to periodontitis were associated with bop in sites with minimal pd and/or attachment level (al). species presumed to be associated with periodontal health demonstrated inverse associations with bop.

TI  == smap29 congeners demonstrate activity against oral bacteria and reduced toxicity  against oral keratinocytes.
AB  == introduction: cathelicidins are antimicrobial peptides found in epithelial and mucosal tissues as well as the secondary granules of neutrophils. smap29, a sheep cathelicidin, has differential antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including periodontal organisms. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of smap29, smap28, and three congeners (smap18a, smap18d, and smap14a). methods: the peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 250 microg/ml were tested for their activity  against multiple strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and porphyromonas gingivalis using a radial diffusion assay. cytotoxicity of keratinocytes was evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release after incubation with the individual peptides. results: smap28, thought to be the biologically active peptide, was the most potent antimicrobial (range of minimum  inhibitory concentrations 0.06-7.03 microg/ml, p < 0.05); however, the activity of smap28 and smap29 was strongly associated (r = 0.933). the congeners also demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested (range of minimum inhibitory concnetrations 0.21-79 microg/ml). overall, f. nucleatum was the most  susceptible organism, while p. gingivalis was the least susceptible. keratinocyte cytotoxicity was dependent on peptide length and dose. smap28 was the most cytotoxic, while smap14a was the least cytotoxic. conclusion: the antimicrobial activities against oral microorganisms and the minimal toxicity seen in this study suggest that the congeners of smap29 may serve as an alternative to traditional antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of periodontal and other  oral diseases.

TI  == reduction of periodontal pathogens adhesion by antagonistic strains.
AB  == introduction: periodontitis results from a shift in the subgingival microflora into a more pathogenic direction with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans considered as periodontopathogens. in many cases, treatment procures only a temporary shift towards a less pathogenic microflora. an alternative treatment could be the deliberate colonization of pockets with antagonistic microorganisms to control the adhesion of periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to identify bacterial strains that reduce adhesion of periodontopathogens to surfaces. methods: streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus crista, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces naeslundii, and haemophilus parainfluenzae were  evaluated as potential antagonists against p. gingivalis atcc 33277, p. intermedia atcc 49046, and a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718 as periodontopathogens. adhesion of periodontopathogens to the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber was studied in the absence (control) and the presence of pre-adhering antagonistic strains up to a surface coverage of 5%. results: the largest reduction caused by antagonistic strains was observed for p. gingivalis.  all antagonistic strains except s. crista atcc 49999 inhibited the adhesion of p. gingivalis by at least 1.6 cells per adhering antagonist, with the largest significant reduction observed for a. naeslundii atcc 51655 (3.8 cells per adhering antagonist). adhering antagonists had a minimal effect on the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718. intermediate but significant reductions were perceived for p. intermedia, most notably caused by s. mitis bms. conclusion: the adhesion of p. gingivalis was inhibited best by antagonistic strains, while s. mitis bms appeared to be the most successful antagonist.

TI  == susceptibility of various oral bacteria to antimicrobial peptides and to phagocytosis by neutrophils.
AB  == background and objective: the aim of this study was to compare the susceptibility of nonperiodontopathic and periodontopathic bacteria to major defense mechanisms  for bacterial clearance in gingival sulcus. material and methods: twenty strains  of 13 oral bacterial species were studied for their susceptibility to phagocytosis by human neutrophils and to the antimicrobial peptides ll-37 and human beta defensin-3. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ll-37 and human beta defensin-3 were determined by a liquid dilution assay, and susceptibility to phagocytosis was examined by a flow cytometric phagocytosis assay. results: the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ll-37 and human beta defensin-3 varied greatly, depending on the strain and species. although a significant difference between the non- and periodontopathic groups was not observed, the red-complex bacteria were more resistant to ll-37 than the others (p=0.004). the susceptibility of oral bacteria to phagocytosis was quite variable, depending on  the species but not on the strains. the periodontopathic bacteria, especially actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and the red-complex triad, were more resistant to phagocytosis than were the nonperiodontopathic bacteria (p=0.0003).  in addition, bacteria resistant both to antimicrobial peptides and to phagocytosis were more common in the periodontopathic group. conclusion: our results indicate that immune evasion may contribute to the pathogenicity of some  periodontopathic bacteria.

AB  == in vivo dental plaque biofilms consist of complex communities of oral bacteria that are a challenge to replicate in vitro. the aim of this investigation was to  establish human dental plaque microcosms in microplates to reflect conditions that are relevant to dental caries. microcosm plaque biofilms were initiated from the saliva of two different donors, grown for up to 10 days in 24-welled microplates on thermanox coverslips in various types of artificial saliva with and without sucrose, which were replaced daily. microbiota composition of 40 species associated with oral health and dental caries was monitored in the plaques using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization analysis. ph was measured as an  indicator of cariogenic potential. the composition of the saliva inocula was different, and yielded plaque microcosms with different composition and growth responses to sucrose. artificial saliva type and presence of sucrose, and the resulting growth and ph conditions, modified the growth of individual species and hence the ecological profile of the microplate plaques during development. complex population shifts were observed during development, and older plaques comprised predominantly facultative anaerobic species. sucrose supplementation limited the decline of streptococci over time but did not increase the abundance  of mutans streptococci. sucrose at 0.15% increased levels of caries-associated species including lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus and actinomyces gerensceriae; these were further increased with sucrose at 0.5%, in addition to actinomyces israelii, rothia dentocariosa and capnocytophaga gingivalis. the microplate plaques demonstrated complex community dynamics that appeared to reflect the maturation of natural plaques, and sucrose induced a cariogenic plaque composition and ph.

TI  == expression of the short fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated in oral bacterial consortia.
AB  == the mfa1 protein of porphyromonas gingivalis is the structural subunit of the short fimbriae and mediates coadhesion between p. gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii. we utilized a promoter-lacz reporter construct to examine the regulation of mfa1 expression in consortia with common oral plaque bacteria. promoter activity of mfa1 was inhibited by s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus mitis. in contrast, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus cristatus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum did not affect mfa1 expression. expression of sspa/b, the streptococcal receptor for mfa1, was not required for regulation of mfa1 promoter activity. proteinaceous molecule(s) in oral streptococci may be responsible for regulation of mfa1 expression. porphyromonas gingivalis is capable of detecting heterologous organisms, and responds to selected organisms by specific gene regulation.

TI  == selective inhibition of porphyromonas gingivalis growth by a factor xa inhibitor, dx-9065a.
AB  == background: porphyromonas gingivalis is a causative bacterium of adult periodontitis. however, there is no drug specific for p. gingivalis and for its virulence factor. objectives: the objective of this study was to examine the effects of a new selective inhibitor of activated factor x, dx-9065a, on growth of porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria. methods: we incubated p. gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria in the presence or absence of dx-9065a and examined the effect of dx-9065a on bacterial growth and trypsin-like activity in its cultures. we also examined the effects of dx9065a on amidolytic activity of purified trypsin-like proteinases (gingipains rgpa and rgpb), from p. gingivalis and on trypsin-like activity in gingival crevicular fluids from patients with adult periodontitis. results: dx-9065a selectively inhibited the growth of p. gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, and its effect on p. gingivalis was bactericidal. trypsin-like proteinase activity was detected  in p. gingivalis, and the activity was strongly inhibited by dx-9065a. dx-9065a even inhibited amidolytic activity of rgpa and rgpb from p. gingivalis. furthermore, trypsin-like proteinase activity in gingival crevicular fluids was strongly inhibited by dx-9065a. conclusions: dx-9065a inhibits p. gingivalis growth in part through to its ability to inhibit the trypsin-like proteinase activity in p. gingivalis and may be useful for a new drug for treatment of adult periodontitis.

TI  == analysis of the antibacterial activity and plaque control benefit of colgate total dentifrice via clinical evaluation and real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == objective: this study analyzed, from a combined clinical and molecular biologic perspective, the antibacterial and antiplaque efficacy of colgate total dentifrice (ctd). methodology: a single-blind crossover study design utilized 11  healthy human subjects. after a one-week washout period, subjects donated dental  plaque, received a dental prophylaxis, and subsequently brushed with a test product. twenty-four hours postbrushing, dental plaque was collected and a clinical plaque score determined. dental plaque was submitted for real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time pcr) analysis. the same procedure was repeated in accordance with a crossover design for the use of the second test product. following a one-week washout, a plaque donation, prophylaxis, and brushing with the test product ensued for each subject. twenty-four hours post-brushing, the subjects returned for a plaque score and plaque donation. results: twenty-four hours after brushing, dental plaque coverage increased 17.88% +/- 8.27% with ctd, compared to 30.42% +/- 9.97% with colgate cavity protection (ccp; p = 0.005). real-time pcr found plaque collected 24 hours after  brushing with ctd exhibited, on average, fewer representative periodontal pathogens (fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, and porphyromonas gingivalis) and fewer early colonizers (actinomyces naeslundii) than plaque collected before brushing, whereas ccp showed a moderate effect on oral bacteria. conclusion: the study provides clinical and molecular biological evidence to substantiate the antibacterial and  plaque control benefits of colgate total, and suggests the value of combining a molecular biological method with clinical research to corroborate clinical benefits.

TI  == in vivo evaluation of the effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on salivary bacteria using the checkerboard method.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on different species of the oral microbiota. methodology: saliva samples were collected from 20 subjects with good oral health, diluted and plated onto blood agar medium. the subjects were asked to place the strip (listerine pocketpaks) on the tongue allowing it to dissolve. after 30 minutes, new saliva samples were collected again and the plates with the samples were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees c for seven days. colony counts (cfu/ml) were determined for each sample. the colonies on the plates were washed with 1 ml of te buffer, and the bacterial suspensions were processed for the identification of 24 species by dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. differences in total counts, prevalence, and levels of the species evaluated before and after placement of the strips were determined by wilcoxon sign rank and chi-square tests. results: a modest increase in the total bacterial number in saliva from 1.4 x 10(8) to 1.7 x 10(8) bacterial cells  was observed 30 minutes after the strip placement, although this change was not significant (p = 0.632). most of the species reduced in frequency and/or levels,  including the pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium spp., p. intermedia, and s. noxia, as well as the beneficial species a. meyeri, a. georgia, a. gerencseriae, a. odontolyticus, and p. acnes after strip placement. in contrast, a. viscosus, p. melaninogenica, p. gingivalis, p. micros, streptococcus spp., t. forsythensis, and v. parvula presented an increase in prevalence and/or levels. these changes were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (p > 0.0022).  conclusion: the use of the essential oil-containing oral strips resulted in a short-term small increase in the total number of salivary microorganisms. in addition, a not significant decrease of certain periodontopathogens, and an increase in species compatible with oral health were observed.

TI  == dna-dna hybridization demonstrates multiple bacteria in osteoradionecrosis.
AB  == bone necrosis secondary to radiation was previously attributed to trauma of devitalized bone and microbiological sepsis. however, conventional microbiological technique has failed to demonstrate microorganisms throughout osteoradionecrotic bone, claimed to be hypoxic, hypovascular and hypocellular. the aim of the present study was to examine such bone for bacteria using dna-dna  hybridization. compared to standard culture methods this technique enables the investigation of a vast number of bacteria in a fairly short time. twelve deep medullary specimens from resected radionecrotic mandibles were studied. a multitude of bacterial species were detected, most of them anaerobic. porphyromonas gingivalis was the most predominant organism, followed by fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies polymorphum. all samples contained actinomyces, prevotella and f. nucleatum. the results of this study indicate that bacteria, particularly anaerobes, may play a more fundamental role in the pathophysiology of osteoradionecrosis than being merely surface contaminants.

TI  == effectiveness of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on microbiological and inflammatory parameters.
AB  == according to the us surgeon general's report, "oral health in america," published in 2000, most adults in the united states show some degree of periodontal pathology, with severe periodontal diseases affecting about 14% of middle-aged adults. periodontal diseases are polymicrobial-induced inflammatory diseases, and they vary from mild gingival inflammation to severe deterioration of the periodontium, ie, loss of periodontal supportive tissues and, ultimately, tooth loss. new evidence shows that periodontal diseases may impact systemic health. for this reason, the maintenance of a healthy mouth is becoming increasingly important for the overall health of the body. this article summarizes laboratory  research conducted during the development of a novel, multibenefit, oral-care technology based on triclosan--a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent--and a polyvinylmethylether/maleic acid copolymer. this unique combination of agents is  found in colgate total, a clinically proven efficacious dentifrice for control of dental plaque and gingivitis. data are presented that demonstrate the unique antibacterial properties of this dentifrice: (1) a broad-spectrum antimicrobial profile; (2) the long-lasting retention of triclosan on hydroxyapatite and epithelial cells; and (3) molecular evidence of antibacterial activity against specific pathogens in clinical dental plaque. in addition, data are presented that demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effects of triclosan on specific cytokines, the interruption of inflammatory pathways, and the inhibition of bone  resorption. overall, these data support the multibenefit clinical effects of colgate total and suggest a plurality of mechanisms of action.

TI  == detection of subgingival calculus and dentine caries by laser fluorescence.
AB  == objectives: detection of subgingival calculus and dentine caries in the bottom of deep periodontal pockets is often difficult without visual observation. we thus examined the possibility of its detection using autofluorescence induced by laser irritation. methods: autofluorescence was measured at various excitation and emission wavelength settings in five specimens each of sound dentine and enamel,  subgingival calculus, and root caries. periodontopathic model teeth with bacterial cells and blood clots were also irritated by laser to obtain autofluorescent images. results: subgingival calculus and dentine caries showed a characteristic 700 nm emission when excited at 635 nm or a 720 nm emission when excited at 655 nm; sound dentine or enamel, however, did not. the calculus differentiation power, however, was higher with excitation at 635 nm than at 655  nm. the autofluorescent images photographed at an excitation of 633 nm provided clear calculus identification in periodontopathic model teeth when a 700 nm band-pass filter or a 700 nm high-pass filter was used. however, fluorescence intensity was masked when the calculus surface was covered by bacterial cells or  blood clots. for clinical use, it would be important to remove subgingival plaque and debris from root surfaces before attempting to detect subgingival calculus and root caries with this manner. conclusion: the autofluorescence method employing excitation of 633-635 nm was found to be a powerful tool for detecting  subgingival calculus and root caries.

TI  == a rapid procedure to ascertain the antimicrobial efficacy of oral care formulations.
AB  == a rapid method examining the antimicrobial efficacy of oral care formulations with alamar blue, an oxidation-reduction dye with fluorescent end-points, is described. significant correlations between increasing viable plate counts of the oral bacteria actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and increased alamar fluorescence were noted. metabolically active bacteria reduced alamar with the reduced dye found in the cell-free filtrate. insignificant alamar reductions were noted in the absence of bacteria or by spent culture supernatants. the efficacy of mouthrinses with clinically proven antiplaque agents such as chlorhexidine or cetylpyridinium chloride were determined by alamar blue. in a model system with a. viscosus, triclosan dentifrices demonstrate a dose-dependent effect on bacteria. human salivary bacteria demonstrate increasing alamar fluorescence with increasing plate counts. a clinical study examined the effects of rinsing with chlorhexidine or cetylpyridinium chloride mouthrinses in comparison with a placebo mouthrinse and water on salivary bacteria. rinsing with chlorhexidine resulted in the least  number of bacteria by alamar and plate count methods. in summary, the current study demonstrates the utility of alamar blue to examine the antimicrobial effects of oral care formulations in laboratory and clinical studies.

TI  == subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  == little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. we assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. a pooled subgingival plaque  sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold,  between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. the percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. miswak users harbored significantly higher streptococcus intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii, and capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower selenomonas sputigena, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (p <  0.05) higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and v. parvula than those 4-5 mm. our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.

TI  == generation of gingival t cell lines/clones specific with porphyromonas gingivalis pulsed dendritic cells from periodontitis patients.
AB  == objectives and background: it is well documented that in periodontitis lesions, most infiltrated gingival t cells are antigen-specific memory t cells. these cells play an important role as regulators and effector cells in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. in this study, we used dendritic cells (dcs) as antigen-presenting cells to generate human gingival t cell lines and clones specific for porphyromonas gingivalis from periodontitis patients. methods: autologous dcs were derived from the patients' adherent monocytes using granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin (il)-4. lymphocytes were isolated from gingival biopsies using collagenase enzyme digestion and the number was increased by subsequent culturing in il-2-containing medium. t cells were then negatively sorted using flow cytometry, cocultured with p. gingivalis-pulsed dcs and subsequently expanded in the culture medium containing il-2. t cells were kept viable and active by periodic exposure to antigen-pulsed dcs. the specificity of the t cell lines was tested against four plaque bacteria: p. gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella  intermedia and actinomyces viscosus. the established t cell lines were then cloned. three p. gingivalis-specific t cell lines and 12 gingival t cell clones were generated. they all showed good specificity against p. gingivalis but not to other plaque bacteria. results: all t cell clones were positive for cd4 and the majority of them produced interferon gamma, but a minimal or negligible amount of il-5. conclusions: the data obtained clearly showed that monocyte-derived dcs could be used as powerful antigen-presenting cells to generate antigen-specific t cells from periodontitis tissues.

AB  == bacteria are involved in the onset and progression of periodontitis. a promising  molecular technique, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), to study microbial population dynamics in the subgingival pocket is presented. twenty-three samples were taken from the subgingival pockets of nine patients and six healthy family members. from four periodontitis patients, 12 samples were evaluated before, 1 day after and 3 months after treatment. part of the 16s rrna  gene of all bacteria was amplified by pcr and separated by dgge, creating banding patterns representative of the community structure. shifts in composition and diversity of the microbial population could be determined semiquantitatively, and this showed that treatment resulted in a decrease in the diversity of the population. after 3 months a microbial population 33-47% different from the population before treatment had re-established. intense bands representing exiguobacterium aurantiacum were present in 13 out of 25 samples, indicating that this species may play a role in periodontal disease.

AB  == the aim of the present investigation was to examine the outer-surface microbiota  of the prosthetic connector of frialit-2 implants, and to compare the microbial findings with the peri-implant parameters 2 years after functional loading. in 16 implant-treated patients (55.8 +/- 9.5 years) the outer-surface micro-organisms of the prosthetic connectors were determined in 32 frialit-2 implants. the functional loading time of the prosthetic suprastructures was 24.1 +/- 13.8 months on average. after removal of the implant-supported restoration, microbial  samples were obtained from the outer-surfaces of the frialit-2 prosthetic connector. the microbial plaque samples were specified on cdc-blood agar as percentages of the total cultivable flora. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was semiquantitively determined on tsbv-agar in cfu/ml. the microbial plaque samples were dominated by actinomyces israelii (68.8%), eubacterium lentum (56.3%) and veillonella parvula (43.8%) with proportions ranking between 3.9% (v. parvula) and 11.1% (a. israelii). the most frequently detected gram-negative microorganisms were fusobacterium nucleatum (87.5%), porphyromonas gingivalis (81.3%), and peptostreptococcus micros (68.8%) with enhanced proportions for p. gingivalis (11.4%) and p. micros (11.4%). no statistical significant correlation  could be established between the microbiota present on the outer-surfaces of the  f2-connector and the peri-implant parameters examined. the outer-surface microflora recovered from the implanto-prosthetic-connector of frialit-2 implants reveals a colonization with gram-positive bacteria and potentially harmful gram-negative micro-organisms that were frequently detected, but present at low levels. after 2 years of restorative loading, the outer-surface microbial colonization is compatible with peri-implant soft tissue health.

TI  == isotypic antibody response to plaque anaerobes in periodontal disease.
AB  == background: it has been suggested that locally produced immunoglobulin (ig)a could be more protective than igg and that there could be a relationship between  crevicular fluid-specific iga levels and the onset of periodontal disease. this study was designed to investigate this hypothesis regarding specific immune responses towards 4 plaque anaerobes in gingival crevicular fluid and saliva from patients with periodontopathies and controls. methods: gingival crevicular fluid  (gcf) and whole saliva were collected from 35 adults with periodontitis and 24 periodontally healthy adults (controls). antigens were extracted from actinomyces actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum and used to set up specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) tests to assess iga and igg levels to these microorganisms in the fluids collected. results: the crevicular fluid of periodontitis patients contained significantly higher levels of igg to the 4 microorganisms tested than  that of controls (p < 10(-6) for all comparisons). iga levels to the 4 bacteria were statistically significantly much higher in control crevicular fluid (p < 10(-7) for all comparisons). controls also had statistically significantly higher levels of specific salivary iga than patients (p < 0.02 for all comparisons). conclusions: these data support the potentially protective role of specific iga directed to oral microorganisms involved in the onset and development of periodontal disease.

TI  == stress and the periodontal diseases: effects of catecholamines on the growth of periodontal bacteria in vitro.
AB  == microorganisms possess the ability to recognize hormones within the host and utilize them to adapt to their surroundings. noradrenaline and adrenaline, which  are released during human stress responses, may act as environmental cues to alter the growth of individual organisms within subgingival biofilms. the aims of this study were to modify, for anaerobic culture, existing methodology used in determining microorganism catecholamine responses and to investigate the growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline of 43 microorganisms found within subgingival microbial complexes. we established initial inocula for each strain using anaerobic culture, re-inoculated into a minimal serum-based medium and grown anaerobically at 35 degrees c. we assessed organism growth by optical density (od(600nm)) readings, with test and control cultures performed in triplicate. test cultures were supplemented with 50 microm noradrenaline or 100 microm adrenaline. we observed significant growth effects for supplementation with noradrenaline (20 species responding positively) and adrenaline (27 species  responding positively), with differences in growth response observed within bacterial species and within and between microbial complexes. the most pronounced positive growth effects of noradrenaline were demonstrated in actinomyces naeslundii (+ 49.4%), actinomyces gerenscseriae (+ 57.2%), eikenella corrodens (+ 143.3%) and campylobacter gracilis (+ 79.9%). we also observed inhibitory effects of noradrenaline supplementation for porphyromonas gingivalis (- 11.9%) and bacteroides forsythus (- 22.2%). responses to adrenaline tended to mirror the responses seen with noradrenaline. individual organisms from different microbial  complexes vary in their in vitro growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline. such variation may influence the in vivo composition of the subgingival biofilm in response to stress-induced changes in local catecholamine  levels and play a significant role in the aetiology and pathogenesis of the periodontal diseases.

AB  == persons who smoke display a less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the  experimental gingivitis model as compared with non-smokers. the aim of the present study was to investigate whether this could partly be explained by differences in levels of parotid total secretory iga (s-iga) or parotid s-iga reactive with selected oral microorganisms. parotid saliva samples were obtained  from 11 smoking and 14 non-smoking volunteers, at baseline, after 5 and 14 days of full mouth experimental gingivitis. output levels of total s-iga and of specific s-iga reactive with cell extracts from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces naeslundii, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans were determined in the samples by means of elisa. smokers and non-smokers were found to have similar output levels (microg/min) of total s-iga, and the values did not significantly change during the experimental gingivitis trial. parotid salivary outputs (units/min) of the bacteria-specific s-iga at baseline and at days 5 and 14, were not different between smokers and non-smokers; no changes were observed during the experimental gingivitis trial. the present observations indicate that total s-iga and bacteria-specific s-iga in saliva are not main factors that can explain the less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the experimental gingivitis model in smokers as compared with non-smokers.

AB  == objective: to define the subgingival microbial profiles of adult subjects from a  previously identified rural community of indigenous indians in guatemala, central america. materials and methods: a full-mouth periodontal examination was performed in 114 adult subjects from 45 families. plaque samples were collected from both deep and shallow periodontal pockets and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization was employed to identify 17 species previously associated with periodontitis or health. results: plaque deposits and gingivitis were universal and widespread, and periodontal pocketing > or =5 mm was highly prevalent (84% of subjects). streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 and fusobacterium nucleatum were significantly more prevalent in shallow sites. at the subject level, actinomyces naeslundii and peptostreptococcus micros were significantly more prevalent in periodontally-healthy subjects. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any sample. conclusion: there was no association between periodontal disease status and presence of suspected periodontal pathogens. these latter results conflict somewhat with those from treated populations. however, in this population where extensive plaque deposits  and gingivitis are universal, the presence of putative pathogens may be more reflective of the local environment.

TI  == efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (ii). effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == phosphorylcholine-dependent cross-reactivity between dental plaque bacteria and oxidized low-density lipoproteins.
AB  == antibodies reactive with phosphorylcholine (pc) are ubiquitous in human sera, but the antigens stimulating their production and their function are not clear. previous studies have shown that a significant proportion of dental plaque bacteria contain pc as determined by reactivity with pc-specific mouse myeloma proteins and monoclonal antibodies. additionally, serum antibody concentrations of immunoglobulin (igg) g anti-pc are higher in sera of individuals who have experienced periodontal attachment loss than those who are periodontally healthy. these data implicate the oral microflora as a source of antigen-stimulating anti-pc responses. recent data also indicate that antibodies with specificity for pc are elevated in apoe-deficient mice, a model for studies of athersclerosis, and that such antibodies bound oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ldl) (oxldl) in atherosclerotic plaques. these data prompted the hypothesis that human anti-pc could bind to both oral bacteria and human oxldl, and that these antigens are cross-reactive. we therefore examined the ability of human anti-pc to bind to pc-bearing strains of oral bacteria using enzyme-linked immunosorbent inhibition  assays and by assessment of direct binding of affinity-purified human anti-pc to  pc-bearing actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. our results indicated that pc-bearing strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, haemophilus aphrophilus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans, as well as a strain of streptococcus pneumoniae, absorbed  up to 80% of anti-pc igg antibody from human sera. furthermore, purified anti-pc  bound to a pc-bearing strain of a. actinomycetemcomitans but only poorly to a pc-negative strain. oxldl also absorbed anti-pc from human sera, and oxldl but not ldl reacted with up to 80% of the anti-pc in human sera. furthermore, purified anti-pc bound directly to oxldl but not to ldl. the data indicate that pc-containing antigens on a variety of common oral bacteria are cross-reactive with neoantigens expressed in oxldl. we propose that pc-bearing dental plaque microorganisms may induce an antibody response to pc that could influence the inflammatory response associated with atherosclerosis.

TI  == molecular strategies for fimbrial expression and assembly.
AB  == fimbriae or pili are long, filamentous, multimeric macromolecules found on the bacterial cell surface. bacteria express a diverse array of fimbriae or pili that are involved in bacterial adherence and invasion. fimbriae can be categorized based on their modes of expression and assembly. type i fimbriae and p pili are distributed peritrichously and translocated to the cell surface by a chaperone/usher pathway. type 4 pili are located at the pole of the cell and assembled via the type ii secretion system. curli fimbriae are coiled surface structures assembled by an extracellular nucleation/precipitation pathway. fimbriae of oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria have not been well-studied as compared with the fimbriae of enteric pathogens. oral pathogens,  such as eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis, possess fimbriae that have been implicated in bacterial adhesion and invasion. these fimbriae are potential virulence factors in oral infectious processes. a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. corrodens have type 4-like  fimbriae, whereas p. gingivalis displays a unique type of fimbriae. to date, fimbriae of the oral primary colonizers, actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus parasanguis, represent the only fimbriae characterized for any gram-positive bacteria. the putative major fimbrial subunits, fima and fimp of a. naeslundii and fap1 of s. parasanguis, contain a signal sequence and cell-wall-sorting signal. the presence of extensive dipeptide repeats in fap1 makes it unique among fimbrial molecules. based on experimental data, a nucleation/precipitation pathway is proposed for fimbrial biogenesis of both s. parasanguis and a. naeslundii, although we cannot rule out an alternative covalent linkage model. the model systems described in this review served as a framework for hypotheses for how the known molecular factors of fimbriae on oral bacteria may be expressed and assembled.

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.

TI  == effect of three mouthrinses, containing amine/stannous fluoride, herbal extracts  or emser salt on the growth of oral bacteria--an in vitro study.
AB  == background/aims: clinical studies have shown the efficacy of mouthrinses in reducing plaque accumulation and inflammation of oral tissues. the aim of this in vitro study was to compare the effect of three mouthrinses: meridol, an organic amine/ stannous fluoride solution; parodontax, containing herbal ingredients; and an 0.8 % emser salt solution, on the growth of oral bacteria and dental plaque. methods: growth of actinomyces viscosus t14v, capnocytophaga ochracea 25, c. sputigena 4, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.) y4, and pooled supragingival plaque in the presence of the various mouthrinses, applied to paper discs, was tested in an agar diffusion test. in a second series of tests, the 4 bacterial strains were exposed to the agents for about 3 min to simulate rinsing, then the agent was removed, and the bacteria were inoculated into fresh nutrient  broth. after 48 h bacterial growth was measured in a spectrophotometer and compared with the controls. results: in the agar diffusion test only meridol, the organic amine/stannous fluoride-containing solution, could inhibit bacterial growth, except for a. a. y4. when the bacteria where in contact with the agents for only a few minutes these results were confirmed. neither paradontax nor emser salt inhibited the growth of the bacteria, and a. a. y4 proved to be resistant to all three agents. growth of the other three strains was inhibited by meridol 92-99% (undiluted), 85-96% (1:5) and 83-98% (1:10). conclusions: we conclude that only meridol contains ingredients capable of inhibiting the growth of oral bacteria in vitro. the efficacy of the other two mouthrinses in reducing plaque accumulation in vivo has to be explained by other mechanisms.

TI  == photoactive porphyrin derivative with broad-spectrum activity against oral pathogens in vitro.
AB  == photodynamic therapy (pdt) has historically been used as a means to treat cancerous tumors but has recently been used to kill bacterial cells through the use of targeted photosensitizers. pdt is a potential adjunct to scaling and root  planing in the treatment of periodontal disease. however, the effectiveness of porphyrin derivatives against microorganisms has been limited because some gram-negative bacteria are refractory to photodynamic treatment with these agents. we have designed a porphyrin derivative conjugated to a pentalysine moeity that endows the molecule with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. whereas the porphyrin, chlorin e6, showed in vitro activity against a limited spectrum of bacteria, chlorin e6 conjugated to pentalysine showed in vitro activity against all oral microorganisms tested, including porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, actinomyces viscosus, and the streptococci. potent  antimicrobial activity (>/=5-log-unit reduction in the numbers of cfu per milliliter) was retained in the presence of up to 25% whole sheep blood. the use  of potent, selective agents such as this chlorin e6-pentalysine conjugate to more effectively reduce the pathogenic bacteria in the periodontal pocket may be a significant tool for the treatment of periodontal disease.

TI  == microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). methods: a total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level,  were made at 6 sites per tooth. the counts (levels), % dna probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. significance of  differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: all 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of  supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 actinomyces species. supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts  of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, neisseria mucosa, streptococcus gordonii, capnocytophaga ochracea  and capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. subgingival plaque samples presented  significantly higher counts of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and porphykromonas gingivalis. subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as actinomyces species. suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival  samples were negative for the same species. conclusions: the data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.

TI  == coptidis rhizoma inhibits growth and proteases of oral bacteria.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effect of coptidis rhizoma (cr), a traditional medicinal plant, on oral bacteria. materials and methods: cr extract was prepared by boiling cr in water for 2 h. alkaloids contained in cr extract were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). antibacterial activity of cr extract was estimated from the lowest concentration that did not permit bacterial growth (minimum inhibitory concentration, mic) and the concentrations that inhibited 50% of bacterial proteolytic activity (ic50). results: cr extract inhibited the growth of actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans at mic of 0.031-0.25 mg ml(-1), whereas it had less inhibitory effect (mic: 0.5-2 mg ml(-1)) on the growth of streptococcus and lactobacillus. the major active component of cr extract was berberine (ber), an alkaloid, and its inhibiting specificity to bacterial growth was similar to that of cr extract. cr extract and ber were bacteriostatic at the mics against most of the bacteria, and bacteriocidal at the concentrations higher than the mics. ber inhibited the activities of collagenase from p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusion: cr extract and ber had an inhibitory effect on periodontopathogenic bacteria. these results suggest the possibility of their clinical application for the treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == identification of periodontal disease-associated bacteria in the "plaque-free zone".
AB  == background: subgingival plaque bacteria live within a biofilm covered with glycocalyx, and little is known of the bacterial species associated with biofilm  formation at the bottom of human periodontal pockets, the so-called "plaque-free  zone"(pfz). methods: seventy-seven extracted teeth from 56 patients with severe advanced adult periodontitis were examined. porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella nigrescens, and actinomyces viscosus were examined by scanning immunoelectron microscopic techniques, using both secondary and back-scattered imaging, with rabbit antibodies specific for each bacteria. results: secondary electron images showed  that rods, filaments, and spirochete-shaped bacteria formed small aggregates in the pfz. some of the bacteria were covered with an amorphous film-like structure. by back-scattered electron imaging, positive reactions with anti-p. gingivalis were found in 8 of 13 samples examined, and film-like structures coated several cells of 6 positive samples examined. labeled cells with anti-c. rectus, anti-t.  denticola and anti-p. nigrescens were detected in 3 of 11, 5 of 10, and 1 of 8 samples examined. a. viscosus were found in 6 of 11 of the samples. a. viscosus tended to overlay the amorphous capsula and aggregate. f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans were not detected in any samples examined. conclusions: these findings indicated that p. gingivalis, c. rectus, t. denticola, p. nigrescens, and a. viscosus were present in the pfz, and that some specified bacteria were possibly related to plaque-biofilm formation of subgingival plaque.

TI  == "checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == periodontal findings and systemic antibody responses to oral microorganisms in behcet's disease.
AB  == background: behcet's disease is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology, affecting predominantly the oral mucosa, skin, and eyes. recurrent and painful episodes of oral ulcerations interfere with regular oral hygiene leading to rapid bacterial plaque accumulation. the aims of this study were to evaluate the periodontal status of patients with behcet's disease and determine serum antibody responses to selected oral microorganisms, including major periodontopathogens in these patients. methods: thirty-three patients with behcet's disease and 15 healthy subjects were included in the study. plaque, sulcular bleeding, periodontal index scores, probing depths, and total number of teeth were recorded. serum igg antibody levels to a panel of 13 oral microorganisms were determined. results: significantly higher values for each of the clinical measures were observed in patients with behcet's disease compared to healthy subjects (p <0.0001). antibody levels to selected members of plaque, including actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus  oralis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, and prevotella intermedia were significantly lower in patients with behcet's disease than in controls (p <0.001-0.05). in contrast, these patients exhibited significantly elevated antibody levels to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 compared to controls (p <0.01). conclusions: our data indicate that the patients with behcet's disease generally exhibit clinical findings of established periodontal disease. decreased antibody responses to early colonizers of both supra- and subgingival plaque were observed along with the elevation in antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans. these results suggest that the bacterial plaque ecology and/or immune responses to these microorganisms may be affected in behcet's disease which could lead to changes in the expression of periodontal disease.

TI  == virulence factors of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == a. actinomycetemcomitans has clearly adapted well to its environs; its armamentarium of virulence factors (table 2) ensures its survival in the oral cavity and enables it to promote disease. factors that promote a. actinomycetemcomitans colonization and persistence in the oral cavity include adhesins, bacteriocins, invasins and antibiotic resistance. it can interact with  and adhere to all components of the oral cavity (the tooth surface, other oral bacteria, epithelial cells or the extracellular matrix). the adherence is mediated by a number of distinct adhesins that are elements of the cell surface (outer membrane proteins, vesicles, fimbriae or amorphous material). a. actinomycetemcomitans enhances its chance of colonization by producing actinobacillin, an antibiotic that is active against both streptococci and actinomyces, primary colonizers of the tooth surface. the fact that a. actinomycetemcomitans resistance to tetracyclines, a drug often used in the treatment of periodontal disease, is on the rise is an added weapon. periodontal  pathogens or their pathogenic products must be able to pass through the epithelial cell barrier in order to reach and cause destruction to underlying tissues (the gingiva, cementum, periodontal ligament and alveolar bone). a. actinomycetemcomitans is able to elicit its own uptake into epithelial cells and  its spread to adjacent cells by usurping normal epithelial cell function. a. actinomycetemcomitans may utilize these remarkable mechanisms for host cell infection and migration to deeper tissues. a. actinomycetemcomitans also orchestrates its own survival by elaborating factors that interfere with the host's defense system (such as factors that kill phagocytes and impair lymphocyte activity, inhibit phagocytosis and phagocyte chemotaxis or interfere with antibody production). once the organisms are firmly established in the gingiva, the host responds to the bacterial onslaught, especially to the bacterial lipopolysaccharide, by a marked and continual inflammatory response, which results in the destruction of the periodontal tissues. a. actinomycetemcomitans has at least three individual factors that cause bone resorption (lipopolysaccharide, proteolysis-sensitive factor and groel), as well as a number of activities (collagenase, fibroblast cytotoxin, etc.) that elicit detrimental effects on connective tissue and the extracellular matrix. it is of considerable  interest to know that a. actinomycetemcomitans possesses so many virulence factors but unfortunate that only a few have been extensively studied. if we hope to understand and eradicate this pathogen, it is critical that in-depth investigations into the biochemistry, genetic expression, regulation and mechanisms of action of these factors be initiated.

TI  == the microbiota of periodontal pockets with different depths in therapy-resistant  periodontitis.
AB  == this study presents the composition of the cultivable microbiota colonising periodontal pockets of different depths among 2 patient-groups classified as non-responsive (nr-group; 11 participants) or responsive (r-group; 10 participants) to periodontal treatment. microbiological samples from three types  of pocket (< 4 mm deep a-samples; 4-5 mm b-samples; > 5 mm c-samples) were analysed by cultural methods for putative periodontitis pathogens, microbial groups constituting > or = 5% of the total cultivable flora and opportunistic pathogens. actinomyces naeslundii, a. israelii, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium spp, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, anaerobic streptococci and facultative anaerobic streptococci were most prevalent. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, staphylococcus aureus, enteric rods and yeasts were less prevalent. the periodontitis pathogens bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium spp, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and peptostreptococcus micros constituted together (on average) < or = 23% of the viable counts in the a- and b-samples of  both patient groups and in the c-samples of the r-group. in the c-samples of the  nr-group their mean counts were 45%. correlations were found between smoking habits and the five pathogens in the c-samples and in pooled pocket depth samples. the results show that groups of periodontopathogens should be considered a causal factor in therapy-resistant periodontitis. further, smoking and deep pockets can enhance a shift in the balance of the subgingival microflora predisposing a site to disease and a susceptible host may be the pre-requisite to therapy-resistant periodontitis.

TI  == the importance of fimbriae in the virulence and ecology of some oral bacteria.
AB  == cumulative evidence indicates that bacterial adherence to mucosal and tooth surfaces as well as bacterial coaggregation are essential steps for colonization  of various oral bacterial species. bacterial fimbriae have been shown to play an  important role in the interaction between bacteria and host cells or among bacterial cells. the properties of fimbriae from selected species of oral bacteria are discussed in terms of virulence traits and ecological significance.  among others, porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae have been most extensively studied. the fimbrial structure is composed of 41-kda fimbrillin proteins. dna sequencing of the fimbrillin gene (fima) from nine strains of p. gingivalis suggests intraspecies variation in the structure of fima, while retaining common  immunochemical specificities. p. gingivalis fimbriae exhibit a wide variety of biological activities including immunogenicity, binding to various host proteins, stimulation of cytokine production and promotion of bone resorption, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans also possesses fimbriae; however, little is  known concerning their chemical, genetical, and biological properties. fimbriae of prevotella intermedia are shown to induce hemagglutination reaction, while those of prevotella loescheii are found to cause coaggregation with other bacteria, i.e., actinomyces viscosus and sanguis streptococci. fimbriae from gram-positive oral bacteria such as oral actinomyces and sanguis streptococci are described. these fimbriae may participate in coaggregation, binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite or glycoprotein of the surface layer of oral epithelial cells. taken together, fimbriae are key components in cell-to-surface  and cell-to-cell adherence of oral bacteria and pathogenesis of some oral and systemic diseases.

TI  == microbiological features and crevicular fluid aspartate aminotransferase enzyme activity in early onset periodontitis patients.
AB  == gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) reflects the immune and inflammatory reactions and the specific host-microbe interactions that lead to periodontal diseases. aspartate aminotransferase enzyme (ast) is one of the components of gcf that is released as a result of cell death. in this study, periodontal sites (4 sites/patient) with a probing depth of > or =5 mm in early onset periodontitis (eop) patients were first examined for the ast levels in gcf by the periogard periodontal tissue monitor. to be eligible for the study, each of the patients had at least 1 ast positive site with clinical inflammatory changes (ast+, cic+)  and 1 ast negative site with no or minimum clinical inflammatory changes (ast-, cic-). in 15 eop patients who met the entry criteria, 30 ast+, cic+ sites (1st group) and 19 ast-, cic- sites (2nd group) were evaluated for microbiological variables. certain microbial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia were detected more frequently (p<0.001, p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively) in the 1st group, while gram-positive facultative organisms such as actinomyces species were found more often (p<0.001) in the 2nd group. parallel to the ast levels, the 2nd group had a lower number of total bacteria and proportion of obligate anaerobic and capnophilic micro-organisms than the first group (p<0.05 and p<0.05, respectively). within the scope of this study, ast activity and microbiological data were found in agreement in the examined groups. these findings are encouraging and indicate the need for further studies to evaluate the ability of  the ast test to differentiate the microbial flora of progressing sites and those  that are inflamed, but not progressing.

AB  == the present study primarily aimed at investigating the oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers with established gingivitis and monitoring its composition during experimental gingivitis. secondly, it aimed at examining whether the composition  of the microbiota is associated with different levels of gingival inflammation during this experimental gingivitis trial. for this purpose, 25 non-dental university students with gingivitis were recruited. 11 subjects were smokers and  14 were non-smokers. after achieving gingival health, they entered a 14-day experimental gingivitis trial. plaque and bleeding were assessed before entering  into the study (intake), at day 0, day 5 and at day 14 of the experiment. microbiological samples from mucosal sites and dental plaque (taken at intake, day 0, and day 14) were analysed for the presence of actinomyces species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus species. at day 14 of the experimental period, the level of plaque formation was not different between smokers and non-smokers, but bleeding scores were lower in smokers than in non-smokers (15% and 30% respectively, p=0.01). the change from natural gingivitis to a state of gingival health and a subsequent change from gingival health to experimentally induced gingivitis was accompanied by quantitative alterations in the cultivable microbiota in both groups. changes were most prominent in the transition from gingival health to experimental gingivitis and were found in dental plaque for actinomyces species, c. rectus, f. nucleatum, and p. intermedia. within the group of non-smokers, a distinction was made between subjects with a 'weak' or 'strong' inflammatory response. no relationship with a  single bacterial species could be established which would likely explain the differences in levels of inflammation. it is concluded that differences in response to experimental gingivitis are not caused by major differences in the composition of the oral microbiota.

TI  == antibacterial effects of a bioactive glass paste on oral microorganisms.
AB  == bioactive glasses contain oxides of calcium, sodium, phosphorus, and silicon in a proportion that provides the material with surface activity and concomitantly with the property of forming a strong bond with bone. bioactive glasses have been tested as bone substitutes in different clinical situations. in an aqueous environment, ca2+, na+, po4(3-) , and si4+ are released from the glass, resulting in a rise in ph and in osmotic pressure in its vicinity. since these are factors  that potentially influence the viability of oral microorganisms at the dentogingival margin, we studied the effects of bioactive glass s53p4 on the oral microorganisms actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguis. this was done by incubating each microbe in a suspension, in the presence of bioactive glass s53p4 in powder form. a. naeslundii was found to lose its viability within  10 min under the experimental conditions. a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and s. mutans lost their viability within 60 min. also for s. sanguis a significant loss of viability was seen within 60 min, but it was the only microbe that had any viable cells left after 60 min. thus, in aqueous solutions the powdered bioactive glass s53p4 appears to have a broad antimicrobial effect on microorganisms of both supra- and subgingival plaque. consequently, it could be useful as an ingredient in tooth-care products that may have beneficial effects on oral health both from a cariologic and a periodontal point of view.

TI  == adhesion of periodontal bacteria to titanium, and titanium alloy powders.
AB  == in this study, the adhesion of radioactively labeled actinomyces viscosus (a. viscosus), actinobacillus actinomicetemcomitans (aa) and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) to titanium (ti) and ti-6-al-4v alloy (ti-alloy) coated with albumin or human saliva was investigated. all the tested bacteria displayed greater attachment to ti-alloy than to ti. p. gingivalis exhibited less adhesion  to ti and ti-alloy than did the other bacterial strains. adhesion of a. viscosus  and aa was greatly reduced when ti or ti-alloy were coated with albumin or saliva. p. gingivalis demonstrated a lesser reduction in adhesion to albumin or saliva-coated surfaces. the results show that oral bacteria have different adhesion affinities for ti and ti-alloy and that both albumin and human saliva reduce bacterial adhesion.

TI  == the effect of herbal extracts in an experimental mouthrinse on established plaque and gingivitis.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to establish in vitro the inhibiting effect  of a herbal extract mixture on a selected number of micro-organisms and to test in vivo the effect of a mouthwash containing 6.3 mg/ml herbal extract mixture on  plaque and gingivitis as compared to a minus active control mouthrinse. the herbal extract was a mixture of: juniperus communis (juniper), urtica dioca (nettle), achillaea millefolium (yarrow); 1:1:1. in the study, in-vitro, the effect of pure herbal extract mixture on acid production of streptococcus mutans  was tested and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of the following micro-organisms were tested: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, actynomyces viscosus, actynomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, veillonella parvula. the mic-values for a. viscosus and p. gingivalis  were 100 mg/ml. the mic-values for a. naeslundii and a. actinomycetemcomitans were considerably lower (10 mg/ml). s. mitis was the most susceptible of the tested organisms to the extract with a mic value of 1 mg/ml. s. mutans, c. rectus, v. parvula, and f. nucleatum were not influenced by the extracts. no inhibitory effect of the 6.3 mg/ml herbal extract mixture was observed on the acid production of s. mutans. for the study in-vivo, 45 volunteers were selected  on the basis of having moderate gingival inflammation. as efficacy parameters the plaque index, modified gingival index and angulated bleeding index were assessed. the subjects were randomly divided among 3 experimental groups (2x test and 1 'minus active' control). the participants were requested to rinse with 10 ml of mouthwash twice a day for a period of three months. after 6 weeks and 3 months, the same clinical indices as at baseline were recorded. the results show no difference between the two test groups and the control group. in conclusion, the  results of the present study have shown that the mixture of the 3 herbal extracts, juniperus communis, urtica dioca and achillaea millefolium when used in a mouthrinse has no effect on plaque growth and gingival health.

TI  == microbiota associated with experimental peri-implantitis and periodontitis in adult macaca mulatta monkeys.
AB  == this study examines the microbiota associated with the progression of experimental peri-implantitis and periodontitis induced concurrently in partially edentulous adult monkeys. root-form and plate-form implants with fixed prosthesis in place for at least 12 months and their corresponding opposite molar teeth were ligated for 6 months. the microbiota in plaque around these ligated dental implants and molars were studied at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6 months post-ligation. plaque samples were analyzed by dark-field microscopy and selective and non-selective culture. putative periodontal pathogens were detected as a major component of the microbiota cultured from plaque samples obtained from experimental peri-implantitis sites. overall, the types and relative proportions  of putative periodontal pathogens in plaque associated with ligature-induced peri-implantitis and ligature-induced periodontitis were similar. only levels of  anaerobic actinomyces and spirochetes were significantly different between both sites. spirochete levels were significantly higher at peri-implantitis sites when compared with levels at periodontitis sites after 6 months, and spirochete levels increased significantly between 0 and 6 months post-ligation at implant sites. levels of spirochetes correlated significantly with probing depth and bone loss at peri-implantitis sites. overall, actinomyces levels were higher at periodontitis sites. porphyromonas species were not detected continuously as part of the peri-implantitis microbiota. in conclusion, this study finds that the microbiota associated with the progression of experimental peri-implantitis and periodontitis occurring concurrently in partially edentulous mouths are similar.

TI  == oral food consumption and subgingival microorganisms: subgingival microbiota of gastrostomy tube-fed children and healthy controls.
AB  == this study examined the effect of oral food consumption on the prevalence and levels of subgingival bacteria and yeasts in 20 gastrostomy tube-fed children and 24 healthy controls. microbial identification was carried out using anaerobic culture and 16s rrna-based pcr identification methods. streptococcal and actinomyces species were recovered from 100% and 76% of all subjects and averaged 66% and 11% of total cultivable organisms, respectively. in decreasing order of prevalence, fusobacterium, enteric rods, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga, propionibacterium, yeasts, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in 48% to 2% of the study subjects. the cultivable levels of these species varied widely among subjects. pcr detection showed c. rectus and eikenella corrodens both to occur in 93% of the study subjects and to be the most prevalent putative periodontal pathogens examined. in decreasing order of prevalence, pcr identified treponema denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia, b. forsythus,  and p. gingivalis in 38% to 21% of the subjects studied. tube-fed children and healthy controls exhibited similar subgingival microbial compositions. it appears from this study that oral food consumption is not a major determinant for the establishment of subgingival microbiota in children.

TI  == effect of triclosan on the subgingival microbiota of periodontitis-susceptible subjects.
AB  == the present study evaluated the long-term effect of (i) meticulous self-performed, supragingival plaque control and (ii) the use of a triclosan/copolymer containing dentifrice in adult subjects susceptible to destructive periodontitis. 40 individuals were recruited into the trial. 3-5 years prior to the baseline examination, they had all been treated by nonsurgical means- for advanced periodontal disease. during the subsequent maintenance phase, all subjects had at different time intervals exhibited sites with recurrent periodontitis. at a baseline examination, 6 surfaces per tooth were examined regarding bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth, and probing attachment level. the deepest pocket site in each quadrant (i.e. 4 sites per subject) was selected and samples of the subgingival bacteria were taken. at baseline, all volunteers received detailed information on proper oral hygiene techniques. this  information was repeated on an individual need basis during the course of the subsequent 36-months. no professional subgingival therapy was delivered between the baseline and the 36-month examinations. the subjects were randomly distributed into 2 equal groups of 20 individuals each, 1 test and 1 control group. the members of the test group were supplied with a fluoridated dentifrice  containing triclosan/copolymer (total, colgate), while the controls received a corresponding dentifrice but without triclosan/copolymer. the findings demonstrated that in subjects with advanced and recurrent periodontitis, carefully practiced supragingival plaque control had some effects on the subgingival microbiota, but also that this was insufficient to prevent disease progression. in a corresponding group of subjects, however, who used a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice, the subgingival microbiota was reduced in both quantitative and qualitative terms and recurrent periodontitis was almost entirely prevented.

TI  == comparison of the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy and diseased adults in northern cameroon.
AB  == our study is the 1st report on subgingival microbiota in adult cameronians. the aim was to investigate, using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique, the prevalence of 18 oral species in subgingival plaque samples obtained from sex- and age-matched cameronian adults with and without periodontal destruction.  we also compared cultivation and the affirm dp test with the checkerboard technique in their capability to detect some selected species among the 18. 21 adult periodontitis patients and 21 periodontally healthy subjects were examined  and the results were compared statistically. each periodontitis patient had at least 4 pockets of > or = 6 mm depth, while the healthy subjects had no sites more than 3 mm deep. results of the checkerboard analysis showed that significantly (p < 0.05) more periodontitis patients tested positive for most of  the 18 bacterial species. the gram-positive species actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis, known as microbiota of healthy sites, were detected significantly more frequently in the healthy group. cultivation demonstrated p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum in significantly lower %s of patients as compared  to the checkerboard technique. furthermore, the affirm dp test detected p. gingivalis and b. forsythus in significantly fewer patients than did the checkerboard technique. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 52.3% of the patients by the latter technique while the affirm dp test failed to detect the bacterium in any of the samples. overall, the results of the present study confirm the importance of the screening method and indicate that the prevalences  of the investigated putative periodontal pathogens and beneficial species in the  healthy and diseased adult cameronians were similar to those reported for adults  in the west and in some developing countries.

TI  == beta-lactamase producing bacteria in adult periodontitis.
AB  == in 23 untreated adult periodontitis patients, the occurrence of beta-lactamase producing periodontal bacteria was determined. in addition to non-selective isolation media, selective isolation and growth of beta-lactamase positive subgingival bacterial species was carried out on blood agar plates supplemented with amoxicillin and plates with amoxicillin+clavulanic acid. porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides forsythus and campylobacter rectus isolates from the non-selective medium were tested for beta-lactamase activity by a nitrocefin disk method (dryslide) and by a laboratory chromogenic nitrocefin-based test. isolates from the amoxicillin plates that were absent on the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid plates were identified and tested for beta-lactamase production. based on the non-selective plates, six  of 23 p. intermedia isolates, 2 of 19 b. forsythus isolates and 3 of 23 f. nucleatum isolates were beta-lactamase positive. the beta-lactamase positive species prevotella loescheii, prevotella buccae, prevotella buccalis and actinomyces spp were recovered from the selective amoxicillin plates. beta-lactamase positive subgingival species were recovered from 17 of 23 patients (74%) but usually comprised low proportions of the subgingival microbiota (range  < 0.01-15%). comparison of the dryslide test and the nitrocefin-based laboratory  test revealed full agreement of test results. beta-lactamase activity in whole subgingival plaque was detected in 12 patient samples (52%). it was concluded that beta-lactamase activity in subgingival bacteria in adult periodontitis is a  common feature. however, since the majority of the samples showed only low-level  enzymatic activity, the clinical relevance of this observation with regard to therapy with unprotected enzyme-susceptible beta-lactams is uncertain, though failure on the other hand, is difficult to rule out when a mechanism of resistance is present. the majority of beta-lactamase positive strains was found  among species of the prevotella genus.

TI  == periodontal bacteria colonizing oral mucous membranes in edentulous patients wearing dental implants.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of the microbiota on  the oral mucosal surfaces and in the peri-implant pocket in edentulous subjects with a past history of periodontitis. twenty edentulous subjects wearing dental implants for at least one year and with a history of periodontitis participated in this study. clinical parameters were assessed (plaque, redness, swelling, peri-implant probing depth [pipd], and bleeding on probing) and microbiological samples were taken (oral mucosal surfaces, saliva, plaque, and peri-implant pocket). based on the clinical results, the group as a whole showed healthy peri-implant tissues. a mean pipd of 3.6 mm was found. a statistically significant correlation was found between the pipd and bleeding upon probing, plaque scores, redness, and swelling. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were not detected. the subjects harboring prevotella intermedia showed presence of pipd of > or = 5 mm. all subjects harbored peptostreptococcus spp., fusobacterium spp., and other prevotella species. actinomyces odontolyticus, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, pseudomonas spp., and enterobacteria were detected less frequently. three subjects showed signs of overt soft tissue inflammation. they harbored higher proportions of peptostreptococcus spp. than the other subjects. the results corroborate the suggestion that the primary source of colonization for dental implants in edentulous patients are the oral mucous membranes. the results indicate that the microbiota of subjects wearing dental implants with a past history of periodontitis are composed of bacteria associated with a healthy periodontium or gingivitis. it is suggested that elimination of the subgingival environment by extraction of all natural teeth probably initiates the disappearance of the two periodontal bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis.

TI  == bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  == microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (gtr) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. the purpose of this study  was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). the study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. in each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (p1, p2, m1, m2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). these teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). a 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was  positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with  an external sling suture. with oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of  each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. viscosus, b. melaninogenicus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, s. mutans, s. sanguis, selenomonas sputigena, t. denticola, and t. vincentii) were present. semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (p < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. these results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.

TI  == effect of antibodies on the chain length and growth of streptococcus sobrinus.
AB  == passive immunization has been suggested as a method to prevent colonization of teeth by mutans streptococci. however, the mechanism of action of antibodies, both polyclonal and monoclonal, is not clear. in this study we investigated the effect of polyclonal antibodies (pabs) and a monoclonal antibody (omvu10) on the  chain length and growth of streptococcus sobrinus. during growth in broth s. sobrinus formed significantly longer chains in the presence of pabs in comparison to pre-immune serum (p < 0.01), but pabs did not influence the growth rate of s.  sobrinus in broth. omvu10 did not influence the growth rate nor the chain length. in order to study the effect of the antibodies on adhesion and growth on a surface, s. sobrinus was grown on hydroxyapatite discs in the presence of two other bacteria, streptococcus oralis and actinomyces viscosus. no effect of the antibodies was found on the total cultivable count of the three bacteria after growth on hydroxyapatite discs. however, the morphology of the s. sobrinus microcolonies was different after growth in the presence of both pabs and omvu10. the colonies were less dense and chains of s. sobrinus could be seen using a confocal laser microscope. after growth in the presence of the control antibodies, the colonies were dense and no long chains could be observed. it was  concluded that pabs influenced the chain length, in broth and on hydroxyapatite discs, and the colony morphology of s. sobrinus on hydroxyapatite discs, whereas  omvu10 influenced the colony morphology of s. sobrinus on hydroxyapatite discs.

TI  == clinical, microbiological and immunological profile of healthy, gingivitis and putative active periodontal subjects.
AB  == thirteen periodontally healthy subjects were monitored clinically for 6-12 months. clinical measurements at 6-weekly intervals included duplicate pd measurements, presence of plaque, redness, and bleeding on probing. baseline measurements consisted of 2 visits 1 wk apart. microbial samples were taken from  11 of the subjects who had completed at least 8 months of monitoring. levels of serum antibodies to 12 periodontal species were determined from 10 subjects. standard deviations of replicate pd measurements, computed for each subject, ranged from 0.2-0.3 mm over the monitoring period. plaque and redness increased during monitoring, and showed a weak association with pd change. baseline and follow-up distributions of pd changes indicated that changes of > 1.5 mm could reasonably be considered to represent active sites. five subjects demonstrated at least 1 site deepening by 1.5 mm over the period monitored, and these were considered putative active subjects. sites from 2 subjects showed pd increases in the 6 wk just before sampling, and these were considered to represent active sites. species associated with putative active subjects included actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, selenomonas noxia and prevotella nigrescens. streptococcus sanguis, s. gordonii and peptostreptococcus micros were associated  with inactive subjects. s. gordonii and s. oralis were associated with health, whereas p. nigrescens was associated with gingivitis. elevated serum antibodies were detected to a. actinomycetemcomitans in 4 subjects. the predominant microbiota of putative active subjects included some species previously associated with gingivitis, and some species previously associated with progressing periodontitis.

TI  == inhibition of neutrophil and monocyte defensive functions by nicotine.
AB  == to learn more about the effects of smokeless tobacco on the defensive functions of neutrophils, we studied the influence of nicotine on these cells in vitro, looking at their bactericidal activity against oral pathogens, and at their ability to produce microbicidal reactive oxygen species (oxygen radicals). exposure of human blood neutrophils to nicotine (0.01% to 0.1%) inhibited their ability to kill actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and fusobacterium nucleatum. although these concentrations of nicotine are high, such concentrations are relevant to phagocytes in the gingival sulcus, because smokeless tobacco contains 0.5% to 3.5% nicotine by dry weight. nicotine had no such inhibitory effect when the killing assay was performed in an anaerobic environment, implying that nicotine preferentially affected oxygen-dependent killing mechanisms. to further investigate the effects of nicotine on production  of oxygen radicals, neutrophils were primed with lipopolysaccharide and triggered with f-met-leu-phe or phorbol ester in the presence of nicotine. nicotine inhibited production of superoxide anion (measured by reduction of cytochrome c)  and hydrogen peroxide (measured by oxidation of phenol red). nicotine inhibition  of superoxide production was reversible by washing away the nicotine. by observing that nicotine inhibited the reduction of cytochrome c by reagent potassium superoxide, we determined that nicotine directly absorbed superoxide. in addition, by examining nicotine inhibition of the uptake of oxygen by neutrophils, we determined that nicotine also interfered with the production of oxygen radicals by these cells. nicotine also inhibited production of superoxide  and interleukin-1 beta by monocytes. nicotine did not affect the viability of neutrophils and monocytes, as determined by their ability to exclude trypan blue  dye. inhibition of the aerobic antimicrobial functions of neutrophils and monocytes by nicotine may alter the microbial ecology of the oral cavity, and this might be one mechanism by which nicotine compromises the oral health of users of tobacco products.

TI  == cell envelope and cell wall immunization of macaca fascicularis: effect on the progression of ligature-induced periodontitis.
AB  == the nonhuman primate, macaca fascicularis, was used to study the role of immunization with selected members of the periodontopathic microbiota in the longitudinal progression of ligature-induced periodontitis. animals were immunized with cell envelope antigens prepared from porphyromonas gingivalis and  prevotella intermedia, and a mixture prepared from fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and actinomyces viscosus. serum immunoglobulin g (igg), igm and iga isotype antibodies increased significantly in all immunization groups and were specific for each of the immunogens. p. gingivalis and p. intermedia immunization resulted in a stabilization of the proportions of these species throughout most of the experiment. the high p. gingivalis antibody titer resulted in low p. gingivalis numbers being recovered. p. gingivalis immunization, while lowering recoverable viable p. gingivalis, resulted in significantly increased levels of prevotella loescheii, prevotella buccae, bacteroides macacae and prevotella melaninogenica compared with preligation and preimmunization levels. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp. and eikenella spp. remained at preligation levels postimmunization. campylobacter spp. increased significantly during the course of the experiment in all groups, whereas the levels of fusobacterium spp. decreased. plaque indices and bleeding on probing showed significant increases in all groups following ligation, with the placebo group showing the greatest increase. pocket depth measurements revealed that , whereas the placebo animals showed an approximate 5% increase, the p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups showed nearly a 20% increase in pocket depth.  attachment level measurements showed significantly greater attachment loss in the p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups, and the f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus immunization appeared to prevent significant changes in pocket depth/attachment level loss. radiographic measurement of bone loss by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis revealed that the placebo group lost bone throughout the experiment. p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups showed an exacerbated loss of bone density and the group immunized with f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus exhibited significantly lower amounts of bone loss when analyzed by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis, compared with the other immunized groups. although immunization with p. gingivalis and p.  intermedia cell envelope antigens had an effect on their emergence in the complex microbiota of the developing periodontal pocket, this immunization also resulted  in greater bone loss than immunization with f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus, suggesting that, whereas selective members of the putative periodontopathic microbiota may play a direct role in periodontal tissue destruction, the complexity of the subgingival microbiota dictates that considerable scrutiny is required to select useful immunogens that can elicit functional protection from periodontal tissue destruction induced by oral microorganisms that already colonize or infect the host.

TI  == microbial alterations in supragingival dental plaque in response to a triclosan-containing dentifrice.
AB  == a total of 325 subjects were entered into a double-blind, stratified 2-treatment  clinical study that examined the effects of a dentifrice containing 0.3% triclosan, 2% gantrez copolymer and 0.243% sodium fluoride on supragingival dental plaque and gingivitis. a subset of 159 subjects including 72 men and 87 women participated in the microbiological component of this study, which was designed to detect shifts in supragingival bacterial species in response to triclosan. subjects were divided into two groups: one performed normal oral hygiene with the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice and a control group used a placebo dentifrice without triclosan. at baseline, 3 and 6 months during treatment and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks post-treatment, supragingival dental plaque was collected from the buccal and lingual surfaces of the 4 first molar teeth and assayed for: 1) bacterial morphotypes by phase-contrast microscopy; 2)  select bacterial groups and bacterial species by culture; and 3) target periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia by immunofluorescence microscopy. there were few statistically significant differences between treatment groups in any of the 90 microbiological parameters  measured at the 7 different time points. the control group demonstrated significantly higher levels of cultivable neisseria and higher proportions at the 3-month treatment period of p. gingivalis-infected subjects and mean cells. after 6 months of treatment, the triclosan group demonstrated higher levels of fusiforms. analysis of triclosan resistance data failed to detect a shift towards increased proportions of bacteria resistant to triclosan, and both treatment groups demonstrated triclosan-resistant strains, predominantly veillonella dispar. this study confirms the microbiological safety of triclosan-containing dentifrices and suggests that continued use can be associated with beneficial alterations in the bacterial composition of supragingival dental plaque.

TI  == oral microbiota in subjects with a weak or strong response in experimental gingivitis.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to examine the composition of the oral microbiota in subjects who had previously demonstrated to develop either a weak or strong response to experimental gingivitis. for this study, subjects were selected from a pool of 25 individuals who had participated twice in an experimental gingivitis trial. out of these 25 panellists, 6 subjects were selected who had developed 2x a weak gingival inflammatory response and 7 subjects who had developed 2x a strong gingival inflammatory response. approximately 9 months after the 2nd experimental gingivitis trial, we evaluated  the clinical condition and the prevalence of a panel of selected oral micro-organisms in these subjects. the subjects were clinically examined for the  presence of plaque, bleeding, pocket depth and loss of attachment. for the microbiological evaluation, samples were taken from the mucous membranes, subgingival sites and saliva. samples were analyzed for the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, actinomyces spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, spirochaetes and motile rods. clinical evaluation showed that most subjects had a relatively healthy periodontal condition. no clinically  significant differences could be detected between the weak and strong responding  groups. the microbial evaluation showed absence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and p. micros in all subjects in either group. analysis of the microbial data for the weak and strong responding group showed no differences between the groups.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == periodontopathogens in elderly chinese with different periodontal disease experience.
AB  == if an etiological relationship exists between destructive periodontal disease and putative periodontopathogens, they would be expected to have a very low prevalence in periodontally healthy elderly persons. to test this hypothesis, 2 subgroups of elderly, rural chinese (a periodontally "best" and a "worst" group,  each comprising 15 persons) were identified in 1990 from a cohort aged 55-69 years, examined in 1984. assessment of changes in periodontal status over the 6-year period were possible by comparing detailed clinical recordings performed by the same examinator. subgingival microbial samples were taken at the mesial aspects of an upper central incisor and a lower canine and examined for the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia group, prevotella melaninogenica group, capnocytophaga, selenomonas, campylobacter rectus as well as predominant streptococcus and actinomyces species. during the 6 years prior to microbiological sampling, persons in the "best" group had lost an average of 1.21 +/- 0.48 mm attachment, while persons in the "worst" group had lost an average of 1.60 +/- 0.94 mm. the latter group had lost 53.3 teeth, predominantly for periodontal reasons, in contrast to 1.8 teeth lost in the "best" group. "best" persons did not differ from "worst" persons with respect to the occurrence of the putative periopathogens, total viable count, and total streptococcal and actinomyces recovery. similarly, sites which had experienced an attachment loss > or = 2 mm during the 6-year period did not differ microbiologically from sites with less attachment loss. it is concluded that subgingival microbial characterization does not allow for a distinction between elderly individuals with markedly different periodontal disease experiences.

TI  == adherence of microorganisms to rat salivary pellicles.
AB  == numerous studies, using models to mimic the formation of the acquired pellicle, have concentrated on human saliva-coated hydroxyapatite; in contrast, although the rat is frequently used as an animal model, the information concerning the formation of pellicles from rat saliva is sparse. we compared the ability of streptococcus and actinomyces species to adhere to hydroxyapatite coated by rat saliva (rsha) and human saliva (sha). we also explored the influence of glucan synthesized in situ on the adherence of organisms. we show that each strain of organism has a distinct binding pattern, which was essentially the same with surfaces coated with either rat or human saliva. dissolved rsha beads revealed a  major protein band (35-49 kd), identified as glutamine/glutamic-acid-rich protein; acidic proline-rich protein (31-45 kd and alpha-amylase (66 kd) were also identified. overall, these in vitro data strongly suggest that the principles of bacterial adhesion to rsha are similar to those observed with sha.

TI  == predominant microflora of severe, moderate and minimal periodontal lesions in young adults with rapidly progressive periodontitis.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to study the microflora of severe, moderate and minimal periodontal lesions, in young adults with rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp). subgingival plaque samples were taken from 142 periodontal lesions in 10 young adults aging 25 to 35 years. the examination of the subgingival microflora indicated that certain species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and campylobacter species were found to be predominant in  severe periodontal lesions. b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, f. nucleatum, capnocytophaga ochracea, were predominant in medium lesions while streptococcus species and actinomyces species, c. ochracea, haemophilus segnis and veillonella parvula, were found in higher levels in minimal periodontal lesions.

TI  == effect of proteolytic enzymes on the lysis and growth of oral bacteria.
AB  == previous studies have shown increased levels of proteolytic enzymes in affected periodontal sites. the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of proteolytic environments on the lysis and growth of selected oral bacteria associated with either healthy or diseased periodontal sites. the effect of trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase k on cell lysis was determined following  incubation with bacteria, whereas the effect of the same proteolytic enzymes on bacterial growth was tested using a disc-plate technique. overall, gram-positive  bacteria appeared to be more resistant to lysis than gram-negative bacteria. the  most susceptible bacteria were actinomyces spp., eubacterium saburreum, prevotella intermedia, capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loescheii, treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the disc-plate procedure indicated that the growth of actinomyces spp., e. saburreum, c. ochracea, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, porphyromonas gingivalis and t. denticola were the most affected, more particularly by chymotrypsin and proteinase k. interestingly, the growth of f. nucleatum was rather stimulated by proteolytic enzymes. the observations reported in this investigation indicate that specific and general proteolytic activities have the ability to lyse some oral bacterial species and to interfere with their  growth. it is suggested that such effects could represent new mechanisms by which the bacterial ecology of subgingival sites may be affected.

TI  == adherence of oral microorganisms to guided tissue membranes: an in vitro study.
AB  == microorganisms can adhere and colonize on an exposed guided tissue regeneration (gtr) membrane thus developing a nidus of infection. the purpose of this study was to compare early bacterial adhesion to three different gtr membranes. expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, polyglactin 910, and collagen were used as the  test membranes. in part i of this study 15 different oral microbes were used to compare their relative ability to adhere to the membranes. six of the most strongly adherent bacteria (actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and selenomonas sputigena) were selected for part ii of  this study. the membranes were placed in tubes containing broth cultures containing identical concentrations (1 x 10(8) cells/ml) of these bacteria at 37  degrees c. membranes were placed in tubes of media without bacteria as controls.  at 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours, the bacterial cultures were decanted and the membranes in the tubes were agitated gently in reduced transfer fluid (rtf) 4 times to remove non-adherent bacteria. each tube was then sonicated for 30 seconds in 10 ml rtf to detach adherent bacteria. the detached adherent bacteria were counted using a petroff-hausser chamber. data were analyzed by using the sas program. analysis of variance was used to test for differences between multiple means. results showed s. mutans had the strongest attachment to the collagen membrane at 4 and 6 hours. selenomonas sputigena had the lowest adherence capability to all test membranes. polyglactin 910 had significantly (p < 0.05) lower s. mutants adherence than either the eptfe or the collagen membrane at 4 and 6 hours.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == relationship between salivary blood group antigens, microbial flora and periodontal condition in young adults.
AB  == to investigate a possible role for salivary blood-group antigens in the relative  frequencies of selected periodontal pathogens and commensal oral micro-organisms, we studied the clinical and microbiological condition in young adults with or without blood group reactive substances in saliva (secretors or non-secretors respectively). clinical measurements were recorded at the ramfjord teeth in 81 1st-year dental students. in addition, presence of interproximal loss of attachment (la) was assessed at sites with a pocket depth of > or = 4 mm. microbiological samples were taken from one of the ramfjord teeth (site without interproximal la), from interproximal sites of > or = 4 mm in conjunction with la, and from the saliva. the samples were analyzed for the presence of actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. clinically, no statistically significant differences were found in the periodontal status between secretors (78% of our population) and non-secretors. furthermore, the occurrence of the monitored micro-organisms was not correlated to the secretor status. it is concluded that bacterial colonization with the micro-organisms tested in this study, apparently occurred independent of secretor status. among the periodontal  pathogens, only p. intermedia was more frequently recovered from the saliva of subjects with interproximal la (49%) than in those without (33%; p = 0.03). this  finding was irrespective of the secretor status. therefore, p. intermedia may be  an important micro-organism in relation to the onset of periodontal destruction in young adults.

TI  == antiseptic mouthrinse-induced microbial cell surface alterations.
AB  == this study determined the effect of an essential oil-containing mouthrinse, listerine antiseptic, on microbial cell surface morphology using scanning electron microscopy. twenty-four hour cultures of c. albicans, a. viscosus, s. sanguis, f. nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were harvested and washed in  buffer. triplicate samples were overlaid on poly-l-lysine coated coverslips, immersed in either listerine or buffer for 30 seconds, fixed in glutaraldehyde followed by post-fixing in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated, and embedded in peldri ii. exposure of the microorganisms to listerine antiseptic for 30 seconds  resulted in distinct morphological alterations of cell surfaces suggestive of loss of cell surface integrity. the extent of alteration varied among the structurally different species; cell surface roughening was mild in s. sanguis but extensive in the other microorganisms which developed distinct surface blebs  and other abnormalities after the 30-second exposure. these results suggest that  a brief exposure to listerine produces significant morphological changes which may be associated with cell death and may help explain the alteration of surface-associated activities demonstrated in previous studies.

TI  == the antimicrobial activity of prevention mouthrinse.
AB  == prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. to determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. a spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, serratia  marcescens and candida albicans. microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. mic determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to prevention mouthrinse, with mics ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold  dilutions. bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. brief (5-minute) exposure of s. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. under the constraints of this type of study, prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. we support the notion that prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. a 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.

TI  == characterization of hemolytic bacteria in subgingival plaque.
AB  == three-quarters of the patients with periodontal diseases surveyed in this study had one or more distinct types of hemolytic bacteria in their subgingival plaque. twelve different species of bacteria were identified, belonging to five genera (actinomyces, streptococcus, staphylococcus, prevotella, and actinobacillus). nine hemolytic isolates, consisting of four prevotella denticola strains, two actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 strains, and one each of p. melaninogenica,  streptococcus constellatus, and a. naeslundii genospecies 1 strains were characterized. incorporation of pronase into blood agar medium inhibited hemolysis by all of the isolates, suggesting a proteinaceous component for each of their hemolysins. with one exception, hemolysin production appeared to be regulated by the concentration of environmental iron: exogenous hemin was found to inhibit hemolysin production, and the iron scavenging compound, 2,2'- dipyridyl, was found to promote hemolysin production by all of the strains except for the s. constellatus isolate. genomic libraries of each of the hemolytic plaque isolates were prepared in escherichia coli using pbr322. hemolytic clones  were isolated on blood agar medium containing ampicillin at frequencies ranging from 1-6.7 x 10(-4). extensive restriction mapping revealed regions of homology in the case of clones derived from three p. denticola strains isolated from the same subjects. two of the p. denticola-derived clones were virtually identical throughout the entrety of their > 5 kb inserts. the clone derived from the third  strain showed good homology to the other two within a 1.3 kb region, but the flanking dna showed no homology even though all three p. denticola isolates were  shown to be clonally related by ribotyping.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey is one of several non-human primate (nhp) models for periodontal disease. this report presents the bacteriology of the gingival sulci in m. mulatta monkeys. three sub-gingival sites (maxillary right central incisor, the disto-buccal of the mandibular left second molar and mesio-buccal of the mandibular right second molar) of 9 monkeys were evaluated clinically before scaling and 7 days after scaling. plaque samples were obtained  from sub-gingival sites before clinical examination and studied bacteriologically by dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and by primary phenotypic characterizations of culture isolates. several gingival sites presented with mild gingival inflammation. anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic  bacteria were the predominant flora colonizing the gingival sulci. the major microbial groups were haemophilus species (100% of sites; percentage of total anaerobic count (tac): 21-51), peptostreptococcus micros (89%, 7.5-29.5), actinomyces sp. (85%, 7-27), fusobacterium nucleatum (90%, 5-8), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (73%, 1.3-12), black-pigmented anaerobic rods (bpar) (80%,  0.6-6.5) and oral streptococci (80%, 0.2-1.0). microbial groups detected less often were wolinella sp. (66%, 0-2.6), capnocytophaga sp. (30%), eikenella corrodens (4.7%, 0), campylobacter sp. (28%, 0-0.1) and spirochetes (4.7%, 0-0.07). seven days after gingival sites were scaled, the plaque score and indices for gingival inflammation declined significantly. the gingival flora after scaling were characterized by lower proportions of the actinomyces sp., p.  micros and bpar; and increased proportions of the oral streptococci, relative to  pre-scaling levels.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == mutans streptococci have been strongly implicated in the initiation of dental caries on coronal surfaces. their role in development of root-surface caries is less clear. the etiologic agents of both types of dental caries are likely to elicit systemic immune responses. the objective of the present study, therefore,  was to study the association of clinical variables of disease with humoral igg antibodies to nine oral micro-organisms in 314 adult subjects, aged 45-65 years,  who were at risk for root-surface caries. antibody activity to streptococcus mutans strain ingbritt, s. mutans/s. sobrinus gtfs, s. faecalis strain 19433, actinomyces viscosus strain wvu 626, actinomyces naeslundii strain 12, lactobacillus casei, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strain y4, porphyromonas gingivalis strain 381, eikenella corrodens strain 1073, and wolinella recta strain 371 was measured by elisa. pearson correlation coefficients among log10 antibody levels within subjects revealed marked positive correlations among subgingival bacteria, generally weak positive correlations among supragingival micro-organisms, and no correlations between elements of the  supragingival battery with the subgingival battery. igg antibody levels to mutans streptococcal antigens were significantly correlated with subject dmf scores (r = 0.23; p less than 0.0001). no significant correlation was seen between dmf scores and antibody to any other supragingival micro-organism tested. further relationships between levels of s. mutans antibody and individual clinical variables were analyzed by step-wise multiple linear regression, resulting in a model that was highly significant (p = 0.0001), with an r2 = 0.14. numbers of missing teeth, coronal caries, root-surface caries, and root-surface restorations were each positively associated with antibody levels to mutans streptococci.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == microbial etiology of periodontal diseases. where are we? where are we going?
AB  == many studies indicate a strong association of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans with localized juvenile periodontitis. species associated with adult periodontitis include bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and wolinella recta. capnocytophaga species may be important in pubertal gingivitis. an unnamed spirochete related to treponema pallidum has been identified in acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis lesions. species isolated from prepubertal periodontitis, peri-implantitis, pericoronitis, and human immunodeficiency virus gingivitis and  periodontitis are similar to those isolated from periodontal and gingival infections. species identification in combination with clinical characteristics facilitates periodontal diagnosis. dna probes, immunoassays, and benzoyl-arginine naphthylamide reactivity methods can be used to indicate putative pathogens in plaque samples. microbial identification aids in antibiotic selection and planning a treatment regimen.

TI  == antibacterial activity of dental implant metals.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate the specific in vitro antibacterial effect of seven dental implant metals on oral bacteria which have often been identified in failing implants. the metals chosen for evaluation were titanium, chromium, cobalt, aluminum, iron, gold, and vanadium. these metals were selected  because they are contained in many commonly used dental implants. the bacteria selected for this study included isolates of porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaniogenica, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces naeslundii, and actinomyces viscosus. sets of tubes containing either supplemented trypticase soy broth, brain-heart infusion-yeast extract, or brain-heart infusion-yeast extract with 5  percent defibrinated rabbit blood were aseptically prepared with doubling dilutions of the seven metals starting at an initial concentration of 500 micrograms/ml and terminating at 0 microgram/ml. cultures of each organism were inoculated into each set of broth tubes containing all concentrations of metals.  tubes were incubated either anaerobically or in an atmosphere of 5 percent carbon dioxide for 48 hours at 35 degrees c and then assayed for atp content which was proportional to the viable cellular biomass. the results showed that, although being bacteria and concentration dependent, all seven metals suppressed the growth of each organism. the rank order of antibacterial activity expressed by dental implant metals was gold > titanium > cobalt > vanadium > aluminum > chromium > iron.
