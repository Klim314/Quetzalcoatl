TI  == analysis of bacterial communities of traditional fermented west african cereal foods using culture independent methods.
AB  == in this study, the microbial composition of kunu-zaki and ogi, two popular foods  in nigeria produced after natural, uncontrolled fermentation of cereals, was assessed by culture-independent molecular profiling methods. in particular, pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and construction of 16s rrna gene clone libraries revealed the presence of diverse bacterial communities. dna sequencing of the highly variable v3 region of the 16s rrna genes obtained from pcr-dgge fingerprints identified species related to weissella confusa, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus amylolyticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bacillus spp. and lactococcus lactis spp lactis from food samples obtained from northern and southern geographical locations. a more comprehensive analysis of 272 full-length 16s rrna gene inserts revealed that 70% of them were assigned to the lactobacillaceae family and 19% to the streptococcaceae family. interestingly, sequences associated with a particular food type were also identified. for example, l. plantarum, l. pantheris and l. vaccinostercus were found in ogi but not in kunu-zaki while w. confusa, streptococcus lutetiensis and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus were  found in kunu-zaki but not in ogi. phylotypes corresponding to potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as clostridium perfringens and bacillus cereus were also detected highlighting the need for controlled fermentation processes.

TI  == heat resistance of bacillus cereus, salmonella typhimurium and lactobacillus delbrueckii in relation to ph and ethanol.
AB  == the aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of ethanol alone and in combination with low ph on the heat resistance of specific bacteria. the bacteria chosen are representative of heat resistant and heat sensitive pathogens (bacillus cereus and salmonella typhimurium) and of relatively heat resistant spoilage microorganisms (lactobacillus delbrueckii). the chosen bacteria were treated at different temperatures ranging between 70 and 97 degrees c for b. cereus, 48 and 54 degrees c for s. typhimurium and 44 and 60 degrees c for l. delbrueckii, in media of different ph (3, 5 and 7) and ethanol content (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10%). both factors proved to be very effective in reducing the heat resistance of the bacteria examined in this work. at ph 7, an increase in ethanol content up to 10% caused d values to decrease by up to 100-fold (s. typhimurium). a drop from ph 7 to ph 3 also caused up to a 100-fold reduction in the d values (s. typhimurium). for b. cereus the regression analysis of the log10 of the d value in relation to temperature, ph and ethanol content was used to produce a second order polynomial equation. the z values increased at decreasing ph and cells were more sensitive to ethanol at lower ph. for s. typhimurium the polynomial equation produced to describe the relationship between log10 of the d  values and temperature and ethanol content was also a second order equation indicating that the relationship between z values and ethanol was non-linear. for l. delbrueckii, z values were independent of the ethanol content of the heating medium. acid tolerance at 25 and 37 degrees c (l. delbrueckii and s. typhimurium) and acid adaptation (s. typhimurium) were also tested. l. delbrueckii was more ethanol and ph tolerant than s. typhimurium at heat treatment temperatures whilst s. typhimurium was more acid tolerant than l. delbrueckii at incubation temperatures (25 and 37 degrees c). acid adaptation increased the tolerance of s. typhimurium to low ph at 25 degrees c but failed to improve its thermal resistance at 48 degrees c. in all bacteria used, the effects of ph and ethanol were more evident at lower treatment temperatures and therefore their significance becomes greater in view of reduced thermal processing and/or changes in product formulation.

TI  == production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  == a total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. for detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. lactobacillus sake lb790, listeria monocytogenes li6, staphylococcus aureus st44 and escherichia coli nrrl b-3704 were used as indicator organisms. strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against clostridium perfringens 4ttk, clostridium botulinum type a. 7948,  bacillus cereus nrrl b-3711, micrococcus luteus nrrl b-4376 and yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following:  19 lactobacillus plantarum, 4 l. curvatus, 4 pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 p. acidilactici, 2 l. pentosus, 2 l. sake, 1 l. delbrueckii, 1 l. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified lactobacillus spp. p. pentosaceus 416, p. acidilactici 413, 419 and  446, l. curvatus 348, l. plantarum 452 and 495, and lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.

TI  == detection, identification and characterization of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria from retail food products.
AB  == forty bacteriocin-producing (bac+) lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from  food samples purchased from retail supermarkets and local farms. of the 40 bac+ isolates, 18 were isolated from 85 food samples by enrichment (21% isolation rate) whereas eight were obtained from 63 samples by direct plating (13% isolation rate). by direct plating, bac+ lab were detected at levels up to 2.4 x  10(5) cfu/g in ready-to-eat meats. the bac+ isolates were identified by carbohydrate fermentation patterns, sds-page protein patterns, and other biochemical characteristics; sds-page proved invaluable in identifying strains that could not be identified by other means. differential inhibitory spectra against indicator microorganisms assisted in the identification of 19 unique bac+ isolates. bac+ lab included enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus curvatus, lb. delbrueckii, lb. plantarum, lactococcus lactis, and pediococcus acidilactici. lb. curvatus (four strains) and lc. lactis (nine strains) were the only isolates inhibitory to foodborne pathogens including listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and staphylococcus aureus. some lc. lactis isolates inhibited as many as nine gram-positive genera. lb. curvatus fs47 and fs65 grew to high cell densities and produced bacteriocin at 6 degrees c; however, lc. lactis fs56 produced greater levels of bacteriocin at lower cell densities. the high incidence of bac+ lab detected in retail foods indicates that the public is consuming a wide variety of bac+ lab that occur as natural contaminants. these data suggest a greater role for bacteriocins as biopreservatives in food.

TI  == organization and nucleotide sequence of the glutamine synthetase (glna) gene from lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.
AB  == a 3.3-kb bamhi fragment of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus dna was cloned and sequenced. it complements an escherichia coli glna deletion strain and hybridizes strongly to a dna containing the bacillus subtilis glna gene. dna sequence analysis of the l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus dna showed it to contain the glna gene encoding class i glutamine synthetase, as judged by extensive homology with other prokaryotic glna genes. the sequence suggests that  the enzyme encoded in this gene is not controlled by adenylylation. based on a comparison of glutamine synthetase sequences, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus is much closer to gram-positive eubacteria, especially clostridium acetobutylicum, than to gram-negative eubacteria and archaebacteria. the fragment contains another open reading frame encoding a protein of unknown function consisting of 306 amino acids (orf306), which is also present upstream of glna of bacillus cereus. in b. cereus, a repressor gene, glnr, is found between the open reading frame and glna. two proteins encoded by the l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus gene were identified by the maxicell method; the sizes of these proteins are consistent with those of the open reading frames of orf306 and glna. the lack of  a glnr gene in the l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus dna in this position may indicate a gene rearrangement or a different mechanism of glna gene expression.
