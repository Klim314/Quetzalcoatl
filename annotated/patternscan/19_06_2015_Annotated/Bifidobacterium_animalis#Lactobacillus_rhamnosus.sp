TI  == immunomodulatory effects of probiotic supplementation in schizophrenia patients:  a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == although peripheral immune system abnormalities have been linked to schizophrenia pathophysiology, standard antipsychotic drugs show limited immunological effects. thus, more effective treatment approaches are required. probiotics are microorganisms that modulate the immune response of the host and, therefore, may  be beneficial to schizophrenia patients. the aim of this study was to examine the possible immunomodulatory effects of probiotic supplementation in chronic schizophrenia patients. the concentrations of 47 immune-related serum proteins were measured using multiplexed immunoassays in samples collected from patients before and after 14 weeks of adjuvant treatment with probiotics (lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis strain bb12; n = 31) or placebo (n = 27). probiotic add-on treatment significantly reduced levels  of von willebrand factor (vwf) and increased levels of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (mcp-1), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf), rantes, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta (mip-1) beta with borderline significance  (p </= 0.08). in silico pathway analysis revealed that probiotic-induced alterations are related to regulation of immune and intestinal epithelial cells through the il-17 family of cytokines. we hypothesize that supplementation of probiotics to schizophrenia patients may improve control of gastrointestinal leakage.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == effect of sublethal preculturing on the survival of probiotics and metabolite formation in set-yoghurt.
AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of preculturing of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb12 under  sublethal stress conditions on their survival and metabolite formation in set-yoghurt. prior to co-cultivation with yoghurt starters in milk, the two probiotic strains were precultured under sublethal stress conditions (combinations of elevated nacl and low ph) in a batch fermentor. the activity of  sublethally precultured probiotics was evaluated during fermentation and refrigerated storage by monitoring bacterial population dynamics, milk acidification and changes in volatile and non-volatile metabolite profiles of set-yoghurt. the results demonstrated adaptive stress responses of the two probiotic strains resulting in their viability improvement without adverse influence on milk acidification. a complementary metabolomic approach using spme-gc/ms and (1)h-nmr resulted in the identification of 35 volatiles and 43 non-volatile polar metabolites, respectively. principal component analysis revealed substantial impact of the activity of sublethally precultured probiotics on metabolite formation demonstrated by distinctive volatile and non-volatile metabolite profiles of set-yoghurt. changes in relative abundance of various aroma compounds suggest that incorporation of stress-adapted probiotics considerably influences the organoleptic quality of product. this study provides  new information on the application of stress-adapted probiotics in an actual food-carrier environment.

TI  == does maternal perinatal probiotic supplementation alter the intestinal microbiota of mother and child? a randomized controlled trial.
AB  == objectives: maternal probiotic supplementation has been shown to prevent the development of atopic dermatitis (ad) in their offspring. we aimed to investigate whether probiotics in pregnant and breastfeeding mothers altered the colonization pattern and the diversity of the mothers' and children's intestinal microbiota. methods: in a randomized, double-blind trial, women received probiotic milk or placebo from 36 weeks of gestation until 3 months postnatally whilst breastfeeding. the probiotic milk contained lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), l.  acidophilus la-5 and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12. stool samples  were collected from the mothers at 30 to 36 weeks gestation and 3 months after birth, and from the child at age 10 days, 3 months, 1 year and 2 years, and bacteria were analysed by quantitative pcr. additionally, stool samples from 3 months old and 2 years old children were characterized using 16s rrna gene deep sequencing to estimate the bacterial classes and genera, and the alpha and beta diversity. results: three months after birth, both the prevalence and the relative abundance of the administered probiotic bacteria were significantly increased among the mothers in the probiotic group compared to the placebo group. only the lgg bacteria colonized the children at 10 days and at 3 months of age. there were no significant differences in the abundance of the administered probiotic bacteria between the groups at 1 and 2 years of age. for the bacterial  classes and genera, and alpha and beta diversity there were no significant differences between the groups. conclusions: different probiotic bacteria seem to have different ability to transfer from the mother to the child. we found no evidence that the probiotics altered the microbial composition or alpha and beta  diversity of the children.

TI  == differential effects of two probiotics on the risks of eczema and atopy associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms to toll-like receptors.
AB  == background: there is strong evidence to support a genetic predisposition to eczema and more recently studies have suggested that probiotics might be used to  prevent eczema by modifying the expression of putative allergy-associated genes.  the aim of this present study was to investigate whether two probiotics, lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 (hn001) and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis  hn019 (hn019), can modify the known genetic predisposition to eczema conferred by genetic variation in the toll-like receptor (tlr) genes in a high-risk infant population. methods: we selected 54 snps in the toll-like receptor genes. these snps were analysed in 331 children of sole european ancestry as part of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial examining the effects of hn001 and hn019 supplementation on eczema development and atopic sensitization. results: the data showed that 26 tlr snps interacted with hn001 resulting in a significantly reduced risk of eczema, 18 for eczema severity as defined by scorad >/= 10 and 20 for atopic sensitization compared to placebo. there were only two snps that interacted with hn019 resulting in a reduced risk of eczema, eczema severity or atopy. conclusions: this is the first study to show that the negative impact of specific tlr genotypes may be positively affected by probiotic supplementation. hn001 exhibits a much stronger effect than hn019 in this respect.

TI  == evaluation of the probiotic properties of new lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains and their in vitro effect.
AB  == probiotic ingestion is recommended as a preventive approach to maintain the balance of the intestinal microbiota and to enhance the human well-being. during  the whole life of each individual, the gut microbiota composition could be altered by lifestyle, diet, antibiotic therapies and other stress conditions, which may lead to acute and chronic disorders. hence, probiotics can be administered for the prevention or treatment of some disorders, including lactose malabsorption, acute diarrhoea, irritable bowel syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis and mild forms of inflammatory bowel disease. the probiotic-mediated effect is an important issue that needs to be addressed in relation to strain-specific probiotic properties. in this work, the probiotic properties of new lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains were screened, and their effects in vitro were evaluated. they were screened for probiotic properties by determining their tolerance to low ph and to bile salts, antibiotic sensitivity, antimicrobial activity and vitamin b8, b9 and b12 production, and by considering their ability to increase the antioxidant potential and to modulate the inflammatory status of systemic-miming cell lines in vitro. three out of the  examined strains presenting the most performant probiotic properties, as lactobacillus plantarum pbs067, lactobacillus rhamnosus pbs070 and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis pbso75, were evaluated for their effects also on human intestinal ht-29 cell line. the obtained results support the possibility to move to another level of study, that is, the oral administration of these probiotical strains to patients with acute and chronic gut disorders, by in vivo experiments.

TI  == lactobacilli and bifidobacteria enhance mucosal b cell responses and differentially modulate systemic antibody responses to an oral human rotavirus vaccine in a neonatal gnotobiotic pig disease model.
AB  == b cells play a key role in generation of protective immunity against rotavirus infection, a major cause of gastroenteritis in children. current rv vaccines are  less effective in developing countries compared to developed countries. commensals/probiotics influence mucosal immunity, but the role of early gut colonizing bacteria in modulating intestinal b cell responses to rv vaccines is largely unknown. we co-colonized neonatal gnotobiotic pigs, the only animal model susceptible to hrv diarrhea, with 2 dominant bacterial species present in the gut of breastfed infants, lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg and bifidobacterium animalis lactis bb12 to evaluate their impact on b cell responses to an attenuated (att) human rotavirus (hrv) wa strain vaccine. following hrv challenge, probiotic-colonized, atthrv vaccinated piglets had significantly lower fecal scores and reduced hrv shedding titers compared to uncolonized, atthrv vaccinated pigs. the reduction in hrv diarrhea was significantly correlated with  higher intestinal iga hrv antibody titers and intestinal hrv-specific iga antibody secreting cell (asc) numbers in probiotic-colonized, atthrv vaccinated pigs compared to uncolonized, vaccinated pigs. the significantly higher small intestinal hrv iga antibody responses coincided with higher il-6, il-10 and april responses of ileal mononuclear cells (mncs) and the immunomodulatory effects of probiotics genomic dna on tgf-beta and il-10 responses. however, serum rv igg antibody titers and total igg titers were significantly lower in probiotic-colonized, atthrv vaccinated pigs compared to uncolonized, vaccinated pigs, both pre- and post-challenge. in summary, lgg and bb12 beneficially modulated intestinal b cell responses to hrv vaccine.

TI  == differential modification of genetic susceptibility to childhood eczema by two probiotics.
AB  == background: in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled birth cohort, we have recently shown a beneficial effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 (hn001)  for the prevention of eczema in children through to 6 years of age but no effect  of bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis hn019 (hn019). objective: among this cohort of children, we aim to investigate whether these probiotics could modify the expression of genetic predisposition to eczema conferred by genetic variation in susceptibility genes. methods: thirty-three eczema susceptibility snps (in eleven genes) were genotyped in 331 children of european ancestry. results: children who carried a genetic variant that put them at a high risk of developing eczema were less likely to develop eczema if they had been randomized to the hn001 intervention group compared to those in the placebo group. hn019 was also able to protect against the effects of some snps. as well as modifying genetic susceptibility to childhood eczema, hn001 was also found to modify genetic susceptibility to eczema severity and atopy risk. conclusion and clinical relevance: this is the first study to show an effect of a probiotic on reducing eczema risk amongst those with particular eczema-associated genotypes. our findings suggest that lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 may be particularly effective in preventing eczema in children with specific high-risk genotypes.

TI  == effect of probiotic supplementation on schizophrenia symptoms and association with gastrointestinal functioning: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == objective: a range of immune system abnormalities have been associated with schizophrenia. probiotic compounds modulate the immune response and offer a potential treatment strategy for schizophrenia. probiotic compounds have also been observed to improve gastrointestinal dysfunction, which is a common problem  in individuals with schizophrenia. we performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to examine whether probiotic supplementation can reduce  symptom severity in patients with schizophrenia receiving antipsychotic treatment and also whether probiotics are associated with bowel functioning. methods: outpatients with schizophrenia (n = 65) meeting dsm-iv criteria and with at least moderately severe psychotic symptoms were enrolled in the study from december 2010-august 2012. following a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients were randomly assigned to 14 weeks of double-blind adjunctive probiotic (combined lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis strain bb12) or placebo therapy. psychiatric symptoms were assessed biweekly with the positive and negative syndrome scale (panss), and patients were queried weekly about their gastrointestinal functioning. results: repeated-measures analysis of variance showed no significant differences in the panss total score between probiotic and placebo supplementation (f = 1.28, p = .25). however, patients in the probiotic group were less likely to develop severe bowel difficulty over the course of the trial (hazard ratio = 0.23; 95% ci, 0.09-0.61,  p = .003). conclusions: probiotic supplementation may help prevent a common somatic symptom associated with schizophrenia. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct01242371.

TI  == modulation of gut microbiota during probiotic-mediated attenuation of metabolic syndrome in high fat diet-fed mice.
AB  == structural disruption of gut microbiota and associated inflammation are considered important etiological factors in high fat diet (hfd)-induced metabolic syndrome (ms). three candidate probiotic strains, lactobacillus paracasei cncm i-4270 (lc), l. rhamnosus i-3690 (lr) and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis  i-2494 (ba), were individually administered to hfd-fed mice (10(8) cells day(-1)) for 12 weeks. each strain attenuated weight gain and macrophage infiltration into epididymal adipose tissue and markedly improved glucose-insulin homeostasis and hepatic steatosis. weighted unifrac principal coordinate analysis based on 454 pyrosequencing of fecal bacterial 16s rrna genes showed that the probiotic strains shifted the overall structure of the hfd-disrupted gut microbiota toward  that of lean mice fed a normal (chow) diet. redundancy analysis revealed that abundances of 83 operational taxonomic units (otus) were altered by probiotics. forty-nine altered otus were significantly correlated with one or more host ms parameters and were designated 'functionally relevant phylotypes'. thirteen of the 15 functionally relevant otus that were negatively correlated with ms phenotypes were promoted, and 26 of the 34 functionally relevant otus that were positively correlated with ms were reduced by at least one of the probiotics, but each strain changed a distinct set of functionally relevant otus. lc and lr increased cecal acetate but did not affect circulating lipopolysaccharide-binding protein; in contrast, ba did not increase acetate but significantly decreased adipose and hepatic tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene expression. these results suggest that lactobacillus and bifidobacterium differentially attenuate obesity comorbidities in part through strain-specific impacts on ms-associated phylotypes of gut microbiota in mice.

TI  == specific probiotics and virological findings in symptomatic conscripts attending  military service in finland.
AB  == background: viral upper respiratory tract infections occur frequently among conscripts. probiotics have reduced viral infections in children attending day care. limited data are available on the effects of probiotics on the nasopharyngeal presence of respiratory viruses. objectives: to assess, whether probiotics could decrease nasopharyngeal occurrence of respiratory viruses in finnish conscripts. study design: in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 90- and 150-day intervention study, 239 nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from 192 symptomatic conscripts receiving daily chewable probiotic tablet containing lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 (46.9%) or control tablet (53.1%) on visits to a garrison's health care center due to symptoms of infection. the presence of respiratory viruses was tested by pcr-methods, and viral findings were compared between the intervention groups. results: 184 (76.9%) nasopharyngeal samples were positive for at least one respiratory virus. picornaviruses were the most common  viruses and were detected in 155 (84.2%) of samples. of these, 143 (92.3%) were rhinovirus-positive and 20 (12.9%) were enterovirus-positive. the control group had 83 (64%) and the probiotic group 72 (66%) picornavirus infections (p=0.79). monthly distribution of picornaviruses showed that there were less picornavirus findings after 3 months in the probiotic group than in the control group (p=0.0069). however, probiotics did not reduce picornavirus occurrence in other months. conclusions: overall, probiotics did not reduce viral occurrence in symptomatic conscripts. however, probiotics decreased the presence of picornaviruses after 3 months, which may imply that probiotics play a role against viruses causing common cold. further investigations are necessary to clarify the mechanisms involved in order to target specific probiotics on specific respiratory viruses.

TI  == assessment of stress tolerance acquisition in the heat-tolerant derivative strains of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg.
AB  == aims: the purpose of this study was to investigate the heat-shock response at molecular level in lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 and their heat-tolerant derivatives and to characterize the changes  that make the derivatives more robust in terms of heat stress. methods and results: the study strains were exposed for 2 h to a heat-shock treatment, bif. animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 and its derivative at 50 degrees c and the lact. rhamnosus gg and its derivative at 60 degrees c. protein synthesis before and after heat shock was examined using proteomics and rt-qpcr. the analysis revealed that the regulation of seven proteins in both strain pairs was modified as a response to heat or between the original and the derivative strain. the comparison of wild-type strains and the heat-tolerant derivatives suggests that the acquisition of heat tolerance in the bif. animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 derivative is due to a slightly increased constitutive level of chaperones, while in lact. rhamnosus gg derivative, the main reason seems to be a higher ability to induce the production of chaperones. conclusions: this study revealed possible markers of heat tolerance in b. lactis and lact. rhamnosus strains. significance  and impact of study: this study increases our knowledge on how lactobacillus and  bifidobacterium strains may acquire heat tolerance. these findings may be useful  for improving the heat tolerance of existing probiotic strains as well as screening new heat-tolerant strains.

TI  == impact of orally administered lozenges with lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 on the number of salivary mutans streptococci, amount of plaque, gingival inflammation and the oral microbiome in  healthy adults.
AB  == objectives: the aim was to evaluate the effects of orally administered lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg) and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 (bb-12) on the number of salivary mutans streptococci (ms), amount of plaque, gingival inflammation and the oral microbiota in healthy young adults. materials  and methods: the study was a randomised, controlled, double-blind trial. healthy  volunteers used lozenges containing a combination of lgg and bb-12 (test group, n = 29) or lozenges without added probiotics (control group, n = 31) for 4 weeks. at baseline and at the end of the test period, the plaque index (pi) and gingival index (gi) were determined, and stimulated saliva was collected. the microbial composition of saliva was assessed using human oral microbe identification microarray (n = 30). ms and lactobacilli (lb) were plate cultured. results: the probiotic lozenge decreased both pi and gi (p < 0.05) while no changes were observed in the control group. however, no probiotic-induced changes were found in the microbial compositions of saliva in either group. conclusions: the probiotic lozenge improved the periodontal status without affecting the oral microbiota. clinical relevance: short-term consumption of lgg and bb-12 decreased the amount of plaque which was associated with a clinical impact: a decrease in gingival inflammation.

TI  == immune system stimulation by probiotic microorganisms.
AB  == probiotic organisms are claimed to offer several functional properties including  stimulation of immune system. this review is presented to provide detailed informations about how probiotics stimulate our immune system. lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota, bifidobacterium animalis bb-12, lactobacillus johnsonii la1, bifidobacterium lactis dr10, and saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii are the most investigated probiotic cultures for their immunomodulation properties. probiotics can enhance nonspecific cellular immune response characterized by activation of macrophages, natural killer (nk) cells, antigen-specific cytotoxic t-lymphocytes, and the release of various cytokines in strain-specific and dose-dependent manner. mixture and type (gram-positive and gram-negative) of probiotic organisms may induce different cytokine responses. supplementation of probiotic organisms in infancy could help prevent immune-mediated diseases in childhood, whereas their intervention in pregnancy could affect fetal immune parameters, such as cord blood interferon (ifn)-gamma levels, transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta1 levels, and breast milk immunoglobulin (ig)a. probiotics that can be delivered via fermented milk or yogurt could improve the gut mucosal immune system by increasing the number of iga(+) cells and cytokine-producing cells in the effector site of the intestine.

TI  == [phenotypic and genotypic characterization of probiotic bacterial strains used in medicinal products].
AB  == introduction: the optimization of quality testing strategy of products containing probiotics might allow to general improvement of its safer use in humans. the goal of the study was the evaluation of quality expressed by identity, colony forming unit (cfu) and antibiotic sensitivity ofprobiotics used in medicinal products available in poland using the appropriate and validated procedures. methods: the medicinal products containing l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and b. animalis subsp. lactis, l. helveticus, and l. gasseri were tested for species identity performed with validated rep-pcr (boxa 1r) method. the antimicrobial susceptibility of working seeds and strains isolated to 26 antibiotics were tested by disk diffusion and e-test methods using relevant references as recommended by eucast. the numbers of probiotic strains, expressed as cfu count per package, was done using plating plunge method. results: all strains tested, except b. lactis, were found to be resistant to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, nalidixic acid, metronidazole, and colistin. b. lactis was resistant to aminoglycosides. l. rhamnosus strains were found to be resistant to vancomycin, (mic > 256 microg/ml) similarly to atcc strains (l. rhamnosus gg 53103 and 244). the sensitivity to other antibiotics was strain specific. the rep-pcr method was found species and strain specific. all products  tested fulfilled declared countent as measured by cfu count/package. conclusions: quality of medicinal products containing probiotics was found undoubted and confirmed. the optimized strategy of quality monitoring of probiotics used in medicinal products can be used in dietary supplements and foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses.

TI  == effect of prebiotic carbohydrates on growth, bile survival and cholesterol uptake abilities of dairy-related bacteria.
AB  == background: three strains of lactic acid bacteria and one probiotic bifidobacterium strain sourced from milk origin were considered to select for the best synbiotic-like combination for cholesterol uptake ability. for that purpose, fermentative characteristics, bile salt hydrolase activity, bile survival and cholesterol removal were assessed in the presence of different carbohydrates. results: carbohydrate fermentability was highly variable among the different strains, and lactulose was the only prebiotic to favour growth of all strains, whereas pectin led to low population regardless of the strain. bile survival of bacteria could be improved by the preferred carbon source and was related to their bile salt hydrolase activities. all together, our results showed that the most advantageous synbiotic-like combinations to achieve cholesterol uptake abilities were lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus lb 340 with raffinose, streptococcus thermophilus ta040 or lactobacillus rhamnosus lbre-lsas with lactulose, and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb12 with mannitol. conclusion: the suggested synbiotics may represent new promising functional dairy additives.

TI  == lactobacillus reuteri and escherichia coli in the human gut microbiota may predict weight gain associated with vancomycin treatment.
AB  == background: antibiotics, used for 60 years to promote weight gain in animals, have been linked to obesity in adults and in children when administered during early infancy. lactobacillus reuteri has been linked to obesity and weight gain in children affected with kwashiorkor using ready-to-use therapeutic food. in contrast, escherichia coli has been linked with the absence of obesity. both of these bacteria are resistant to vancomycin. objectives and methods: we assessed vancomycin-associated weight and gut microbiota changes, and tested whether bacterial species previously linked with body mass index (bmi) predict weight gain at 1 year. all endocarditis patients treated with vancomycin or amoxicillin  in our center were included from january 2008 to december 2010. bacteroidetes, firmicutes, lactobacillus and methanobrevibacter smithii were quantified using real-time pcr on samples obtained during the 4-6 weeks antibiotic regimen. l. reuteri, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, bifidobacterium animalis and e. coli were quantified on stool samples obtained during the first week of antibiotics. results: of the193 patients included in the study, 102 were treated with vancomycin and 91 with amoxicillin. vancomycin was associated with a 10% bmi increase (odds ratio (or) 14.1; 95% confidence interval (ci; 1.03-194); p=0.047)  and acquired obesity (4/41 versus 0/56, p=0.01). in patients treated with vancomycin, firmicutes, bacteroidetes and lactobacillus increased, whereas m. smithii decreased (p<0.05). the absence of e. coli was an independent predictor of weight gain (or=10.7; 95% ci (1.4-82.0); p=0.02). strikingly, a patient with an 18% bmi increase showed a dramatic increase of l. reuteri but no increase of e. coli. conclusion: the acquired obesity observed in patients treated with vancomycin may be related to a modulation of the gut microbiota rather than a direct antibiotic effect. l. reuteri, which is resistant to vancomycin and produces broad bacteriocins, may have an instrumental role in this effect.

TI  == early supplementation with lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 reduces eczema prevalence to 6 years: does it also reduce atopic sensitization?
AB  == background: the role of probiotics in prevention of allergic disease is still not clear; efficacy may depend on the timing, dose, duration, and specific probiotic  used. using a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial (australian new zealand clinical trials registry: actrn12607000518460), we have shown that in a high-risk birth cohort, maternal supplementation from 35 weeks gestation until 6  months if breastfeeding and infant supplementation from birth until 2 years with  lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 (hn001) (6 x 10(9) cfu/day) halved the cumulative prevalence of eczema at 2 and 4 years. bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis hn019 (hn019) (9 x 10(9) cfu/day) had no significant effect. objective: to determine whether differences in effects of hn001 and hn019 on eczema persist to  age 6 years, and to investigate effects on sensitization. methods: standard procedures were used to assess eczema (the uk working party's criteria), eczema severity (scorad), atopic sensitization [skin prick tests (spt), total and specific ige] and standard questions used for asthma, wheeze, and rhinoconjunctivitis. results: hn001 was associated with significantly lower cumulative prevalence of eczema (hr = 0.56, 95% ci 0.39-0.80), scorad >/= 10 (hr  = 0.69, 0.49-0.98) and spt sensitization (hr = 0.69, 95% ci 0.48-0.99). the point prevalence of eczema (rr = 0.66, 95% ci 0.44-1.00), scorad >/= 10 (rr = 0.62, 95% ci 0.38-1.01) and spt sensitization (rr = 0.72, 95% ci 0.53-1.00) were also reduced among children taking hn001. hn019 had no significant effect on any outcome. conclusion and clinical relevance: this study provides evidence for the  efficacy of the probiotic l. rhamnosus hn001 in preventing the development of eczema and possibly also atopic sensitization in high risk infants to age 6 years. the absence of a similar effect for hn019 indicates that benefits may be species specific.

TI  == assessment of the effect of stress-tolerance acquisition on some basic characteristics of specific probiotics.
AB  == the production of viable functional probiotics presupposes stability of strain features in the final product. we evaluated the impact of acquisition of heat-tolerance and subsequent freeze-drying on the adhesion properties of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota, bifidobacterium lactis bb-12 and bifidobacterium animalis if20/1 and on their ability to inhibit the adhesion of pathogens in a mucus model. both fresh and freeze-dried cultures were evaluated. significant differences were observed between fresh, freeze dried, fresh heat-tolerant and freeze dried heat-tolerant strains, especially in the ability of the freeze dried probiotics to exclude, displace or outcompete pathogens. based on our study characterizing probiotic properties such as adhesion and competitive exclusion, it seems possible to adapt probiotics to processing stresses, such as heat, without significantly changing the probiotic properties of the strains assessed. this may provide new options for future probiotic production technology. however, our results also emphasize that the properties of the stress-adapted strains, as well as the effect of the production processes should always be assessed as these are strain-specific.

AB  == gut-derived lipopolysaccharides (lps) are critical to the development and progression of chronic low-grade inflammation and metabolic diseases. in this study, the effects of probiotics lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on gut-derived lipopolysaccharide and inflammatory cytokine concentrations were evaluated using  a human colonic microbiota model. lactobacillus reuteri, l. rhamnosus, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium animalis, b. bifidum, b. longum, and b. longum subsp.  infantis were identified from the literature for their anti-inflammatory potential. each bacterial culture was administered daily to a human colonic microbiota model during 14 days. colonic lipopolysaccharides, and gram-positive and negative bacteria were quantified. raw 264.7 macrophage cells were stimulated with supernatant from the human colonic microbiota model. concentrations of tnf-alpha, il-1beta, and il-4 cytokines were measured. lipopolysaccharide concentrations were significantly reduced with the administration of b. bifidum (-46.45 +/- 5.65%), l. rhamnosus (-30.40 +/- 5.08%), b. longum (-42.50 +/- 1.28%), and b. longum subsp. infantis (-68.85 +/- 5.32%) (p < 0.05). cell counts  of gram-negative and positive bacteria were distinctly affected by the probiotic  administered. there was a probiotic strain-specific effect on immunomodulatory responses of raw 264.7 macrophage cells. b. longum subsp. infantis demonstrated higher capacities to reduce tnf-alpha concentrations (-69.41 +/- 2.78%; p < 0.05) and to increase il-4 concentrations (+16.50 +/- 0.59%; p < 0.05). colonic lipopolysaccharides were significantly correlated with tnf-alpha and il-1beta concentrations (p < 0.05). these findings suggest that specific probiotic bacteria, such as b. longum subsp. infantis, might decrease colonic lipopolysaccharide concentrations, which might reduce the proinflammatory tone. this study has noteworthy applications in the field of biotherapeutics for the prevention and/or treatment of inflammatory and metabolic diseases.

TI  == in vitro inhibition of clostridium difficile and clostridium perfringens by commercial probiotic strains.
AB  == probiotics have gained importance in human and veterinary medicine to prevent and control clostridial enteric disease. limited information is available on the ability of different probiotic bacteria used in food products to inhibit clostridium difficile and clostridium perfringens. the objective of this study was to examine the in vitro inhibitory effects of selected commercial bacterial strains on pathogenic clostridia and their growth characteristics under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. the inhibitory effects of 17 commercial strains of lactobacillus (n = 16) and bifidobacterium (n = 1) on the reference strains of c. difficile and c. perfringens were assessed by an agar well diffusion assay and by a broth culture inhibition assay using cell-free supernatant harvested at different growth phases, with and without ph neutralization. to study growth characteristics, probiotic strains were cultivated in different acid and bile environments, and growth in the modified media was compared to growth in standard medium. in the agar well diffusion assay, supernatant obtained from two probiotic strains inhibited the growth of both reference and clinical strains of c. perfringens. this effect as seen when supernatant was assessed with and without ph neutralization. supernatants obtained from 10 probiotic strains inhibited c. difficile only when supernatant was added without ph neutralization. in the broth culture inhibition assay, growth of c. perfringens and c. difficile was inhibited by supernatant without ph neutralization from 5 and 10 probiotic strains, respectively. all potential probiotic strains were able to grow at ph 4.0 and in  the presence of 0.15% and 0.3% bile but none were able to grow or survive at ph 2.0. altogether five probiotic strains [lactobacillus plantarum (n = 2), lactobacillus rhamnosus (n = 2), bifidobacterium animalis lactis (n = 1)] were shown to inhibit all strains of c. difficile and c. perfringens. the inhibitory effect was probiotic strain-specific. two strains showed a ph-independent inhibitory effect likely due to production of either antibiotics or bacteriocins  inhibiting c. perfringens only. these strains have favourable growth characteristics for use as probiotics and their efficacy as prophylactic or therapeutic measures against clostridial enteric disease should be further evaluated by clinical trials in animals.

TI  == assessment of probiotic viability during cheddar cheese manufacture and ripening  using propidium monoazide-pcr quantification.
AB  == the use of a suitable food carrier such as cheese could significantly enhance probiotic viability during storage. the main goal of this study was to assess viability of commercial probiotic strains during cheddar cheesemaking and ripening (4-6 months) by comparing the efficiency of microbiological and molecular approaches. molecular methods such as quantitative pcr (qpcr) allow bacterial quantification, and dna-blocking molecules such as propidium monoazide  (pma) select only the living cells' dna. cheese samples were manufactured with a  lactococci starter and with one of three probiotic strains (bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12, lactobacillus rhamnosus ro011, or lactobacillus helveticus ro052) or a mixed culture containing b. animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 and l. helveticus ro052 (mc1), both lactobacilli strains (mc2), or all three strains (mc3). dna extractions were then carried out on pma-treated and non-treated cell pellets in order to assess pma treatment efficiency, followed by quantification using the 16s rrna gene, the elongation factor tu gene (tuf) or the transaldolase gene (tal). results with intact/dead ratios of bacteria showed  that pma-treated cheese samples had a significantly lower bacterial count than non-treated dna samples (p < 0.005), confirming that pma did eliminate dead bacteria from pcr quantification. for both quantification methods, the addition of probiotic strains seemed to accelerate the loss of lactococci viability in comparison to control cheese samples, especially when l. helveticus ro052 was added. viability of all three probiotic strains was also significantly reduced in mixed culture cheese samples (p < 0.0001), b. animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 being  the most sensitive to the presence of other strains. however, all probiotic strains did retain their viability (log 9 cfu/g of cheese) throughout ripening. this study was successful in monitoring living probiotic species in cheddar cheese samples through pma-qpcr.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus lgg(r) and bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12(r) on health-related quality of life in college students affected by upper  respiratory infections.
AB  == college students are susceptible to upper respiratory infections (uri) due to inadequate sleep, stress and close living quarters. certain probiotic strains modulate immune function and may improve health-related quality of life (hrql) during uri. the present study recruited apparently healthy college students and assessed the effect of probiotics on hrql outcomes (i.e. self-reported duration,  symptom severity and functional impairment of uri) in those who developed uri. missed school and work days due to uri were also considered. subjects (n 231) were apparently healthy college students living on campus in residence halls at the framingham state university (framingham, ma, usa), and were randomised to receive placebo (n 117) or probiotic-containing powder (daily dose of minimum 1 billion colony-forming units of each lactobacillus rhamnosus lgg(r) (lgg(r)) and  bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12(r) (bb-12(r)); n 114) for 12 weeks. subjects completed the wisconsin upper respiratory symptom survey-21 to assess hrql during uri. the final analyses included 198 subjects (placebo, n 97 and probiotics, n 101). the median duration of uri was significantly shorter by 2 d and median severity score was significantly lower by 34% with probiotics v. placebo (p,0.001), indicating a higher hrql during uri. number of missed work days was not different between groups (p=0.429); however, the probiotics group missed significantly fewer school days (mean difference = 0.2 d) compared to the  placebo group (p=0.002). lgg(r) and bb-12(r) may be beneficial among college students with uri for mitigating decrements in hrql. more research is warranted regarding mechanisms of action associated with these findings and the cost-benefit of prophylactic supplementation.

TI  == myosin-cross-reactive antigens from four different lactic acid bacteria are fatty acid hydratases.
AB  == the 67 kda myosin-cross-reactive antigen (mcra) is a member of the mcra family of proteins present in a wide range of bacteria and was predicted to have fatty acid isomerase function. we have now characterised the catalytic activity of mcras from four lab stains, including lactobacillus rhamnosus lgg, l. plantarum st-iii, l. acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12. mcra genes  from these strains were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein function was analysed with lipid profiles by gc-ms. the four  mcras catalysed the conversion of linoleic acid and oleic acid to their respective 10-hydroxy derivatives, which suggests that mcra proteins catalyse the first step in conjugated linoleic acid production. this is the first report of mcra from l. rhamnosus with such catalytic function.

TI  == a protective effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 against eczema in the first  2 years of life persists to age 4 years.
AB  == background: using a double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial (australian  new zealand clinical trials registry: actrn12607000518460), we have shown that in a high risk birth cohort, maternal supplementation from 35 weeks gestation until  6 months if breastfeeding and infant supplementation until 2 years with lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 (hn001) (6 x 10(9) cfu/day) halved the cumulative prevalence of eczema by age 2 years. bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis hn019  (hn019) (9 x 10(9) cfu/day) had no effect. objective: the aim of this study was to investigate the associations of hn001 and hn019 with allergic disease and atopic sensitization among these children at age 4 years, 2 years after stopping  probiotic supplementation. methods: the presence (uk working party's diagnostic criteria) and severity scoring atopic dermatitis (scorad) of eczema and atopy (skin prick tests) and parent-reported symptoms of asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis were assessed using standard protocols and questions. results: four-hundred and seventy-four infants were eligible at birth of whom 425 (90%) participated in this follow-up. the cumulative prevalence of eczema by 4 years (hazard ratio (hr) 0.57 (95% ci 0.39-0.83)) and prevalence of rhinoconjunctivitis at 4 years (relative risk 0.38 (95% ci 0.18-0.83)) were significantly reduced in the children taking hn001; there were also nonsignificant reductions in the cumulative prevalence of scorad >/= 10 (hr 0.74 (95% ci 0.52-1.05), wheeze (hr 0.79 (95% ci 0.59-1.07)) and atopic sensitization (hr = 0.72 (95% ci 0.48-1.06)). hn019 did not affect the prevalence of any outcome. conclusions and clinical relevance: this study showed that the protective effect of hn001 against eczema,  when given for the first 2 years of life only, extended to at least 4 years of age. this, together with our findings for a protective effect against rhinoconjunctivitis, suggests that this probiotic might be an appropriate preventative intervention for high risk infants.

TI  == gut balance, a synbiotic supplement, increases fecal lactobacillus paracasei but  has little effect on immunity in healthy physically active individuals.
AB  == synbiotic supplements, which contain multiple functional ingredients, may enhance the immune system more than the use of individual ingredients alone. a double blind active controlled parallel trial over a 21 d exercise training period was conducted to evaluate the effect of gut balance, which contains lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (l. casei 431(r)), bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis (bb-12(r)), lactobacillus acidophilus (la-5(r)), lactobacillus rhamnosus (lgg(r)), two prebiotics (raftiline and raftilose) and bovine whey derived lactoferrin and immunoglobulins with acacia gum on fecal microbiota, short chain  fatty acids (scfa), gut permeability, salivary lactoferrin and serum cytokines. all subjects randomized were included in the analysis. there was a 9-fold (1.2-fold to 64-fold; 95% confidence intervals p = 0.03) greater increase in fecal l. paracasei numbers with gut balance compared with acacia gum supplementation. gut balance was associated with a 50% (-12% to 72%; p = 0.02) smaller increase in the concentration of serum il-16 in comparison to acacia gum  from pre- to post-study. no substantial effects of either supplement were evident in fecal scfa concentrations, measures of mucosal immunity or gi permeability. clinical studies are now required to determine whether gut balance may exert beneficial gi health effects by increasing the recovery of fecal l. paracasei. both supplements had little effect on immunity. twenty two healthy physically active male subjects (mean age = 33.9 +/- 6.5y) were randomly allocated to either daily prebiotic or synbiotic supplementation for 21 d. saliva, blood, urine and fecal samples were collected pre-, mid and post-intervention. participants recorded patterns of physical activity on a self-reported questionnaire.

TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and bifidobacterium animalis mb5 induce intestinal but not systemic antigen-specific hyporesponsiveness in ovalbumin-immunized rats.
AB  == probiotics may modulate the host immune response by mechanisms not yet fully understood. we evaluated the modulation of intestinal and systemic antigen-specific immune response by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg) or bifidobacterium animalis mb5 in tolerized and immunized rats. three groups of rats received orally lgg, b. animalis, or pbs (control) for 28 d. each group was  divided into two subgroups of tolerized or immunized rats receiving orally ovalbumin (ova; 7 mg) or pbs on d 7, 9, and 11. all rats were immunized with ova  (300 mug) on d 14 and 21. in tolerized rats, the ova-induced proliferative response of mesenteric lymph nodes (mln) and spleen cells did not differ from control, indicating that the two probiotics maintained the tolerance. lgg and b.  animalis in immunized rats reduced the ova-induced proliferative response in mln  (p < 0.01) but not in spleen, whereas the proliferative response to anti-cd3 and  concanavalin a of mln and spleen cells as well as the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction were not affected by probiotic treatment, indicating ova-specific hyporesponsiveness restricted to intestinal immunity. this hyporesponsiveness was associated with cd4+cd25+foxp3+ t cell expansion (p < 0.01) and increased il-10 and tgfbeta after lgg (p < 0.05), and increased apoptosis after b. animalis (p < 0.001) in mln. in conclusion, we report a novel  activity of lgg and b. animalis in inducing ova-specific hyporesponsiveness in mln of ova-immunized rats that can be useful for a therapeutic strategy to prevent undesirable reactions to immunogenic antigens in the gut.

TI  == effects of synbiotic fermentation products on primary chemoprevention in human colon cells.
AB  == the consumption of synbiotics, a mixture of probiotics and indigestible food constituents such as dietary fiber, has been reported to reduce colon cancer risk. we investigated the effects of fermented wheat aleurone enriched with the probiotics lactobacillus rhamnosus gg/bifidobacterium animalis supsp. lactis on the gene expression and functional end points related to cellular defence in ht29 and primary human colon cells. aleurone was digested and fermented in vitro with/without probiotics. the resulting fermentation supernatants (fs) were analyzed for concentrations of deoxycholic acid and ammonia. the cells were treated with the fs, and effects on gene expression of catalase, gstp1 and sult2b1, enzyme activity of catalase and glutathione s-transferase as well as h(2)o(2)-induced dna damage were examined. fermentation of aleurone reduced deoxycholic acid concentration by 84%, while the probiotics enhanced this effect. ammonia was increased by fs aleurone, whereas a reduction occurred by the addition of l. rhamnosus gg/b. animalis supsp. lactis 12. gstp1 expression tended to result in an increase by the fs aleurone in both cell types, whereas the probiotics could not additionally increase the effect. catalase was not modulated by fs aleurone enriched with probiotics. only in ht29 cells, expression of sult2b1 was enhanced by fs aleurone. enzyme activity of catalase and glutathione  s-transferase was induced (2-3.6 fold, 72 h) in ht29 cells only. addition of probiotics had no influence on this effect. in ht29 cells, a reduced h(2)o(2)-induced dna damage by the fs aleurone after 48 h, enhanced by the addition of probiotics, was detected. the observed effects could improve detoxification of xenobiotics and therefore may lower colon cancer risk.

TI  == effect of kynurenic acid on the viability of probiotics in vitro.
AB  == probiotics are bacteria that are commercially available as dietary supplements. one of the important properties of probiotics is their ability to survive in the  intestine. recent evidence has identified kynurenic acid (kyna) as a bactericidal constituent of intestinal fluid. these data led us to study the influence of kyna on the viability of selected probiotics. we found that kyna supported the growth  of bacteria in the probiotics acidolac (lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium) and lakcid forte (lactobacillus rhamnosus) or retarded the growth of bacteria from the acidolac, biogaia (lactobacillus reuteri protectis),  dicoflor (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg), lacium (lactobacillus plantarum) and trilac (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis) probiotics depending on its concentration. kyna did not affect the viability of bacteria from the probiotic linex (lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12). our results suggest a potential role of kyna in the regulation of bacterial growth in the digestive system.

AB  == aim: to investigate the effects of four probiotic bacteria and their combination  on human mast cell gene expression using microarray analysis. methods: human peripheral-blood-derived mast cells were stimulated with lactobacillus rhamnosus  (l. rhamnosus) gg (lgg((r))), l. rhamnosus lc705 (lc705), propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js (pjs) and bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb12 (bb12) and their combination for 3 or 24 h, and were subjected to global microarray analysis using an affymetrix genechip((r)) human genome u133 plus 2.0  array. the gene expression differences between unstimulated and bacteria-stimulated samples were further analyzed with gorilla gene enrichment analysis and visualization tool and mev multiexperiment viewer-tool. results: lgg and lc705 were observed to suppress genes that encoded allergy-related high-affinity ige receptor subunits alpha and gamma (fcer1a and fcer1g, respectively) and histamine h4 receptor. lgg, lc705 and the combination of four probiotics had the strongest effect on the expression of genes involved in mast cell immune system regulation, and on several genes that encoded proteins with a  pro-inflammatory impact, such as interleukin (il)-8 and tumour necrosis factor alpha. also genes that encoded proteins with anti-inflammatory functions, such as il-10, were upregulated. conclusion: certain probiotic bacteria might diminish mast cell allergy-related activation by downregulation of the expression of high-affinity ige and histamine receptor genes, and by inducing a pro-inflammatory response.

TI  == persistence of probiotic strains in the gastrointestinal tract when administered  as capsules, yoghurt, or cheese.
AB  == most clinical studies of probiotics use freeze-dried, powdered bacteria or bacteria packed in capsules. however, probiotics are commercially available in various food matrices, which may affect their persistence in the gastrointestinal tract. the objective of the study was to compare oral and faecal recovery during  and after administration of a combination of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lc705, propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii js, and bifidobacterium  animalis subsp. lactis bb12 as capsules, yoghurt, or cheese. this randomized, parallel-group, open-label trial (n=36) included a 4-week run-in, 2-week intervention, and 3-week follow-up period. participants consumed 10(10)cfu/day of probiotic combination and provided saliva and faecal samples before, during, and  after the intervention. strain-specific real-time pcr was used to quantify the strains. l. rhamnosus gg was the only probiotic strain regularly recovered in saliva samples. during the intervention period it was recovered in the saliva of  88% of the volunteers at least once. no difference was found between the yoghurt  and cheese groups. at the end of the intervention, l. rhamnosus gg and lc705 counts were high in faecal samples of all product groups (8.08 and 8.67log(10) genome copies/g, respectively). there was no matrix effect on strain quantity in  faeces or the recovery time after ceasing the intervention. for p. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii js and b. animalis subsp. lactis bb12, a matrix effect was found at the end of the intervention (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively) and in the recovery time during follow-up (p<0.05 for both). yoghurt yielded the highest faecal quantity of js and bb12 strains (8.01 and 9.89log(10) genome copies/g, respectively). the results showed that the administration matrix did not influence the faecal quantity of lactobacilli, but affected faecal counts of propionibacteria and bifidobacteria that were lower when consumed in cheese. thus, the consumption of probiotics in yoghurt matrix is highly suitable for studying potential health benefits and capsules provide a comparable means of administration when the viability of the strain in the capsule product is confirmed.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains abrogate in vitro the cytotoxic effect of bacterial toxins on eukaryotic cells.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the capability of the exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactobacilli and bifidobacteria from human and dairy origin to antagonize the cytotoxic effect of bacterial toxins. methods and results: the cytotoxicity of bacillus cereus extracellular factors on caco-2 colonocytes in the presence/absence of the eps was determined by measuring the integrity of the tissue monolayer and the damage to the cell membrane (extracellular lactate dehydrogenase activity). additionally, the protective effect of eps against the haemolytic activity of the streptolysin-o was evaluated on rabbit erythrocytes. the eps produced by bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis a1 and ipla-r1, bifidobacterium longum nb667 and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg were able to counteract the toxic effect of bacterial toxins on the eukaryotic cells at 1mg ml(-1) eps concentration. the eps a1 was the most effective in counteracting the  effect of b. cereus toxins on colonocytes, even at lower doses (0.5mg ml(-1) ), whereas eps nb667 elicited the highest haemolysis reduction on erythrocytes. conclusions: the production of eps by lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could antagonize the toxicity of bacterial pathogens, this effect being eps and biological marker dependent. significance and impact of the study: this work allows gaining insight about the mechanisms that probiotics could exert to improve the host health.

TI  == production of exopolysaccharides by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains of  human origin, and metabolic activity of the producing bacteria in milk.
AB  == this work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the eps-producing strains in milk. the strains belong to the species  lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. the molar mass distribution of eps fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some eps from bacteria of food origin. in general, we detected an association between the eps size distribution and the eps-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial eps tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. the main monosaccharide components of the eps under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the  galactose ratio in our human bacterial eps. all eps-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. the lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the eps-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. with respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, l. plantarum h2 and l. rhamnosus e41 and e43r were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the eps-producing streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive  control. therefore, these human eps-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts  in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. this is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of eps isolated from human intestinal microbiota.

AB  == pasteurized and unfermented milks supplemented with probiotic bacteria are appearing on the market. it then becomes a challenge to ascertain the undesirable contamination microbiota in the presence of a largely superior population of probiotic bacteria. a method to enumerate the contaminating microbial microbiota  in such probiotic-enriched milks was developed. the probiotic cultures, lactobacillus rhamnosus lb-immuni-t and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12(r), were added to a pasteurized unfermented milk to reach a minimum of 1 billion cfu per 250 ml portion, as ascertained by plating on de man - rogosa - sharpe (mrs) agar in anaerobic conditions. no growth of b. animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 was noted on plate count agar (pca) or petrifilm plates, and the presence of this culture did not affect standard plate counts (spc) of contaminating bacteria. however, l. rhamnosus formed colonies on pca and petrifilm plates. attempts were thus made to inhibit the growth of the probiotic lactobacilli in pca. the addition of 2% sodium phosphate (sp) or 5% glycerophosphate (gp) inhibited the growth of the lactobacilli in broths, but pin-point colonies of l.  rhamnosus lb-immuni-t nevertheless appeared on pca supplemented with phosphates.  spc could be obtained on pca + 2% sp by only counting the large colonies, but this resulted in a significant (4.4 fold) underestimation of spc values. on petrifilm ac, at dilutions 0 to 2, all colonies were considered as being contaminants, while at dilutions 3 and 4, only large colonies were counted for spc determinations. there was a direct correlation (r2 = 0.99) between spc values with petrifilm in uninoculated milks and those obtained on probiotic-enriched milks. the high correlation obtained over the 102 to 106 cfu/ml range of spc values show that this petrifilm method is appropriate to evaluate the microbiological quality of pasteurized milks enriched with l. rhamnosus lb-immuni-t and b. animalis subsp. lactis bb-12.

TI  == a differential effect of 2 probiotics in the prevention of eczema and atopy: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == background: the role of probiotics in prevention of allergic disease is still not clearly established, although early reports suggested lactobacillus gg halved the risk of eczema at 2 years. objective: to determine whether probiotic supplementation in early life could prevent development of eczema and atopy at 2  years. methods: double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial of infants at risk of allergic disease. pregnant women were randomized to take lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 (l rhamnosus), bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis strain hn019 or placebo daily from 35 weeks gestation until 6 months if breast-feeding, and their infants were randomized to receive the same treatment from birth to 2 years (n = 474). the infant's cumulative prevalence of eczema and point prevalence of atopy, using skin prick tests to common allergens, was assessed at 2 years. results: infants receiving l rhamnosus had a significantly (p = .01) reduced risk of eczema (hazard ratio [hr], 0.51; 95% ci, 0.30-0.85) compared with placebo, but this was not the case for b animalis subsp lactis (hr, 0.90; 95% ci, 0.58-1.41).  there was no significant effect of l rhamnosus (hr, 0.74; 95% ci, 0.46-1.18) or b animalis subsp lactis (hr, 0.82; 95% ci, 0.52-1.28) on atopy. l rhamnosus (71.5%) was more likely than b animalis subsp lactis (22.6%) to be present in the feces at 3 months, although detection rates were similar by 24 months. conclusion: we found that supplementation with l rhamnosus, but not b animalis subsp lactis, substantially reduced the cumulative prevalence of eczema, but not atopy, by 2 years. understanding how lactobacilli act to prevent eczema requires further investigation.

TI  == probiotic intervention has strain-specific anti-inflammatory effects in healthy adults.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the effects of three potentially anti-inflammatory probiotic bacteria from three different genera on immune variables in healthy adults in a clinical setting based on previous in vitro characterization of cytokine responses. methods: a total of 62 volunteers participated in this randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled parallel group intervention study. the volunteers were randomized to receive a milk-based drink containing either lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb12 (bb12), or propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js (pjs) or a placebo  drink for 3 wk. venous blood and saliva samples were taken at baseline and on d 1, 7 and 21. fecal samples were collected at baseline and at the end of intervention. results: the serum hscrp expressed as the median auc(0-21) (minus baseline) was 0.018 mg/l in the placebo group, -0.240 mg/l in the lgg group, 0.090 mg/l in the bb12 group and -0.085 mg/l in the pjs group (p = 0.014). in vitro production of tnf-alpha from in vitro cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) was significantly lower in subjects receiving lgg vs placebo. il-2 production from pbmc in the bb12 group was significantly lower compared with the  other groups. conclusion: in conclusion, probiotic bacteria have strain-specific  anti-inflammatory effects in healthy adults.

TI  == the effect of probiotics and organic acids on shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in shiga-toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for stec. shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and  hemolytic uremic syndrome. stec possesses shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and shiga toxin 2  (stx2), both of which have a and b subunits. although stec containing both stx1 and stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. thus, the effect of lactobacillus, pediococcus, and bifidobacterium strains on stx2a expression levels in stec was investigated. lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included l. rhamnosus gg, l. curvatus, l. plantarum, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. reuteri, p. acidilactici, p. cerevisiae, p. pentosaceus, b. thermophilum, b. boum, b. suis and b. animalis. e. coli o157:h7 (edl 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. following rna extraction and cdna synthesis, relative stx2a mrna levels were determined according to a comparative  critical threshold (ct) real-time pcr. data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and the level of stx2a expression between treated and untreated stec was compared. observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2a was down-regulated, when compared to the control  culture. probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in  ph, influenced stx2a gene expression.

TI  == clinical trial: multispecies probiotic supplementation alleviates the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and stabilizes intestinal microbiota.
AB  == background: irritable bowel syndrome is the most common diagnosis in gastroenterology. trials suggest certain probiotics to be beneficial. aim: to investigate the effects of multispecies probiotic supplementation (lactobacillus  rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js and bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb12) on abdominal symptoms, quality  of life, intestinal microbiota and inflammatory markers in irritable bowel syndrome. methods: eighty-six irritable bowel syndrome patients (rome ii criteria) participated in this randomized, placebo-controlled 5-month intervention. patients were randomized to receive daily either multispecies probiotic supplementation or placebo. irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, quality  of life, microarray-based intestinal microbiota stability (n = 20), serum cytokines and sensitive c-reactive protein were monitored. results: the composite irritable bowel syndrome score had at 5 months decreased 14 points (95% ci: -19 to -9) from baseline with the multispecies probiotic vs. three points (95% ci: -8 to 1) with placebo (p = 0.0083). especially, distension and abdominal pain were affected. a stabilization of the microbiota was observed, as the microbiota similarity index increased with the probiotic supplementation (1.9 +/- 3.1), while it decreased with placebo (-2.9 +/- 1.7). no differences were seen in c-reactive protein. conclusions: this multispecies probiotic seems to be an effective and safe option to alleviate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, and  to stabilize the intestinal microbiota.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by probiotic strains modify the adhesion of probiotics and enteropathogens to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == exopolysaccharides (epss) are exocellular polymers present in the surface of many bacteria, including lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. the genome sequence of several strains revealed the presence of eps-encoding genes. however, the physiological role that epss play in the bacterial ecology still remains uncertain. in this study, we have assessed the effect of epss produced by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium longum nb667, and bifidobacterium animalis ipla-r1 on the adhesion of probiotic and enteropathogen strains to human intestinal mucus. the eps fraction gg had no significant effect on the adhesion of l. rhamnosus gg and b. animalis ipla-r1. however, the eps fractions nb667 and  ipla-r1 significantly reduced the adherence of both probiotic strains. in contrast, the three eps fractions increased the adhesion of enterobacter sakazakii atcc 29544 and escherichia coli nctc 8603. higher adherence of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 29631 and clostridium difficile atcc 9689 was detected in the presence of the eps fractions gg and nb667. in general,  these effects were obtained at eps concentrations of up to 5 mg/ml, and they were eps dose dependent. the competitive exclusion of probiotics in the presence of eps could suggest the involvement of these biopolymers in the adhesion to mucus.  the increase in the adherence of enteropathogens could be explained if components of the pathogen surface are able to bind to specific epss and the bound epss are  able to adhere to mucus. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work reporting the effect of epss from probiotics on bacterial adhesion properties.

TI  == probiotic bacteria bifidobacterium animalis mb5 and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg protect intestinal caco-2 cells from the inflammation-associated response induced by enterotoxigenic escherichia coli k88.
AB  == probiotic bacteria may provide protection against intestinal damage induced by pathogens, but the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. we investigated whether bifidobacterium animalis mb5 and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg  (lgg) protected intestinal caco-2 cells from the inflammation-associated response induced by enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) k88, by inhibiting pathogen attachment to the cells, which is the first step of etec pathogenicity, and regulating neutrophil recruitment, a crucial component of inflammation. a partial reduction of etec adhesion was exerted by probiotics and their culture supernatant fractions either undigested or digested with proteases. etec viability was unaffected by the presence of b. animalis, lgg or their supernatant fractions in the culture medium, indicating an absence of probiotic bactericidal  activity. probiotics and their supernatant fractions, either undigested or digested with proteases, strongly inhibited the neutrophil transmigration caused  by etec. both b. animalis and lgg counteracted the pathogen-induced up regulation of il-8, growth-related oncogene-alpha and epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide-78 gene expression, which are chemokines essential for neutrophil migration. moreover, the probiotics prevented the etec-induced increased expression of il-1beta and tnf-alpha and decrease of transforming growth factor-alpha, which are regulators of chemokine expression. these results indicate that b. animalis mb5 and lgg protect intestinal cells from the inflammation-associated response caused by etec k88 by partly reducing pathogen adhesion and by counteracting neutrophil migration, probably through the regulation of chemokine and cytokine expression.

TI  == application of a microplate scale fluorochrome staining assay for the assessment  of viability of probiotic preparations.
AB  == cell viability in probiotic preparations is traditionally assessed by the plate count technique. additionally, fluorescent staining combined with epifluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry has been developed for the viability assessment, but the currently available assays are either laborious or require highly sophisticated equipment. the aim of this study was to investigate the applicability of a microplate scale fluorochrome assay for predicting the cell state of freeze-dried lactobacillus rhamnosus and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis preparations. in addition to viability assessment with live/dead baclight  bacterial viability kit, dibac(4)3 stain was used for the kinetic measurement of  changes in bifidobacterial cell membrane functions during exposure to low ph. the microplate scale fluorochrome assay results on the viability and cell numbers of  probiotic preparations correlated well with the results obtained with the culture-based technique and (with few exceptions) with epifluorescence microscopy. the assay was applicable also for the viability assessment of stressed (acid-treated) cells provided that the cell density in treatments was adjusted to the optimal measurement level of the fluorometer. the microplate scale fluorochrome assay offers a rapid and robust tool for the viability assessment of probiotic preparations, and enables also kinetic measurements.

TI  == a dynamic model that simulates the human upper gastrointestinal tract for the study of probiotics.
AB  == a dynamic model of the human upper gastrointestinal (gi) tract was designed to better simulate conditions of ingestion and digestion, by including a food matrix as part of the model design. the dynamic model consisted of two reactors maintained at 37 degrees c, one simulating stomach conditions and the other simulating duodenum conditions. the model was tested by comparing survival of bacteria isolated from humans (bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus acidophilus) animals (bifidobacterium  animalis, 2 strains), and fermented dairy products (bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus kefir, lactobacillus kefirgranum, and leuconostoc mesenteroides) with their survival as determined by conventional methods. five strains were not  able to survive (>3 log reduction) 15 min in a medium acidified at ph 2.0 using the conventional testing method, but survival was improved significantly for some strains in the dynamic model. two strains (bifidobacterium animalis atcc 25527 and lactobacillus johnsonii la-1 ncc 533) showed good survival with both methods. the dynamic model was shown to better represent the events during upper gi tract  transit than the conventional methods, by incorporation of a food matrix to buffer the gastric acidity and therefore expose bacteria to ph levels found in vivo before, during, and after a meal.

TI  == growth and metabolism of selected strains of probiotic bacteria in milk.
AB  == growth and metabolism of five probiotic strains with well-documented health effects were studied in ultra-high temperature (uht) treated milk, supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) tryptone or 0.75% (w/v) fructose. the probiotic strains were lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lb. acidophilus 1748, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg,  lactobacillus reuteri sd 2112 and bifidobacterium animalis bb12. fermentation was followed for 72 h at 37 degrees c and the samples were analysed for ph, log cfu ml(-1), volatile compounds, organic acids and carbon dioxide. the strains reduced ph from 6.7 to between 3.9 and 4.4 after 24 h of incubation. all strains attained viable cell counts above 8.7-9.18 log cfu ml(-1) after 6-16 h of incubation. the  two lb. acidophilus strains showed a stable level of viable cells during 12-72 h  of incubation but the three other strains showed a reduction of 0.4-1.1 log cfu ml(-1) from 24 to 72 h of incubation. however, all strains showed cell levels between 7.8 and 8.7 log cfu ml(-1) after 72 h of incubation. after 48 h of incubation, the amount of lactic acid produced varied according to strain from 6949 to 14,000 mg kg(-1) and acetic acid produced varied from 0 to 6901 mg kg(-1). three of the strains metabolised citrate but only low amounts of diacetyl and acetoin were detected within strains, 0.2-0.8 and 6.5-10 mg kg(-1), respectively. carbon dioxide produced varied from 221 to 3942 mg kg(-1) and was connected to the citrate-fermenting ability of the strain used and their carbohydrate fermentation pathway. three of the strains produced detectable levels of acetaldehyde and the concentration varied from 9.4 to 12.6 mg kg(-1) after 24 h of incubation. all five probiotic strains showed very different profiles of metabolites during fermentation; however, the two lb. acidophilus strains were the most alike. our findings show the importance of controlling the  fermentation time since the probiotic strains produced different amounts of metabolic products according to fermentation time.

TI  == effects of different probiotic strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on bacterial translocation and liver injury in an acute liver injury model.
AB  == septic complications represent frequent causes of morbidity in liver diseases and following hepatic operations. most infections are caused by the individual own intestinal microflora. the intestinal microflora composition is important in physiological and pathophysiological processes in the human gastrointestinal tract, but their influence on liver in different situations is unclear. we therefore studied the effect of different lactobacillus strains and a bifidobacterium strain on the extent of liver injury, bacterial translocation and intestinal microflora in an acute liver injury model. sprague-dawley rats were divided into five groups: acute liver injury control, acute liver injury + b. animalis nm2, acute liver injury + l. acidophilus nmi, acute liver injury + l. rhamnosus atcc 53103, and acute liver injury + l. rhamnosus dsm 6594 and l. plantarum dsm 9843. the bacteria were administered rectally daily for 8 days. liver injury was induced on the 8th day by intraperitoneal injection of d-galactosamine (1.1 g/kg bw). samples were collected 24 h after the liver injury. liver enzymes and bilirubin serum levels, bacterial translocation (to arterial and portal blood, liver and mesenteric lymph nodes (mlns)), and intestinal microflora were evaluated. l. acidophilus nm1; l. rhamnosus atcc 53103, and l. rhamnosus dsm 6594 + l. plantarum dsm 9843 decreased bacterial translocation compared to the liver injury control group. b. animalis nm2 increased bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes. the levels of alanine aminotransferase (alat) were significantly lower in the l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus atcc 53103, l. rhamnosus dsm 6594 + l. plantarum dsm 9843 groups compared to the liver injury group. the l. rhamnosus and l. rhamnosus + l. plantarum groups significantly reduced alat levels compared to the b. animalis group. all administered bacteria decreased the enterobacteriaceae count in the cecum and colon. administration of different lactobacilli and a bifidobacterium strain in an acute liver injury rat model, has shown different effects on bacterial translocation and hepatocellular damage. l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus,  and l. rhamnosus + l. plantarum reduced bacterial translocation and hepatocellular damage. b. animalis nm2 increased bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes and did not affect hepatocellular damage.

TI  == a probiotic strain of l. acidophilus reduces dmh-induced large intestinal tumors  in male sprague-dawley rats.
AB  == probiotic bacteria strains were examined for their influence on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh)-induced intestinal tumors in 100 male sprague-dawley  rats. lactobacillus acidophilus (delvo pro la-1), lactobacillus rhamnosus (gg), bifidobacterium animalis (cscc1941), and streptococcus thermophilus (dd145) strains were examined for their influence when added as freeze-dried bacteria to  an experimental diet based on a high-fat semipurified (ain-93) rodent diet. four  bacterial treatments were compared: l. acidophilus, l. acidophilus + b. animalis, l. rhamnosus, and s. thermophilus, the bacteria being added daily at 1% freeze-dried weight (10(10) colony-forming units/g) to the diet. trends were observed in the incidence of rats with large intestinal tumors for three treatments: 25% lower than control for l. acidophilus, 20% lower for l. acidophilus + b. animalis and l. rhamnosus treatments, and 10% lower for s. thermophilus. large intestinal tumor burden was significantly lower for treated rats with l. acidophilus than for the control group (10 and 3 tumors/treatment group, respectively, p = 0.05). large intestinal tumor mass index was also lower  for the l. acidophilus treatment than for control (1.70 and 0.10, respectively, p < 0.05). other treatments showed no statistically significant change from control for these indexes of tumorigenesis. for rats fed l. acidophilus, no adenocarcinomas were present in the colons. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of bacterial chromosomal dna fragments was used to differentiate introduced (exogenous) bacterial strains from indigenous bacteria of the same genera present in the feces. survival during gut passage and displacement of indigenous lactobacilli occurred with introduced l. acidophilus and l. rhamnosus gg during the probiotic treatment period. however, introduced strains of b. animalis and s. thermophilus were not able to be isolated from feces. it is concluded that this strain of l. acidophilus supplied as freeze-dried bacteria in the diet was protective, as seen by a small but significant inhibition of tumors within the rat colon.
