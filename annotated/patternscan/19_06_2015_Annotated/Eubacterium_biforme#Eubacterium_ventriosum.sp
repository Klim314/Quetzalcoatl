TI  == quantification of different eubacterium spp. in human fecal samples with species-specific 16s rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes.
AB  == species-specific 16s rrna-targeted, cy3 (indocarbocyanine)-labeled oligonucleotide probes were designed and validated to quantify different eubacterium species in human fecal samples. probes were directed at eubacterium barkeri, e. biforme, e. contortum, e. cylindroides (two probes), e. dolichum, e.  hadrum, e. lentum, e. limosum, e. moniliforme, and e. ventriosum. the specificity of the probes was tested with the type strains and a range of common intestinal bacteria. with one exception, none of the probes showed cross-hybridization under stringent conditions. the species-specific probes were applied to fecal samples obtained from 12 healthy volunteers. e. biforme, e. cylindroides, e. hadrum, e. lentum, and e. ventriosum could be determined. all other eubacterium species for  which probes had been designed were under the detection limit of 10(7) cells g (dry weight) of feces(-1). the cell counts obtained are essentially in accordance with the literature data, which are based on colony counts. this shows that whole-cell in situ hybridization with species-specific probes is a valuable tool  for the enumeration of eubacterium species in feces.
