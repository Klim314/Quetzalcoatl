TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == bacterial adhesion on the titanium and zirconia abutment surfaces.
AB  == objective: microorganisms harboring the oral cavity, mainly those related to periodontal diseases, are the most potential etiologic factor of failure in long-term implant treatment. the material used for abutment components may influence the adhesion and colonization of microbial species. the aim of this in  vivo investigation was to evaluate the biofilm formation on machined (mpt) or cast titanium (cpt) and zirconia abutments (zc). methods: six healthy subjects were enrolled in this randomized crossover clinical investigation. the study was  conducted in three phases according to abutment surface evaluated. each subject used an individual oral splint containing four disks of the same tested substrate, two located in the anterior and two in the posterior region, totalizing 12 specimens for subject. participants were asked to use the removable intraoral splint during 24 h. dna checkerboard hybridization method was used to identify and quantify 38 bacterial species colonizing formed biofilm on the abutment substrates. results: pathogens and non-pathogens species were found colonizing the three substrates surfaces. fusobacterium nucleatum, neisseria mucosa, porphyromonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobios, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus parasanguinis, and tanerella forsythia were the only species with no significant differences over the tested materials (p > 0.05). all the other target species presented significant differences sought by friedman test (p < 0.0001). conclusions: there was a significant difference in the total bacterial count between the three groups. cpt presented the higher mean counts, followed by mpt and zc. cpt group also showed a higher mean incidence of species than mpt and zc. the anterior or posterior region of disks placement did not show significant differences in relation to bacterial adhesion.

TI  == gap1 functions as a molecular chaperone to stabilize its interactive partner gap3 during biogenesis of serine-rich repeat bacterial adhesin.
AB  == serine-rich repeat glycoproteins (srrps) are important bacterial adhesins that are conserved in streptococci and staphylococci. fimbriae-associated protein (fap1) from streptococcus parasanguinis, was the first srrp identified; it plays  an important role in bacterial biofilm formation. a gene cluster encoding glycosyltransferases and accessory secretion components is required for fap1 biogenesis. two glycosylation-associated proteins, gap1 and gap3 within the cluster, interact with each other and function in concert in fap1 biogenesis. here we report the new molecular events underlying contribution of the interaction to fap1 biogenesis. the gap1-deficient mutant rendered gap3 unstable  and degraded in vitro and in vivo. inactivation of a gene encoding protease clpp  reversed the phenotype of the gap1 mutant, suggesting that clpp is responsible for degradation of gap3. molecular chaperone groel was co-purified with gap3 only when gap1 was absent and also reacted with gap1 monoclonal antibody, suggesting that gap1 functions as a specific chaperone for gap3. the n-terminal interacting  domains of gap1 mediated the gap3 stability and fap1 biogenesis. gap1 homologues  from streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus also interacted with and  stabilized corresponding gap3 homologues, suggesting that the chaperone activity  of the gap1 homologues is common in biogenesis of srrps.
