TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == evaluation of bacterial nitrate reduction in the human oral cavity.
AB  == it is hypothesized that the enterosalivary nitrate circulation encourages nitrate reducing bacteria to reside within the oral cavity. nitrite production may then limit the growth of acidogenic bacteria as a result of the production of antimicrobial oxides of nitrogen, including nitric oxide. this study was carried  out with 10 subjects to characterize oral nitrate reduction and identify the bacteria responsible. nitrate reduction varied between individuals (mean 85.4 +/- 15.9 nmol nitrite min(-1) with 10 ml 1 mm kno(3) mouth wash) and was found to be  concentrated at the rear of the tongue dorsal surface. nitrate reductase positive isolates identified, using 16s rdna sequencing, from the tongue comprised veillonella atypica (34%), veillonella dispar (24%), actinomyces odontolyticus (21%), actinomyces naeslundii (2%), rothia mucilaginosa (10%), rothia dentocariosa (3%) and staphylococcus epidermidis (5%). nitrite production rates,  using intact and permeabilized cells, of the major tongue nitrate reducers were determined in the presence of methyl and benzyl viologen. under anaerobic conditions in the presence of nitrate, rates in decreasing order were: a. odontolyticus > r. mucilaginosa > r. dentocariosa > v. dispar > v. atypica. in conclusion, veillonella spp. were found to be the most prevalent taxa isolated and thus may make a major contribution to nitrate reduction in the oral cavity.
