TI  == growth characteristics and biofilm formation of various spoilage bacteria isolated from fresh produce.
AB  == this study investigated the characteristics of spoilage bacteria isolated from fresh produce including growth at various temperatures, biofilm formation, cell hydrophobicity, and colony spreading. the number of spoilage bacteria present when stored at 35 degrees c was significantly greater than when stored at lower temperatures, and maximum population size was achieved after 10 h. however, bacillus pumilus, dickeya zeae, pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum pcc21, and bacillus pumilus (rda-r) did not grow at the storage temperature of 5  degrees c. the biofilm formation by clavibacter michiganensis, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and a. calcoaceticus (rda-r) are higher than other spoilage bacteria. biofilm formation showed low correlation between hydrophobicity, and no significant correlation with colony spreading. these results might be used for developing safe storage guidelines for fresh produce at various storage temperatures, and could be basic information on the growth characteristics and biofilm formation properties of spoilage bacteria from fresh produce. practical application: growth of spoilage bacteria was different depending on the bacteria  strains and storage temperature. between biofilm formation and cell hydrophobicity was low correlation on spoilage bacteria. therefore, growth characteristics and biofilm formation of spoilage bacteria might be used for developing safe storage guidelines for fresh produce at various storage temperatures.

TI  == functional characterization of the sucrose isomerase responsible for trehalulose  production in plant-associated pectobacterium species.
AB  == fifty-three plant-associated microorganisms were investigated for their ability to convert sucrose to its isomers. these microorganisms included one dickeya zeae isolate and 7 enterobacter, 3 pantoea, and 43 pectobacterium species. eleven out  of the 53 strains (21%) showed the ability to transform sucrose to isomaltulose and trehalulose. among those, pectobacterium carotovorum kkh 3-1 showed the highest bioconversion yield (97.4%) from sucrose to its isomers. in this strain,  the addition of up to 14% sucrose in the medium enhanced sucrose isomerase (siase) production. the siase activity at 14% sucrose (47.6 u/mg dcw) was about 3.6-fold higher than that of the negative control (13.3 u/mg dcw at 0% sucrose).  the gene encoding siase, which is comprised a 1776 bp open reading frame (orf) encoding 591 amino acids, was cloned from p. carotovorum kkh 3-1 and expressed in escherichia coli. the recombinant siase (pcsi) was shown to have optimum activity at ph 6.0 and 40 degrees c. the reaction temperature significantly affected the ratio of sucrose isomers produced by pcsi. the amount of trehalulose increased from 47.5% to 79.1% as temperature was lowered from 50 degrees c to 30 degrees c, implying that siase activity can be controlled by reaction temperature.

TI  == specificity of monoclonal antibodies to strains of dickeya sp. that cause bacterial heart rot of pineapple.
AB  == during a severe outbreak of bacterial heart rot that occurred in pineapple plantations on oahu, hawaii, in 2003 and years following, 43 bacterial strains were isolated from diseased plants or irrigation water and identified as erwinia  chrysanthemi (now dickeya sp.) by phenotypic, molecular, and pathogenicity assays. rep-pcr fingerprint patterns grouped strains from pineapple plants and irrigation water into five genotypes (a-e) that differed from representatives of  other dickeya species, pectobacterium carotovorum and other enteric saprophytes isolated from pineapple. monoclonal antibodies produced following immunization of mice with virulent type c dickeya sp. showed only two specificities. mab pine-1 (2d11g1, igg1 with kappa light chain) reacted to all 43 pineapple/water strains and some reference strains (d. dianthicola, d. chrysanthemi, d. paradisiaca, some d. dadantii, and uncharacterized dickeya sp.) but did not react to reference strains of d. dieffenbachiae, d. zeae, or one of the two malaysian pineapple strains. mab pine-2 (2a7f2, igg3 with kappa light chain) reacted to all type b, c, and d strains but not to any a or e strains or any reference strains except dickeya sp. isolated from malaysian pineapple. pathogenicity tests showed that type c strains were more aggressive than type a strains when inoculated during cool months. therefore, mab pine-2 distinguishes the more virulent type c strains from less virulent type a pineapple strains and type e water strains. mabs with these two specificities enable development of rapid diagnostic tests that will distinguish the systemic heart rot pathogen from opportunistic bacteria associated with rotted tissues. use of the two mabs in field assays also permits  the monitoring of a known subpopulation and provides additional decision tools for disease containment and management practices.
