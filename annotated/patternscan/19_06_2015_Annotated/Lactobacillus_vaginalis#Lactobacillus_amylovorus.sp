TI  == detection and characterisation of lactobacillus spp. in the bovine uterus and their influence on bovine endometrial epithelial cells in vitro.
AB  == bacterial infections and inflammation of the uterus are common in dairy cattle after parturition. in particular, pathogenic bacteria that cause endometritis have been the focus of research in cattle reproduction in the last ten years. the aim of the present study was to identify commensal lactobacilli in the bovine uterus and to examine their influence on the synthesis of pro-inflammatory factors in bovine endometrial epithelial cells in vitro. lactobacillus species were isolated from healthy bovine uteri and further characterised. bovine endometrial epithelial cells in the second passage (n = 5 animals) were co-cultured with the autochthonous isolates l. buchneri, l. ruminis and l. amylovorus as well as with a commercially available l. vaginalis in different multiplicities of infection (moi = 1, 5 and 10, respectively). endometrial epithelial cells cultured without bacteria served as controls. at distinct points in time (2, 4 and 6 h) total rna was extracted from co-cultured epithelial cells  and subjected to reverse transcription quantitative pcr of pro-inflammatory factors. furthermore, the release of such factors by co-cultured epithelial cells was measured by elisa or eia after 24 and 48 h. l. ruminis and l. amylovorus induced increased interleukin (il) il1a, il6, il8 and prostaglandin-endoperoxide  synthase 2 mrna levels and the release of il8 and prostaglandin f(2alpha) in endometrial epithelial cells compared with control cells. in contrast, l. buchneri did not significantly influence the expression and release of these factors. toll-like receptors 2 and 6 transcripts were found unchanged in co-cultured and untreated epithelial cells in vitro. however, endometrial epithelial cells of each animal showed individual differences in the response to  bacterial load. these results suggest that lactobacillus species are present in the bovine uterus, revealing immunomodulatory properties.

TI  == the natural antimicrobial subtilosin a synergizes with lauramide arginine ethyl ester (lae), epsilon-poly-l-lysine (polylysine), clindamycin phosphate and metronidazole, against the vaginal pathogen gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common, recurrent vaginal infection linked to increased chances of preterm delivery, incidence of sexually transmitted infections and fertility problems. bv is caused by a shift of the vaginal ecosystem from predominately lactobacillus to a multispecies actinomyces biofilm  with the most common representatives identified as gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella spp. current treatments have been associated with increased resistance as well as negative effects on healthy microbiota. the objective of this study was to evaluate the synergistic potential of ten two-antimicrobial combinations against g. vaginalis and four representative lactobacilli. the four tested antimicrobials were lauramide arginine ethyl ester, epsilon-poly-l-lysine, clindamycin phosphate, metronidazole and the bacteriocin subtilosin a. the use of bacteriocins as either synergist or alternative treatment positions bacteriocins  as an excellent alternative to current antibiotics. the microdilution method was  used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of each of the antimicrobials individually, and the checkerboard assay was used to evaluate these mics in combination. clindamycin and subtilosin (cs), and metronidazole and subtilosin were synergistic against g. vaginalis in terms of fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici). all tested combinations were found to have bliss synergy. the combination of clindamycin and polylysine (cp) was identified  as antagonistic against l. acidophilus in terms of both fici and bliss synergy. the combination of clindamycin and metronidazole (cm) was antagonistic against l. vaginalis for both fici and bliss synergy. the combinations of cp, clindamycin and lae, cs, and lae and polylysine were identified as bliss antagonistic against l. vaginalis but did not indicate fici antagonism.

TI  == naturally occurring lactic acid bacteria isolated from tomato pomace silage.
AB  == silage making has become a significant method of forage conservation worldwide. to determine how tomato pomace (tp) may be used effectively as animal feed, it was ensilaged for 90 days and microbiology counts, fermentation characteristics and chemical composition of tomato pomace silage (tps) were evaluated at the 30th, 60th, and 90th days, respectively. in addition, 103 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from tps. based on the phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, 16s rdna sequence and carbohydrate fermentation tests, the isolates were identified as 17 species namely: lactobacillus coryniformis subsp.  torquens (0.97%), lactobacillus pontis (0.97%), lactobacillus hilgardii (0.97%),  lactobacillus pantheris (0.97%), lactobacillus amylovorus (1.9%), lactobacillus panis (1.9%), lactobacillus vaginalis (1.9%), lactobacillus rapi (1.9%), lactobacillus buchneri (2.9%), lactobacillus parafarraginis (2.9%), lactobacillus helveticus (3.9%), lactobacillus camelliae (3.9%), lactobacillus fermentum (5.8%), lactobacillus manihotivorans (6.8%), lactobacillus plantarum (10.7%), lactobacillus harbinensis (16.5%) and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (35.0%). this study has shown that tp can be well preserved for 90 days by ensilaging and that tps is not only rich in essential nutrients, but that physiological and biochemical properties of the isolates could provide a platform for future design of lactic acid bacteria (lab) inoculants aimed at improving the fermentation quality of silage.

TI  == polyethylene glycol-based hydrogels for controlled release of the antimicrobial subtilosin for prophylaxis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == current treatment options for bacterial vaginosis (bv) have been shown to be inadequate at preventing recurrence and do not provide protection against associated infections, such as that with hiv. this study examines the feasibility of incorporating the antimicrobial peptide subtilosin within covalently cross-linked polyethylene glycol (peg)-based hydrogels for vaginal administration. the peg-based hydrogels (4% and 6% [wt/vol]) provided a two-phase release of subtilosin, with an initial rapid release rate of 4.0 mug/h (0 to 12 h) followed by a slow, sustained release rate of 0.26 mug/h (12 to 120 h). the subtilosin-containing hydrogels inhibited the growth of the major bv-associated pathogen gardnerella vaginalis with a reduction of 8 log10 cfu/ml with hydrogels  containing >/=15 mug entrapped subtilosin. in addition, the growth of four common species of vaginal lactobacilli was not significantly inhibited in the presence of the subtilosin-containing hydrogels. the above findings demonstrate the potential application of vaginal subtilosin-containing hydrogels for prophylaxis  of bv.

TI  == benzoyl peroxide formulated polycarbophil/carbopol 934p hydrogel with selective antimicrobial activity, potentially beneficial for treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == the human vagina is colonized by a variety of indigenous microflora; in healthy individuals the predominant bacterial genus is lactobacillus while those with bacterial vaginosis (bv) carry a variety of anaerobic representatives of the phylum actinobacteria. in this study, we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of  benzoyl peroxide (bpo) encapsulated in a hydrogel against gardnerella vaginalis,  one of the causative agents of bv, as well as indicating its safety for healthy human lactobacilli. herein, it is shown that in well diffusion assays g. vaginalis is inhibited at 0.01% hydrogel-encapsulated bpo and that the tested lactobacillus spp. can tolerate concentrations of bpo up to 2.5%. in direct contact assays (cells grown in a liquid culture containing hydrogel with 1% bpo or bpo particles), we demonstrated that hydrogels loaded with 1% bpo caused 6-log reduction of g. vaginalis. conversely, three of the tested lactobacillus spp. were not inhibited while l. acidophilus growth was slightly delayed. the rheological properties of the hydrogel formulation were probed using oscillation  frequency sweep, oscillation shear stress sweep, and shear rate sweep. this shows the gel to be suitable for vaginal application and that the encapsulation of bpo  did not alter rheological properties.

TI  == spermicidal and anti-trichomonas vaginalis activity of brazilian sapindus saponaria.
AB  == background: sapindus saponaria is used traditionally for curing ulcers, external  wounds and inflammations. the spermicidal and anti-trichomonas activity of s. saponaria and its effect on lactobacillus acidophilus were evaluated. methods: water-ethanol (we) and butanolic (be) extracts, as well as a purified sample of saponins (sp) from s. saponaria were tested for spermicidal and anti-trichomonas  activity and for their effect on l. acidophilus. results: we, be and sp immobilized spermatozoa at a minimum effective concentration (mec) of 2.5 (gram %) for extracts and 1.25 (gram %) for sp. the effective concentrations that caused 50% immobilization of spermatozoa (ec(5)(0)) were 0.5 (gram %) for we and  sp, and 0.1 (gram %) for be. the compounds were effective against trichomonas vaginalis (minimum inhibitory concentration = 0.156 mg/ml for we and be, and 0.078 mg/ml for sp against a clinical strain (cs); and 0.312, 0.156 and 0.078 mg/ml for we, be and sp, respectively, against an atcc strain). in all concentrations tested, the growth of l. acidophilus was not reduced. conclusion:  the in vitro study proved the spermicidal and anti-trichomonas activity of s. saponaria. complementary in vivo studies should be made for establish the use as  a vaginal spermicide, particularly in brazil and latin america.

TI  == transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants between lactobacilli isolates from the gastrointestinal tract of chicken.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the potential horizontal transfer of genetic  traits for antibiotic resistance between lactobacilli isolated from the chicken gut, both in vitro and in vivo. thirty-seven lactobacillus spp. strains isolated  from the gizzard, small and large intestines and caeca of free-range broiler chickens showed multi-drug resistance as assessed by disc diffusion assays. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for vancomycin, tetracycline, erythromycin and chloramphenicol was determined in de man, rogosa and sharpe broth in a microplate assay. almost all the lactobacilli isolates were resistant to vancomycin (except strains belonging to the lactobacillus acidophilus group) and  to tetracycline (mic>/=128 mug/ml). only five strains were resistant to erythromycin, and six to chloramphenicol. the transfer rate in filter mating experiments performed using l. acidophilus strain 4m14e (emr), lactobacillus vaginalis strain 5m14e (cmr), lactobacillus salivarius strain 5c14c (emr), and the 4g14l and 3c14c strains of lactobacillus reuteri (cmr) showed a frequency of  approximately 1x104 cfu/ml of double-resistant transconjugants for the different  combinations. the exception was the l. salivarius 5c14c (emr) and l. vaginalis 5m14e (cmr) mating combination, which produced no transconjugants. in vivo experiments performed in gnotobiotic mice by mating l. acidophilus 4m14e (emr) with l. reuteri 3c14c (cmr), l. reuteri 4g14l (cmr) or l. vaginalis 5m14e (cmr) resulted in transconjugants at 3.95+/-0.29, 3.16+/-0.33, and 4.55+/-1.52 log10 cfu/g of faeces, respectively. taken together, these data suggest that genetic exchange may occur between native bacterial strains within the gastrointestinal tract of chickens, which might maintain a dynamic gene pool conferring antibiotic resistance upon indigenous microbiota components, even in the absence of the pathogens. this possibility must be taken into account as a complementary criterion when lactobacilli are screened for probiotic use.

TI  == evidence for gardnerella vaginalis uptake and internalization by squamous vaginal epithelial cells: implications for the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv), a common condition seen in premenopausal women, is associated with preterm labor, pelvic inflammatory disease, and delivery of low birth weight infants. gardnerella vaginalis is the predominant bacterial species  associated with bv, although its exact role in the pathology of bv is unknown. using immunofluorescence, confocal and transmission electron microscopy, we found that vk2 vaginal epithelial cells take up g. vaginalis after exposure to the bacteria. confocal microscopy also indicated the presence of internalized g. vaginalis within vaginal epithelial cells obtained from a subject with bv. using  vk2 cells and (35)s labeled bacteria in an invasion assay, we found that a 1 h uptake of g. vaginalis was 21.8-fold higher than heat-killed g. vaginalis, 84-fold compared to lactobacillus acidophilus and 6.6-fold compared to lactobacillus crispatus. internalization was inhibited by pre-exposure of cells to cytochalasin-d. in addition, the cytoskeletal protein vimentin was upregulated in vk2 cells exposed to g. vaginalis, but there was no change in actin cytoskeletal polymerization/rearrangements or vimentin subcellular relocalization post exposure. cytoskeletal protein modifications could represent a potential mechanism for g. vaginalis mediated internalization by vaginal epithelial cells.  finally, understanding vaginal bacteria/host interactions will allow us to better understand the underlying mechanisms of bv pathogenesis.

TI  == murine models of vaginal trichomonad infections.
AB  == trichomonas vaginalis and tritrichomonas foetus cause common sexually transmitted infections in humans and cattle, respectively. mouse models of trichomoniasis are important for pathogenic and therapeutic studies. here, we compared murine genital infections with t. vaginalis and t. foetus. persistent vaginal infection  with t. foetus was established with 100 parasites but t. vaginalis infection required doses of 10(6), perhaps because of greater susceptibility to killing by  mouse vaginal polymorphonuclear leukocytes. infection with t. vaginalis persisted longest after combined treatment of mice with estrogen and dexamethasone, whereas infection was only short-lived when mice were given estrogen or dexamethasone alone, co-infected with lactobacillus acidophilus, and/or pretreated with antibiotics. infection rates were similar with metronidazole-resistant (mr) and metronidazole-sensitive (ms) t. vaginalis. high dose but not low dose metronidazole treatment controlled infection with ms better than mr t. vaginalis. these murine models will be valuable for investigating the pathogenesis and treatment of trichomoniasis.

TI  == effect of grape polyphenols on lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria growth: resistance and metabolism.
AB  == food polyphenols are able to selectively modify the growth of susceptible micro-organisms. this study describes the effect of a flavan-3-ol enriched grape  seed extract (gse) on the growth of several lactic acid bacteria (lab) and bifidobacteria and the ability of the resistant strains to metabolize these compounds. streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus vaginalis strains showed a remarkable sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, including a gse fraction consisting mainly in (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin (gse-m). on the other hand, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus bulgaricus strains reached maximal growth with the gse fractions, including a rich-oligomeric (gse-o) fraction. within bifidobacteria, bifidobacterium lactis bb12 showed the highest sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, whereas bifidobacterium breve 26m2  and bifidobacterium bifidum hdd541 reached maximum growth in presence of gse-o and gse-m fractions. metabolism of flavan-3-ols by lab and bifidobacteria resistant strains was investigated in vitro. the results revealed that only l. plantarum ifpl935 was able to metabolize the polyphenols studied by means of galloyl-esterase, decarboxylase and benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase activities that  led to the formation of gallic acid, pyrogallol and catechol, respectively. an unknown metabolite that does not exhibit a phenolic-acid-type structure was also  detected, which suggests a new enzyme activity in l. plantarum ifpl935 able to degrade flavan-3-ol monomers.

TI  == (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting of lactobacilli isolated from cervix of healthy women.
AB  == a group of lactobacilli isolated from the cervix of 31 healthy women was characterized by (gtg)(5)-polymerase chain reaction (pcr) fingerprinting in order to evaluate this method for identification of vaginal lactobacilli. obtained fingerprints were compared with profiles available in an in-house database of the ccm bacteria collection covering type and reference strains of multiple lactic acid bacteria including lactobacilli. selected strains representing individual clusters were further identified by phes gene sequencing. in total, six lactobacillus species were found among lactobacilli isolated from the cervix of healthy women. the (gtg)(5)-pcr method identified lactobacillus gasseri (11 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (one), and some of the lactobacillus jensenii strains (eight out of 11), but failed to identify the remaining strains, including the lactobacillus crispatus (18), lactobacillus mucosae (one), and lactobacillus vaginalis (one) species. l. jensenii strains were distributed over  two fingerprint clusters. the majority of samples was dominated by one (gtg)(5)-pcr type. the rep-pcr fingerprinting using the (gtg)(5) primer allowed straightforward identification of many, but not all, isolates. this method has been shown to be a useful tool for fast screening and grouping of vaginal lactobacilli, but its combination with another identification method is needed to obtain reliable identification results. in addition, lactobacillus acidophilus was not shown to be the most common inhabitant of the female genital tract as generally assumed.

TI  == characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  == the study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented foods in xi'an, china. lab strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of lactobacillus (n = 73), and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and s. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of lactobacillus. the erm(b) gene was detected from two strains of each of l. fermentum and l. vaginalis, and one strain of each of l. plantarum, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, l. animalis, and s. thermophilus. the tet genes were  identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. this is the first time, the authors identified tet(s) gene from l. brevis and l. kefiri. the  erm(b) gene from l. fermentum nwl24 and l. salivarius nwl33, and tet(m) gene from l. plantarum nwl22 and l. brevis nwl59 were successfully transferred to enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. it was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in xi'an, china and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.

TI  == correlation between api 50 ch and multiplex polymerase chain reaction for the identification of vaginal lactobacilli in isolates.
AB  == identification of lactobacillus sp. strains by phenotypic methods may lead to doubtful results possibly interfering in the reliability of the epidemiological and probiotics studies. therefore this study aimed to determine the best methodology for the identification of the large diversity of lactobacilli species found in the vagina by comparing two techniques, one based on their biochemical profile and other employing molecular biology. a carbohydrate fermentation test (api 50 ch) was compared with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for the identification of species of vaginal lactobacilli from 135 healthy women. the kappa index was used to evaluate agreement between the methods. using the molecular technique, l. crispatus (32.6%), l. jensenii (25%) and l. gasseri (20.6%) were the most frequent species. however, using the biochemical technique, the most frequent species were: l. acidophilus (34.8%), l. crispatus (27.2%) and  l. fermentum (13%). although l. acidophilus was the most frequent specie found by biochemical tests, no strain of this microorganism was detected by pcr. agreement between the methods was low for identification of all the most common species. although rates of l. crispatus detected were similar using both methods (32.6% and 27.2%), agreement between them was relatively low (kappa = 0.52). conclusions: our results confirmed the limitation of the biochemical method and the applicability of a previously published molecular method (multiplex pcr) for  the identification of lactobacilli in the vaginal tract, focusing on further necessity of its improvement for also targeting l. vaginalis and l. iners.

TI  == efficacy of vaginal probiotic capsules for recurrent bacterial vaginosis: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
AB  == objective: we assessed the effectiveness of vaginal probiotic capsules for recurrent bacterial vaginosis (bv) prevention. study design: one hundred twenty healthy chinese women with a history of recurrent bv were assigned randomly to daily vaginal prophylaxis with 1 capsule (probaclac vaginal; nicar laboratories,  inc, blainville, quebec, canada) that contained 8 billion colony-forming units of lactobacillus rhamnosus, l acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 58 women) or 1 placebo capsule (n = 62 women) for 7 days on, 7 days off, and 7 days  on. results: probiotic prophylaxis resulted in lower recurrence rates for bv (15.8% [9/57 women] vs 45.0% [27/60 women]; p < .001) and gardnerella vaginalis incidence through 2 months (3.5% [2/57 women] vs 18.3% [11/60 women]; p = .02). between the 2- and 11-month follow-up period, women who received probiotics reported a lower incidence of bv and g vaginalis. aside from vaginal discharge and malodor, no adverse events were reported in either study group. conclusion: short-term probiotic prophylaxis is well tolerated and reduces bv recurrence and  g vaginalis risk through 11 months after treatment.

TI  == microbial risk markers for childhood caries in pediatricians' offices.
AB  == dental caries in pre-school children has significant public health and health disparity implications. to determine microbial risk markers for this infection, this study aimed to compare the microbiota of children with early childhood caries with that of caries-free children. plaque samples from incisors, molars, and the tongue from 195 children attending pediatricians' offices were assayed by 74 dna probes and by pcr to streptococcus mutans. caries-associated factors included visible plaque, child age, race, and snacking habits. species were detected more frequently from tooth than tongue samples. lactobacillus gasseri (p < 0.01), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus vaginalis, and s. mutans with streptococcus sobrinus (all p < 0.05) were positively associated with caries. by  multifactorial analysis, the probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus was negatively associated with caries. prevotella nigrescens was the only species (p < 0.05) significantly associated with caries by the 'false discovery' rate. analysis of the data suggests that selected lactobacillus species, in addition to mutans streptococci, are risk markers for early childhood caries.

TI  == vaginal lactobacilli as potential probiotics against candida spp.
AB  == urogenital infections affect millions of people every year worldwide. the treatment of these diseases usually requires the use of antimicrobial agents, and more recently, the use of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab) cultures for the management of vaginal infections has been extensively studied. in this work, 11 vaginal lactobacilli isolates, previously obtained from healthy patients, were studied to screen microorganisms with probiotic properties against candida spp. the lab were tested for their ability of auto-aggregation, co-aggregation with c. albicans, c. glabrata, c. krusei, and c. tropicalis, adhesion to caco-2 epithelial cells and production of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2). all  lactobacilli isolates tested were able to auto-aggregate (ranging from 25.3% to 75.4% assessed at 4 hours of incubation) and to co-aggregate with the four candida species into different degrees; among them l. crispatus showed the highest scores of co-aggregation. the highest amount of lactic acid was produced  by l. salivarius (13.9 g/l), followed by l. johnsonii (6.5 g/l), l. acidophilus (5.5 g/l), and l. jensenii (5.4 g/l). all isolates produced h2o2, but the highest levels (3 - 10 mg/l) were observed for l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. gasseri,  l. johnsonii, and l. vaginalis. only l. agilis, l. jensenii, l. johnsonii and l.  ruminus were able to adhere to epithelial caco-2 cells. among the isolates evaluated, l agilis, l. jensenii, l. johnsonii, and l. ruminus exhibited simultaneously several desirable properties as potential probiotic strains justifying future studies to evaluate their technological properties in different pharmaceutical preparations for human use.

TI  == gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacillus sp in liquid-based cervical samples in healthy and disturbed vaginal flora using cultivation-independent methods.
AB  == our objective was to determine the morphotype of the adherent bacteria in liquid-based cytology (lbc) in smears with healthy and disturbed vaginal flora. and to use pcr technology on the same fixed cell sample to establish dna patterns of the 16s rna genes of the bacteria in the sample. thirty samples were randomly  selected from a large group of cervical cell samples suspended in a commercial coagulant fixative "(boonfix)." pcr was used to amplify dna of five bacterial species: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii, gardnerella vaginalis, and mycoplasma hominis. the lbc slides were then analyzed by light microscopy to estimate bacterial adhesion. dna of lactobacilli  was detected in all cell samples. seventeen smears showed colonization with gardnerella vaginalis (range 2.6 x 10(2)-3.0 x 10(5) bacteria/mul boonfix sample). two cases were identified as dysbacteriotic with high dna values for gardnerella vaginalis and low values for lactobacillus crispatus. the sample with the highest concentration for gardnerella vaginalis showed an unequivocal gardnerella infection. this study indicates that the adherence pattern of a disturbed flora in liquid-based cervical samples can be identified unequivocally, and that these samples are suitable for quantitative pcr analysis. this cultivation independent method reveals a strong inverse relationship between gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacillus crispatus in dysbacteriosis and unequivocal gardnerella infection.

TI  == characterization of dominant cultivable lactobacilli and their antibiotic resistance profiles from faecal samples of weaning piglets.
AB  == aims: to examine the lactic acid bacteria flora of weaning piglets, to define the distribution of different lactobacilli species in piglet faecal samples, and to determine the susceptibility phenotype to 11 antibiotic of different families. methods and results: the faecal samples were taken from piglets with good herd status at 11 and 28 days after weaning. the lactobacillus isolates (n = 129) from 78 animals housed in pairs in 39 pens were preliminarily identified by their morphology and biochemical characteristics. partial 16s ribosomal dna (16s rdna)  was used to identify the isolates to the species level, and rapd (randomly amplified polymorphism dna) profiles to differentiate lactobacillus isolates to the strain level. based on these studies, 67 strains were selected for antibiotic resistant tests. the most numerous lactobacillus species found in the piglets was lactobacillus reuteri (n = 43). other lactobacilli were l. salivarius (n = 15), l. agilis (n = 4), l. johnsonii (n = 2), l. vaginalis (n = 1), l. mucosae (n = 1) and l. gallinarum (n = 1). all the strains were susceptible to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and gentamicin. two l. salivarius isolates and two l. reuteri isolates were found to be multiresistant. conclusions: this study indicates that the faecal lactobacillus flora in piglets consists mainly of l. reuteri, l. salivarius and l. acidophilus group lactobacilli, and the distribution of lactobacilli is similar between individuals of the same age and with the same diet. most of the lactobacillus isolates tested were sensitive to the antibiotics used in this study. significance and impact of the study: valuable information on lactobacillus species distribution and their antibiotic resistance profiles in piglets is obtained.

TI  == probiotics for the treatment of women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == this review considers whether probiotics are effective agents for the treatment and/or prevention of bacterial vaginosis (bv). there seems to be an association between the absence of, or low concentrations of, vaginal lactobacilli and the development of bv. many studies have suggested that the presence of h2o2-producing vaginal lactobacilli may protect against bv, although some studies do not support this hypothesis. in-vitro studies have suggested that certain specific strains of lactobacilli are able to inhibit the adherence of gardnerella vaginalis to the vaginal epithelium and/or produce h2o2, lactic acid and/or bacteriocins, which inhibit the growth of bacteria causing bv. clinical trials showed that intra-vaginal administration of lactobacillus acidophilus for 6-12 days, or oral administration of l. acidophilus or lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14 for 2 months, resulted in the cure of bv (defined as a 0-1 positive score according to amsel's criteria), and/or reduced the recurrences of bv, and/or caused an increase in vaginal lactobacilli and restoration of a normal vaginal microbiota, significantly more frequently than did a placebo, acetic acid or no treatment. however, several trials have found no significant difference in the cure rate of bv and in the number of vaginal lactobacilli after intra-vaginal instillation of lactobacilli when compared with  the effect of a placebo or oestrogen. thus, although the available results concerning the effectiveness of the administration of lactobacilli for the treatment of bv are mostly positive, it cannot yet be concluded definitively that probiotics are useful for this purpose.

AB  == in the present study, lactic acid bacteria (lab) from the cecum of chickens bred  either under intensive (commercial broilers) or extensive (free-range) conditions were isolated, identified and some of their probiotic characteristics determined. the lab identified by 16s-23s rrna pcr-ardra were mainly of lactobacillus species and to a lesser extent of enterococcus spp. for all animals. free-range chickens  showed a higher presence of lactobacillus acidophilus while lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus johnsonii were more frequently recovered from commercial broilers. lactobacillus crispatus was found only in commercial broilers, lactobacillus vaginalis and lactobacillus agilis only in free-range chickens and  lactobacillus salivarius in both types. enterococcus isolates from ceca of commercial broilers showed a higher resistance to antimicrobial drugs. lactobacillus isolates from free-range chickens presented a higher frequency of in vitro antagonistic activity against selected pathogens than from commercial broilers. all lab isolates had predominantly non-hydrophobic surfaces, but with variations depending on age of the chickens and breeding conditions. animal breeding caused variation on composition, antimicrobial susceptibility, antagonistic activity and surface hydrophobicity of lab from chicken cecum. lab isolates from ceca of free-range chickens have potential as probiotic agents, which may be used in the future as replacing the use of antimicrobials as growth  promoters.

TI  == lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginal microbiota of healthy women inhibit prevotella bivia and gardnerella vaginalis in coculture and cell culture.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate how human vaginal isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus crispatus inhibit the vaginosis-associated pathogens gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia. results show that all the strains in coculture condition reduced the viability of g. vaginalis and p. bivia, but with differing  degrees of efficacy. the treatment of g. vaginalis- and p. bivia-infected cultured human cervix epithelial hela cells with l. gasseri strain ks120.1 culture or cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs) results in the killing of the pathogens that are adhering to the cells. the mechanism of the killing activity is not attributable to low ph and the presence of lactic acid alone, but rather to the presence of hydrogen peroxide and proteolytic enzyme-resistant compound(s) present in the cfcss. in addition, coculture of g. vaginalis or p. bivia with l.  gasseri ks120.1 culture or ks120.1 bacteria results in inhibition of the adhesion of the pathogens onto hela cells.

TI  == characterisation of prototype nurmi cultures using culture-based microbiological  techniques and pcr-dgge.
AB  == undefined nurmi-type cultures (ntcs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. these cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. in this study, 10 batches of prototype ntcs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), were applied to characterise  these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the ntcs were identical. culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology,  gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (api, biomerieux, france). two sets of pcr-dgge studies were performed. these involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (lab)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16s rrna gene by pcr. resultant amplicons were subjected to dgge. sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant dgge profiles using the basic local alignment search tool (blast). microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera lactobacillus, lactococcus, bifidobacterium, enterococcus, clostridium, escherichia, pediococcus and enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, actinomyces, bacteroides, propionibacterium, capnocytophaga, proteus, and klebsiella. bacteroides, enterococcus, escherichia, brevibacterium, klebsiella, lactobacillus, clostridium, bacillus, eubacterium, serratia, citrobacter, enterobacter, pectobacterium and pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the ntcs using universal pcr-dgge analysis. a number of the sequences detected by lab-specific pcr-dgge were homologous to those of a number of lactobacillus spp., including l. fermentum, l. pontis, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, l. casei, l. suntoryeus, l. vaginalis, l. gasseri, l. aviaries, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. mucosae  in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. while ntcs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the ntc cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. pcr-dgge proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. in conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or pcr-dgge alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of ntcs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype ntcs during their development, pcr-dgge overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and  unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. this study demonstrated that pcr-dgge is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various ntcs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during ntc production.

TI  == [study of vaginal and intestinal microflora of women in the prenatal period and its correction in dysbacteriosis].
AB  == a comparative research of the structure of vaginal and intestinal microflora in norm and at kidney pathologies in women in the prenatal period was carried out. at physiologically normal course of pregnancy microbiocenosis of vagina and intestine does not contain pathogenic and conditional-pathogenic microorganisms.  lactic acid bacteria are fixed within the limits of 10(5)-10(8) cfu/1 ml in the vagina secretion and 10(7)-10(8) cfu/1 g in the intestine content. the spore microorganisms have completely disappeared in vaginal biocenosis of women with pyelonephritis after pharmacotherapy; and colibacterias has disappeared in 62% of women. quantity of lactic acid bacteria has also decreased. quantity of e. coli (10(8)- 10(9)) cfu/g, sporous microorganisms (10(3)-10(4)) cfu/g and yeast (10(4)-10(5)) cfu/g has considerably increased in the content of intestine. lactic acid bacteria in content of the vagina are presented by: lactobacillus acidophilus, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. vaginalis; in content of the intestine--l. plantarum and l. fermentum. all the isolated strains of lactobacilli are resistant to metrogyl and amphotericin, 87%--to cephoxitine, cypropfloxacine. twenty three of 24 strains of lactic acid bacteria--antagonists  of pathogenic microflora have shown adhesion to vaginal epthelium. the degree of  adhesive activity depends on the strain and genus specificity of cultures. the highest index of adhesiveness in indicated in enterococcus faecium (5.82 - 7.62)  and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (2.74 - 6.40) strains. the screening of strains has been performed, which suppress growth of gas-producing microflora. the strain of lactobacillus plantarum 200d proved to be the most active one. a complex of cultures of the lactic bacteria providing normalization  of microbial cenosis of the vagina in women in the prenatal period has been selected as based on the data obtained. the biotechnology of production of vaginal suppositories is developed.

TI  == kinetics of immunoglobulin g, m, a and igg subclass responses in experimental intravaginal trichomoniasis: prominence of igg1 response.
AB  == trichomoniasis, the most common nonviral sexually transmitted disease, is caused  by infection with the protist trichomonas vaginalis. the clinical spectrum varies from an asymptomatic state to mild, moderate or severe symptoms. however, the exact factors leading to varied symptomatology have not been well elucidated. the mouse is a useful experimental model for intravaginal trichomoniasis, for understanding the role of local immune responses in the pathogenesis and varied symptomatology of this disease. the present study reports anti-trichomonas igg, igm, iga and igg subclass antibody responses on different post-infection days (3rd, 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th) in serum and vaginal washes of mice infected intravaginally with t. vaginalis isolates from 15 symptomatic and 15 asymptomatic women. successful intravaginal infection was established by inoculating t. vaginalis in balb/c mice pre-inoculated with lactobacillus acidophilus and pretreated with oestradiol. a significant increase in parasite load was observed  on the 14th post-infection day (p.i.d.) in mice inoculated with t. vaginalis isolates from symptomatic women as compared to asymptomatic women (p < 0.001), followed by reduction until the 28th p.i.d. (p < 0.05). a significant increase in specific igg (p < 0.001) and in particular igg1 (p < 0.001) and igm (p < 0.01) responses was observed on the 14th p.i.d. in serum and vaginal washes of mice infected with t. vaginalis isolates from symptomatic women as compared to asymptomatic women. significant increases in specific igg, igm and igg1 responses was observed on the 14th p.i.d. in serum samples as compared with vaginal washes  of mice infected with t. vaginalis isolates from symptomatic and asymptomatic women (p < 0.01), whereas no significant difference was observed in iga, igg2a, igg2b and igg3 antibody responses. the study indicates that specific igg, particularly igg1 and igm, may be playing a role in establishing symptomatic infection.

TI  == susceptibility to some antifungal drugs of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from healthy women.
AB  == samples were taken from the lateral vaginal wall of 19 healthy women. lactobacilli were isolated from ten of these women. fifty-eight lactobacillus isolates were identified as l. gasseri, l. vaginalis, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii spp. lactis, l. crispatus, l. plantarum, l. cellobiosus, l. jensenii, l. salivarius, l. curvatus, l. brevis and l. oris. the inhibitory effect of isoconazole and oxiconazole in 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05 microg/ml concentrations on 58 lactobacillus spp. and candida albicans (ajd 180) were investigated, using an agar diffusion method. although both antifungal drugs showed a large inhibitory effect on c. albicans, oxiconazole had a very low inhibitory effect on lactobacillus isolates. the natural resistance of lactobacilli to anti-fungal drugs may enable the development of an antifungal drug(s)/ probiotic combination  for antifungal activity and lactobacilli replacement therapy.

TI  == in vitro comparative kinetics of adhesive and haemolytic potential of t. vaginalis isolates from symptomatic and asymptomatic females.
AB  == the host parasite relationship and pathogenic mechanisms of the commonly reported sexually transmitted urogenital disease, trichomoniasis, are poorly understood. this study was planned to correlate the adhesion properties of trichomonas vaginalis isolates from symptomatic and asymptomatic women to vaginal epithelial  cells in vitro (in presence and absence of l. acidophilus) and to ascertain the haemolytic activity of the isolates, in order to assess these properties as possible markers of pathogenicity. cytoadherence assay study shows the significant difference in adhesion only up to first 15 minutes of incubation in symptomatic versus asymptomatic isolates. the presence of l. acidophilus was found to be more effective in enhancing the attachment of t. vaginalis in a time  dependent manner mostly operative through its ph lowering effect, whereas the excretory secretory products of l. acidophilus reduced the attachment in case of  both symptomatic and asymptomatic isolates. amount of haemoglobin released by isolates from symptomatic patients was significantly higher than by the isolates  from asymptomatic women. this investigation forms the basis for future studies to explore the role of other known virulence factors of t. vaginalis in initiation and persistence of vaginal infection by the parasite.

TI  == effectiveness of current therapy of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == the study was conducted in order to evaluate effectiveness of the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (bv) with different therapeutic regimes according to recommendations of the world health organization (who). during a one-year period  (february 2000-february 2001) the sexually transmitted diseases (std) center was  visited by 482 women aged 14-51. the diagnosis of bv was established by standard  methods: amsel's clinical criteria and gram stain of vaginal discharge. the first-line treatment was oral metronidazole 2 g single dose. second line was metronidazole 500 mg twice daily orally for 7 days or oral clindamycin 300 mg twice daily for seven days. bv was confirmed in 74 women (15.4%). most often it was observed in women aged 17-30 years of age. thirty-three (44.6% of total) were young women 14-21 years of age. thirty-one (42%) women received a follow-up examination and of those, 11 (38.7%) needed a repeat treatment for bv due to unsatisfactory results of this treatment. it is concluded that treatment of bv with standard methods was not always effective with no significant difference between women under 21 years and older women found in regards to response to treatment. besides antibiotic treatment, the so-called probiotics (lactobacillus  acidophilus) can be taken into consideration as an alternative treatment. additional research about the therapeutic effect of this type of drugs is needed.

TI  == specific iga response, t-cell subtype and cytokine profile in experimental intravaginal trichomoniasis.
AB  == trichomoniasis caused by trichomonas vaginalis may lead to either a complete absence of symptoms or to severe inflammatory manifestations in infected women. studies of the role of immune responses in the pathogenesis and varied symptomatology of this disease are lacking. mice may prove useful as an experimental model for intravaginal trichomoniasis in developing an understanding of the role of local immune responses in the pathogenesis and varied symptomatology of this disease. the present study reports the levels of anti-trichomonas iga antibodies in serum and vaginal washes, and t-cell subtype and cytokine profile in vaginal cervical tissues of mice infected intravaginally  with t. vaginalis isolates from 15 symptomatic and 15 asymptomatic women. it also correlates the responses with symptomatology of the patients. successful intravaginal infection was established by inoculating t. vaginalis in balb/c mice preinoculated with lactobacillus acidophilus and pretreated with oestradiol. a significant increase in specific iga antibody levels was detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in vaginal secretions and serum samples collected on the 7th post-infection day from animals infected with isolates from  asymptomatic women when compared with mice infected with isolates from symptomatic women. t-cell subset analysis showed significant differences, with increased cd4+ t-cell count in animals infected with isolates from asymptomatic women compared with animals infected using isolates from symptomatic women. no difference in cd8+ t cells was observed between the two groups. cytokine profile  revealed significantly higher (p < 0.001) production of gamma-ifn and il-2 in mice infected with asymptomatic isolates compared with animals infected with symptomatic isolates, using t. vaginalis crude antigen extract and nonspecific mitogen (cona) as stimulants for vaginal cervical lymphocytes. however, no difference in il-4 levels was observed in the two groups of animals. in contrast, significant increase in tumour necrosis factor (tnf-alpha) levels was observed in animals infected with asymptomatic isolates compared with those infected with isolates from symptomatic women and controls, thereby indicating that tnf-alpha may play an important role in the inflammatory response to trichomoniasis. the study further suggests that specific iga antibodies might help to protect asymptomatic individuals from severe infection and t-lymphocytes may play an important function in the eradication of the parasite. the cytokine profile indicated the involvement of th-1 like responses in mice infected with asymptomatic isolates, compared with those infected with symptomatic isolates.

AB  == objective: our purpose was to investigate the bacteriocin susceptibility of gardnerella vaginalis and its relationship to biotype, genotype, and resistance to metronidazole. study design: bacteriocin susceptibility of 36 g vaginalis clinical isolates was tested against a vaginal strain of lactobacillus acidophilus by a growth-inhibition method. the relationship to biotype, genotype, and resistance to metronidazole were analyzed by the chi2 test and fisher exact test. results: eight g vaginalis strains (22%) were bacteriocin-resistant. biotypes 5 and 7 were found to be the most frequent among these resistant strains. eight (42%) of the 19 isolates classified as biotype 5, 6, or 7 were bacteriocin-resistant compared with none of the isolates that were classified as  other biotypes (p <.01). biotype 5 was found in higher prevalence among the isolates resistant to bacteriocin (62%) than among the susceptible isolates (14%) (p =.01). genotype b was found more frequently among the bacteriocin-resistant strains, but this finding was not statistically significant (p =.71). seven (88%) bacteriocin-resistant strains were also resistant to metronidazole. conclusion: an association between biotype and an increased resistance to bacteriocin was found. the ability of g vaginalis to resist the antibacterial activity of lactobacillus bacteriocin may be a pivotal factor in understanding bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == evaluation of two self-care treatments for prevention of vaginal candidiasis in women with hiv.
AB  == vaginal candidiasis (vc) is a common concern for women living with hiv infection. the authors evaluated the effectiveness of two self-care approaches to prophylaxis of vc among hiv-infected women, weekly intravaginal application of lactobacillus acidophilus or weekly intravaginal application of clotrimazole tablets, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. vc was defined  as a vaginal swab positive for candida species in the presence of signs/symptoms  of vaginitis and the absence of a diagnosis of trichomonas vaginalis or bacterial vaginosis. thirty-four episodes of vc occurred among 164 women followed for a median of 21 months. the relative risk of experiencing an episode of vc was 0.4 (95% ci = 0.2, 0.9) in the clotrimazole arm and 0.5 (95% ci = 0.2, 1.1) in the lactobacillus acidophilus arm. the estimated median time to first episode vc was  longer for clotrimazole (p = .03, log rank test) and lactobacillus acidophilus (p = .09, log rank test) compared with placebo. vaginal yeast infections can be prevented with local therapy. education about self-care for prophylaxis of vc should be offered to hiv-infected women.

AB  == within the framework of the characterization of the microflora of an industrial sourdough fermentation, strains of lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus pontis and two other strains were isolated which could not be associated with a valid species. these latter strains were gram-positive, catalase-negative, non-spore-forming, non-motile rods that could be clearly differentiated from known species by 16s rdna sequence analysis. for further characterization, the morphological, physiological (sugar fermentation, formation of dl-lactate, hydrolysis of arginine, growth temperature, co2 production) and chemotaxonomic (g+c content, cell wall composition, sds-page of whole-cell proteins) properties  were determined. fitting of the complete 16s rdna sequence into alignments of such sequences, together with the subsequent phylogenetic calculations, allowed the reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree. these data showed that the two strains were phylogenetically related but formed an independent cluster distinct from their closest neighbours, l. pontis, lactobacillus panis, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus vaginalis and lactobacillus reuteri. the results of dna-dna hybridization experiments indicated that the two isolates represent a new lactobacillus species, for which the name lactobacillus frumenti is proposed; the type strain of this species is dsm 13145t (= lmg 19473t).

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == characterisation and selection of a lactobacillus species to re-colonise the vagina of women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == this paper reports the results of characterising and selecting a strain of lactobacillus for potential use as a probiotic in regenerating the vaginal flora  of women with recurrent episodes of bacterial vaginosis (bv). bv is a condition characterised by a depletion of vaginal lactobacilli accompanied by an overgrowth of a mixed vaginal flora of aerobic, anaerobic and micro-aerophilic species in very large numbers. bv has been associated with various gynaecological and obstetric complications and has an extremely high recurrence rate, due in part to the failure to establish a normal vaginal flora after antimicrobial therapy. a total of 60 vaginal isolates of lactobacilli was assessed for characteristics considered important for vaginal re-colonisation. the characteristics studied were the in-vitro inhibitory activity of the lactobacilli against bacterial species isolated from women with recurrent bv, acid production after growth of the lactobacilli in liquid culture, production of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) and adhesiveness of the lactobacilli to exfoliated vaginal epithelial cells (vec). four strains of lactobacilli, l. acidophilus (61701 and 61880), l. crispatus (55730) and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii (65407), demonstrated the greatest  inhibitory activity against the bv-associated bacterial species. two of these isolates (55730 and 61880) produced h2o2. all four isolates produced a highly acidic environment after growth in liquid medium (ph <4). only one of these (strain 61701) was strongly adherent to vec (>100 bacteria/vec). a further isolate (l. acidophilus 48101) did not demonstrate maximum inhibitory activity against bv-associated bacteria, but was found to be a strong producer of h2o2 and was also highly adherent to vec. isolates 61701 and 48101 could be candidates for use as probiotics for vaginal re-colonisation.

TI  == adherence of human vaginal lactobacilli to vaginal epithelial cells and interaction with uropathogens.
AB  == three strains of lactobacillus, identified as lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus jensenii, were selected from among 70 isolates from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women for properties relevant  to mucosal colonization or antagonism. all three self-aggregated and adhered to epithelial vaginal cells, displacing well-known vaginal pathogens, such as g. vaginalis, and inhibiting the growth in vitro of escherichia coli and streptococcus agalactiae. the surface components involved in self-aggregation appeared to be proteins for l. gasseri and lipoproteins for l. acidophilus and l. jensenii, as judged by susceptibility to treatment with appropriate degrading enzymes. the factors responsible for adherence to epithelial vaginal cells seemed to be glycoproteins (l. acidophilus and l. gasseri) and carbohydrate (l. jensenii). the receptors of the vaginal cells were glycolipids, which presumably  were the targets of the competition observed between the lactobacilli and the pathogenic microbes.

AB  == background and objectives: a decreased concentration or total disappearance of lactobacillus acidophilus in the vagina constitutes a frequent observation in bacterial vaginosis. goal of the study: cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate has been evaluated in vitro to detect antiadhesive properties at subinhibitory concentrations for gardnerella vaginalis and mobiluncus curtisii to vaginal epithelial cells (vec). study design: bacterial strains 14c- and or 3h-labeled were tested for adherence and competition to binding sites in vecs before and after treatment at sub-mic with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate. results: in control tests of adherence, g. vaginalis and m. curtisii had their maximal adhesion at ph 5.4, l. acidophilus at ph 4.4. preincubation of g. vaginalis and m. curtisii with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate 2.5 mg/ml (subinhibitory concentration) at ph 5.4 reduced adherence to vecs respectively by 48.3% and 34.1%. the same treatment of l. acidophilus showed no statistically significant difference. treatment of vecs alone did not modify adherence. competition tests between l. acidophilus and g. vaginalis and between l. acidophilus and m. curtisii showed that, in small quantities, l. acidophilus could compete with g. vaginalis and m. curtisii for binding sites in vecs at ph 4.4, when pretreated with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate. at a higher ph (4.8 and 5.4), l. acidophilus in higher quantities did not compete for binding sites occupied by g. vaginalis and m. curtisii. conclusions: cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate at subinhibitory concentrations modifies the adhesiveness of g. vaginalis and m. curtisii to vecs, reducing it by 48.3% and 34.1%, respectively. adhesion of l. acidophilus to vecs is not impaired by pretreatment with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate at ph 4.4, even if they are in low number and compete for binding sites against pathogens. at higher ph levels, l. acidophilus did not compete for  binding sites occupied by g. vaginalis and m. curtisii.

TI  == the interaction of lactobacillus acidophilus and trichomonas vaginalis in vitro.
AB  == recent work with a mouse model of trichomonas vaginalis infection indicated that  estrogenized balb/c mice that were preinfected with lactobacillus acidophilus showed a greater duration of t. vaginalis infection as compared to a control group of mice that were not treated with l. acidophilus. to examine the interaction between t. vaginalis and l. acidophilus further we performed in vitro competitive growth assays between the 2 species. although the addition of l. acidophilus to the t. vaginalis cultures slowed the growth of the protozoa, the added bacteria did not increase trichomonad death. however, t. vaginalis had a deleterious effect on l. acidophilus growth in combined cultures when compared to matched controls. using an initial inoculum of 10(5)/ml, at 40 hr the control l.  acidophilus concentrations had grown to 1.3 x 10(7)/ml. however, in combined culture with t. vaginalis, l. acidophilus concentrations at 40 hr had fallen to 7.8 x 10(5)/ml and 6.1 x 10(4)/ml for the 10:1 (t. vaginalis at 10(4)) and 1:1 (t. vaginalis at 10(5) test ratios, respectively (p < 0.01). this demonstrates that t. vaginalis can cause the concentration of l. acidophilus to fall in vitro  and may explain why the concentration of l. acidophilus in the vagina falls in trichomoniasis.

TI  == the vagina as an ecologic system. current understanding and clinical applications.
AB  == recent advances in understanding the mechanisms of dominance of the healthful microecology by lactobacillus acidophilus through microbicidal enzyme systems has led to renewed interest in ecologic approaches to vaginal health maintenance and  treatment of vaginosis and vaginitis. review of pertinent research suggests that  due to inadequate adherence of lactobacilli from dairy sources, contaminants in commercial sources, and lack of evidence of effectiveness in sparse clinical trials, intravaginal applications of l. acidophilus cannot be recommended. bacterial vaginosis is described in this article as a microecologic shift in the  dominant organism of the microecology from l. acidophilus to gardnerella vaginalis. this results in conditions favorable to vaginal establishment of many  anaerobic organisms. the ability to identify and nurture healthful lactobacilli in the vaginal microflora is suggested as a future direction for health-enhancement-oriented research, practice, and screening.

TI  == mouse intravaginal infection with trichomonas vaginalis and role of lactobacillus acidophilus in sustaining infection.
AB  == recent work with a mouse model of trichomonas vaginalis infection indicated that  only 25% of mice harbor lactobacillus spp. and that t. vaginalis infection rates  fall rapidly after 7 days postinfection. in women infected with t. vaginalis, there is a disruption of the lactobacillus population, which usually predominates. in an attempt to establish a better mouse intravaginal infection that resembles human disease, we established lactobacillus acidophilus in estrogenized balb/c mice. t. vaginalis was then inoculated intravaginally into mice previously infected with l. acidophilus and into mice in an untreated group. from 52 mice, 50-microliters vaginal washes were collected, cultured, and examined daily for live trichomonads after inoculation. although initial infectivity in the two groups was comparable (79 to 83%), l. acidophilus-infected mice showed greater duration of infection. at day 24 postinfection, 69% of l. acidophilus-infected mice were still infected with t. vaginalis compared with only 11% of untreated mice (p = 0.002). the addition of l. acidophilus did not significantly alter the resident mouse vaginal flora. by the addition of l. acidophilus, the mouse will be valuable for studying factors involved in t. vaginalis infectivity and pathogenicity.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis is not a simple ecological disorder.
AB  == eighty-four patients with bacterial vaginosis were examined in an open randomized trial, the aim of which was to define clinical results and the microbiological panorama after topical treatment for 1 week with either an acetic acid jelly (a), an estrogen cream (b), a fermented milk product (c) or metronidazole (d). after exclusion because of chlamydia infection (15 cases) or for other reasons, 61 cases remained for complete evaluation 4 weeks after the start of treatment. clinical cure was obtained in 3 cases out of 17 on regimen a, in 1 out of 16 on regimen b, in 1 of 14 on regimen c, and in 13 out of 14 on regimen d. the patients were conclusively either symptomless or symptomatic when examined on 113 occasions. statistically significant reduction after treatment resulting in relief of symptoms was observed in the numbers of corynebacteria and anaerobic cocci, whereas lactobacilli increased in numbers. the instillation of high numbers of lactobacillus acidophilus (c) into the vagina cured only 1 patient and did not influence the predominance of lactobacilli in the vagina at the follow-up examination. the difference in microbiological profile of women in symptomatic and asymptomatic conditions becomes still more apparent when the results of the present and previously published studies on the subject by the present group of investigators are combined. the symptomatic woman is significantly more often harboring corynebacteria, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococci, peptococci, eubacteria and bacteroides species. lactobacilli are significantly reduced in numbers. however, only 51% of our previously symptomatic, but now symptomless women show predominant growth of lactobacilli, which is less than expected for healthy women.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == does lactobacillus vaccine for trichomoniasis, solco trichovac, induce antibody reactive with trichomonas vaginalis?
AB  == solco trichovac is a vaccine of lactobacillus acidophilus developed for treating  trichomoniasis. the efficacy of the vaccine is reportedly due to cross reacting antibody being produced in people immunised with the lactobacillus bacteria. several techniques, including enzyme linked immunosorbent, indirect immunofluorescence, immunoblot, and radioimmunoprecipitation assays were used to  assess the extent of antigenic cross reactivity between lactobacillus acidophilus and trichomonas vaginalis. data show a lack of antigenic relatedness between the  solco trichovac lactobacilli and several strains of t vaginalis. furthermore, antiserum to l acidophilus failed to inhibit trichomonad cytadherence or host cell killing, as is suggested by the producers of the solco trichovac vaccine.

TI  == immunotherapeutic effect of the lactobacillus vaccine, solco trichovac, in trichomoniasis is not mediated by antibodies cross reacting with trichomonas vaginalis.
AB  == according to the producers of the lactobacillus vaccine, solco trichovac, its therapeutic effect in trichomoniasis is achieved by antibodies that are induced by the vaccination and cross react with trichomonas vaginalis. common antigens of lactobacillus acidophilus from solco trichovac vaccine and t vaginalis were therefore sought by three different seroreactions. immune serum against lacidophilus obtained by vaccinating two healthy human volunteers and two rabbits with the original solco trichovac vaccine, as well as hyperimmune rabbit antiserum to t vaginalis, were tested with each of the two micro-organisms. no evidence of antigenic similarity between l acidophilus and t vaginalis was obtained with either serum in any of the three serological tests. a non-specific  immunostimulatory effect therefore seems to be a more probable explanation of the mode of action of solco trichovac vaccine.

TI  == in vitro adherence of lactobacillus species to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  == because of the reported use of yogurt douches for the treatment of vaginitis, the adherence of lactobacillus species to normal human vaginal epithelial cells was tested by in vitro methods. l. acidophilus and l. bulgaricus isolated from three  commercial yogurts were compared to l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. cellobiosus, and l. casei isolated from clinical specimens and from american type culture collection cultures. l. acidophilus isolated from lactinex tablets was also tested. no significant difference was found among the 19 clinical isolates, the american type culture collection cultures, and the lactinex isolate, but all showed significantly higher (p less than 0.01) adherence than any lactobacillus isolated from yogurt. the presence of gardnerella vaginalis, which adheres strongly to vaginal epithelial cells, was found to interfere with the adherence of lactobacilli from all sources studied.

TI  == [isolation and identification of gardnerella vaginalis].
AB  == thirty-four strains of gardnerella vaginalis were studied. they were isolated from non specific vaginitis. a presumptive identification can be based on colonial morphology, gram stain characteristics, negative catalase and oxidase test. the differentiation of gardnerella vaginalis from other negative catalase coccobacilli is based on the acid formation of carbohydrates, enzymatic test, analysis of short chain volatile and non volatile end products of fermentation in glc. all gardnerella strains produce acid from glucose, maltose, starch and are hippurate and alpha glucosidase positive. they are sulfonamide resistant, acetic, lactic and succinic acids are detected by gas liquid chromatography.

AB  == in vitro-studies concerning the influence of commercially available spermicides on lactobacillus acidophilus as well as on pathogenic organisms of the genital tract revealed, that the preparations had only weak antimicrobial effect on doderlein's bacteria and pathogenic fungi. however, all four preparations tested, revealed a good inhibition effect on neisseria gonorrhoeae, treponema pallidum and trichomonas vaginalis. irreversible damage to gonococci and trichomonas vaginalis. irreversible damage to gonococci and trichomonas was subject to considerable variation, probably due to the different chemical composition of the commercially in austria available spermicides.

TI  == [incidence and clinical importance of haemophilus vaginalis (corynebacterium vaginalis) (author's transl)].
AB  == in 250 women aged between 16 and 55 years who came to a gynaecologist we looked for haemophilus vaginalis. in 9.6% it was possible to culture haemophilus vaginalis. the comparison of the differential vaginalis (v-)medium of greenwood with the starch medium of smith showed the much better resolution of the greenwood medium. in one-half of the patients with haemophilus vaginalis there was no clinical evidence of pathogenicity of the bacterium, whereas in the other  half, there was only a slight symptomatology. haemophilus vaginalis and lactobacillus acidophilus seem to exclude each other. the strains of haemophilus  vaginalis were resistant to sulfonamides, polymyxin b and aminoglycoside antibiotics.

TI  == [effectiveness of a lactobacillus vaccine on trichomonas infections in women. preliminary results].
AB  == this is the report on a multi-centre study of the treatment of 444 women with trichomoniasis vaginalis using solcotrichovac, a vaccine containing at least 7 x  10(9) inactivated microorganisms of various strains of lactobacillus acidophilus  in each 0.5 ml dose. one year after the first vaccination 427 of the patients (96.2%) were followed up, and 92.5% of them were found to be cured of clinical symptoms; the remaining 7.5% must be considered as not cured, as either the slide or the culture was positive. we are convinced by these results that vaccination with solcotrichovac represents an enhancement of therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of trichomoniasis vaginalis.
