TI  - Oribacterium sinus gen. nov., sp. nov., within the family 'Lachnospiraceae' (phylum Firmicutes).
AB  - A hitherto unknown anaerobic bacillus isolated from sinus pus in a young child (strain AIP 354.02T) was characterized by using phenotypic and genotypic methods. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that this strain was phylogenetically affiliated with several sequences of cloned 16S rRNA gene inserts previously deposited in the public databases. According to their 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities, these uncultivated bacteria, together with strain AIP 354.02T, formed a separate subgroup belonging to the family 'Lachnospiraceae' within the phylum Firmicutes. Oribacterium gen. nov. is proposed for this group of organisms and Oribacterium sinus gen. nov. sp. nov. for strain AIP 354.02T (= CIP 107991T = CCUG 48084T).
