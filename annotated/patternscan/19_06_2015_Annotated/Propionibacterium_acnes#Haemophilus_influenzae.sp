TI  == routine testing for anaerobic bacteria in cerebrospinal fluid cultures improves recovery of clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == in north america, the widespread use of vaccines targeting haemophilus influenzae type b and streptococcus pneumoniae have dramatically altered the epidemiology of bacterial meningitis, while the methodology for culturing cerebrospinal fluid (csf) specimens has remained largely unchanged. the aims of this study were 2-fold: to document the current epidemiology of bacterial meningitis at a tertiary care medical center and to assess the clinical utility of routinely querying for anaerobes in csf cultures. to that end, we assessed csf cultures submitted over a 2-year period. a brucella blood agar (bba) plate, incubated anaerobically for 5 days, was included in the culture procedure for all csf specimens during the second year of evaluation. in the pre- and postimplementation years, 2,353 and 2,302 csf specimens were cultured, with 49 and 99 patients having positive culture results, respectively. the clinical and laboratory data for patients with positive cultures were reviewed. anaerobic bacteria were isolated in the csf samples from 33 patients post-bba compared to two patients pre-bba (p = 0.01). the anaerobic isolates included bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (n = 1), propionibacterium species (n = 15), and propionibacterium acnes (n = 19) isolates; all of these isolates were recovered on the bba. eight of the 35 patients from whom anaerobic organisms were isolated  received antimicrobial therapy. although six of these patients had central nervous system hardware, two patients did not have a history of a neurosurgical procedure and had community-acquired anaerobic bacterial meningitis. this study demonstrates that the simple addition of an anaerobically incubated bba to the culture of csf specimens enhances the recovery of clinically significant anaerobic pathogens.

TI  == antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from nunavik collections of the macroalgae fucus evanescens c. agardh (fucaceae).
AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga fucus evanescens in cell culture. accessions were collected on the arctic coast of ungava bay, nunavik, quebec. the crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against hemophilus influenzae , legionella pneumophila , propionibacterium acnes (atcc and clinical isolate), and streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/ml. this algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , whereas bacillus cereus , escherichia coli , klebsiella pneumoniae , and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against propionibacterium acnes showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/ml. the main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl o-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/ml. therefore, the semipurified f. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.

TI  == comparison of azithromycin and moxifloxacin against bacterial isolates causing conjunctivitis.
AB  == objective: to examine in vitro resistance to azithromycin and moxifloxacin in bacterial conjunctivitis isolates. methods: mic90s (minimum inhibitory concentration) and resistance rates to azithromycin and moxifloxacin were determined based upon microtiter broth dilution and/or antimicrobial gradient test strips in a multicenter phase iii study and confirmed externally. results: the most common isolates collected from bacterial conjunctivitis patients in the  phase iii study were haemophilus influenzae (40.6%), followed by staphylococcus epidermidis (19.3%), propionibacterium acnes (17.3%), streptococcus pneumoniae (16.8%), and staphylococcus aureus (0.06%). mic90s for all of these organisms were well below established resistance breakpoints for moxifloxacin, indicating no bacterial resistance. on the other hand, the mic90 for h. influenzae was 3-fold higher than the resistance breakpoint for azithromycin, > or = 128-fold higher for s. epidermidis, 16-fold higher for s. pneumoniae and > or = 128-fold higher for s. aureus, indicating moderate to very high bacterial resistance to azithromycin. conclusions: resistance to azithromycin is more common than resistance to moxifloxacin in clinical isolates causing bacterial conjunctivitis.

TI  == bacteriology of chronic sinusitis and acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis.
AB  == objective: to establish the microbiological characteristics of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis (aecs). setting: academic medical center. patients: thirty-two patients with chronic sinusitis and 30 patients with aecs. main outcome measure: the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of maxillary aecs and chronic maxillary sinusitis. results: a total of 81 isolates (33 aerobic and 48 anaerobic) were recovered from the 32 cases (2.5 per specimen) with chronic sinusitis. aerobes alone were recovered in 8 specimens (25%), anaerobes only were isolated in 11 (34%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes were recovered in 13 (41%). the predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were enterobacteriaceae and staphylococcus aureus. the predominant anaerobic bacteria were peptostreptococcus subspecies, fusobacterium subspecies, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, and propionibacterium acnes. twenty-one beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 17 specimens (53%). a total of 89 isolates (40 aerobic and facultatives, and 49 anaerobic) were recovered from the 30 patients (3.0 per specimen) with aecs. aerobes were recovered in 8 instances (27%), anaerobes only  in 11 (37%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes were recovered in 11 (37%). the predominant aerobes were streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacteriaceae, and s aureus. the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus subspecies, fusobacterium subspecies, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, and p acnes. thirty-six beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 28 specimens (53%). conclusions: this study demonstrates that the organisms isolated from patients with aecs were predominantly anaerobic and were similar to those generally recovered in patients with chronic sinusitis. however, aerobic bacteria that are usually found in acute infections (eg, s pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis) can also emerge in some of the episodes of aecs.

TI  == microbiology of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis.
AB  == objectives: we undertook to evaluate the microbiology of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis (aecs). methods: repeated aspirations of maxillary sinus secretions by endoscopy were performed in 7 patients over a period of 125 to 242  days. results: bacteria were recovered for all 22 aspirates, and the number of isolates was between 2 and 4. a total of 54 isolates were isolated: 16 aerobic and facultative bacteria and 38 anaerobic bacteria. the aerobic bacteria were haemophilus influenzae (7 isolates), streptococcus pneumoniae (3), moraxella catarrhalis (3), staphylococcus aureus (2), and klebsiella pneumoniae (1). the anaerobic bacteria included pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp (19), peptostreptococcus spp (9), fusobacterium spp (8), and propionibacterium acnes (2). a change in the types of isolates was noted in all consecutive cultures obtained from the same patients as different organisms emerged and previously isolated bacteria were no longer recovered. an increase in antimicrobial resistance was noted in 6 instances. conclusions: this study illustrates the microbial dynamics of aecs in which anaerobic and aerobic bacteria prevail, and highlights the importance of obtaining cultures from patients with aecs for guidance in selection of proper antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == [microbiology of acute exacerbation chronic sinusitis in adults].
AB  == the bacterial flora taken by sinus puncture from 115 patients with uni and bilateral acute exacerbation of chronic maxillary sinusitis was analyzed. germ-free culture was obtained in 49 cases (40%) and in 69 cases (60%) bacteria were isolated from all sinus aspirates. microbiological evaluation shows, that in majority of cases (90%) of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis there were pathogenic bacteria namely aerobic and anaerobic. the most frequent pathogens isolated from the aspirates were; staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae,  escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus hominis, propionibacterium acnes i candida albicans. the culture analysis proves that one  or more pathogens can be the etiological factor. in the majority of cases (64%) the sinusitis is caused by monoculture.

TI  == increased antimicrobial resistance in organisms recovered from otitis media with  effusion.
AB  == previous studies concerning the microbiology of otitis media with effusion (ome)  did not correlate the past use of antimicrobial agents with the recovered organism's antimicrobial susceptibility. a retrospective analysis of cultures obtained from aspirates of 129 children with ome was performed. the study identified the isolated organisms and determined their susceptibility to the most recently administered antimicrobials. bacterial growth was noted in 58 (45 per cent) patients. aerobic organisms only were recovered in 37 aspirates (63 per cent of the culture-positive aspirates); anaerobic bacteria in seven (12 per cent); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 14 (24 per cent). a total of 92 bacterial isolates were recovered, accounting for 1.6 isolates per specimen (1.1 aerobes and 0.5 anaerobes). there were a total of 66 aerobic isolates, including haemophilus influenzae non type-b (20 isolates), streptococcus pneumoniae (17), and staphylococcus spp. (seven). twenty-six anaerobes were recovered, including peptostreptococcus spp. and prevotella spp. (eight each) and propionibacterium acnes (four). resistance to the antimicrobial used was found in 60 (65 per cent) isolates, recovered from 41 (71 per cent) of the patients. of the 41 patients in whom resistance was detected, 37 (90 per cent) had been treated within three months of culture and four (10 per cent) had completed treatment more than three months before the cultures were taken (p < 0.01). the highest rate of recovery of resistant organisms was following trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (96 per cent), amoxycillin (71 per cent), and azithromycin (56 per cent). of the patients treated with amoxycillin, h influenzae predominated. s pneumoniae was recovered from four of the seven (57 per cent) after trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, four of 14 (29 per cent) following amoxycillin, and three of 11 (27 per cent) after azithromycin. the data illustrate the relationship between resistance to the antimicrobials given to children and their recovery from the middle ear of patients with ome.

TI  == vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  == objective: to investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. methods: a prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between september 2001 and may 2002 at the cullen eye institute. aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients  after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: mean +/- sd gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/ml, 1.34  +/- 0.34 micro g/ml, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/ml respectively. mean +/- sd sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. the percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration  achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous mic(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. conclusions: orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low mic(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin  represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.

TI  == sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  == aims: to test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. methods: the bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 iu/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin b was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees c with five inocula of 14 bacteria. two yeasts  (candida spp) and one aspergillus were also tested. contaminated media were then  inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened  daily by visual inspection. the sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. results: organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria  irrespective of the starting inoculums: streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and haemophilus influenzae. for micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal  only (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, candida kruzei, aspergillus  fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (sd 13.8, range 2-52). in cases of detection by the  blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. conclusions: blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.

TI  == microbiology of serous otitis media in children: correlation with age and length  of effusion.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to correlate the microbiology of serous otitis media in children with the duration of the condition and the patient's age. aspirates of serous ear fluids from 114 children were examined for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. bacterial growth was noted in 47 patients (41%). aerobic organisms only were recovered in 27 aspirates (57% of the culture-positive aspirates); anaerobic bacteria only in 7 (15%); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 13 (28%). a total of 83 bacterial isolates were recovered, accounting for 1.8 isolates per specimen (1.2 aerobes and 0.6 anaerobe). there were a total  of 57 aerobic isolates, including haemophilus influenzae (15 isolates), streptococcus pneumoniae (13), and staphylococcus sp (12). twenty-six anaerobes were recovered, including anaerobic gram-positive cocci (10), prevotella spp (8), and propionibacterium acnes (4). the rate of positive cultures (20 of 36; 56%) was higher in patients younger than 2 years of age than in those older than 2 years of age (27 of 78; 35%). streptococcus pneumoniae and h influenzae were more often isolated in children younger than 2 years of age and those with effusion for 3 to 5 months, whereas anaerobes were recovered more often in those older than 2 years of age and those with effusion for 6 to 13 months. these data illustrate the effects of the length of effusion and age on the recovery of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in serous otitis media.

TI  == [in vitro activities of levofloxacin and other antibiotics against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == in this study, the in vitro activity of levofloxacin (lvfx) against 1,020 fresh bacterial clinical isolates was compared with the activities of a range of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin (cpfx), ampicillin (abpc), cefaclor, cefpodoxime, methicillin and benzylpenicillin. the clinical isolates except vibrio cholerae were collected in japan during 1998 from patients with infectious diseases. mics  were determined using the agar dilution method according to the recommendations by the japan society of chemotherapy. some isolates of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and coagulase negative staphylococcus were resistant to fluoroquinolones, but the mic50 of lvfx against mrsa was 6.25 micrograms/ml. lvfx was the most active against mrsa among the antibiotics tested. most of staphylococcus epidermidis strains were susceptible to the fluoroquinolones. lvfx showed greater activity against all streptococci strains compared with fluoroquinolones tested. in particular, all streptococcus pneumoniae strains including prsp were susceptible to lvfx at < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml. among enterococcus, abpc showed superior activity against enterococcus faecalis but many isolates of enterococcus species were resistant to abpc. lvfx was more active against to these enterococcus species compared with other fluoroquinolones. on the other hand, lvfx and cpfx showed similar activity against isolates of enterobacteriaceae. cpfx had an mic50/90 of 0.20, 0.39 microgram/ml and lvfx showed an mic50/90 of 0.78, 1.56 micrograms/ml against pseudomonas aeruginosa. lvfx (mic50/90 0.10, 0.20 microgram/ml) was more active against acinetobacter species than cpfx (mic50/90 0.10, 0.39 microgram/ml). haemophilus influenzae, branhamella (moraxella) catarrhalis and v. cholerae were  inhibited by low concentration of the fluoroquinolones tested. the mic90 of lvfx  and cpfx were < or = 0.10 microgram/ml against above three species. some isolates of neisseria gonorrhoeae and campylobacter species were moderately resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested but the mic50 of lvfx and cpfx were < or = 0.39 microgram/ml. among anaerobes, propionibacterium acnes was more susceptible than  peptostreptococcus species, and the mic90 of beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones tested were < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. in conclusion, this study, performed on large number of strains, confirmed an excellent and wide spectrum antibacterial activity of lvfx compared with the fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams tested. and  our results suggest that lvfx may be useful in the treatment of various bacterial infections.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of cefuroxime against recent clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (cxm-ax) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from january to september of 1990 and 1993. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were  obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic80 of cxm were equal to or lower against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, peptostreptococcus spp., and propionibacterium acnes, except for streptococcus pneumoniae, mic80 which was slightly higher. 2. mic90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephem-resistant e. coli and klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant h. influenzae and n. gonorrhoeae. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. from the nature of mrsa detected in those situations mrsa appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. mic90 against strains obtained from  patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. therefore, the determination of mic90  is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. antimicrobial activities of cxm against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. however, mic of cxm as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of cxm against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., h. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.

TI  == microbiology of chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  == to better understand the factors involved in chronic sinusitis in childhood, we cultured the sinuses, middle meatus, and nasopharynx in 39 children requiring surgical intervention. sixty-nine percent of these patients had other medical problems, including asthma (49%) and immunologic compromise (18%). we cultured coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 18 patients, streptococcus viridans in 14 patients, normal flora in 10 patients, staphylococcus aureus in nine patients, group d streptococcus in five patients, corynebacterium in five patients, haemophilus influenzae in three patients, neisseria in three patients, and streptococcus pneumoniae, group a streptococcus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces, and an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus in one patient each. cultures yielded no growth  in nine patients. a strong association between cultures of the middle meatus obtained ipsilaterally and cultures of the maxillary (83%) and ethmoid sinuses (80%) occurred. a poor correlation was found between cultures of the nasopharynx  and maxillary (45%) and ethmoid sinuses (49%). all seven patients who had both maxillary and ethmoid sinus cultures showed the same organisms in both sinuses. only 41% of organisms were found on both sides when procedures were performed bilaterally. cultures of the middle meatus appear to be sensitive and specific for organisms within sinuses. the presence of predominantly nonvirulent organisms in low titers suggests that additional factors other than bacterial overgrowth contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis in children.

TI  == comparison of the nasal bacterial floras in two groups of healthy subjects and in patients with acute maxillary sinusitis.
AB  == the nasal bacterial flora was studied in 183 healthy men entering military service (entry group), 103 healthy recruits in service (service group), and 185 recruits with acute maxillary sinusitis. the 267 nasal and ipsilateral sinus aspirate findings in the same patients with acute maxillary sinusitis were compared pairwise. in the entry group presumed sinus pathogens were only rarely isolated from the nasal cavities: haemophilus influenzae in 4%, streptococcus pneumoniae in 1%, branhamella catarrhalis in 3%, and streptococcus pyogenes in 0%. the corresponding isolation frequencies in the service group were 19, 13, 3,  and less than 1%, respectively, and those in the group with acute maxillary sinusitis were 61, 25, 7, and 6%, respectively. suppression of the major components of the normal nasal flora, corynebacterium sp., coagulase-negative staphylococci, propionibacterium acnes, and staphylococcus aureus, was seen in the group with acute maxillary sinusitis and also occasionally in the service group. when a sinus aspirate culture yielded a presumed sinus pathogen, the same  pathogen was found in the nasal samples in 91% of the cases. the predictive value of a pathogen-positive nasal finding was highest (93.8%) for s. pyogenes, followed by 77.7% for h. influenzae and 68.7% for s. pneumoniae, and lowest (20%) for b. catarrhalis.

TI  == bacteriological findings of acute maxillary sinusitis in young adults.
AB  == bacteriological findings in 339 sinus secretions obtained by puncture were investigated in 238 young adult patients with acute maxillary sinusitis. aerobic  and anaerobic cultures were performed immediately. a total of 76% of the secretions were positive. the most common pathogens isolated were haemophilus influenzae (50%), streptococcus pneumoniae (19%), streptococcus pyogenes (5%), and branhamella catarrhalis (2%). coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus were isolated in 8 and 1% of the specimens, respectively. the staphylococci were almost invariably present in low numbers and, therefore, probably represented nasal contamination. other aerobic species were found only occasionally. anaerobes were isolated in 5% of the secretions. in one-half of these, a low concentration of propionibacterium acnes was the sole anaerobe that  was found, and it was usually mixed with a facultative organism (suggestive of contamination with nasal flora). only 2% of the sinuses were considered to have true anaerobic infections (high concentrations of several species typical of anaerobic infection), indicating that anaerobes are not a significant cause of acute maxillary sinusitis in a young adult population. the high recovery of h. influenzae in this study indicates that aminopenicillins may be more appropriate  choice than conventional penicillin in the antimicrobial therapy of acute maxillary sinusitis (only 2 of 168 h. influenzae strains produced beta-lactamase).

TI  == changes in expression of bacterial surface antigens induced by antibiotics and their influence on host defenses.
AB  == concomitant with the discovery that a number of antibiotics were able to induce profound morphological changes (increased septation, thickened walls, filamentation) at low concentrations their ability to inhibit bacterial protein/polysaccharide synthesis was determined. in particular toxin and extracellular enzyme biosynthesis could be repressed by the lincosamines, fusidic acid, erythromycin and streptomycin in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. several of these exoproducts act as antigens associated with microbial virulence  and are therefore of importance in pathogenicity. likewise structural components  such as fimbriae in escherichia coli, m protein in streptococcus pyogenes, protein a in staphylococcus aureus and capsule in bacteroides fragilis and haemophilus influenzae were not synthesised when the producer bacteria were grown in low concentrations of antibiotic. these products, through their importance as  impedins of opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis by white blood cells, are important determinants in the host-parasite relationship. by their loss during drug exposure, potentiation of opsonophagocytosis occurred leading to more rapid  killing of the pathogen. the immunogenicity of the antibiotic-damaged bacteria was also changed under these circumstances.

TI  == bmy 28100, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == bmy 28100, a new oral cephalosporin with a (z)-propenyl side chain at the 3 position and a p-hydroxyphenylglycyl substituent at the 7 position, was evaluated in comparison with cefaclor and cephalexin and, when appropriate, ampicillin and  vancomycin. in vitro, bmy 28100 was more active than the reference cephalosporins against streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, haemophilus influenzae, propionibacterium acnes, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. bmy 28100 was comparable to cefaclor and  more active than cephalexin against staphylococcus saprophyticus and ampicillin-susceptible strains of branhamella catarrhalis; but against ampicillin-resistant strains of b. catarrhalis, bmy 28100 was comparable to cephalexin and more active than cefaclor. against neisseria gonorrhoeae, bmy 28100 was comparable to cephalexin, but less active than cefaclor. members of the family enterobacteriaceae overall were equally susceptible to bmy 28100 and cefaclor but were less susceptible to cephalexin. in human serum, bmy 28100 was 45% protein bound. after an oral dose to mice, 82% of the drug was recovered in urine. the oral therapeutic efficacy of bmy 28100 in systemically infected mice reflected its activity in vitro.

TI  == in vitro study of the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against recent clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. a total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). ofloxacin was highly active against e. coli, klebsiella sp., citrobacter sp., proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, salmonella sp., campylobacter jejuni, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, eubacterium sp., propionibacterium acnes and streptococcus sp. pseudomonas sp., serratia sp. and proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. high percentages of resistance to ofloxacin  were found only for providencia sp., proteus rettgeri and bacteroides fragilis. with regard to streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and mic determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.

TI  == the bacterial flora of the nasal cavity in healthy young men.
AB  == the nasal cavity of 97 young healthy men (applicants for the pilot education in the finnish air force) was examined. bacterial culture demonstrated one or more species of aerobic bacteria in all 194 nasal cavities examined and anaerobic bacteria in 76.5%. in ten per cent of the cultures bacteria were detected after enrichment only. the most common aerobic bacteria were staphylococcus epidermidis (79%), diphtheroids (41%) and staphylococcus aureus (34%). haemophilus influenzae was found in 5% and streptococcus pneumoniae in 0.5%. anaerobic culture yielded propionibacterium acnes in 74.5% and peptococcus magnus in 3.5%.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo evaluation of a-56268 (te-031), a new macrolide.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of a-56268 (te-031), the 6-o-methyl derivative of erythromycin, was compared with those of erythromycin and other reference drugs. a-56268 had the same spectrum of antibacterial activity as erythromycin. a-56268 was generally 1 log2 dilution more potent or equal to erythromycin against all organisms except haemophilus influenzae and propionibacterium acnes, for which a-56268 was 1 log2 dilution and 3 log2 dilutions, respectively, less potent. the mbc of a-56268 and erythromycin was not significantly different from the mic against streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, and h. influenzae but was more than 2 log2 dilutions higher than the mics for some staphylococcus aureus strains. human serum at a concentration of 50% did not change the in vitro potency of a-56268 or erythromycin. a-56268 was similar to erythromycin in being  more active at ph 8.0 than at the physiologic ph of 7.3. the activity of a-56268  was synergistic with sulfamethoxazole against 4 of 12 strains of h. influenzae. in mouse protection tests, when administered orally a-56268 was more potent than  erythromycin against h. influenzae, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, and s. aureus. after subcutaneous administration the potencies of a-56268 and erythromycin were  not statistically different from each other. a-56268 was more potent than erythromycin against legionella infection in guinea pigs. the concentration of a-56268 in the serum and lung was higher than that of erythromycin after intraperitoneal administration. in a-56268 in the serum and lung was higher than  that of erythromycin after intraperitoneal administration. in mice, the peak levels in serum of a-56268 and erythromycin were similar after subcutaneous administration and seven times higher for a-56268 after oral administration. the  serum half-life of a-56268 was approximately twice that of erythromycin after administration by both routes.

TI  == normal cultivable microflora in upper jejunal fluid in children without gastrointestinal disorders.
AB  == bacteriological studies of uncontaminated upper jejunal fluid were performed in 51 danish children without gastrointestinal disorders. thirty-seven percent of the samples were sterile [less than 10(1) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml]. in 25%  of the cases, the total number of microorganisms exceeded 10(5) cfu/ml. the microorganisms isolated most frequently were: streptococcus, sp. ("viridans group"), veillonella parvula, hemophilus parainfluenzae, lactobacillus, sp., corynebacterium, sp., actinomyces, sp., bacteroides, sp., and hemophilus influenzae, each found in more than 10% of the children. the upper range for the  number of microorganisms isolated exceeded 10(5) cfu/ml for most of the species isolated of which the vast majority belonged to an "oral type" of flora. enterococci were isolated in small numbers in three children, and enterobacteriaceae were not found.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriologic features of serous otitis media in children.
AB  == aspirates of serous ear fluids from 57 children were examined for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. bacterial growth was noted in 23 patients (40 per cent). aerobic organisms only were recovered in 13 aspirates (57 per cent of the culture-positive aspirates); anaerobic bacteria in four (17 per cent); and mixed  aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in six (26 per cent). a total of 45 bacterial isolates were recovered, accounting for 2.0 isolates per specimen (1.4 aerobes and 0.6 anaerobe). there were a total of 31 aerobic isolates, including hemophilus influenzae (eight isolates), staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae (five of each), and staphylococcus epidermidis and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (four of each). fourteen anaerobes were recovered, including anaerobic gram-positive cocci and bacteroides melaninogenicus (five isolates each) and propionibacterium acnes (three isolates).

TI  == experimental otitis media in gerbils and chinchillas with streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and other aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == to ascertain the usefulness of mongolian gerbils as an inbred model for otitis media, 52 mongolian gerbils (meriones unguiculatus, strain mont/tum) were compared with 26 chinchillas (chinchilla laniger) for susceptibility to streptococcus pneumoniae type 3. haemophilus influenzae type b, and a polymicrobic culture including anaerobes (streptococcus intermedius, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, and corynebacterium sp.). organisms were inoculated percutaneously into the superior chamber of the middle  ear bulla. the gerbils and chinchillas shared similar susceptibilities and responses to the inoculated organisms as determined by x-ray, otoscopic, histopathological, and microbiological determinations at 5 to 7 days. koch's postulate studies proved the role of s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae in the pathology found in both animal models. the animals were also susceptible to the polymicrobic culture, although the relative virulence of the individual members of this mixture was low, suggesting that these species potentiated as a polymicrobic mixture. the corynebacterium sp. appeared to elicit the greatest histopathological response in chronic (8-week) studies in gerbils. the gerbils were found to be useful as an alternative animal model for the study of otitis media of bacterial etiology.

TI  == microbiology of otitis media.
AB  == the microbiology of otitis media (om) has been documented by cultures of middle ear fluid (mef) obtained by needle aspiration. the results of studies of bacteriology of om from sweden, finland and the united states are very similar: streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae are the most important pathogens: gram-negative enteric bacilli are isolated from mef of approximately equal to 20% of infants to six weeks of age but are rarely present in mef of older children; group a beta hemolytic streptococcus and staphylococcus aureus are infrequent causes of otitis. preliminary results suggest that anaerobic bacteria are responsible for some episodes of om. although epidemiologic data suggest that virus infection is associated with om, the results of ten studies indicate that these agents are infrequently isolated from mef of children with om. viruses were isolated from 29 to 663 patients (4.4%). respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus were isolated most frequently. the results of seven studies of mycoplasma infection in 771 patients with om included only one isolation of mycoplasma pneumoniae from mef. these results indicate that viruses  and mycoplasmas are uncommonly found in mef of patients with om, but few studies  have been attempted in recent years. chlamydia trachomatosis is the etiologic agent of a mild but prolonged pneumonia in infants. om may accompany the respiratory infection, and c. trachomatis has been isolated from mef of some of these infants. recent studies of asymptomatic children with persistent mef indicate that bacterial pathogens are present in some of these fluids. investigators in columbus, boston, and pittsburgh obtained mef for culture at the time of myringotomy or placement of tympanostomy tubes. bacteria were isolated from mef of 50% of these children; s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, or group a streptococcus were isolated from 10% to 20% of cases. there were only minimal differences in the rates of isolation of bacteria from serous, mucoid, or purulent fluids. the significance of these results is uncertain, but they suggest that the persistent effusion may be a result of asymptomatic but prolonged infection or may be an immune response to a persisting antigen.

TI  == antibody coated bacteria in otitis media with effusions.
AB  == the significance of bacterial isolates of coagulase negative staphylococcus epidermidis and corynebacterium species in middle ear fluids remains controversial. this study was undertaken to evaluate the possible role of these organisms in different effusions. cultures were obtained from the external cartilaginous ear, bony canal, tympanic membrane, middle ear fluids, tonsils and  nasopharynx of 93 patients at the time of myringotomy for otitis media with effusion. isolates of coagulase negative staphylococci from the middle ear, external ear and posterior aural skin were evaluated in regard to antibiotic sensitivity, biochemical tests and phage typing. furthermore, in another series of patients in whom these organisms were isolated, specific antibody activity in  both middle ear washings and corresponding sera were measured, using the technique of indirect immunofluorescence. the results suggest that the isolates from the middle ear and ear canal are not always identical. there is some evidence that specific igm and igg as well as iga responses to these organisms are present in middle ear washings and not in corresponding serum. these results  suggest that coagulase negative staphylococcus and corynebacterium species in middle ear effusions may not be contaminants from the external canal and that a local immune response may be produced by these organisms. whether or not these organisms represent etiologic agents responsible for otitis media with effusion cannot be ascertained from this data. one very interesting point is the presence  of igf coating of organisms in some effusions.

TI  == anaerobic and aerobic bacteriology of acute conjunctivitis.
AB  == aerobic and anaerobic cultures and clinical data were obtained from 131 patients  presenting with acute conjunctivitis. similar cultures were obtained from 60 noninflamed individuals. anaerobes were isolated from 66 patients, 51 times in mixed culture with aerobes and 15 times (11.5%) as the only isolates. aerobes only were recovered in 54 patients. the organisms found to be statistically significantly more commonly recovered from eyes with conjunctivitis were staphylococcus aureus, hemophilus influenzae, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes. no statistical difference was present between the bacterial flora of the eyes with unilateral conjunctivitis when compared to their uninvolved mates in 20 cases in which only one eye was involved.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of acute otitis media in children.
AB  == tympanocentesis and aerobic and anaerobic cultivation of the middle-ear fluid obtained was performed through one or both tympanic membranes of 62 children with acute otitis media. aerobic bacteria alone, predominantely pneumococcus and hemophilus influenzae, were isolated from 57% of patients; anaerobic organisms alone, most commonly propionibacterium acnes and peptococcus, from 15%. thirteen  percent yielded mixtures of aerobes and anaerobes, and several had multiple aerobic or anaerobic agents. the isolation of only anaerobic bacteria, supported  in some patients by gram-stain observations of middle-ear fluid, suggest that these bacteria, especially petococcus, may occasionally play a direct role in acute otitis media.
