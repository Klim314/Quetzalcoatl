TI  == recombinant fragilysin isoforms cause e-cadherin cleavage of intact cells and do  not cleave isolated e-cadherin.
AB  == the fragilysin (bft) is a protein secreted by enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis strains. bft contains zinc-binding motif which was found in the metzincins family of metalloproteinases. in this study, we generated three known  recombinant isoforms of bft using escherichia coli, tested their activity and examined whether e-cadherin is a substrate for bfts. bft treatment of ht-29 cells induced endogenous e-cadherin cleavage, and this bft activity requires the native structure of zinc-binding motif. at the same time recombinant bfts did not cleave recombinant e-cadherin or e-cadherin in isolated cell fractions. it indicates that e-cadherin may be not direct substrate for bft. we also detected and identified proteins released into the cultural medium after ht-29 cells treatment with bft. the role of these proteins in pathogenesis and cell response to bft remains to be determined.

TI  == intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: a systematic review.
AB  == evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. in the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of firmicutes; a higher count of bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, and  bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, and lactobacillus. in the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of bacteroides; a lower count of akkermansia muciniphila, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and clostridium; a higher prevalence of b. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of b. catenulatum and staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.

TI  == structures of bacteroides fragilis uridine 5'-diphosphate-n-acetylglucosamine (udp-glcnac) acyltransferase (bflpxa).
AB  == uridine 5'-diphosphate-n-acetylglucosamine (udp-glcnac) acyltransferase (lpxa) catalyzes a reversible reaction for adding an o-acyl group to the glcnac in udp-glcnac in the first step of lipid a biosynthesis. lipid a constitutes a major component of lipopolysaccharides, also referred to as endotoxins, which form the  outer monolayer of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. ligand-free and  udp-glcnac-bound crystal structures of lpxa from bacteroides fragilis nctc 9343,  the most common pathogenic bacteria found in abdominal abscesses, have been determined and are presented here. the enzyme crystallizes in a cubic space group, with the crystallographic threefold axis generating the biological functional homotrimer and with each monomer forming a nine-rung left-handed beta-helical (lbetah) fold in the n-terminus followed by an alpha-helical motif in the c-terminus. the structure is highly similar to lpxa from other organisms.  yet, despite sharing a similar lbetah structure with lpxas from escherichia coli  and others, previously unseen calcium ions are observed on the threefold axis in  b. fragilis lpxa to help stabilize the trimeric assembly.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - special references to bacteria isolated between april 2011 and march 2012].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2011 to march 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus  spp., in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by parvimonas micra, collinsella aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus and finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, e. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by p micra and l. acidophilus, in this order. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides caccae, b. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus and b. wadsworthia, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus  spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.

TI  == quantitative profiling of colorectal cancer-associated bacteria reveals associations between fusobacterium spp., enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis (etbf) and clinicopathological features of colorectal cancer.
AB  == various studies have presented clinical or in vitro evidence linking bacteria to  colorectal cancer, but these bacteria have not previously been concurrently quantified by qpcr in a single cohort. we quantify these bacteria (fusobacterium  spp., streptococcus gallolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis (etbf), enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), and afac-  or pks-positive e. coli) in paired tumour and normal tissue samples from 55 colorectal cancer patients. we further investigate the relationship between a) the presence and b) the level of colonisation of each bacterial species with site and stage of disease, age, gender, ethnicity and msi-status. with the exception of s. gallolyticus, we detected all bacteria profiled here in both tumour and normal samples at varying frequencies. etbf (fdr = 0.001 and 0.002 for normal and tumour samples) and afac-positive e. coli (fdr = 0.03, normal samples) were significantly enriched in the colon compared to the rectum. etbf (fdr = 0.04 and  0.002 for normal and tumour samples, respectively) and fusobacterium spp. (fdr =  0.03 tumour samples) levels were significantly higher in late stage (iii/iv) colorectal cancers. fusobacterium was by far the most common bacteria detected, occurring in 82% and 81% of paired tumour and normal samples. fusobacterium was also the only bacterium that was significantly higher in tumour compared to normal samples (p = 6e-5). we also identified significant associations between high-level colonisation by fusobacterium and msi-h (fdr = 0.05), age (fdr = 0.03) or pks-positive e. coli (fdr = 0.01). furthermore, we exclusively identified atypical epec in our cohort, which has not been previously reported in association with colorectal cancer. by quantifying colorectal cancer-associated bacteria across a single cohort, we uncovered inter- and intra-individual patterns of colonization not previously recognized, as well as important associations with clinicopathological features, especially in the case of fusobacterium and etbf.

TI  == appendicitis in a child due to streptococcus pneumoniae: a rare case report.
AB  == a variety of bacterial species play a major role in appendicitis. both aerobic and anaerobic gram positive and gram negative bacteria such as, bacteroides fragilis, streptococcus species, escherichia coli, klebsiella species and citrobacter freundii cause appendicitis. appendicitis is usually polymicrobial. the case assumes importance because of single aetiological agent i.e. unimicrobial and no predisposing factors are present to cause infection. we report a rare case of appendicitis due to streptococcus pneumoniae in child. this case emphasizes that streptococcus pneumoniae can cause wide spectrum of disease  like appendicitis.

TI  == analysis of the outer membrane proteome and secretome of bacteroides fragilis reveals a multiplicity of secretion mechanisms.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis is a widely distributed member of the human gut microbiome and an opportunistic pathogen. cell surface molecules produced by this organism likely play important roles in colonization, communication with other microbes, and pathogenicity, but the protein composition of the outer membrane (om) and the mechanisms used to transport polypeptides into the extracellular space are poorly characterized. here we used lc-ms/ms to analyze the om proteome and secretome of  b. fragilis nctc 9343 grown under laboratory conditions. of the 229 om proteins that we identified, 108 are predicted to be lipoproteins, and 61 are predicted to be tonb-dependent transporters. based on their proximity to genes encoding tonb-dependent transporters, many of the lipoprotein genes likely encode proteins involved in nutrient or small molecule uptake. interestingly, protease accessibility and biotinylation experiments indicated that an unusually large fraction of the lipoproteins are cell-surface exposed. we also identified three proteins that are members of a novel family of autotransporters, multiple potential type i protein secretion systems, and proteins that appear to be components of a type vi secretion apparatus. the secretome consisted of lipoproteins and other proteins that might be substrates of the putative type i or type vi secretion systems. our proteomic studies show that b. fragilis differs considerably from well-studied gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli in both the spectrum of om proteins that it produces and the range of secretion strategies that it utilizes.

TI  == in vitro fermentation of fructooligosaccharides with human gut bacteria.
AB  == fructooligosaccharides (fos) are one of the most studied prebiotics, selectively  stimulating the growth of health-promoting bacteria in the host. however, there is increasing evidence that commensal gut bacteria, such as bacteroides fragilis, clostridium butyricum, enterobacter cloacae, and even the pathogenic escherichia  coli ben2908, are also able to metabolize fos in vitro, and in some cases, fos displayed adverse effects. therefore, it is necessary to identify fos-metabolizing species that are present in the gut. unlike previous studies focusing on individual strains, this study used the traditional culture method combined with an alignment search on the gut bacteria database established from the human microbiome project (hmp). the alignment results showed that homologous  proteins for fos transporters and glycosidases were distributed in 237 of the 453 strains of gut bacteria. la506 msmk encoding the atp-binding protein and aec45 fosgh1 encoding glycoside hydrolase were most widely distributed, in 155 and 55 strains, respectively. seven of eight strains with both transporters and glycosidases were proven to be capable of metabolizing fos, while five strains without either transporters or glycosidases were not. fifteen species isolated from human feces and 11 species from the alignment search were identified to be fos-metabolizing, of which cronobacter sakazakii, marvinbryantia formatexigens, ruminococcus gnavus, and weissella paramesenteroides are reported here for the first time. thus, alignment search combined with the culture method is an effective method for obtaining a global view of the fos-metabolizing bacteria in  the gut and will be helpful in further investigating the relationship between fos and human gut bacteria.

TI  == microbiology of pelvic lymphocyst infection after lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors.
AB  == background: pelvic lymphocyst infection is a rare complication after lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors. although medical therapy is a useful addition to surgical drainage, the appropriate antibiotic regimen is unknown because few studies have examined the causative organisms. the purpose of this case series was to identify the micro-organisms infecting pelvic lymphocysts. methods: this was a single-center, retrospective, case-series review conducted at a tertiary-care cancer center between october 2002 and march 2013. the participants included all patients who experienced their first pelvic lymphocyst infection after undergoing pelvic lymphadenectomy for cervical, endometrial, or ovarian cancer and exhibited positive lymphocyst fluid culture. computed tomography- or sonography-guided percutaneous aspiration procedures were performed to obtain lymphocyst fluid for culture. results: during the study period, 878 patients underwent lymphadenectomy for gynecologic malignant tumors,  and 13 developed a pelvic lymphocyst infection documented microbiologically. cultures identified staphylococcus aureus (three patients), s. epidermidis (one patient), streptococcus agalactiae (three patients), enterococcus (two patients), escherichia coli (one patient), and anaerobic bacteria (three patients). they were all monomicrobial infections. conclusions: our study and other smaller ones  suggest that lymphocyst infections following pelvic lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors usually are monomicrobial and caused by gram-positive cocci, including staphylococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus, and anaerobes such as  bacteroides fragilis. these bacteria should be considered when selecting empiric  antibiotic therapy.

TI  == gastrointestinal symptoms in travellers.
AB  == diarrhoea is probably the single most common medical complaint in returning travellers. the most common pathogens are entero-toxigenic escherichia coli, shigella, salmonella and campylobacter. viruses, toxigenic arcobacter and bacteroides fragilis, as well as parasites such as cryptosporidium sp, are increasingly recognised but are not tested for in most diagnostic laboratories. blood in stools is a sign of invasive disease and should trigger exclusion of invasive amoebic disease. the use of empiric antibiotics may shorten illness but  is complicated by the diversity of bacterial causes and emerging resistance.

TI  == comparison of the transport of bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli within saturated sand packs.
AB  == pathogens in groundwater accounted for approximately 50% of waterborne disease outbreaks in the united states between 1971 and 2006. the fast and reliable detection of groundwater microbial contamination and the identification of the contamination sources are of critical importance to the protection of public health. recent studies suggested that fecal anaerobe bacteriodes spp. could be employed as an effective tool for surface water microbial source tracking (mst).  the usefulness of bacteroides spp. for groundwater mst depends strongly on its mobility within the subsurface system. this research provides laboratory results  comparing transport and attachment of e. coli k12 and b. fragilis within packed quartz sands. the results indicate that at low ionic strengths both e. coli k12 and b. fragilis are readily transported through saturated sand packs. at higher ionic strengths such as may be found near concentrated sources of fecal contamination, b. fragilis displayed significantly higher mobility than e. coli k12. analysis of the extended derjaguin-landau-verweu-overbeek (xdlvo) energy interactions for both types of bacteria showed a significant repulsive energy barrier exists between the sand surface and the bacteria, precluding attachment directly to the sand surface. however a secondary minimum energy level exists under higher ionic strength conditions. the depth of this energy low is greater for e. coli k12, which results in greater attachment of e. coli k12 than of b. fragilis. the high mobility of b. fragilis suggests that it represents a promising tool for the detection of groundwater fecal contamination as well as the identification of the microbial sources.

TI  == anaerobic bacteria grow within candida albicans biofilms and induce biofilm formation in suspension cultures.
AB  == the human microbiome contains diverse microorganisms, which share and compete for the same environmental niches. a major microbial growth form in the human body is the biofilm state, where tightly packed bacterial, archaeal, and fungal cells must cooperate and/or compete for resources in order to survive. we examined mixed biofilms composed of the major fungal species of the gut microbiome, candida albicans, and each of five prevalent bacterial gastrointestinal inhabitants: bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis. we observed that biofilms formed by c. albicans provide a hypoxic microenvironment that supports the growth of two anaerobic bacteria, even when cultured in ambient oxic conditions that are normally toxic to the bacteria. we also found that coculture with bacteria in biofilms induces massive gene expression changes in c. albicans, including upregulation of wor1, which encodes a transcription regulator that controls a phenotypic switch in c. albicans, from the "white" cell type to the "opaque" cell type. finally, we observed that in suspension cultures, c. perfringens induces aggregation of c. albicans into "mini-biofilms," which allow c. perfringens cells to survive in a normally toxic environment. this work indicates that bacteria and c. albicans interactions modulate the local chemistry of their environment in multiple ways to create niches favorable to their growth and survival.

TI  == the intestinal microbiota composition and weight development in children: the koala birth cohort study.
AB  == objective: to investigate whether the intestinal microbiota composition in early  infancy is associated with subsequent weight development in children. methods: analyses were conducted within the koala birth cohort study (n = 2834). this cohort originates from two recruitments groups: pregnant women with a conventional lifestyle (no selection based on lifestyle) and pregnant women recruited through alternative channels (organic shops, anthroposophic clinicians/midwives, steiner schools and relevant magazines). from 909 one-month-old infants, fecal samples were collected and analyzed by quantitative  pcr targeting bifidobacteria, bacteroides fragilis group, clostridium difficile,  escherichia coli, lactobacilli and total bacteria counts. between the ages of 1 and 10 years, parent-reported weight and height was collected at 7 time points. age- and gender-standardized body mass index (bmi) z-scores were calculated. data were analyzed using generalized estimating equation. results: colonization with b. fragilis group was borderline significantly associated with a higher bmi z-score of 0.15 (95% confidence interval (ci): -0.02 to 0.31), in the conventional subcohort. after stratification for fiber intake (p(forinteraction)  = 0.003), colonization with b. fragilis group was associated with a 0.34 higher bmi z-score among children with a low-fiber intake in this subcohort (95% ci: 0.17-0.53). higher counts among colonized children were positively associated with bmi z-score only in children within the conventional subcohort and a high-fiber diet (bmi z-score 0.08; 95% ci: 0.01-0.14), but inversely associated in children with a low-fiber diet (bmi z-score -0.05; 95% ci: -0.10 to 0.00), and in children recruited through alternative channels (bmi z-score -0.10; 95% ci: -0.17 to -0.03). the other bacteria were not associated with bmi z-scores, regardless of subcohort. conclusion: using a targeted approach, we conclude that  the intestinal microbiota, particularly the b. fragilis group, is associated with childhood weight development. to identify the potential impact of additional bacterial taxa, further prospective studies applying an unconstrained in-depth characterization of the microbiota are needed.

TI  == distinct patterns of igg and iga against food and microbial antigens in serum and feces of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  == background: inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is associated with a defective intestinal barrier and enhanced adaptive immune responses against commensal microbiota. immune responses against food antigens in ibd patients remain poorly  defined. methods: igg and iga specific for food and microfloral antigens (wheat and milk extracts; purified ovalbumin; escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis  lysates; mannan from saccharomyces cerevisiae) were analyzed by elisa in the serum and feces of patients with crohn's disease (cd; n = 52 for serum and n = 20 for feces), ulcerative colitis (uc; n = 29; n = 17), acute gastroenteritis/colitis (age; n = 12; n = 9) as well as non-inflammatory controls (n = 61; n = 39). results: serum anti-saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (asca)  and anti-b. fragilis igg and iga levels were increased in cd patients whereas antibody (ab) levels against e. coli and food antigens were not significantly different within the patient groups and controls. subgroup analysis revealed that cd patients with severe diseases defined by stricturing and penetrating lesions have slightly higher anti-food and anti-microbial iga levels whereas cd and uc patients with arthropathy have decreased anti-food igg levels. treatment with anti-tnf-alpha abs in cd patients was associated with significantly decreased asca igg and iga and anti-e. coli igg. in the feces specific igg levels against all antigens were higher in cd and age patients while specific iga levels were higher in non-ibd patients. anti-food igg and iga levels did not correlate with food intolerance. summary: in contrast to anti-microbial abs, we found only minor changes in serum anti-food ab levels in specific subgroups of ibd patients. fecal ab levels towards microbial and food antigens show distinct patterns in controls, cd and uc patients.

TI  == evaluation of detachment methods for the enumeration of bacteroides fragilis in sediments via propidium monoazide quantitative pcr, in comparison with enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli.
AB  == aims: the aim was to develop an optimized detachment method for separating bacteroidales from sediments to allow enumeration via pma-qpcr. the effectiveness of four different detachment treatments in removing bacteroides fragilis was compared as a function of time as well as in relation to enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli as detected by cultivation and qpcr. methods and results: cells were inoculated into four sediments from sea water (sw) and freshwater (fw) beaches. sediment samples were taken on days 1 and 7 and subjected to four different treatments for separation of micro-organisms. on day 1, the detachment  treatments performed equally well in removing intact bact. fragilis cells. in contrast, 7 days later the detachment treatment with tween 80 and handshaking (th) resulted in up to eightfold higher 16s rrna gene concentrations of intact and total bact. fragilis cells compared to other detachment treatments. total ent. faecalis cells based on the 23s rrna gene were also preferentially recovered by treatment th. cultivable ent. faecalis or e. coli numbers detached from sediments were similar for all methods in most sediments tested. conclusions: handshaking and 1% tween 80/naoh (ph 7.0) eluant was the most efficient technique to recover intact as well as total bact. fragilis cells in sediment samples with  different salinities and after prolonged sediment cell contact time. significance and impact of the study: the optimized detachment method enables the application  of pma-qpcr to sediment samples to detect the presence of bacteroidales cells and their dna in future microbial source tracking studies.

TI  == effects of macroporous monofilament mesh on infection in a contaminated field.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to evaluate whether the type of the mesh and proper surgical technique can influence the outcome of a tension-free hernia  repair in a contaminated filed. materials and methods: this study was based on the model of bacterial peritonitis in rats induced with a mixture composed of escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis. two animals were used as a control group without induced peritonitis and 10 animals with mesh implanted inside of the peritoneal cavity. for the 20 animals in the studied group, bacterial fluid was applied into the abdominal cavity together with the mesh implantation. in 10  cases, the mesh was fixed flatly upon the surface of the peritoneum; in the other 10, the mesh was rolled and then fixed within the peritoneal cavity. after 5 weeks, the animals were operated on again, and the meshes, the peritoneal fluid and, if present, any granulomas were taken for bacterial cultivation. results: the results of the bacterial cultivation of the material from the control group (without mesh) and from the rats with flatly fixed mesh were almost completely negative (0/10 and 1/10, respectively). in 9 out of 10 rats that were exposed to  the rolled mesh for 5 weeks, the colonisation of meshes with both b. fragilis and e. coli was found (p < 0.0198). conclusions: when properly fixed, flat mesh, even in a contaminated field, may allow for a proper mesh healing and does not influence the ability to cure bacterial peritonitis in an animal model. a bad surgical technique, such as inadequately positioned or rolled mesh, may cause persistent peritoneal bacteraemia.

TI  == species differences in alternative substrate utilization by the antibacterial target undecaprenyl pyrophosphate synthase.
AB  == undecaprenyl pyrophosphate synthase (upps) is a critical enzyme required for the  biosynthesis of polysaccharides essential for bacterial survival. in this report, we have tested the substrate selectivity of upps derived from the mammalian symbiont bacteroides fragilis, the human pathogen vibrio vulnificus, and the typically benign but opportunistic pathogen escherichia coli. an anthranilamide-containing substrate, 2-amideanilinogeranyl diphosphate (2aa-gpp), was an effective substrate for only the b. fragilis upps protein, yet replacing the amide with a nitrile [2-nitrileanilinogeranyl diphosphate (2cna-gpp)] led to  a compound that was fully functional for upps from all three target organisms. these fluorescent substrate analogues were also found to undergo increases in fluorescence upon isoprenoid chain elongation, and this increase in fluorescence  can be utilized to monitor the activity and inhibition of upps in 96-well plate assays. the fluorescence of 2cna-gpp increased by a factor of 2.5-fold upon chain elongation, while that of 2aa-gpp increased only 1.2-fold. the 2cna-gpp compound  was therefore more versatile for screening the activity of upps from multiple species of bacteria and underwent a larger increase in fluorescence that improved its ability to detect increases in chain length. overall, this work describes the development of new assay methods for upps and demonstrates the difference in substrate utilization between forms of upps from different species, which has major implications for upps inhibitor development, assay construction, and the development of polysaccharide biosynthesis probes.

TI  == functional identification of a galactosyltransferase critical to bacteroides fragilis capsular polysaccharide a biosynthesis.
AB  == capsular polysaccharide a (cpsa), a polymer of a four-sugar repeating unit that coats the surface of the mammalian symbiont bacteroides fragilis, has therapeutic potential in animal models of multiple sclerosis and other autoinflammatory diseases. genetic studies have demonstrated that cpsa biosynthesis is dependent primarily on a single gene cluster within the b. fragilis genome. however, the precise functions of the individual glycosyltransferases encoded by this cluster  have not been identified. in this report each of these glycosyltransferases (wcfq, wcfp, and wcfn) have been expressed and tested for their function in vitro. using a reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (hplc) assay, wcfq and wcfp were found to transfer galactose from uridine diphosphate (udp)-linked galactose (gal) to n-acetyl-4-amino-6-deoxy-galactosamine (aadgal) linked to a fluorescent mimic of bactoprenyl diphosphate, the native isoprenoid anchor for bacterial polysaccharide biosynthesis. the incorporation of galactose  to form a bactoprenyl-linked disaccharide was confirmed by radiolabel incorporation and mass spectrometry (ms) of purified product. using varying concentrations of udp-gal and enzyme, wcfq was found to be the most effective protein at transferring galactose, and is the most likely candidate for in vivo incorporation of the sugar. wcfq also cooperated in the presence of three preceding biosynthetic enzymes to form an isoprenoid-linked disaccharide in a single-pot reaction. this work represents a critical step in understanding the biosynthetic pathway responsible for the formation of cpsa, an unusual and potentially therapeutic biopolymer.

AB  == several synthetic metabolic pathways for butanol synthesis have been reported in  escherichia coli by modification of the native coa-dependent pathway from selected clostridium species. these pathways are all dependent on the o2 -sensitive adhe2 enzyme from clostridium acetobutylicum that catalyzes the sequential reduction of both butyryl-coa and butyraldehyde. we constructed an o2  -tolerant butanol pathway based on the activities of an acp-thioesterase, acting  on butyryl-acp in the native fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, and a promiscuous carboxylic acid reductase. the pathway was genetically optimized by screening a series of bacterial acyl-acp thioesterases and also by modification of the physical growth parameters. in order to evaluate the potential of the pathway for butanol production, the acp-dependent butanol pathway was compared with a previously established coa-dependent pathway. the effect of (1) o2 -availability, (2) media, and (3) co-expression of aldehyde reductases was evaluated systematically demonstrating varying and contrasting functionality between the acp- and coa-dependent pathways. the yield of butanol from the acp-dependent pathway was stimulated by enhanced o2 -availability, in contrast to the coa-dependent pathway, which did not function well under aerobic conditions. similarly, whilst the coa-dependent pathway only performed well in complex media, the acp-dependent pathway was not influenced by the choice of media except in the absence of o2 . a combination of a thioesterase from bacteroides fragilis and the aldehyde reductase, ahr, from e. coli resulted in the greatest yield of butanol.  a product titer of ~300 mg/l was obtained in 24 h under optimal batch growth conditions, in most cases exceeding the performance of the reference coa-pathway  when evaluated under equivalent conditions.

TI  == distinct cytokine pattern in response to different bacterial pathogens in human brain abscess.
AB  == brain abscess is a focal suppurative process. host inflammatory response in gram  type and specific bacteria has not been studied in brain abscess. a total of 57 brain abscess patients with monomicrobial infections were studied for th1 (tnf-alpha, ifn-gamma, il1-beta), th2 (il-4, il-10) and th17 (il-17, il-23) cytokine response by reverse-transcriptase pcr and elisa. th1 and th17 cytokines  were significantly elevated in gram positive (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus intermedius) and th2 cytokine (il-10) in gram negative (bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli) infections (p<0.05). cytokine levels were significantly higher in abscess than blood (p<0.001). elevated levels of several  inflammatory cytokines (tnf-alpha, ifn-gamma, il1-beta, il-17 and il-23) were associated with the duration of symptoms; predisposing factors also influenced the levels of several cytokines. the expression of inflammatory cytokines in abscess was influenced by the bacterial pathogen, duration of symptoms and predisposing factors. local milieu of brain plays significant role in secretion of various cytokines.

TI  == analysis of the arabinose-5-phosphate isomerase of bacteroides fragilis provides  insight into regulation of single-domain arabinose phosphate isomerases.
AB  == arabinose-5-phosphate isomerases (apis) catalyze the interconversion of d-ribulose-5-phosphate and d-arabinose-5-phosphate, the first step in the biosynthesis of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (kdo), an essential component of the lipopolysaccharide in gram-negative bacteria. classical apis, such as escherichia coli kdsd, contain a sugar isomerase domain and a tandem cystathionine beta-synthase domain. despite substantial effort, little is known about structure-function relationships in these apis. we recently reported an api containing only a sugar isomerase domain. this protein, c3406 from e. coli cft073, has no known physiological function. in this study, we investigated a putative single-domain api from the anaerobic gram-negative bacterium bacteroides fragilis. this putative api (uniprot id q5liw1) is the only protein encoded by the b. fragilis genome with significant identity to any known api, suggesting that it is responsible for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis in b. fragilis. we tested this hypothesis by preparing recombinant q5liw1 protein (here referred to  by the uniprot id q5liw1), characterizing its api activity in vitro, and demonstrating that the gene encoding q5liw1 (genbank id yp_209877.1) was able to  complement an api-deficient e. coli strain. we demonstrated that q5liw1 is inhibited by cytidine 5'-monophospho-3-deoxy-d-manno-2-octulosonic acid, the final product of the kdo biosynthesis pathway, with a ki of 1.91 mum. these results support the assertion that q5liw1 is the api that supports lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis in b. fragilis and is subject to feedback regulation by cmp-kdo. the sugar isomerase domain of e. coli kdsd, lacking the two cystathionine beta-synthase domains, demonstrated api activity and was further characterized. these results suggest that q5liw1 may be a suitable system to study api structure-function relationships.

TI  == use of accuracy profile procedure to validate a real-time pcr method to quantify  bacteria in feces.
AB  == this study describes a novel validation procedure of real-time pcr based on accuracy profile to estimate bacterial concentrations in fecal samples. to assess the performance of the method, measurements of axenic fecal samples spiked with a measured quantity of known bacterial species (bacteroides fragilis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecium, and escherichia coli) were performed under repeatability and intermediate precision conditions. data collected were used to compute a tolerance interval that was compared to a defined acceptance interval. it is concluded that the method is valid and relevant for the studied validation range of 8.20-10.24 and 7.43-9.47 log10 cfu/g of feces to ensure proper measurement of b. fragilis and e. coli, respectively. the loq is 8.20 and 7.43 log10 cfu/g of feces. in contrast, the method is not valid for the quantification of e. faecium and b. adolescentis, but by applying a correction factor of +0.63 log10 cfu/g, it can be considered valid for e. faecium. this correction is included in the final results. in conclusion, the accuracy profile is a statistical tool that is easy to use and totally adapted to validate real-time pcr.

TI  == antibiotic resistance capability of cultured human colonic microbiota growing in  a chemostat model.
AB  == to evaluate the potential antibiotic resistance capability of cultured human colonic microbiota as a whole system when residual antibiotics enter the human intestine, the combination of viable cell counting and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) method was used to study effects of the enrofloxacin (enr) residue on the microbial diversity, antibiotic resistance, and anti-colonization  capability in a human chemostat model. the results indicated that the enr enhanced the microbial antibiotic resistance to the ciprofloxacin (ci), and a dose-dependent effect was observed. when exposed to 1.25 mug/ml enr, the growth of the tested bacteria (e.g., total aerobic bacteria, total anaerobic bacteria, lactobacillus, enterococci, escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis) received little change, while the microbial diversity in this group was totally changed; in 12.5- and 125-mug/ml enr group, the quantities and microbial diversity received a dramatic change compared to their no drug stage, while the addition of the cultured human colonic microbiota to the probiotic group did enhance the colonization resistance (cr) of the cultured microbiota to candida albicans sc5314, indicating its potential beneficial effect on human intestinal healthy and anti-infection capability.

TI  == the reca operon: a novel stress response gene cluster in bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis, an opportunistic pathogen of humans, is a leading cause of  bacteraemias and anaerobic abscesses which are often treated with metronidazole,  a drug which damages dna. this study investigated the responses of the b. fragilis reca three gene operon to the stress experienced during metronidazole treatment and exposure to reactive oxygen species simulating those generated by the host immune system during infection. a transcriptionally regulated response was observed using quantitative rt-pcr after metronidazole and hydrogen peroxide  treatment, with all three genes being upregulated under stress conditions. in vivo and in vitro analysis of the functional role of the second gene of the operon was done using heterologous complementation and protein expression (in escherichia coli), with subsequent biochemical assay. this gene encoded a functional bacterioferritin co-migratory protein (bcp) which was thiol-specific and had antioxidant properties, including protection of the glutamine synthetase  iii enzyme. this in vitro data supports the hypothesis that the genes of the operon may be involved in protection of the bacteria from the oxidative burst during tissue invasion and may play a significant role in bacterial survival and  metronidazole resistance during treatment of b. fragilis infections.

TI  == influence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group b streptococcus on  the early newborn gut composition and evaluation of the anti-streptococcus activity of bifidobacterium strains.
AB  == several factors are known to influence the early colonization of the gut in newborns. among them, the use of antibiotics on the mother during labor, referred to as intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (iap), has scarcely been investigated, although this practice is routinely used in group b streptococcus (gbs)-positive  women. this work is therefore aimed at verifying whether iap can influence the main microbial groups of the newborn gut microbiota at an early stage of microbial establishment. fifty-two newborns were recruited: 26 born by mothers negative to gbs (control group) and 26 by mothers positive to gbs and subjected to iap with ampicillin (iap group). selected microbial groups (lactobacillus spp., bidobacterium spp., bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and escherichia coli) were quantified with real-time pcr on dna extracted from newborn feces. further analysis was performed within the bidobacterium genus by using dgge after amplification with genus-specific primers. results obtained showed a significant decrease of the bifidobacteria counts after antibiotic treatment of the mother. bifidobacteria were found to be affected by iap not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. in fact, iap determined a decrement in the frequency of bidobacterium breve, bidobacterium bifidum, and bidobacterium dentium with respect to the control group. moreover, this study has preliminarily evaluated that some bifidobacterial strains, previously selected for use in infants, have antibacterial properties against gbs and are therefore potential candidates for being applied as probiotics for the prevention of gbs infections.

TI  == production of human metabolites by gastrointestinal bacteria as a potential source of post-mortem alteration of antemortem drug/metabolite concentrations.
AB  == previous studies have demonstrated that bacterial species are capable of transforming complex chemical substances. several of these species, native to the human gastrointestinal tract, are active in postmortem decomposition. they have potential to cause biotransformations affecting compound-to-metabolite ratios within the human body, especially after death. investigation of postmortem effects could supply valuable information, especially concerning compound identification and confirmation. the purpose of this research was to investigate  the effects of escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, and clostridium perfringens on diazepam and flunitrazepam in reinforced clostridial medium, and to compare bacterial biotransformation products to those of human metabolism. a decrease in diazepam concentration between pre- and post-incubation was observed  for samples inoculated with escherichia coli (14.7-20.2%) as well as bacteroides  fragilis (13.9-25.7%); however there was no corresponding increase in concentration for the monitored human metabolites. flunitrazepam demonstrated a greater concentration loss when incubated with individual bacterial species as well as mixed culture (79.2-100.0%). samples incubated with bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and mixed culture resulted in nearly complete conversion of flunitrazepam. increased 7-aminoflunitrazepam concentrations accounted for the majority of the conversion; however discrepancies in the mass balance of the reaction suggested the possibility of a minor metabolite that was not monitored in the current analysis. these experiments served as a pilot study and proof of concept that can be adapted and applied to a realm of possibilities. ultimately,  this methodology would be ideal to study compounds that are too toxic or lethal for animal and human metabolic investigations.

TI  == role of dissemination of microorganisms during laparoscopic appendectomy in abscess formation.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to investigate the potential contributory role of laparoscopic appendectomy in the occurrence of postoperative intra-abdominal infections. methods: a prospective single-center study including  48 patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy was conducted between august  2010 and september 2011. two peritoneal samples were obtained from each patient in the pre- and post-appendectomy period. aerobic and anaerobic microbiological cultures were obtained from the samples. the data were analyzed with statistical  methods. results: the mean age of the 48 patients (29 male, 19 female) was 10.9 years. among the pre-appendectomy aerobic cultures, microorganisms were isolated  in 18 of the patients (38%), with escherichia coli being the most common. in post-appendectomy aerobic cultures, various bacteria were isolated in 7 patients  (14.6%), with the numbers of bacteria statistically significantly reduced (p<0.05). anaerobic microorganisms were isolated in 12 patients (25%) and 4 patients (8.3%) in pre- and post-appendectomy cultures, respectively, with bacteroides fragilis the most common organism; there was a significant reduction  in the bacterial count (p<0.05). each patient was regarded as their own control.  conclusion: our results suggest that laparoscopic appendectomy does not cause an  increase in intra-abdominal infections, and particularly not infections associated with anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == isolation and identification of quercetin degrading bacteria from human fecal microbes.
AB  == quercetin has a wide range of biological properties. the gut microflora can often modulate its biological activity and their potential health effects. there still  is a lack of information about gut bacteria involving in this process. the strains of gut microbes from human feces that can transform quercetin were isolated and identified by in vitro fermentation. the results showed that escherichia coli, stretococcus lutetiensis, lactobacillus acidophilus, weissella  confusa, enterococcus gilvus, clostridium perfringens and bacteroides fragilis have the various ability of degrading quercetin. among them, c. perfringens and b. fragilis were discovered to have the strongest ability of degrading quercetin. additionally, quercetin can't inhibit the growth of c. perfringens. in conclusion, many species of gut microbiota can degrade quercetin, but their ability are different.

TI  == effects of carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum on the inflammatory response and bacterial translocation in intraabdominal infection.
AB  == background: this study evaluated the effect of co2 pneumoperitoneum on intraabdominal infection and bacterial translocation in intraabdominal infection. materials and methods: escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis were injected separately into the abdominal cavities of 30 new zealand white rabbits to establish two animal models of intraabdominal infection. each model was divided into a laparotomy group, a pneumoperitoneum group, and a control group. before and 1, 2, 4, and 7 days after surgery, blood and peritoneal fluids were obtained  to determine bacterial culture and serum interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and c-reactive protein levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the total number of white blood cells (wbcs) was measured. seven days after surgery, the animals were sacrificed and dissected, and liver, kidney, and spleen tissues were obtained for bacterial culture. results: in the two bacterial models, incidence rates of bacteremia were higher in the laparotomy and pneumoperitoneum groups than in the control group. however, there were no significant differences between the laparotomy and pneumoperitoneum groups. visceral bacterial translocation was detected in each group with no significant difference among the three groups. the change of inflammatory factors in the e. coli group and the b. fragilis group was nearly the same: the inflammatory factor levels and wbc counts in the laparotomy group were significantly higher than in the pneumoperitoneum group. the inflammatory factor levels and wbc counts in the  pneumoperitoneum group increased slowly and were restored to normal quickly. conclusions: in the intraabdominal infection animal model of the pneumoperitoneum group, the inflammatory response was weaker and the immune function was less affected and restored to normal more quickly than in the laparotomy group. the incidence rate of visceral bacterial translocation was not higher than that in the laparotomy group.

TI  == the interplay between the innate immune system and the microbiota.
AB  == the human gastrointestinal tract harbors one of the highest densities of microorganisms on earth, called the microbiota. in fact, the number of microbial  cells in the intestine outnumbers the amount of human cells of the entire organism by a factor of 10. as such, a human being is more and more perceived as  a super-organism consisting of a eukaryotic and a prokaryotic part. the compartment mediating the communication between both parts is the innate immune system and its various microbe-sensing pattern-recognition receptors. co-evolution of the microbiota with the innate immune system has resulted in elaborate interdependency and feedback mechanisms by which both systems control mutual homeostasis. here, we review the most important innate immune-microbiota interdependencies known to date. while microbial sensing by pattern-recognition receptors is required for stable microbial composition, the presence of the microbiota, in turn, is necessary for proper development and function of the immune system.

AB  == objective: this study aims to examine the prevalence and bacteriological findings of different types of intrauterine fluid collection in women presenting with postmenopausal bleeding and the risk factors for predicting positive microbiological culture, mixed growth, and anaerobic growth. methods: this is a retrospective cohort study. data from all of the women who were assessed in our one-stop postmenopausal bleeding clinic between 2008 and 2011 and who were found  to have intrauterine fluid collection were reviewed. endometrial aspirates of all women were sent for bacterial culture and histological examination. the risk factors for positive culture were assessed by both univariate and multivariate analyses. results: a total of 228 cases of intrauterine fluid collection were included for analysis. there were 109 (47.8%) cases of pyometra, 98 (43.0%) cases of hydrometra, and 21 (9.2%) cases of hematometra. escherichia coli, bacteroides  fragilis, and enterococcus were the commonest microorganisms isolated from endometrial aspirates. both endometrial malignancy and benign intrauterine pathologies are not risk factors for positive culture. advanced age (>75 y) is an independent risk factor for positive culture (odds ratio, 2.89; 95% ci, 1.39-6.01) and mixed growth (odds ratio, 2.18; 95% ci, 1.02-4.67). residency in nursing homes is an independent risk factor for mixed growth (odds ratio, 2.61; 95% ci, 1.21-5.63) and anaerobic growth (odds ratio, 2.55; 95% ci, 1.01-6.44). conclusions: e. coli, b. fragilis, and enterococcus are the commonest microorganisms isolated from intrauterine fluid. apart from drainage of the intrauterine fluid collection, successful management also requires appropriate antibiotics and improvement in perineal hygiene.

TI  == microbes in the neonatal intensive care unit resemble those found in the gut of premature infants.
AB  == background: the source inoculum of gastrointestinal tract (git) microbes is largely influenced by delivery mode in full-term infants, but these influences may be decoupled in very low birth weight (vlbw, <1,500 g) neonates via conventional broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. we hypothesize the built environment (be), specifically room surfaces frequently touched by humans, is a predominant source of colonizing microbes in the gut of premature vlbw infants. here, we present the first matched fecal-be time series analysis of two preterm vlbw neonates housed in a neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) over the first month of life. results: fresh fecal samples were collected every 3 days and metagenomes sequenced on an illumina hiseq2000 device. for each fecal sample, approximately 33 swabs were collected from each nicu room from 6 specified areas: sink, feeding and intubation tubing, hands of healthcare providers and parents, general surfaces, and nurse station electronics (keyboard, mouse, and cell phone). swabs were processed using a recently developed 'expectation maximization iterative reconstruction of genes from the environment' (emirge) amplicon pipeline in which full-length 16s rrna amplicons were sheared and sequenced using an illumina platform, and short reads reassembled into full-length genes. over 24,000 full-length 16s rrna sequences were produced, generating an average of approximately 12,000 operational taxonomic units (otus) (clustered at 97% nucleotide identity) per room-infant pair. dominant gut taxa, including staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and escherichia coli, were widely distributed throughout the room environment with many gut colonizers detected in more than half of samples. reconstructed genomes  from infant gut colonizers revealed a suite of genes that confer resistance to antibiotics (for example, tetracycline, fluoroquinolone, and aminoglycoside) and  sterilizing agents, which likely offer a competitive advantage in the nicu environment. conclusions: we have developed a high-throughput culture-independent approach that integrates room surveys based on full-length 16s rrna gene sequences with metagenomic analysis of fecal samples collected from infants in the room. the approach enabled identification of discrete icu reservoirs of microbes that also colonized the infant gut and provided evidence for the presence of certain organisms in the room prior to their detection in the gut.

TI  == bacterial profile and patterns of antimicrobial drug resistance in intra-abdominal infections: current experience in a teaching hospital.
AB  == context: bacterial isolates from intra-abdominal infections, in particular, peritonitis and their unpredictable antimicrobial resistance patterns, continue to be a matter of concern not only globally but regionally too. aim: an attempt in the present study was made to study the patterns of drug resistance in bacterial isolates, especially gram negative bacilli in intra-abdominal infections (iai) in our hospital. materials and methods: from 100 cases of peritonitis, identification of isolates was done as per recommended methods. antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) testing  were performed following the clsi guidelines. results: a total of 133 clinical isolates were obtained, of which 108 were aerobes and 22 anaerobes. fungal isolates were recovered in only three cases. escherichia coli (47/108) emerged as the most predominant pathogen followed by klebsiella spp. (27/108), while bacteroides fragilis emerged as the predominant anaerobe (12/22). among coliforms, 61.7% e. coli and 74.1% klebsiella spp. were esbl positive. a high level of resistance was observed for beta lactams, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, and ertapenem. ertapenem resistance (30-41%) seen in coliforms, appears as an important issue. imipenem, tigecycline, and colistin were the most consistently active agents tested against esbl producers. conclusion: drug resistance continues to be a major concern in isolates from intra-abdominal infections. treatment with appropriate antibiotics preceded by antimicrobial resistance testing aided by early diagnosis, adequate surgical management, and knowledge of  antibiotic - resistant organisms appears effective in reducing morbidity and mortality in iai cases.

AB  == context: traditional medicinal plants have long been used in ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still  poorly known. objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in ankober district. methods: about 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: plant extracts from embelia schimperi vatke (myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 64 microg/ml against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. pyogenes. growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of ocimum lamiifolium hochst. (lamiaceae) against s. pyogenes, and those of rubus steudneri schweinf. (rosaceae) against s. epidermidis at an mic value of 128 microg/ml. generally, 74% of ethanol extracts  (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial  strains tested at an mic value of 512 microg/ml or below. discussion and conclusions: results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed  strong antimicrobial activities.

TI  == arda proteins from different mobile genetic elements can bind to the ecoki type i dna methyltransferase of e. coli k12.
AB  == anti-restriction and anti-modification (anti-rm) is the ability to prevent cleavage by dna restriction-modification (rm) systems of foreign dna entering a new bacterial host. the evolutionary consequence of anti-rm is the enhanced dissemination of mobile genetic elements. homologues of arda anti-rm proteins are encoded by genes present in many mobile genetic elements such as conjugative plasmids and transposons within bacterial genomes. the arda proteins cause anti-rm by mimicking the dna structure bound by type i rm enzymes. we have investigated arda proteins from the genomes of enterococcus faecalis v583, staphylococcus aureus mu50 and bacteroides fragilis nctc 9343, and compared them  to the arda protein expressed by the conjugative transposon tn916. we find that despite having very different structural stability and secondary structure content, they can all bind to the ecoki methyltransferase, a core component of the ecoki type i rm system. this finding indicates that the less structured arda  proteins become fully folded upon binding. the ability of arda from diverse mobile elements to inhibit type i rm systems from other bacteria suggests that they are an advantage for transfer not only between closely-related bacteria but  also between more distantly related bacterial species.

TI  == structural and functional characterization of nanu, a novel high-affinity sialic  acid-inducible binding protein of oral and gut-dwelling bacteroidetes species.
AB  == many human-dwelling bacteria acquire sialic acid for growth or surface display. we identified previously a sialic acid utilization operon in tannerella forsythia that includes a novel outer membrane sialic acid-transport system (nanou), where  nano (neuraminate outer membrane permease) is a putative tonb-dependent receptor  and nanu (extracellular neuraminate uptake protein) is a predicted susd family protein. using heterologous complementation of nanou genes into an escherichia coli strain devoid of outer membrane sialic acid permeases, we show that the nanou system from the gut bacterium bacteroides fragilis is functional and demonstrate its dependence on tonb for function. we also show that nanu is required for maximal function of the transport system and that it is expressed in a sialic acid-responsive manner. we also show its cellular localization to the outer membrane using fractionation and immunofluorescence experiments. ligand-binding studies revealed high-affinity binding of sialic acid to nanu (kd  ~400 nm) from two bacteroidetes species as well as binding of a range of sialic acid analogues. determination of the crystal structure of nanu revealed a monomeric susd-like structure containing a novel motif characterized by an extended kinked helix that might determine sugar-binding specificity. the results of the present study characterize the first bacterial extracellular sialic acid-binding protein and define a sialic acid-specific pul (polysaccharide utilization locus).

TI  == wbgl: a novel bacterial alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase for the synthesis of 2'-fucosyllactose.
AB  == fucosyltransferases (fucts) are essential tools for the synthesis of fucosylated  glycoconjugates. multistep enzyme catalysis of fucosylated glycans is not limited as long as isolated and well-characterized fucts are available. the present paper introduces a novel bacterial alpha1,2-fuct of the glycosyltransferase family 11 encoded by the gene wbgl in the e. coli o126 genome, which only displays 25-30% homology to previously published alpha1,2-fucts. a tailor made cloning and expression strategy allowed the successful production of active soluble enzyme in the cytoplasm of e. coli bl21(de3) and e. coli jm109(de3), respectively. the lack of a dxd motif and its high activity without divalent metal ions suggests that wbgl belongs to the gt-b fold superfamily. substrate screening revealed the highest activity for beta4-linked galactoside acceptor substrates, such as lactose and lactulose, making wbgl unique among other characterized alpha1,2-fucts. based on its excellent kinetic efficiency for lactose, we present here a sequential reaction strategy for the synthesis of alpha1,2-fucosyllactose  in one pot including the synthesis of the donor substrate 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (gdp)-beta-l-fucose by the bifunctional l-fucokinase/gdp-beta-l-fuc pyrophosphorylase of bacteroides fragilis 9343.

TI  == the mannobiose-forming exo-mannanase involved in a new mannan catabolic pathway in bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == we have proposed a new mannan catabolic pathway in bacteroides fragilis nctc 9343 that involves a putative mannanase mana in glycoside hydrolase family 26 (bf0771), a mannobiose and/or sugar transporter (bf0773), mannobiose 2-epimerase  (bf0774), and mannosylglucose phosphorylase (bf0772). if this hypothesis is correct, mana has to generate mannobiose from mannans as the major end product. in this study, the bf0771 gene from the b. fragilis genome was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli cells. the expressed protein was found to produce mannobiose exclusively from mannans and initially from manno-oligosaccharides. production of 4-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl-d-mannose or 4-o-beta-d-mannopyranosyl-d-glucose from mannans was not detectable. the results  indicate that this enzyme is a novel mannobiose-forming exo-mannanase, consistent with the new microbial mannan catabolic pathway we proposed.

AB  == background: the growth-inhibiting and morphostructural effects of seven constituents identified in asarum heterotropoides root on 14 intestinal bacteria  were compared with those of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin. method: a microtiter plate-based bioassay in sterile 96-well plates was used to evaluate  the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the test materials against the organisms. results: delta-3-carene (5) exhibited the most potent growth inhibition of gram-positive bacteria (clostridium difficile atcc 9689, clostridium paraputrificum atcc 25780, clostridium perfringens atcc 13124, and staphylococcus aureus atcc 12600) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli atcc 11775 and bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285) (minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic), 0.18-0.70 mg/ml) except for salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 13311 (mic, 2.94 mg/ml). the mic of methyleugenol (2), 1,8-cineole (3), alpha-asarone (4), (-)-asarinin (6), and pellitorine (7) was between 1.47 and 2.94 mg/ml against all test bacteria (except for compound 2 against c. difficile (0.70 mg/ml); compounds 1 (23.50 mg/ml) and 4 (5.80 mg/ml) against c. paraputricum; compounds 2 (5.80 mg/ml), 4 (12.0 mg/ml), and 7 (0.70 mg/ml) against c. perfringens); compound 1 against e. coli (7.20 mg/ml) and s. enterica serovar typhimurium (12.0 mg/ml). overall, all of the constituents were  less potent at inhibiting microbial growth than ciprofloxacin (mic, 0.063-0.25 mg/ ml). the lactic acid-producing bacteria (four bifidobacteria and two lactobacilli) and one acidulating bacterium clostridium butyricum atcc 25779 were less sensitive and more susceptible than the five harmful bacteria and two nonpathogenic bacteria (b. fragilis and e. coli) to the constituents and to ciprofloxacin, respectively. beneficial gram-positive bacteria and harmful and nonpathogenic gram-negative bacteria were observed to have different degrees of antimicrobial susceptibility to the constituents, although the antimicrobial susceptibility of the harmful gram-positive bacteria and the harmful and nonpathogenic gram-negative bacteria was not observed. scanning electron microscopy observations showed different degrees of physical damage and morphological alteration to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria treated with alpha-asarone, delta-3-carene, pellitorine, or ciprofloxacin, indicating that they do not share a common mode of action. conclusion: a. heterotropoides root-derived materials described merit further study as potential antibacterial products or lead molecules for the prevention or eradication from humans from diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.

TI  == protection of enterococcus faecalis in mixed cultures with carbapenemase-producing escherichia coli and bacteroide fragilis: effect of the bacterial load.
AB  == introduction: this study explores effects of ph and inoculum size on imipenem versus tigecycline activity against e. coli, b. fragilis and e. faecalis, both in individual and mixed cultures. methods: mic/mbcs (mg/l) of tigecycline and imipenem were 0.12/>/= 16 and 4/4 for e. coli, 0.12/0.5 and >/= 16/>/= 16 for b.  fragilis, and 0.12/>/= 16 and 2/>/= 16 for e. faecalis, respectively. killing curves in supplemented brucella broth were performed at ph 7 or 5.8, with two final inocula ( approximately 105 or approximately 107 cfu/ml) of each isolate (individual cultures) and with 1:1:1 mixed inocula. tubes were 48 h incubated at  37 masculinec in anaerobiosis. final concentrations (estimated concentrations in  colon) were 1.50 mg/l for tigecycline and 26.40 mg/l for imipenem, with antibiotic-free curves as controls. experiments were performed in triplicate. results: imipenem showed inoculum effect against e.coli and b. fragilis, with reductions in initial inocula in experiments with standard inocula contrasting with increases in experiments with high inocula (both individual and mixed cultures). against e. faecalis no inoculum effect for imipenem was observed in individual cultures, with marked reductions in initial inocula regardless inoculum size. however in mixed experiments the indirect protection of e. faecalis by the two gramnegatives resulted in bacterial regrowth. this protection was inoculum-dependant since it occurred with high but not with standard inocula. tigecycline reduced initial inocula of the three isolates regardless culture type (individual/mixed) or experimental conditions (ph/inocula size), with lower reductions for the tolerant e. faecalis. conclusion: carbapenemase activity was inoculum-dependant for self-protection and indirect protection of e. faecalis.

TI  == in vivo efficacy of humanized ceftaroline fosamil-avibactam exposures in a polymicrobial infection model.
AB  == although gram-positive cocci are the most common pathogens in diabetic foot infections, these infections often are polymicrobial. the objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of a simulated human dose of 600 mg ceftaroline fosamil-600 mg avibactam every 8 h as a 1-h infusion in a polymicrobial in vivo murine model. seven isolates were used (3 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus [mrsa] isolates, 1 methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa] isolate, 1 escherichia coli isolate, 1 enterobacter cloacae isolate, and 1 bacteroides fragilis isolate) in various combinations in an immunocompromised polymicrobial tissue infection to assess the efficacy of the simulated regimen. each infection  was comprised of at least one s. aureus isolate with a mic of 0.25 to 1 mug/ml and one enterobacteriaceae isolate with a mic of 1 or 4 mug/ml. eight of 16 infections also included b. fragilis, with a mic of 0.5 mug/ml, as a third organism. efficacy was evaluated after 24 h as the change in log10 cfu from the level of 0-h controls. efficacy was seen against all isolate combinations, with at least a 1-log kill against enterobacteriaceae and a minimum of a 2-log kill against s. aureus and b. fragilis isolates. these bacterial reductions correlate  with free drug concentration above the mic (ft>mic) produced by the humanized regimen of 100, 86, and 56% at mics of 1, 2, and 4 mug/ml, respectively. the humanized regimen of 600 mg ceftaroline fosamil-600 mg avibactam every 8 h as a 1-h infusion showed predictable efficacy against all infections tested in this model. these data support further clinical investigation of ceftaroline fosamil-avibactam for the treatment of polymicrobial tissue infections.

TI  == production of ai-2 is mediated by the s-ribosylhomocystein lyase gene luxs in bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides vulgatus.
AB  == quorum sensing is a cell-cell signaling mechanism based on cell density and that  involves the production of hormone-like molecules called autoinducers (ai). one of the most studied ais has been termed ai-2, and its biosynthesis requires the enzyme encoded by luxs. we have previously described for the first time that bacteroides species can produce molecules with ai-2 activity. in this study, we focus on the detection of luxs and its activity as the ai-2 synthase in bacteroides species. the strains bacteroides fragilis b3b and bacteroides vulgatus atcc 8482 were selected based on a positive phenotype for ai-2 production and the presence of a putative luxs in the genome, respectively. in order to identify the luxs gene, cloning and heterologous expression strategies were utilized. we demonstrate that both strains contain functional luxs orthologs that can complement ai-2 production in escherichia coli.

TI  == use of a genetically-engineered escherichia coli strain as a sample process control for quantification of the host-specific bacterial genetic markers.
AB  == quantitative pcr (qpcr) assays targeting the host-specific bacteroides-prevotella 16s rrna genetic markers have been proposed as one of the promising approaches to identify the source of fecal contamination in environmental waters. one of the concerns of qpcr assays to environmental samples is the reliability of quantified values, since dna extraction followed by qpcr assays are usually performed without appropriate sample process control (spc) and internal amplification controls (iacs). to check the errors in sample processing and improve the reliability of qpcr results, it is essential to evaluate the dna recovery efficiency and pcr amplification efficiency of the target genetic markers and correct the measurement results. in this study, we constructed a genetically-engineered escherichia coli k12 strain (designated as strain mg1655 deltalac::kan) as sample process control and evaluated the applicability to environmental water samples. the recovery efficiency of the spc strain mg1655 deltalac::kan was similar to that of bacteroides fragilis jcm 11019, when dna were extracted from water samples spiked with the two bacteria. furthermore, the  spc was included in the qpcr assays with propidium monoazide (pma) treatment, which can exclude the genetic markers from dead cells. no significant dna loss was observed in the pma treatment. the inclusion of both the spc (strain mg1655 deltalac::kan) and iac in qpcr assays with pma treatment gave the assurance of reliable results of host-specific bacteroides-prevotella 16s rrna genetic markers in environmental water samples.

TI  == impact of cyadox on human colonic microflora in chemostat models.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiological safety of cyadox, a new member of quinoxaline-1,4-dioxides (qdnos), on human intestinal flora. four chemostats containing human fecal flora were exposed to 0, 16, 32, and 128 mug/ml of cyadox, respectively. bacterial populations, resistance rates of two predominant bacteria and short-chain fatty acids (scfa) were monitored daily prior to and during drug moa laboratory of risk assessment for quality and safety of livestock and poultry products exposure. colonization resistance (cr) of each  community was determined by three successive daily challenges of salmonella typhimurium. efflux pump gene (oqxab) in the escherichia coli and enterococcus strains were analyzed by pcr amplification and dna sequencing. no change in scfa  was observed after exposure to different concentrations of cyadox. lower concentration of cyadox (16 mug/ml) had no adverse effect on human microflora. however, higher concentrations of cyadox (32 and 128 mug/ml) could change bacterial population and increase the proportion of resistant e. coli and enterococcus. more than 26% (12/46) of cyadox resistant e. coli strains contained oqxab gene, while all the resistant enterococcus were negative to oqxab gene. relationship between the occurrence of oqxab gene and cyadox exposure is inconclusive. our data indicated that 16 mug/ml might be the no observed effect concentration (noec) of cyadox. derived microbiological acceptable daily intake (madi) would be 1552.03 mug/kg d. the data obtained in present study indicated that cyadox was a safe member of qdnos family of antimicrobial agents.

TI  == purification and characterisation of recombinant bacteroides fragilis toxin-2.
AB  == fragilysin (bft) is metalloprotease that is secreted by enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis. studying the mechanism of bft interaction with intestinal epithelial cells requires a pure protein sample. in this study, we cloned dna-fragments coding for the catalytic domain of fragilysin-2 and profragilysin-2 into an e. coli expression vector. purification methods for the recombinant fragilysin-2 catalytic domain and profragilysin-2 were developed. in addition, we obtained mature active fragilysin-2 from recombinant proprotein by limited tryptic digestion. we tested the biological activity of the recombinant protein samples and revealed that e-cadherin was cleaved when ht-29 cells were treated with mature fragilysin-2 but not with profragilysin-2. azocoll, azocasein and gelatin were not proteolytically cleaved by mature fragilysin-2. proteins released in culture medium after ht-29 cells treatment with mature active bft-2 were identified.

TI  == tissue concentrations of antibiotics given prophylactically during colorectal cancer surgery.
AB  == background/aims: this study was designed to clarify the pharmacokinetics of prophylactically administered cefmetazole in serum, intestinal tissue, and subcutaneous adipose tissue in patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer. methodology: cefmetazole sodium (1 g) was given intravenously during the  induction of anesthesia, followed by a 1-g dose after 3 hours. blood samples were taken at the start of surgery, immediately before administration of the additional dose of cefmetazole, at the time of lesion resection, and at the time  of wound closure. tissue samples were obtained immediately after lesion resection and at the time of wound closure. concentrations of cefmetazole in serum and tissue were measured by high performance liquid chromatography using an internal  standard for calibration. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic80) of cefmetazole for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacteroides fragilis were measured, and pharmacokinetics were evaluated. results: in subcutaneous adipose tissue, cefmetazole concentrations were maintained higher than the mic80's for e. coli and k. pneumoniae, but were low in all patients regardless of the time of measurement. conclusions: the low transition rate of cefmetazole into subcutaneous adipose tissue indicates the need for additional measures, such as high-pressure washing of the subcutaneous wound tissue.

AB  == nanornase (nrn) specifically degrades nucleoside 3',5'-bisphosphate and the very  short rna, nanorna, during the final step of mrna degradation. the crystal structure of nrn in complex with a reaction product gmp was determined. the overall structure consists of two domains that are interconnected by a flexible loop and form a cleft. two mn(2)(+) ions are coordinated by conserved residues in the dhh motif of the n-terminal domain. gmp binds near the dhha1 motif region in  the c-terminal domain. our structure enables us to predict the substrate-bound form of nrn as well as other dhh/dhha1 phosphoesterase family proteins.

TI  == human colonic mucus is a reservoir for antimicrobial peptides.
AB  == background and aims: to prevent bacterial adherence and translocation, the colonic mucosa is covered by a protecting mucus layer and the epithelium synthesizes antimicrobial peptides. the present qualitative study investigated the contents and interaction of these peptides in and with rectal mucus. methods: rectal mucus extracts were analyzed for antimicrobial activity and screened with  matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, dot blot and immunohistochemistry for antimicrobial peptides. in addition, binding of amps to mucins was investigated by western blot and enzyme-linked lectin assays.  results: in functional tests the mucus layer exhibited a strong antimicrobial activity. we detected 11 antimicrobial peptides in mucus extracts from healthy persons including the defensins hbd-1 and -3, the cathelicidin ll-37, ubiquitin,  lysozyme, histones, high mobility group nucleosome-binding domain-containing protein 2, ubiquicidin and other ribosomal proteins. amps were bound by mucins but this was demonstrated to be reversible and inhibition of antibacterial activity was limited. conclusion: these findings indicate that epithelial antimicrobial peptides are retained in the intestinal mucus layer without losing  their efficacy. thus, the mucus layer and its composition provide an attractive drug target to restore antimicrobial barrier function in intestinal diseases.

TI  == construction of escherichia coli strains with chromosomally integrated expression cassettes for the synthesis of 2'-fucosyllactose.
AB  == background: the trisaccharide 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-fl) is one of the most abundant oligosaccharides found in human milk. due to its prebiotic and anti-infective properties, 2'-fl is discussed as nutritional additive for infant  formula. besides chemical synthesis and extraction from human milk, 2'-fl can be  produced enzymatically in vitro and in vivo. the most promising approach for a large-scale formation of 2'-fl is the whole cell biosynthesis in escherichia coli by intracellular synthesis of gdp-l-fucose and subsequent fucosylation of lactose with an appropriate alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase. even though whole cell approaches have been demonstrated for the synthesis of 2'-fl, further improvements of the engineered e. coli host are required to increase product yields. furthermore, an antibiotic-free method of whole cell synthesis of 2'-fl is desirable to simplify product purification and to avoid traces of antibiotics  in a product with nutritional purpose. results: here we report the construction of the first selection marker-free e. coli strain that produces 2'-fl from lactose and glycerol. to construct this strain, recombinant genes of the de novo  synthesis pathway for gdp-l-fucose as well as the gene for the h. pylori fucosyltransferase futc were integrated into the chromosome of e. coli jm109 by using the lambda-red recombineering technique. strains carrying additional copies of the futc gene and/or the gene fkp (from bacteroides fragilis) for an additional salvage pathway for gdp-l-fucose production were used and shown to further improve production of 2'-fl in shake flask experiments. an increase of the intracellular gdp-l-fucose concentration by expression of fkp gene as well as an additional copy of the futc gene lead to an enhanced formation of 2'-fl. using an improved production strain, feasibility of large scale 2'-fl production was demonstrated in an antibiotic-free fed-batch fermentation (13 l) with a final 2'-fl concentration of 20.28 +/- 0.83 g l(-1) and a space-time-yield of 0.57 g l(-1) h(-1). conclusions: by chromosomal integration of recombinant genes, altering the copy number of these genes and analysis of 2'-fl and intracellular gdp-l-fucose levels, we were able to construct and improve the first selection marker-free e. coli strain which is capable to produce 2'-fl without the use of expression plasmids. analysis of intracellular gdp-l-fucose levels identified the de novo synthesis pathway of gdp-l-fucose as one bottleneck in 2'-fl production.  in antibiotic-free fed-batch fermentation with an improved strain, scale-up of 2'-fl could be demonstrated.

TI  == development and application of a quantitative pcr assay targeting catellicoccus marimammalium for assessing gull-associated fecal contamination at lake erie beaches.
AB  == gulls represent one of the major fecal contamination sources responsible for the  degradation of water quality at lake erie beaches. for assessing gull-associated  fecal contamination, a real-time quantitative pcr assay (qpcr) targeting 16s rrna gene sequences from catellicoccus marimammalium, which are abundant in gull feces, was developed and evaluated by comparing assay results with beach survey data that included gull counting, and quantifying densities of escherichia coli and human-associated fecal markers at two lake erie beaches. in evaluating the specificity and sensitivity of the qpcr assay with animal and wastewater samples, c. marimammalium was detected in most gull fecal samples (80.7%), some chicken fecal samples (24.1%), but was not readily detected from other fecal samples of animals and humans, and wastewater. among 66 lake erie water samples collected in 2010, c. marimammalium was frequently detected from villa angela (36.4%) and headlands beaches (57.6%). c. marimammalium densities were not associated with e. coli densities or sanitary survey data. e. coli counts were likely driven by other sources, such as human, rather than gulls at the study sites. the presumption that human contamination influenced e. coli counts was supported by more frequent detection of the human-specific bacteroides gyrb marker (gyrb) at villa angela (33.3%) than headlands (6.1%). since e. coli may not be an effective indicator for assessing gull-related fecal contamination at these beaches, where  contamination sources are mixed, our novel qpcr assay can be useful for understanding fecal source contributions from gulls not explained by gull abundance or e. coli densities.

AB  == tigecycline is a new glycylcyclin with a wide spectre including multi-resistant bacteria. our laboratory tests in routine the in vitro activity of the tgc towards clinically significant isolates of 3rd generation cephalosporins resistant enterobacteriaceae (ec3r), acinetobacter baumannii and bacteroides fragilis group (bfg). the objective of this study is to describe the in vitro activity of tgc against these strains isolated between 2008 and 2011 in the university hospital of montpellier. in this study period, 1070 isolates ec3r including 541 extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producers (esbl) strains, 47 isolates of a. baumannii including 40 multi-resistant isolates and 645 isolates of bfg were tested. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined using the e-test method. tgc was active against 86.2% of ec3r with a mic 90 less or equal to 1mg/l (escherichia coli being the most sensitive species). a. baumannii  and bfg were also inhibited at low concentrations of tgc with a mic 90 less or equal to 2mg/l respectively for 47% and 84.2% of the isolates. our study confirms the activity of tgc against the ec3r including esbl-producers strains. the relevance of the therapeutic use of tgc on the bfg isolates with a mic greater than 2mg/l should be better documented. often prescribed in therapeutic impasse,  the proper use of tgc would require: clarifying the threshold of sensitivity for  some species (i.e., a. baumannii, bacteroides fragilis group); a better understanding of correlation between in vitro and in vivo activity.

TI  == candida albicans primes tlr cytokine responses through a dectin-1/raf-1-mediated  pathway.
AB  == the immune system is essential to maintain homeostasis with resident microbial populations, ensuring that the symbiotic host-microbial relationship is maintained. in parallel, commensal microbes significantly shape mammalian immunity at the host mucosal surface, as well as systemically. candida albicans is an opportunistic pathogen that lives as a commensal on skin and mucosa of healthy individuals. little is known about its capacity to modulate responses toward other microorganisms, such as colonizing bacteria (e.g., intestinal microorganisms). the aim of this study was to assess the cytokine production of pbmcs induced by commensal bacteria when these cells were primed by c. albicans.  we show that c. albicans and beta-1,3-glucan induce priming of human primary mononuclear cells and this leads to enhanced cytokine production upon in vitro stimulation with tlr ligands and bacterial commensals. this priming requires the  beta-1,3-glucan receptor dectin-1 and the noncanonical raf-1 pathway. in addition, although purified mannans cannot solely mediate the priming, the presence of mannosyl residues in the cell wall of c. albicans is nevertheless required. in conclusion, c. albicans is able to modify cytokine responses to tlr  ligands and colonizing bacteria, which is likely to impact the inflammatory reaction during mucosal diseases.

AB  == aim: to investigate the effect of moxibustion on intestinal flora and release of  interleukin-12 (il-12) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) from the colon in rat with ulcerative colitis (uc). methods: a rat model of uc was established by local stimulation of the intestine with supernatant from colonic contents harvested from human uc patients. a total of 40 male sprague-dawley rats were randomly divided into the following groups: normal (sham), model (uc), herb-partition moxibustion (hpm-treated), and positive control sulfasalazine (sa-treated). rats treated with hpm received hpm at acupuncture points st25 and rn6, once a day for 15 min, for a total of 8 d. rats in the sa group were perfused with sa twice a day for 8 d. the colonic histopathology was observed by  hematoxylin-eosin. the levels of intestinal flora, including bifidobacterium, lactobacillus, escherichia coli (e. coli), and bacteroides fragilis (b. fragilis), were tested by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction to detect bacterial 16s rrna/dna in order to determine dna copy numbers of each specific species. immunohistochemical assays were used to observe the expression  of tnf-alpha and il-12 in the rat colons. results: hpm treatment inhibited immunopathology in colonic tissues of uc rats; the general morphological score and the immunopathological score were significantly decreased in the hpm and sa groups compared with the model group [3.5 (2.0-4.0), 3.0 (1.5-3.5) vs 6.0 (5.5-7.0), p < 0.05 for the general morphological score, and 3.00 (2.00-3.50), 3.00 (2.50-3.50) vs 5.00 (4.50-5.50), p < 0.01 for the immunopathological score]. as measured by dna copy number, we found that bifidobacterium and lactobacillus,  which are associated with a healthy colon, were significantly higher in the hpm and sa groups than in the model group (1.395 +/- 1.339, 1.461 +/- 1.152 vs 0.045  +/- 0.036, p < 0.01 for bifidobacterium, and 0.395 +/- 0.325, 0.851 +/- 0.651 vs  0.0015 +/- 0.0014, p < 0.01 for lactobacillus). on the other hand, e. coli and b. fragilis, which are associated with an inflamed colon, were significantly lower in the hpm and sa groups than in the model group (0.244 +/- 0.107, 0.628 +/- 0.257 vs 1.691 +/- 0.683, p < 0.01 for e. coli, and 0.351 +/- 0.181, 0.416 +/- 0.329 vs 1.285 +/- 1.039, p < 0.01 for b. fragilis). the expression of tnf-alpha  and il-12 was decreased after hpm and sa treatment as compared to uc model alone  (4970.81 +/- 959.78, 6635.45 +/- 1135.16 vs 12333.81 +/- 680.79, p < 0.01 for tnf-alpha, and 5528.75 +/- 1245.72, 7477.38 +/- 1259.16 vs 12550.29 +/- 1973.30,  p < 0.01 for il-12). conclusion: hpm treatment can regulate intestinal flora and  inhibit the expression of tnf-alpha and il-12 in the colon tissues of uc rats, indicating that hpm can improve colonic immune response.

TI  == pharmacodynamic modelling of intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery.
AB  == surgical-site infections are the leading cause of post-operative morbidity and mortality as well as increased costs following colorectal surgery. the purpose of this study was to evaluate different beta-lactam antimicrobial dosing regimens currently used for prophylaxis in elective colorectal procedures with the aim of  identifying optimal antibiotics and dosing regimens. serum pharmacokinetic (pk) parameters specific to each drug for use in pharmacodynamic (pd) modelling were obtained from the published literature. susceptibility data for escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus aureus for use in modelling simulations were obtained from the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast). monte carlo simulation was used to evaluate the influence of dose and dosing frequency of tested antibiotics to achieve a prophylaxis target ft>mic (time during which the free drug concentration exceeds the pathogen minimum inhibitory concentration) of 100% for up to 4h. ertapenem 1g, cefuroxime 1.5 g and cefazolin 2 g were the only antibiotic regimens that consistently yielded target ft>mic of 100% for the entire 4-h post-dose interval and against all targeted organisms more than 90% of the time. in contrast, cefoxitin, cefotetan and ampicillin/sulbactam yielded very poor predicted pk/pd performances. in conclusion, this study demonstrates the value of, and need for, applied pd research in the area of surgical prophylaxis. whether cefoxitin, cefotetan or ampicillin/sulbactam should continue to be advocated as first-line agents for prophylaxis during elective colorectal surgery, particularly at the standard doses currently being used, is debatable.

TI  == microbiology of explanted suture segments from infected and noninfected surgical  patients.
AB  == sutures under selective host/environmental factors can potentiate postoperative surgical site infection (ssi). the present investigation characterized microbial  recovery and biofilm formation from explanted absorbable (ab) and nonabsorbable (nab) sutures from infected and noninfected sites. ab and nab sutures were harvested from noninfected (70.9%) and infected (29.1%) sites in 158 patients. at explantation, devices were sonicated and processed for qualitative/quantitative bacteriology; selective sutures were processed for scanning electron microscopy (sem). bacteria were recovered from 85 (53.8%) explanted sites; 39 sites were noninfected, and 46 were infected. suture recovery ranged from 11.1 to 574.6 days postinsertion. a significant difference in mean microbial recovery between noninfected (1.2 isolates) and infected (2.7 isolates) devices (p < 0.05) was noted. staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia spp. were recovered from infected devices, while commensal skin flora was recovered from noninfected  devices. no significant difference in quantitative microbial recovery between infected monofilament and multifilament sutures was noted. biofilm was present in 100% and 66.6% of infected and noninfected devices, respectively (p < 0.042). we  conclude that both monofilament and braided sutures provide a hospitable surface  for microbial adherence: (i) a significant difference in microbial recovery from  infected and noninfected sutures was noted, (ii) infected sutures harbored a mixed flora, including multidrug-resistant health care-associated pathogens, and  (iii) a significant difference in the presence or absence of a biofilm in infected versus noninfected explanted devices was noted. further studies to document the benefit of focused risk reduction strategies to minimize suture contamination and biofilm formation postimplantation are warranted.

TI  == [role of infectious agents in the emergence of malignant tumors].
AB  == according to the data of the international agency for research on cancer (iarc),  at least 6 virus species (hpv, ebv, hhv-8/kshv, htlv-1, hbv, hcv), 4 helminthes species (schistosoma haematobium and japonicum, opisthorchis viverrini, clonorchis sinensis) and i bacterium species (helicobacter pylori) have been proved to be capable of causing the development of cancer. the analysis of the data available shows that merkel cell polyomavirus (mcv), herpes simplex virus (hsv), john cunningham polyomavirus (jcv), monkey virus 40 (sv40), cytomegalovirus (cmv), xenotropic murine leukemia virus (xmrv), helicobacter bilis and hepaticus, campylobacter jejuni, fusobacterium varium, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus, prevotella spp., streptococcus bovis and anginosus, treponema denticola, salmonella typhi, paratyphi and typhimurium, borrelia burgdorferi, bartonella spp., mycobacterium tuberculosis, chlamydia pneumoniae, trachomatis and psittaci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, propionibacterium acnes, tropheryma whippelii, schistosoma mansoni, opistorchis felineus, strongyloides stercoralis, taenia solium, candida  spp., paracoccidioides brasiliensis, histoplasma capsulatum and trichomonas vaginalis can also be potential etiological agents of cancer. apparently, detection of new associations between infectious agents and risk of the development of cancer will facilitate progress in elaboration of prophylaxis measures, early diagnostic methods and, probably, methods of treatment of malignant tumors.

TI  == nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of pathogens isolated from surgical site infections (ssi) in japan.
AB  == to investigate the trends of antimicrobial resistance in pathogens isolated from  surgical site infections (ssi), a japanese surveillance committee conducted the first nationwide survey. seven main organisms were collected from ssi at 27 medical centers in 2010 and were shipped to a central laboratory for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. a total of 702 isolates from 586 patients with ssi were included. staphylococcus aureus (20.4 %) and enterococcus faecalis  (19.5 %) were the most common isolates, followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.4  %) and bacteroides fragilis group (15.4 %). methicillin-resistant s. aureus among s. aureus was 72.0 %. vancomycin mic 2 mug/ml strains accounted for 9.7 %. in escherichia coli, 11 of 95 strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (klebsiella pneumoniae, 0/53 strains). of e. coli strains, 8.4 % were resistant to ceftazidime (caz) and 26.3 % to ciprofloxacin (cpfx). no p. aeruginosa strains produced metallo-beta-lactamase. in p. aeruginosa, the resistance rates were 7.4  % to tazobactam/piperacillin (taz/pipc), 10.2 % to imipenem (ipm), 2.8 % to meropenem, cefepime, and cpfx, and 0 % to gentamicin. in the b. fragilis group, the rates were 28.6 % to clindamycin, 5.7 % to cefmetazole, 2.9 % to taz/pipc and ipm, and 0 % to metronidazole (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron; 59.1, 36.4, 0, 0, 0  %). mic(9)(0) of p. aeruginosa isolated 15 days or later after surgery rose in taz/pipc, caz, ipm, and cpfx. in patients with american society of anesthesiologists (asa) score >/=3, the resistance rates of p. aeruginosa to taz/pipc and caz were higher than in patients with asa </=2. the data obtained in this study revealed the trend of the spread of resistance among common species that cause ssi. timing of isolation from surgery and the patient's physical status affected the selection of resistant organisms.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == effects of potato fiber and potato-resistant starch on biomarkers of colonic health in rats fed diets containing red meat.
AB  == the effects of red meat consumption with and without fermentable carbohydrates on indices of large bowel health in rats were examined. sprague-dawley rats were fed cellulose, potato fiber, or potato-resistant starch diets containing 12% casein for 2 wk, then similar diets containing 25% cooked beef for 6 wk. after week 8, cecal and colonic microbiota composition, fermentation end-products, colon structure, and colonocyte dna damage were analyzed. rats fed potato fiber had lower bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas group compared to other diet groups. colonic bifidobacterium spp. and/or lactobacillus spp. were higher in potato fiber and potato-resistant starch diets than in the cellulose diet. beneficial changes were observed in short-chain fatty acid concentrations (acetic, butyric,  and propionic acids) in rats fed potato fiber compared with rats fed cellulose. phenol and p-cresol concentrations were lower in the cecum and colon of rats fed  potato fiber. an increase in goblet cells per crypt and longer crypts were found  in the colon of rats fed potato fiber and potato-resistant starch diets. fermentable carbohydrates had no effect on colonic dna damage. dietary combinations of red meat with potato fiber or potato-resistant starch have distinctive effects in the large bowel. future studies are essential to examine the efficacy of different types of nondigestible carbohydrates in maintaining colonic health during long-term consumption of high-protein diets. practical application: improved understanding of interactions between the food consumed and gut microbiota provides knowledge needed to make healthier food choices for large bowel health. the impact of red meat on large bowel health may be ameliorated by  consuming with fermentable dietary fiber, a colonic energy source that produces less harmful by-products than the microbial breakdown of colonic protein for energy. developing functional red meat products with fermentable dietary fiber could be one way to promote a healthy and balanced macronutrient diet.

TI  == treatment of bran containing bread by baking enzymes; effect on the growth of probiotic bacteria on soluble dietary fiber extract in vitro.
AB  == different ways of treating bran by baking enzymes prior to dough making and the baking process were used to increase the amount of water-soluble dietary fiber (df) in wheat bread with added bran. soluble df was extracted from the bread with water and separated from the digestible material with gastrointestinal tract enzymes and by solvent precipitation. the baking enzyme mixtures tested (xylanase and glucanase/cellulase, with and without lipase) increased the amounts of soluble arabinoxylan and protein resistant to digestion. the isolated fiber was used as a growth substrate for 11 probiotic and intestinal bifidobacterium strains, for commensal strains of bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli, and  for potential intestinal pathogenic strains of e. coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, and clostridium perfringens. fermentation analyses indicated that the tested strains had varying capacity to grow in the presence of the extracted  fiber. of the tested probiotic strains b. longum species generally showed the highest ability to utilize the fiber extracts, although the potential pathogens tested also showed an ability to grow on these fiber extracts. in sum, the enzymes used to improve the baking process for high-fiber bread can also be used  to produce in situ soluble fiber material, which in turn can exert prebiotic effects on certain potentially beneficial microbes.

AB  == episodes of blood-streaked stools are not uncommon in exclusively breast-fed infants under 6 months of age. such bleeding is thought to be associated with food protein-induced proctocolitis, however the pathomechanism remains unclear. the aim of this study was to investigate intestinal microbiota and secretory immunoglobulin a in the feces of exclusively breast-fed infants with blood-streaked stools. fecal specimens from 15 full-term infants with blood-streaked stools and 15 breast-fed healthy infants were studied and the results compared. all infants had been delivered vaginally and exclusively breast-fed. the fecal microbiota were investigated by phylogenetic analysis combined with culture methods for some bacterial species, and feces were assessed for the presence of fecal secretory immunoglobulin a by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. phylogenetic cluster analysis revealed four major clusters of fecal bacteria, cluster a being found only in healthy infants. the bacteroides fragilis group was observed more frequently in controls than in patients (p < 0.05). in the controls, the predominant species belonging to the enterobacteriaceae group was escherichia coli, whereas in the patients it was klebsiella (p < 0.05). concentrations of secretory immunoglobulin a were high in  one third of the healthy controls. in conclusion, the pathomechanism of rectal bleeding in exclusively breast-fed infants may be related to differences in the composition of their intestinal flora.

TI  == differential interleukin-10 (il-10) and il-23 production by human blood monocytes and dendritic cells in response to commensal enteric bacteria.
AB  == human peripheral blood contains antigen-presenting cells (apc), including dendritic cells (dc) and monocytes, that may encounter microbes that have translocated from the intestine to the periphery in disease states like hiv-1 infection and inflammatory bowel disease. we investigated the response of dc and  monocytes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) to a panel of representative commensal enteric bacteria, including escherichia coli, enterococcus sp., and bacteroides fragilis. all three bacteria induced significant upregulation of the maturation and activation markers cd40 and cd83 on myeloid dendritic cells (mdc) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pdc). however, only mdc produced cytokines, including interleukin-10 (il-10), il-12p40/70, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), in response to bacterial stimulation. cytokine profiles in whole pbmc differed depending on the stimulating bacterial species: b. fragilis induced production of il-23, il-12p70, and il-10, whereas e. coli and enterococcus induced an il-10-predominant response. mdc and monocyte depletion experiments indicated that these cell types differentially produced il-10 and il-23 in response to e. coli and b. fragilis. bacteroides thetaiotaomicron did not induce levels of il-23 similar to those of b. fragilis,  suggesting that b. fragilis may have unique proinflammatory properties among bacteroides species. the addition of recombinant human il-10 to pbmc cultures stimulated with commensal bacteria abrogated the il-23 response, whereas blocking il-10 significantly enhanced il-23 production, suggesting that il-10 controls the levels of il-23 produced. these results indicate that blood mdc and monocytes respond differentially to innate stimulation with whole commensal bacteria and that il-10 may play a role in controlling the proinflammatory response to translocated microbes.

TI  == transposon mutagenesis of the anaerobic commensal, bacteroides fragilis, using the ez::tn5 transposome.
AB  == genetic analysis of bacteroides fragilis (bf) is hindered because of the lack of  efficient transposon mutagenesis methods. here, we describe a simple method for transposon mutagenesis using ez::tn5, a commercially available system that we optimized for use in bf638r. the modified ez::tn5 transposon contains an escherichia coli conditional origin of replication, a kanamycin resistance gene for e. coli, an erythromycin resistance gene for bf , and 19 basepair transposase recognition sequences on either ends. electroporation of the transposome (transposon-transposase complex) into bf638r yielded 3.2 +/- 0.35 x 10(3) cfu mug(-1) of transposon dna. modification of the transposon by the bf638r restriction/modification system increased transposition efficiency sixfold. electroporation of the ez::tn5 transposome results in a single-copy insertion of  the transposon evenly distributed across the genome of bf638r and can be used to  construct a bf638r transposon library. the transposon was also effective in mutating a bf clinical isolate and a strain of the related species, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. the ez::tn5-based mutagenesis described here is more efficient  than other transposon mutagenesis approaches previously reported for bf.

TI  == contribution of hly homologs to the hemolytic activity of prevotella intermedia.
AB  == prevotella intermedia is a periodontal pathogen that requires iron for its growth. although this organism has hemolytic activity, the precise nature of its  hemolytic substances and their associated hemolytic actions are yet to be fully determined. in the present study, we identified and characterized several putative hly genes in p. intermedia atcc25611 which appear to encode hemolysins.  six hly genes (hlya, b, c, d, e, and hlyi) of p. intermedia were identified by comparing their nucleotide sequences to those of known hly genes of bacteroides fragilis nctc9343. the hlya-e, and hlyi genes were overexpressed individually in  the non-hemolytic escherichia coli strain jw5181 and examined its contribution to the hemolytic activity on sheep blood agar plates. e. coli cells expressing the hlya and hlyi genes exhibited hemolytic activity under anaerobic conditions. on the other hand, only e. coli cells stably expressing the hlya gene were able to lyse the red blood cells when cultured under aerobic conditions. in addition, expression of the hlya and hlyi genes was significantly upregulated in the presence of red blood cells. furthermore, we found that the growth of p. intermedia was similar in an iron-limited medium supplemented with either red blood cells or heme. taken together, our results indicate that the hlya and hlyi  genes of p. intermedia encode putative hemolysins that appear to be involved in the lysis of red blood cells, and suggest that these hemolysins might play important roles in the iron-dependent growth of this organism.

TI  == modelling bacterial transmission in human allergen-specific ige sensitization.
AB  == aims: the impact of bacterial transmission from mother to child on human allergy  development is poorly understood. the aim of the present work was therefore to use a temporal collected dataset of 117 mothers and their children to model the potential effect of mother-to-child bacterial transmission on allergy (ige) sensitization. methods and results: we have recently shown a negative ige correlation to high escherichia coli levels until the age of 1 year, with a shift to positive correlation to high bacteroides fragilis levels at the age of 2. in the present work, we used the previous published data to model the persistence and interaction effects of e. coli and b. fragilis with respect to ige sensitization. temporal modelling was made by first defining a stochastic model for sensitization state based on markov chains and regression tree analyses. subsequent simulations were used to determine the impact of mother-to-infant bacterial transmission. the regression tree analyses showed that e. coli colonization within 4 days was negatively correlated to sensitization, while lack of e. coli colonization at day 4 combined with b. fragilis colonization after 4 months was positively correlated. with markov chain analyses, we found that e. coli was highly persistent in infants until the age of 4 months, while the persistence of b. fragilis increased with age. conclusions: simulations showed that the mother's bacterial composition correlated significantly to the child's ige sensitization state at the age of 2 years. high e. coli and low b. fragilis levels in the mother were negatively correlated, while low e. coli and high b. fragilis were positively correlated to ige. significance and impact of the study: our results support that allergy could partly be communicable, being transferred  from mother to infant through the gut microbiota.

TI  == differential intestinal m-cell gene expression response to gut commensals.
AB  == different rates of bacterial translocation across the gut mucosa have been reported but few studies have examined translocation of commensals at the level of the gut epithelial microfold (m) cell. we used an in vitro m-cell model to quantify translocation and determine the transcriptional response of m cells to various commensal bacteria. the transport kinetics and gene expression profile of m cells in response to different bacterial strains, namely lactobacillus salivarius, escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis, was assessed. bacterial strains translocated across m cells with different efficiencies; e. coli and b. fragilis translocated with equal efficiency whereas l. salivarius translocated with less efficiency. microarray analysis of the m cell response showed both common and differential gene expression changes between the bacterial strains. in the presence of bacteria, but not control beads, up-regulated genes were mainly involved in transcription regulation whereas pro-inflammatory and stress response genes were primarily up-regulated by e. coli and b. fragilis, but not l. salivarius nor beads. translocation of bacteria and m-cell gene expression responses were confirmed in murine m cells following bacterial challenge in vivo. these results demonstrate that m cells have the ability to discriminate between different commensal bacteria and modify subsequent immune responses.

AB  == acute appendicitis is a common cause of acute abdomen requiring an emergency appendicectomy. complications such as perforation and peritoneal contamination leading to peritonitis can result from delay in presentation and an emergency operation. this study prospectively recruited 101 patients diagnosed with acute appendicitis to correlate the bacterial flora with the severity of appendicitis.  the results show that 90 patients had acutely inflamed or gangrenous appendicitis and 11 had perforated appendicitis. the ages ranged from 6 to 49 years with a median of 20 years. there were 59 females and 42 males. the commonest isolates were aerobic bacteria such as escherichia coli, group d streptococci and klebsiella pneumoniae. mixed infection with anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis was seen only in perforated appendicitis. the best choices of antibiotic were a fluoroquinolone, cephalosporin and aminoglycoside for aerobic organisms and metronidazole for anaerobes.

TI  == therapeutic equivalence requires pharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic identities: true bioequivalence of a generic product of intravenous metronidazole.
AB  == animal models of infection have been used to demonstrate the therapeutic failure  of "bioequivalent" generic products, but their applicability for this purpose requires the accurate identification of those products that are truly bioequivalent. here, we present data comparing one intravenous generic product of metronidazole with the innovator product in a neutropenic mouse thigh anaerobic infection model. simultaneous experiments allowed comparisons (generic versus innovator) of potency and the concentration of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (api), analytical chemistry (liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry [lc/ms]), in vitro susceptibility testing, single-dose serum pharmacokinetics (pk) in infected mice, and in vivo pharmacodynamics (pd) against bacteroides fragilis atcc 25825 in synergy with escherichia coli sig-1 in the neutropenic mouse thigh anaerobic infection model. the hill dose-response model followed by curve-fitting analysis was used to calculate and compare primary and secondary pd parameters. the generic and the innovator products were identical in terms of the concentration and potency of the api, chromatographic and spectrographic profiles, mic and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc) (2.0 mg/liter), and mouse pk. we found no differences between products in bacteriostatic doses (bd) (15 to 22 mg/kg of body weight per day) or the doses needed to kill 1 log (1lkd)  (21 to 29 mg/kg per day) or 2 logs (2lkd) (28 to 54 mg/kg per day) of b. fragilis under dosing schedules of every 12 h (q12h), q8h, or q6h. the area under the concentration-time curve over 24 h in the steady state divided by the mic (auc/mic ratio) was the best pd index to predict the antibacterial efficacy of metronidazole (adjusted coefficient of determination [adjr(2)] = 84.6%), and its  magnitude to reach bacteriostasis in vivo (56.6 +/- 5.17 h) or to kill the first  (90.8 +/- 9.78 h) and second (155.5 +/- 22.2 h) logs was the same for both products. animal models of infection allow a thorough demonstration of the therapeutic equivalence of generic antimicrobials.

TI  == significance of perioperative infection in survival of patients with ovarian cancer.
AB  == objectives: perioperative infectious diseases comprise some of the most common causes of surgical mortality in women with ovarian cancer. this study was aimed to evaluate the significance of perioperative infections in survival of patients  with ovarian cancer. methods: patients who underwent primary cytoreductive surgery were included in the analysis (n = 276). the enumeration and speciation of pathogens, antimicrobial agents used, and sensitivity assay results were culled from medical records and correlated to clinicopathologic demographics and  survival outcomes. perioperative infection was determined as a positive microbiology result obtained within a 6-week postoperative period. results: the incidence of perioperative infection was 15.9% (common sites: urinary tract, 57.3%, and surgical wound, 21.4%). commonly isolated pathogens were enterococcus  species (22.4%) and escherichia coli (19.4%) in urinary tract infection, and bacteroides fragilis, e. coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae (all, 16%) in surgical wound infection. imipenem represents one of the least resistant antimicrobial agents commonly seen in urinary tract and surgical wound infections in our institution. perioperative infection was associated with diabetes, serous histology, lymph node metastasis, bowel resection, decreased bicarbonate, and elevated serum urea nitrogen in multivariate analysis. perioperative infections were associated with increased surgical mortality, delay in chemotherapy treatment, decreased chemotherapy response, shorter progression-free survival (median time, 8.4 vs 17.6 months; p < 0.001), and decreased overall survival (29.0 vs 51.8 months; p = 0.011). multivariate analysis showed that perioperative infections other than urinary tract infection remained a significant risk factor  for decreased survival (progression-free survival, p = 0.02; and overall survival, p = 0.019). conclusion: perioperative infectious disease comprises an independent risk factor for survival of patients with ovarian cancer.

TI  == optimal suture materials for contaminated gastrointestinal surgery: does infection influence the decrease of the tensile strength of sutures?
AB  == purpose: suture materials are selected based on the following factors: absorbable/non-absorbable, monofilament/multifilament, duration with sufficiently high tensile strength, and the tissue to be sutured. absorbable sutures are hydrolyzed in tissues. however, little is known about the influence of infection  on the hydrolysis and decrease in the tensile strength. methods: four kinds of sutures, i.e., non-absorbable multifilament silk, non-absorbable monofilament polypropylene (prolene((r))), absorbable multifilament polyglactin 910 (vicryl((r))), and absorbable monofilament polydioxanone (pds((r))) were implanted in the back of rats. a suspension of escherichia coli + bacteroides fragilis or saline was injected subcutaneously into the contaminated and clean condition groups, respectively. the sutures were removed 1, 2, 4 or 8 weeks after the implantation. results: there was significantly more severe inflammation macroscopically for the silk sutures under the contaminated conditions (p = 0.03), however, no significant differences were observed among the other three sutures. all 4 kinds of sutures showed a reduction of the tensile strength over time. there were no significant differences in the magnitude of reduction between both the clean and contaminated conditions for any of the sutures. conclusions: the reduction of the tensile strength with time did not differ significantly between sutures exposed to contaminated and clean conditions, even for the absorbable sutures.

TI  == conservative management of ventriculoperitoneal shunts in the setting of abdominal and pelvic infections.
AB  == object: the optimal management of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt in the setting of  acute, non-shunt related abdominal and pelvic infections is unknown. in the literature, distal shunt catheter reimplantation with or without a variable period of externalization has been recommended to prevent ascending ventriculitis. while this strategy is effective, there is little to almost no published data suggesting that it is necessary in all cases. furthermore, it is not clear that shunt externalization to an external drainage bag during the treatment of non-shunt related peritonitis is any less likely to lead to ventriculitis than leaving the catheter in place. in the authors' experience, shunt externalization or revision during an episode of acute, non-shunt related peritonitis is unnecessary to prevent ventriculitis or chronic peritonitis. methods: in the present case series, the authors report on 7 patients whose shunts were left in the abdomen while they were treated for acute peritonitis. the patients were followed clinically for up to 21 months after the diagnosis to  assess for evidence of recurrent abdominal infections, shunt infections, or shunt failure. results: in a follow-up period ranging from 13 to 22 months, no patient  developed ventriculitis, required a shunt revision, or was unable to clear the peritoneal infection. conclusions: the results of this small series suggest that  leaving the distal end of a shunt catheter in place in a patient with acute peritonitis is a reasonably safe choice in specific patients, provided the source of infection is aggressively treated with systemic antibiotics and local debridement when necessary.

TI  == intestinal bacterial translocation in rats with cirrhosis is related to compromised paneth cell antimicrobial host defense.
AB  == liver cirrhosis is associated with bacterial translocation (bt) and endotoxemia.  most translocating bacteria belong to the common intestinal microbiota, suggesting a breakdown of intestinal barrier function. we hypothesized that diminished mucosal antimicrobial host defense could predispose to bt. two rodent  models of portal hypertension with increased bt were used, ccl(4)-induced ascitic cirrhosis and 2-day portal vein-ligated (pvl) animals. bt was assessed by standard microbiological techniques on mesenteric lymph nodes. total rna was isolated systematically throughout the intestinal tract, and expression of paneth cell alpha-cryptdins and beta-defensins was determined by real-time quantitative  polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). to determine functional consequences, mucosal antimicrobial activity was assessed with a fluorescence-activated cell sorting assay. bt was detectable in 40% of rats with cirrhosis. compared with the group without bt, these animals exhibited diminished intestinal paneth cell alpha-cryptdin 5 and 7 expression. in contrast, pvl was associated with bt in all animals but did not affect antimicrobial peptides. the decrease in paneth cell antimicrobials was most pronounced in the ileum and the coecum. other antimicrobials showed no changes or even an induction in the case of bt at different sites. antimicrobial activity toward different commensal strains was reduced, especially in the distal ileum and the cecum in experimental cirrhosis with bt (excluding pvl). conclusion: compromised paneth cell antimicrobial host defense seems to predispose to bt in experimental cirrhosis. understanding this liver-gut axis including the underlying mechanisms could help us to find new treatment avenues.

TI  == properties of boage2, a second n-acetyl-d-glucosamine 2-epimerase from bacteroides ovatus atcc 8483.
AB  == n-acyl-d-glucosamine 2-epimerase (age) catalyzes the reversible epimerization between n-acetyl-d-mannosamine (mannac) and n-acetyl-d-glucosamine (glcnac). bacteroides ovatus atcc 8483 shows 3 putative genes for age activity (bacova_00274, bacova_01795 and bacova_01816). the bacova_00274 gene encodes an age (boage1) with strong similarity to the age previously characterized in bacteroides fragilis. interestingly, the bacova_01816 gene (boage2) shares 57% identity with anabaena sp. ch1 age, but has an extra 27-amino acid tag sequence in the n-terminal. when cloned and expressed in escherichia coli rosetta (de3)plys, bacova_01816 was able to convert mannac into glcnac and vice versa. it was stable over a broad range of phs and its activity was enhanced by atp (20 mum). the incubation with atp stabilized its structure, raising its melting temperature by about 8 degrees c. in addition, the catalytic efficiency for mannac synthesis was higher than that for glcnac synthesis. these characteristics make boage2 a promising biocatalyst for sialic acid production using cheap glcnac as starting material. boage2 could be considered a renin-binding protein and its  interaction with renin was studied for the first time in a prokaryotic age. surprisingly, renin activated boage2, an effect which is contrary to that described for mammalian age and unrelated with the unique n-terminal tag, since a mutant without this tag was also activated by renin. when boage2 sequence was compared with other related (real and putative) age described in the databases, it was seen that age enzymes can be divided in 3 different groups. the relationship between these groups is also discussed.

TI  == [microbiology of surgical site infections in abdominal tract surgery patients].
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the microbiology of surgical infections after abdominal surgery can be of use when prescribing effective empirical antibiotic treatments. method: analysis of surgical infections after abdominal surgery in patients enrolled in the prevalence of infections in spanish hospitals (epine) corresponding to the years 1999-2006. results: during the period of the study, 2,280 patients who were subjected to upper or lower abdominal tract surgery were  diagnosed with an infection at the surgical site (ssi). eight hundred and eighty  three patients (37%) had an operation of the upper abdominal tract (gastric, hepatobiliary, and pancreatic surgery) and 1,447 patients (63%) lower abdominal tract surgery (appendectomy and colon surgery). a total of 2,617 bacterial species were isolated in the 2,280 patients included in the analysis. the most frequent microorganisms isolated were, escherichia coli (28%), enterococcus spp.  (15%), streptococcus spp. (8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%), and staphylococcus aureus (5%, resistant to methicillin 2%). in the surgical infections after upper  abdominal tract procedures, there were a higher proportion of isolations of staphylococci, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., acinetobacter spp. and candida albicans and less escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis and clostridium  spp. conclusion: the microbiology of ssi produced after upper abdominal tract surgery did not show any significant differences compared to those of the lower tract. however, more cases of ssi were detected due to staphylococci, klebsiella  pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., acinetobacter spp. and candida albicans and less caused by escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis and clostridium spp.

TI  == temporal variations in early gut microbial colonization are associated with allergen-specific immunoglobulin e but not atopic eczema at 2 years of age.
AB  == background: intestinal microbiota undergoes substantial development during the first 2 years of life, important for intestinal immunologic development and maturation influencing systemic immune responses. objective: we aimed to investigate, using a prospective study design, whether allergen-specific ige (sige) and atopic eczema are associated with variations in gut microbial colonization patterns in an unselected population during the first 2 years of life. methods: faeces from 94 infants were repeatedly sampled from 10 days, 4 months, 1 and 2 years postnatal and analysed for 12 different bacterial species by quantitative real-time pcr. venous blood samples from the infants were collected at 2 years of age and were analysed for sige for 12 specific allergens. the temporal gut colonization patterns for 42 sige-positive (sige>/=0.35 ku/l) and 52 sige-negative children (sige<0.1 ku/l) were then compared. the association between colonization pattern and phenotype as atopic eczema according to uk working party (ukwp) criteria were also described. results: subjects with atopic  sensitization had lower levels of escherichia coli at 4 months and 1 year, higher levels of bifidobacterium longum at 1 year and lower levels of bacteroides fragilis at 2 years. for e. coli and b. longum, the differences were only transient and had disappeared by 2 years of age. for other species, there were no differences in colonization patterns, and we found no association between colonization pattern and atopic eczema. conclusions and clinical relevance: we found temporal and transient variations in gut microbial colonization patterns associated with differences in sige sensitization at 2 years of age. a full understanding of the principles and mechanisms that underlie intestinal microbial colonization and diversity and host-microbiota relationships will be pivotal for  the development of therapeutic approaches that manipulate the intestinal microbiota to maintain human health.

TI  == comparative effects of the immediate and the extended release formulations of ciprofloxacin on normal human intestinal microflora.
AB  == ciprofloxacin is a well-known fluoroquinolone, active in vitro against most gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the ecological effects of an orally administered extended-release formulation of ciprofloxacin in comparison with an immediate-release formulation  of ciprofloxacin on the normal human intestinal microflora. thirty-six healthy female subjects were included in the study. the extended-release formulation of ciprofloxacin was given as 500 mg once daily and the immediate-release formulation as 250 mg twice daily. the treatment period was 3 days. the microbiological investigation was blinded with respect to treatment. mean fecal concentration in the volunteers receiving the extended-release formulation ciprofloxacin was 453 mg/kg and in the immediate-release formulation ciprofloxacin volunteers, the mean fecal concentration was 392 mg/kg. the numbers of escherichia coli were significantly suppressed while the enterococci decreased moderately in both treatment groups. no toxigenic clostridium difficile strains were found. no major differences were observed between the two studied formulations on the normal human intestinal microflora.

TI  == the human commensal bacteroides fragilis binds intestinal mucin.
AB  == the mammalian gastrointestinal tract harbors a vast microbial ecosystem, known as the microbiota, which benefits host biology. bacteroides fragilis is an important anaerobic gut commensal of humans that prevents and cures intestinal inflammation. we wished to elucidate aspects of gut colonization employed by b. fragilis. fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on colonic tissue sections from b. fragilis and escherichia coli dual-colonized gnotobiotic mice. epifluorescence imaging reveals that both e. coli and b. fragilis are found in the lumen of the colon, but only b. fragilis is found in the mucosal layer. this  observation suggests that physical association with intestinal mucus could be a possible mechanism of gut colonization by b. fragilis. we investigated this potential interaction using an in vitro mucus binding assay and show here that b. fragilis binds to murine colonic mucus. we further demonstrate that b. fragilis specifically and quantitatively binds to highly purified mucins (the major constituent in intestinal mucus) using flow cytometry analysis of fluorescently labeled purified murine and porcine mucins. these results suggest that interactions between b. fragilis and intestinal mucin may play a critical role during host-bacterial symbiosis.

TI  == bacteremia does not affect cellular uptake of ultrafine particles in the lungs of rats.
AB  == to assess the effects of intra-abdominal bacteremia on lung cellular function in  vivo, we used electron microscopy to quantify the uptake of 6 nm diameter, albumin-coated colloidal gold particles (overall diam. 20.8 nm) by cells in the lungs of rats made septic by the introduction of live bacteria (e.coli and b. fragilis) into their abdomens. gold particles were instilled into the trachea 24  hr after bacteremia induction, and lungs were harvested and prepared for electron microscopy 24 hr later. because bacteremia produces an increase in metabolism, we hypothesized that this might be associated with increased cellular uptake of these particles and also with increased permeability of the alveolar epithelial barrier to them, as bacteremia is also associated with lung injury. we quantified particle uptake by counting particle densities (particles/mum(2)) within type i and type ii epithelial cells, capillary endothelial cells, erythrocytes and neutrophils in the lungs of five septic rats and five sham-sepsis controls. we also counted particle densities within organelles of these cells (nuclei, mitochondria, type ii cell lamellar bodies) and within the alveolar interstitium. we found particles to be present within all of these compartments, although we found no differences in particle densities between bacteremic rats and sham-sepsis controls. our results suggest that these 6 nm particles were able to  freely cross cell and organelle membranes, and further suggest that this ability  was not altered by bacteremia.

AB  == to unravel the profile of intestinal microecological parameters in chinese patients with asymptomatic carriage of hepatitis b virus (hbv), chronic hepatitis b, decompensated hbv cirrhosis, and health controls and to establish their correlation with liver disease progression, we performed quantitative pcr and immunological techniques to investigate fecal parameters, including population of fecal predominant bacteria and the abundance of some virulence genes derived from escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and clostridium perfringens in fecal crude dna and some immunological parameters in extracts of all fecal samples. data analysis indicated that 16s rrna gene copy numbers for faecalibacterium prausnitzii, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacteria, and lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella) showed marked variation in the intestine of hbv cirrhotic patients. the bifidobacteria/enterobacteriaceae (b/e) ratio, which may  indicate microbial colonization resistance of the bowel, was decreased significantly in turn from 1.15 +/- 0.11 in healthy controls, 0.99 +/- 0.09 in asymptomatic carriers, and 0.76 +/- 0.08 in patients with chronic hepatitis b to  0.64 +/- 0.09 in patients with decompensated hbv cirrhosis (for all, p < 0.01). this suggests that b/e ratio is useful for following the level of intestinal microecological disorder in the course of liver disease progression. the data for virulence gene abundance suggested increased diversity of virulence factors during liver disease progression. fecal secretory iga and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in decompensated hbv cirrhotic patients were present at higher levels than in other groups, which indicates that a complicated autoregulatory system tries to achieve a new intestinal microecological balance.

TI  == bpib05, a novel metagenome-derived hydrolase acting on n-acylhomoserine lactones.
AB  == the n-acyl-homoserine lactones (n-ahls) play an important role in bacterial cell-cell signaling. up to date, however, only a few different experimentally proven classes of n-ahl ring-cleaving enzymes are known. here we report on the isolation and biochemical characterization of a novel hydrolase derived from the  soil metagenome and acting on n-ahls. the identified protein designated bpib05 is weakly similar to hypothetical proteins from bacteroides fragilis, the draft genomes of two burkholderia species as well as a marine metagenomic orf but is otherwise not similar to any known protein. bpib05 was overexpressed in escherichia coli as a 10x his-tagged fusion protein. the recombinant protein revealed a molecular weight of about 70kda and was tested for its quorum quenching (qq) activities using a lacz-bioassay. additional hplc-ms analyses confirmed the lactonolytic activity of the purified protein in the presence of ca(2)(+). further tests suggested that bpib05 strongly reduces motility in pseudomonas aeruginosa, pyocyanin synthesis and biofilm formation in this microbe. because bpib05 is not distantly related to any of the currently known hydrolases it forms probably a novel group within the growing number of proteins  acting on n-ahls.

AB  == background: bacterial endotoxin is known to act as a potent trigger of disseminated coagulation and septic shock. during clinical antibiotic treatment,  endotoxin may be released from gram-negative bacteria. it is known that antibiotic classes differ in their ability to induce endotoxin release. aim: it was the aim of this study to test the endotoxin-liberating potential of different antibiotics with activity against escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis. methods: in vitro test models were used to evaluate the endotoxin-liberating potential of moxifloxacin, a 4th-generation quinolone with antianaerobic activity. bacteria were exposed to moxifloxacin at 2x, 10x and 50x the minimal inhibitory concentration. endotoxin release was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent and limulus amoebocyte lysate assays. comparator drugs were ceftazidime and imipenem, i.e. antibiotics with known high and low endotoxin-liberating potential, respectively. as a parameter for biological responses to endotoxin, the release of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis  factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta) from monocytes/macrophages was quantified with bioassays. results: in all test systems, release of endotoxin during exposure of  bacteria to moxifloxacin was minimal or low and comparable with that of imipenem. conclusions: moxifloxacin has a low potential to cause endotoxin-mediated detrimental clinical effects. concerning its endotoxin-releasing properties, moxifloxacin appears to be a choice equivalent to the carbapenems.

AB  == background: a custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  rna probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and crohn's disease (cd) patients. methods: oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "goarray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16s rrna sequences. fecal 16s rdna  from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six cd patients were used as  template to generate fluorescently labeled crna that was hybridized to the microarray. differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with species-specific primer sets. results: the microarray analyses showed that eubacterium rectale, bacteroides fragilis group, b. vulgatus, ruminococcus albus, r. callidus, r. bromii, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the cd patients, while enterococcus sp., clostridium difficile, escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, and listeria sp. were more abundant in the cd group. conclusions: the microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. in addition, the microarray showed that enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the cd patients. this microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == two-component polyethylene glycol surgical sealant influence on intraperitoneal infection in a refined rodent model.
AB  == objective: this study determined the influence of a 2-component polyethylene glycol surgical sealant (coseal) as an adhesion prevention device on sepsis-related mortality and/or systemic bacterial translocation to the spleen. study design: a bacterial inoculum and telemetry probe were implanted in 50 treated and 49 untreated rats. telemetry probes monitored core-body temperature to determine time of death. spleens were collected on day 3 for quantitative bacteriology of escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis. results: median survival time and mortality of treated rats (37.0 hours, 54.0%) were noninferior  to untreated rats (47.5 hours, 55.1%). median e coli titers in treated rats (2.24 log colony forming units/spleen) were significantly less than untreated rats (4.32 log colony forming units/spleen). b fragilis titers were not different. conclusion: this study demonstrates intraperitoneal administration of a 2-component polyethylene glycol surgical sealant as an adhesion prevention device does not alter time to death or sepsis-related mortality and/or systemic bacterial translocation to the spleen.

TI  == travelers' diarrhea.
AB  == purpose of review: travelers' diarrhea affects 20-60% of travelers to low-income  regions of the world. much of the evidence for the clinical description and management of travelers' diarrhea was generated years ago, however, there is new  information on geographic and host risk, etiology, and prevention strategies. recent findings: travel to south asia, followed by sub-saharan africa and south america, carries the highest risk for diarrheal syndromes in returned travelers.  women are more susceptible to travel-related diarrhea than men. host genetic studies have demonstrated that single nucleotide polymorphisms in the lactoferrin, osteoprotegerin, and il-10 genes are associated with small but increased risks for diarrhea and enteric pathogens. enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis is likely to be a new agent identified as causing travelers' diarrhea, and heat-stable toxin-producing escherichia coli appears to be more common than heat-labile toxin e. coli. overall levels of sanitation at the travel destination, including individual eating establishments, are strong predictors for acquisition of travelers' diarrhea. a new transdermal lt vaccine shows promise in modifying the severity of travelers' diarrhea. it remains uncertain whether prophylaxis or prompt self-treatment of travelers' diarrhea will prevent  late-onset irritable bowel syndrome. for self-treatment, azithromycin is the drug of choice in travelers to areas where there is a high risk of fluoroquinolone-resistant campylobacter spp., such as south and southeast asia and possibly north africa, central and south america. summary: there is increased understanding of the determinants of travelers' diarrhea. despite this travelers' diarrhea remains one of the most common illnesses in travelers. continued focus on intervention strategies may ultimately lead to decreased incidence.

TI  == dietary glycosaminoglycans interfere in bacterial adhesion and gliadin-induced pro-inflammatory response in intestinal epithelial (caco-2) cells.
AB  == dietary components may have an important role in maintaining a balanced gut microbiota composition. celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy caused by gliadins, and has been associated with a reduced proportion of bifidobacterium in gut microbiota. this study evaluates the influence of glycosaminoglycans (gags) on bacterial adhesion and their contribution in the gliadins-induced inflammatory response. the adhesion of potential probiotic (bifidobacterium longum cect 7347 and bifidobacterium bifidum cect 7365), commensal (escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis) and pathogenic (salmonella enterica cect 443 and listeria monocytogenes cect 935) bacteria to mucin and caco-2 cell cultures was determined. gliadins were subjected to in vitro digestion (pepsin/pancreatin-bile), with/out gags, and the presence or not of cell suspensions of b. longum (10(8) cfu/ml). b. longum, e. coli, and l. monocytogenes, markedly interact with the high-sulphur-containing fraction of gags. the gags reduced the gliadins-mediated production of interleukin-1beta, but not tumour necrosis factor-alpha. the results suggest that gags may ameliorate gliadin-induced inflammatory response, though they also slightly interfere with the action of b. longum.

TI  == crystallization of recombinant bacteroides fragilis glutamine synthetase (glnn) isolated using a novel and rapid purification protocol.
AB  == glutamine synthetase enzymes (gss) are large oligomeric enzymes that play a critical role in nitrogen metabolism in all forms of life. to date, no crystal structures exist for the family of large ( approximately 1 mda) type iii gs enzymes, which only share 9% sequence identity with the well characterized gsi and gsii enzymes. here we present a novel protocol for the isolation of untagged  bacteroides fragilis glnn expressed in an auxotrophic escherichia coli strain. the rapid and scalable two-step protocol utilized differential precipitation by divalent cations followed by affinity chromatography to produce suitable quantities of homogenous material for structural characterization. subsequent optimizations to the sample stability and solubility led to the discovery of conditions for the production of the first diffraction quality crystals of a type iii gs enzyme.

TI  == [identification of anaerobic bacteria isolated from various clinical specimens and determination of antibiotic susceptibilities].
AB  == routine isolation, identification and susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria present several difficulties leading to defects in the determination of  local susceptibility patterns which will guide empirical treatment protocols. this study was carried out to identify the anaerobic bacteria isolated from various clinical materials obtained from the suspected patients with anaerobic infection and to determine the antibiotic susceptibilities against several antibiotics. one hundred clinical specimens (36 blood, 31 abscess, 12 peritoneal  fluid, 7 joint fluid, 7 pleural fluid, 3 biopsies, 3 cerebrospinal fluids and 1 surgical wound) that were examined in our laboratory during march 20-october 30 2007, were included in the study. the specimens were collected and transported under anaerobic conditions and inoculated to conventional aerobic media and to wilkins chalgren agar, schaedler agar and chopped-meat broth for anaerobic isolation. isolated anaerobic bacteria were identified with api 20a panels (bio-merieux, france) via conventional methods and by the help of an-ident discs  (oxoid, england). penicillin g, clindamycin, cefoxitin, metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem susceptibility tests were performed with e-  test method. twenty two anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 14 clinical specimens; 7 of the specimens yielding the growth of more than one type of anaerobic bacteria and 8 specimens yielding both anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial (4 escherichia coli and 4 enterococcus spp.) growth. anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 89 abscess and in 6 peritoneal fluid specimens. the distribution of the anaerobic bacteria identified among these specimens were as follows: bacteroides fragilis (n = 6), bacteroides spp. other than b.fragilis (n = 4), clostridium spp. (n = 2), fusobacterium necrophorum/nucleatum (n = 1), prevotella intermedia/disiens (n = 1), peptococcus niger (n = 2), peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 5), and lactobacillus acidophilus/lenseii (n = 1). beta-lactamase activity was detected only in 2 of the 6 b. fragilis isolates. all of the isolates were susceptible to imipenem and  piperacillin/tazobactam. the highest rate of resistance was detected against penicillin g (9/22; 41%). while anaerobic gram-positive cocci (n = 7) were found  to be sensitive to all antibiotics, the rate of resistance among anaerobic gram-negative bacilli were 75% (9/12) to penicillin, 33.3% (4/12) to clindamycin, 8.3% (1/12) to metronidazole. among anaerobic gram-positive bacilli (n = 3), 2 were resistant to metronidazole, one to clindamycin and one to cefoxitin. the results of this first anaerobic antimicrobial susceptibility testing study performed at konya area in turkey revealed that penicillin was not appropriate in empirical treatment of anaerobic infections, clindamycin susceptibility should be tested before use, metronidazole and cefoxitin could be used in empirical treatment and imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam should be saved for the treatment of complicated infections and infections caused by resistant bacteria.

TI  == binding and degradation of fibrinogen by bacteroides fragilis and characterization of a 54 kda fibrinogen-binding protein.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis is a bacterium that resides in the normal human gastro-intestinal tract; however, it is also the most commonly isolated gram-negative obligate anaerobe from human clinical infections, such as intra-abdominal abscesses, and the most common cause of anaerobic bacteraemia. abscess formation is important in bacterial containment, limiting dissemination of infection and bacteraemia. in this study, we investigated b. fragilis binding  and degradation of human fibrinogen, the major structural component involved in fibrin abscess formation. we have shown that b. fragilis nctc9343 binds human fibrinogen. a putative bacteroides fragilis fibrinogen-binding protein, designated bf-fbp, identified in the genome sequence of nctc9343, was cloned and  expressed in escherichia coli. the purified recombinant bf-fbp bound primarily to the human fibrinogen bbeta-chain. in addition, we have identified fibrinogenolytic activity in b. fragilis exponential phase culture supernatants,  associated with fibrinogenolytic metalloproteases in nctc9343 and 638r, and cysteine protease activity in ych46. all nine clinical isolates of b. fragilis examined degraded human fibrinogen; with eight isolates, initial aalpha-chain degradation was observed, with varying bbeta-chain and gamma-chain degradation. with one blood culture isolate, bbeta-chain and gamma-chain degradation occurred  first, followed by subsequent aalpha-chain degradation. our data raise the possibility that the fibrinogen-binding protein of b. fragilis, along with a variety of fibrinogenolytic proteases, may be an important virulence factor that  facilitates dissemination of infection via reduction or inhibition of abscess formation.

TI  == peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma activation is required for maintenance of innate antimicrobial immunity in the colon.
AB  == crohn's disease (cd), a major form of human inflammatory bowel disease, is characterized by primary immunodeficiencies. the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (ppargamma) is essential for intestinal homeostasis in response to both dietary- and microbiota-derived signals. its role in host defense remains unknown, however. we show that ppargamma functions as an  antimicrobial factor by maintaining constitutive epithelial expression of a subset of beta-defensin in the colon, which includes mdefb10 in mice and defb1 in humans. colonic mucosa of ppargamma mutant animals shows defective killing of several major components of the intestinal microbiota, including candida albicans, bacteroides fragilis, enterococcus faecalis, and escherichia coli. neutralization of the colicidal activity using an anti-mdefb10 blocking antibody  was effective in a ppargamma-dependent manner. a functional promoter variant that is required for defb1 expression confers strong protection against crohn's colitis and ileocolitis (odds ratio, 0.559; p = 0.018). consistently, colonic involvement in cd is specifically linked to reduced expression of defb1 independent of inflammation. these findings support the development of ppargamma-targeting therapeutic and/or nutritional approaches to prevent colonic  inflammation by restoring antimicrobial immunity in cd.

TI  == consumption of human milk oligosaccharides by gut-related microbes.
AB  == human milk contains large amounts of complex oligosaccharides that putatively modulate the intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants by acting as decoy binding sites for pathogens and as prebiotics for enrichment of beneficial bacteria. several bifidobacterial species have been shown to grow well on human milk oligosaccharides. however, few data exist on other bacterial species. this work examined 16 bacterial strains belonging to 10 different genera for growth on human milk oligosaccharides. for this propose, a chemically defined medium, zmb1, was used, which allows vigorous growth of a number of gut-related microorganisms  in a fashion similar to complex media. interestingly, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, bacteroides fragilis , and bacteroides vulgatus strains were able to metabolize milk oligosaccharides with high efficiency, whereas enterococcus , streptococcus , veillonella , eubacterium , clostridium , and escherichia coli strains grew less well or not at all. mass spectrometry-based glycoprofiling of the oligosaccharide consumption behavior revealed a specific preference for fucosylated oligosaccharides by bi. longum subsp. infantis and ba. vulgatus. this work expands the current knowledge of human milk oligosaccharide consumption by gut microbes, revealing bacteroides as avid consumers of this substrate. these results provide insight on how human milk oligosaccharides shape the infant intestinal microbiota.

TI  == a processive riboantiterminator seeks a switch to make biofilms.
AB  == since the discovery of the first signal-sensing rna structure by grundy and henkin in 1993, the list of cis-acting riboregulators has grown dramatically. riboswitches fold into elaborate structures and respond to binding of small metabolites by altering the folding pattern of the surrounding transcript, thereby altering the gene expression programme. riboswitches that use short-range mechanisms to control transcription attenuation and translation initiation and mediate mrna cleavage have been characterized in many gram-positive bacteria. their action typically relies on alternative rna structures that are differentially stabilized by the ligand binding. in this issue of molecular microbiology, irnov and winkler describe a novel bacillus subtilis riboregulator  called ear that shares structural complexity with riboswitches but possesses a unique mechanism of action. ear increases expression of exopolysaccharide genes and biofilm formation, and appears to act as a processive, long-range antiterminator, the first such example outside of escherichia coli. while it is unclear whether ear senses a biofilm-inducing signal, the results suggest that its action depends on yet unidentified auxiliary factors. interestingly, efficient capsule biogenesis in e. coli and bacteroides fragilis also depends on  processive antiterminators but utilizes the protein-based mechanisms instead.

TI  == efficient electrotransformation of bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == this study describes refined electroporation parameters for efficient transformation of bacteroides fragilis by plasmids prepared from laboratory strains of escherichia coli. development of the method used included determination of the optimal growth conditions for competent cell preparation, selectable antimicrobial resistance markers, electric field strength, and postpulse incubation time. of the four e. coli-bacteroides shuttle plasmids tested (pval-1, pval-2, pnly1, and plyl05), plyl05 containing the cefoxitin resistance marker was found to be the most suitable for b. fragilis transformation, and it generated 2- to 900-fold more transformants (about 10(4) transformants per microg plyl05 dna) than the other plasmids. for the 72-h cultivation period tested, b. fragilis cells harvested at 48 h yielded the highest numbers of transformants. the transformation efficiency of plyl05 increased linearly with the electric field strength over a range from 5.0 to 12.5 kv/cm. at least 3 h of postpulse incubation was required to maximize the transformation efficiency. for deletion of b. fragilis genes by homologous recombination, competent cells grown to early exponential phase and 12 h of postpulse incubation were required for efficient integration of the plyl05-based  suicide vector into the target site. the expected integration was obtained in b.  fragilis strain nctc9343 only when a homologously prepared (i.e., in vivo methylated) suicide vector was used. spontaneous resolution of the diploid successfully deleted the expected genetic region. our simple and efficient plasmid transfer method enabled disruption of a b. fragilis gene using in vivo-methylated targeted vectors. our optimized electroporation parameters provide a useful tool for genetic manipulation of bacteroides species.

TI  == effect of apple intake on fecal microbiota and metabolites in humans.
AB  == the effects of apple intake on the fecal flora, water content, ph, and metabolic  activities in eight healthy volunteers and the utilization of apple pectin in vitro were investigated. although several isolates of bifidobacterium, lactobacillus, enterococcus, and the bacteroides fragilis group utilized apple pectin, most isolates of escherichia coli, collinsela aerofaciense, eubacterium limosum, and clostridium perfringens could not. when fecal samples from healthy adults were incubated in liquid broth with apple pectin present or absent, the numbers of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in the former were higher than those in the later. after the intake of apples (2 apples a day for 2 weeks) by eight healthy adult humans, the number of bifidobacteria in feces increased (p < 0.05 on day 7 and p < 0.01 on day 14 of the intake period), and the numbers of lactobacillus and streptococcus including enterococcus tended to increase. however, lecithinase-positive clostridia, including c. perfringens, decreased (p  < 0.05), and enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas tended to decrease. moreover, the concentrations of fecal acetic acid tended to increase on apple intake. the fecal ammonia concentration showed a tendency to reduce and fecal sulfide decreased (p  < 0.05) on apple intake. these findings indicate that apple consumption is related to an improved intestinal environment, and apple pectin is one of the effective apple components improving the fecal environment.

TI  == in vivo oxidative protein folding can be facilitated by oxidation-reduction cycling.
AB  == current dogma dictates that bacterial proteins with misoxidized disulfide bonds are shuffled into correctly oxidized states by dsbc. there are two proposed mechanisms for dsbc activity. the first involves a dsbc-only model of substrate disulfide rearrangement. the second invokes cycles of reduction and oxidation of  substrate disulfide bonds by dsbc and dsba respectively. here, we addressed whether the second mechanism is important in vivo by identifying whether a periplasmic reductase could complement dsbc. we screened for naturally occurring  periplasmic reductases in bacteroides fragilis, a bacterium chosen because we predicted it encodes reductases and has a reducing periplasm. we found that the b. fragilis periplasmic protein trxp has a thioredoxin fold with an extended n-terminal region; that it is a very active reductase but a poor isomerase; and that it fully complements dsbc. these results provide direct in vivo evidence that correctly folded protein is achievable via cycles of oxidation and reduction.

AB  == background and purpose: bacteroides fragilis is a virulent anaerobic pathogen, resulting in considerable mortality. this study was conducted to investigate the  clinical characteristics, significance of polymicrobial bacteremia, and treatment outcomes of b. fragilis bacteremia. methods: this retrospective analysis enrolled 199 adult patients with b. fragilis bacteremia, who were admitted to hospital between january 2004 and may 2007. chi-squared and fisher's exact tests were used for comparison. a p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. results: 142 patients with b. fragilis bacteremia (71.4%) had at least 1 underlying disease. malignancy was the commonest comorbidity (n = 62; 31.2%). intra-abdominal infection accounted for 49.3% of the infection sources. seventy seven patients (38.7%) had polymicrobial bacteremia and escherichia coli was the  most common concurrent isolate (n = 24). there was no significant difference in septic shock incidence and clinical outcome between the monomicrobial and polymicrobial groups. the overall 30-day crude mortality rate was 30.7%. inappropriate early antimicrobial therapy did not affect outcome, but a higher mortality rate was noted for patients who never received appropriate antimicrobial therapy (55.2% vs 26.5%; p = 0.002). independent risk factors for mortality were age 65 years and older (p = 0.010), malignancy (p = 0.001), shock  (p < 0.001), thrombocytopenia (p = 0.026), and lack of surgical intervention (p = 0.035). conclusions: b. fragilis bacteremia causes a high mortality rate, especially for elderly people and patients with cancer. clinicians should be alert to the infectious focus, and appropriate surgical intervention may be necessary to improve outcomes.

TI  == spatiotemporal progression of localized bacterial peritonitis before and after open abdomen lavage monitored by in vivo bioluminescent imaging.
AB  == background: bacterial peritonitis is a life-threatening abdominal infection associated with high morbidity and mortality. the rat is a popular animal model for studying peritonitis and its treatment, but longitudinal monitoring of the progression of peritonitis in live animals has been impossible until now and thus required a large number of animals. our objective was to develop a noninvasive in vivo imaging technique to monitor the spatiotemporal spread of bacterial peritonitis. methods: peritonitis was induced in 8 immunocompetent male wistar rats by placing fibrin clots containing 5x10(8) cells of both bacteroides fragilis (american type tissue culture [atcc)] 25,285 and bioluminescent escherichia coli xen14. after 1 or 2 days, infected clots were removed and open abdomen lavage was performed. in vivo bioluminescent imaging was used to monitor  the spread of peritonitis. results: bioluminescent in vivo imaging showed an increase in the area of spread, and the number of e. coli tripled into the rat's  abdominal cavity on day 1 after clot insertion; however, on day 2, encapsulation  of the clot confined bacterial spread. bioluminescent e. coli respread over the peritoneal cavity after lavage; within 10 days, however, in vivo imaging showed a decrease of 3-4 orders of magnitude in bacterial load. conclusion: bioluminescent in vivo imaging can be effectively used to monitor the spatiotemporal behavior of the peritonitis during 3 different stages of the disease process: initiation, treatment, and follow-up. imaging allows researchers to repeatedly image the same animal, thereby reducing variability and providing greater confidence in determining treatment efficacies for therapeutic interventions using a small number of animals.

TI  == intra-abdominal infections: etiology, epidemiology, microbiological diagnosis and antibiotic resistance.
AB  == intra-abdominal infections (iais) are commonly encountered in clinical practice.  the etiology of these infections, often polymicrobial in nature, can be variable  and usually includes organisms derived from the gut microbiota. in community-acquired iais enterobacteria predominate (mostly escherichia coli) in combination with anaerobes (mostly bacteroides fragilis). in nosocomial iais, which can complicate abdominal surgery, other pathogens can also play a role, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp. and candida spp. diagnostic microbiology of iais is complex and plays a relevant role, especially in some situations (e.g. presence of foreign bodies, potential presence of resistant or uncommon pathogens, nosocomial infections in subjects with risk factors). antibiotic resistance issues are currently encountered in most pathogenic species causing iais. resistance affects all major classes of antimicrobial agents, often involving multiple classes and resulting in complex resistance phenotypes for which only a very limited number of drugs remain active.

TI  == identification of the site-specific dna invertase responsible for the phase variation of susc/susd family outer membrane proteins in bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == the human gut microbe bacteroides fragilis can alter the expression of its surface molecules, such as capsular polysaccharides and susc/susd family outer membrane proteins, through reversible dna inversions. we demonstrate here that dna inversions at 12 invertible regions, including three gene clusters for susc/susd family proteins, were controlled by a single tyrosine site-specific recombinase (tsr0667) encoded by bf0667 in b. fragilis strain ych46. genetic disruption of bf0667 diminished or attenuated shufflon-type dna inversions at all three susc/susd genes clusters, as well as simple dna inversions at nine other loci, most of which colocalized with susc/susd family genes. the inverted repeat  sequences found within the tsr0667-regulated invertible regions shared the consensus motif sequence agtyyyn(4)gdact. tsr0667 specifically mediated the dna inversions of 10 of the 12 regions, even under an escherichia coli background when the invertible regions were exposed to bf0667 in e. coli cells. thus, tsr0667 is an additional globally acting dna invertase in b. fragilis, which probably involves the selective expression of susc/susd family outer membrane proteins.

TI  == establishment of a continuous culture system for entamoeba muris and analysis of  the small subunit rrna gene.
AB  == we established a culture system for entamoeba muris (mg-em-01 strain isolated from a mongolian gerbil) using a modified balamuth's egg yolk infusion medium supplemented with 4% adult bovine serum and bacteroides fragilis cocultured with  escherichia coli. further, encystation was observed in the culture medium. the morphological characteristics of e. muris are similar to those of entamoeba coli  (e. coli); moreover, the malic isoenzyme electrophoretic band, which shows species-specific electrophoretic mobility, of e. muris had almost the same mobility as that observed with the malic isoenzyme electrophorectic band of e. coli (uzg-ec-01 strain isolated from a gorilla). we determined the small subunit  rrna (ssu-rrna) gene sequence of the mg-em-01 strain, and this sequence was observed to show 82.7% homology with that of the uzg-ec-01 strain. further, the resultant phylogenetic tree for molecular taxonomy based on the ssu-rrna genes of the 21 strains of the intestinal parasitic amoeba species indicated that the mg-em-01 strain was most closely related to e. coli.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of tigecycline and nine other antibiotics against gram-negative bacterial isolates, including esbl-producing strains.
AB  == the enterobacteriaceae, especially escherichia coli and klebsiella spp., as well  as acinetobacter spp., are important agents of nosocomial infections in hospitalized patients. a total of 460 gram-negative bacteria (gnb), were investigated for their susceptibility to tigecycline and 9 other antibiotics by the etest. esbl production was inferred from esbl etest phenotypes. all the gnb,  including the esbl-producers, were susceptible to tigecycline with mic(90 )ranges of 0.25 to 2 microg/ml. imipenem and meropenem were very active against esbl and  non-esbl producers; mean mic(90)s of 0.19 and 0.09 microg/ml and 0.05 microg/ml and 0.02 microg/ml, respectively. the mic(90)s of imipenem and meropenem for the  acinetobacter spp. were 16 and >32 microg/ml, respectively with resistance rates  of 64.3 and 66.1%. esbl production was detected in 62% and 82.1% of the e. coli and k. pneumoniae isolates, respectively. resistance to ciprofloxacin was higher  among the esbl-producing strains of e. coli and k. pneumoniae than the non-esbl producers. comparatively, tigecycline had excellent in vitro activities against esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae and demonstrated superior activity against acinetobacter spp. increasing esbl production and resistance to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin in enterobacteriaceae require careful selection of empirical therapy.  tigecycline holds promise as an alternative choice of therapy for infections caused by esbl-producing isolates and multi-drug resistant acinetobacter spp.

TI  == infections in patients with aplastic anemia.
AB  == infection is a major cause of death in patients with aplastic anemia (aa). there  are differences between the immunocompromised state of a patient with aa and the  patient who is neutropenic due to chemotherapy and this leads to a difference in  the infections that they incur. prolonged neutropenia is one of the largest risk  factors for the development of infections with the invasive mycoses and bacteria. recovery from neutropenia is directly related to survival, and supportive care plays a large role in protection while the patient is in a neutropenic state. the most common invasive mycoses include the aspergillus species, zygomycetes, candida spp., and fusarium spp. bacterial infections that are seen in patients with aa include gram-positive coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, enterococcus, staphylococus aureus, clostridium spp., micrococcus, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, and bacillus cereus. gram-negative infections including gram-negative bacilli, escherichia coli, salmonella, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumonia, aeromonas hydrophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio vulnificus. viral infections are much less common but include those that belong to the herpesviridae family, community-acquired respiratory viral infection, and the viral hepatitides a, b, and c. evidence of the parasite strongyloides stercoralis has also been documented. this review discusses the major invasive fungal infections, bacterial pathogens, parasites, and viral infections that are found in patients with aa who are treated with immunosuppressive therapy. the specific  immune impairment and current treatment parameters for each of these classes of infection will also be discussed.

TI  == bacteroides fragilis signals through toll-like receptor (tlr) 2 and not through tlr4.
AB  == although it is desirable to identify the interactions between endotoxin/lps and the innate immune mechanism, it is often not possible to isolate these interactions from other cell wall-related structures of protein or polysaccharide origin. there is no universally accepted method to extract different lpss from different bacteria, and their natural state will be influenced by their interactions with the associated molecules in the bacterial outer membrane. it is now believed that toll-like receptor (tlr) 4 is the main signal transducer of classical lps (i.e. escherichia coli lps), while tlr2 is used by certain non-classical lpss. there are contradictory reports as to whether bacteroides fragilis lps, a non-classical lps, signals primarily through tlr2 or tlr4. this study was designed to address this problem. different non-purified and purified b. fragilis lpss extracted by different methods together with different heat-killed, whole-cell populations of b. fragilis were used to elucidate the tlr specificity. all of these b. fragilis preparations showed a significant signalling specificity for tlr2 but not for tlr4. this indicates that changing the extraction methods, with or without applying a repurification procedure, and  varying the cell populations do not alter the tlr specificity of b. fragilis lps.

TI  == efficacy of sodium hypochlorite and peroxyacetic acid to reduce murine norovirus  1, b40-8, listeria monocytogenes, and escherichia coli o157:h7 on shredded iceberg lettuce and in residual wash water.
AB  == the efficiency of sodium hypochlorite (naocl) and peroxyacetic acid (paa) to reduce murine norovirus 1 (mnv-1), a surrogate for human norovirus, and bacteroides fragilis hsp40-infecting phage b40-8 on shredded iceberg lettuce was  investigated. the levels of removal of viruses mnv-1 and b40-8 were compared with the reductions observed for bacterial pathogens listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli o157:h7. two inoculation levels, one with a high organic load and the other containing a 10-fold lower number of pathogens and organic matter,  showed that the effectiveness of naocl was greatly influenced by the presence of  organic material, which was not observed for paa. moreover, the present study showed that 200 mg/liter naocl or 250 mg/liter paa is needed to obtain an additional reduction of 1 log (compared with tap water) of mnv-1 on shredded iceberg lettuce, whereas only 250 mg/liter paa achieved this for bacterial pathogens. none of the treatments resulted in a supplementary 1-log pfu/g reduction of b40-8 compared with tap water. b40-8 could therefore be useful as an indicator of decontamination processes of shredded iceberg lettuce based on naocl or paa. neither mnv-1, b40-8, nor bacterial pathogens could be detected in residual wash water after shredded iceberg lettuce was treated with naocl and paa, whereas considerable numbers of all these microorganisms were found in residual wash water consisting solely of tap water. this study illustrates the usefulness of paa and naocl in preventing cross-contamination during the washing  process rather than in causing a reduction of the number of pathogens present on  lettuce.

TI  == streptococcus milleri group isolates from blood cultures: consider surgical sepsis.
AB  == background: streptococcus milleri group bacteria (smg) frequently are involved in purulent infections, often resulting in abscess formation with a high recurrence  rate. blood stream infections with these organisms are infrequent. patients and methods: review of epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of smg-related bacteremia. results: during a four-year period, 637 smg-positive samples from 475 patients, including 45 positive blood cultures from 25 patients (7.1%), were identified. in one pediatric patient, the smg was a contaminant, so 24 patients (5.1%) with 44 positive blood cultures (6.9%) were available for further evaluation. the study group consisted of 17 male and seven female patients with a median age of 56 years and a median hospital stay of 23 days (range 8-83 days). in 21 patients, monomicrobial smg blood stream infection was found, whereas in three patients, polymicrobial infection was diagnosed (coagulase-negative staphylococci in two, escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis in one). the source of the organism in the blood was intra-abdominal infection in six cases, soft tissue infection in another six cases, and cardiovascular and nervous system infection in three cases each. in the remaining cases, miscellaneous sources were identified. in 14 infected patients (58.3%), surgical interventions were performed before smg bacteremia was diagnosed. all patients received antibiotic treatment with a median duration of 11.5 d (range 6-25 d). five patients died, but no death was related directly to smg infection. conclusions: sepsis with smg  is in most cases associated with surgical infection. source control together with directed antibiotic therapy leads to an acceptable outcome. immunosuppression and significant co-morbidities are common in patients with this type of infection.

TI  == mutational analysis of genes implicated in lps and capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis in the opportunistic pathogen bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == the obligate anaerobe bacteroides fragilis is a normal resident of the human gastrointestinal tract. the clinically derived b. fragilis strain nctc 9343 produces an extensive array of extracellular polysaccharides (eps), including antigenically distinct large, small and micro- capsules. the genome of nctc 9343  encodes multiple gene clusters potentially involved in the biosynthesis of eps, eight of which are implicated in production of the antigenically variable micro-capsule. we have developed a rapid and robust method for generating marked  and markerless deletions, together with efficient electroporation using unmodified plasmid dna to enable complementation of mutations. we show that deletion of a putative wzz homologue prevents production of high-molecular-mass polysaccharides (hmmps), which form the micro-capsule. this observation suggests  that micro-capsule hmmps constitute the distal component of lps in b. fragilis. the long chain length of this polysaccharide is strikingly different from classical enteric o-antigen, which consists of short-chain polysaccharides. we also demonstrate that deletion of a putative wbap homologue prevents expression of the phase-variable large capsule and that expression can be restored by complementation. this suggests that synthesis of the large capsule is mechanistically equivalent to production of escherichia coli group 1 and 4 capsules.

TI  == an orthologue of bacteroides fragilis nanh is the principal sialidase in tannerella forsythia.
AB  == sialidase activity is a putative virulence factor of the anaerobic periodontal pathogen tannerella forsythia, but it is uncertain which genes encode this activity. characterization of a putative sialidase, siahi, by others, indicated that this protein alone may not be responsible for all of the sialidase activity. we describe a second sialidase in t. forsythia (tf0035), an orthologue of bacteroides fragilis nanh, and its expression in escherichia coli. sialidase activity of the expressed nanh was confirmed by using 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-d-n-acetylneuraminic acid as a substrate. biochemical characterization of the recombinant t. forsythia nanh indicated that  it was active over a broad ph range, with optimum activity at ph 5.5. this enzyme has high affinity for 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-d-n-acetylneuraminic acid (k(m) of 32.9 +/- 10.3 microm) and rapidly releases 4-methylumbelliferone (v(max) of 170.8 +/- 11.8 nmol of 4-methylumbelliferone min(-1) mg of protein(-1)). e. coli lysates containing recombinant t. forsythia nanh cleave sialic acid from a range of substrates, with a preference for alpha2-3 glycosidic linkages. the genes adjacent to nanh encode proteins apparently involved in the metabolism of sialic acid, indicating that the nanh sialidase is likely to be involved in nutrient acquisition.

TI  == multidrug resistance gene deficient (mdr1a-/-) mice have an altered caecal microbiota that precedes the onset of intestinal inflammation.
AB  == aim: to compare caecal microbiota from mdr1a(-/-) and wild type (fvb) mice to identify differences in the bacterial community that could influence the intestinal inflammation. methods and results: caecal microbiota of mdr1a(-/-) and fvb mice were evaluated at 12 and 25 weeks of age using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and quantitative real-time pcr. dgge fingerprints of fvb and mdr1a(-/-) mice (with no intestinal inflammation) at 12 weeks revealed differences in the presence of dna fragments identified as bacteroides fragilis,  b. thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus and an uncultured alphaproteobacterium. escherichia coli and acinetobacter sp. were only identified in dgge profiles of mdr1a(-/-) mice at 25 weeks (with severe intestinal inflammation), which also had a lower number of total bacteria in the caecum compared with fvb mice at same age. conclusions: differences found in the caecal microbiota of fvb and mdr1a(-/-) mice (12 weeks) suggest that the lack of abcb1 transporters in intestinal cells due to the disruption of the mdr1a gene might lead to changes in the caecal microbiota. the altered microbiota along with the genetic defect could contribute to the development of intestinal inflammation in mdr1a(-/-) mice. significance and impact of the study: differences in caecal microbiota of mdr1a(-/-) and fvb mice (12 weeks) suggest genotype specific colonization. the results provide evidence that abcb1 transporters may regulate host interactions with commensal bacteria. future work is needed to identify the mechanisms involved in this possible cross-talk between the host intestinal cells and microbiota.

AB  == background/aims: risk factors for mortality resulting from anaerobic infection are incompletely defined. the clinical significance of a broad range of pathogenic obligate anaerobic organisms was examined, and factors independently associated with mortality were identified in patients with clinically significant anaerobic infections. methods: the medical records of 1,050 patients with anaerobic infections were retrospectively reviewed at severance hospital in seoul, korea. results: the mean age of the patients was 54.1+/-16.8 years, and 57.7% were men. overall, 320 (30.5%) patients with case-defined illness experienced pain at the affected site, and 230 (21.9%) experienced pus flow from  lesions. ten (1.4%) patients presented with shock, and 80.3% of the clinically significant cases were polymicrobial anaerobic infections. the mean number of pathogens, including aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, was 3.7+/-1.0 (minimum 1, maximum 5), and the number of anaerobic organisms was 1.0+/-0.3 in each specimen. the major pathogens by rank were the bacteroides fragilis group, which accounted  for 41.8% of anaerobic infections, followed by clostridium spp. (11.8%), prevotella spp. (9.4%), and peptostreptococcus spp. (8.4%). escherichia coli (17.5%), staphylococcus aureus (7.5%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (7.5%) were common concomitant aerobic organisms. the overall crude mortality rate resulting  from anaerobic infection was 29.7%. among the determining factors associated with mortality, liver disease (p=0.003) and old age (p=0.005) were significant in multivariate analysis. conclusions: anaerobic infection is polymicrobial and has  a significant role in morbidity and mortality. underlying liver disease was associated with poor prognosis in anaerobic infection.

TI  == management of severe abdominal infections.
AB  == abdominal infections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. nearly all bacteria causing abdominal infections are derived from the endogenous  flora of the alimentary tract. the resulting infection is typically polymicrobial and comprised of both aerobic and anaerobic microbes. they can be classified by their severity as uncomplicated and complicated or by their origin as community or hospital acquired. escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis are the most frequently isolated bacteria in community-acquired abdominal infections. nosocomial infections typically involve a more resistant flora (e.g. pseudomonas  spp., acinetobacter spp., gram-negative bacilli producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases [esbl], vancomycin-resistant enterococci [vre] and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus [mrsa]). antimicrobial therapy should be guided by microbiological testing and frequently requires other interventions  as well. in uncomplicated infections antimicrobial prophylaxis for < 24h may be considered. patients with underlying or acquired immunodeficiency, i.e. organ transplant recipients and other patients on complex immunosuppressant regimens require special attention and antimicrobial coverage. we discuss the relevant microbiota, a rational diagnostic and therapeutic approach including strategies to handle challenging infections. the application of novel compounds and/or drug  classes for abdominal infections such as glycylcyclines (i.e. tigecycline), glycopeptides (i.e. dalbavancin, telavancin, oritavancin), carbapenems (i.e. doripenem), and forth generation cephalosporins (i.e. ceftaroline, ceftobiprole)  as well as patents on metalloproteinase and caspase inhibitors, interleukin antagonists, fusion proteins and nitric oxide donators is critically reviewed. the information is summarized in flow charts and algorithms for use in daily clinical practice and the review article also shows the useful information of the patents for the treatment of abdominal infections.

AB  == a two-year monitoring program of microbiological and physical-chemical parameters at 2 waste water treatment plants (wwtps) in mallorca (spain) was performed in order to (1) evaluate the efficiency of lagooning and uv radiation as tertiary treatment processes; (2) determine the characteristics of wastewater effluent for its potential agricultural reuse; and (3) establish correlations between bacteriological and virological parameters. the presence of currently established bacterial indicators (total coliforms, faecal coliforms, escherichia coli, enterococci, and spores of sulphite-reducing clostridia), virological (enteroviruses, somatic coliphages, f-specific coliphages, and phages infecting bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron), and helminth eggs were tested during this study. bacterial and viral indicators were removed at least with one log reduction in the lagooning system, and to a lesser extent with uv-radiation treatment. the lagooning system was less efficient in removing phages and viruses than were bacterial indicators, with the exception of f-specific phages. phages of b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron were less removed than all of the other microbiological parameters. in the uv-radiation treatment, however, the faecal coliforms proved the most sensitive, while clostridial spores, somatic coliphages, bacteroides phages, and enteric viruses were the more resistant. helminth eggs were not detected in any samples from effluents of either the secondary or tertiary treatments.indicator levels in both treatments met the established regulations of both local and national authorities for the disposal or reuse of wastewater in irrigation for non-human crop. we demonstrate that somatic coliphages are effective indicators of enteric viruses in both of the wwtps studied.

TI  == review of the guidelines for complicated skin and soft tissue infections and intra-abdominal infections--are they applicable today?
AB  == difficult-to-treat infections in surgical patients, such as serious skin and soft tissue infections (sstis) and complicated intra-abdominal infections (ciais), are the cause of significant morbidity and mortality, and carry an economic burden. these surgical site infections are typically polymicrobial infections caused by a plethora of pathogens, which include difficult-to-treat organisms and multiresistant gram-positive and gram-negative strains. optimal management of sstis and ciais must take into account the presence of resistant pathogens, and depends on the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy (i.e. the correct spectrum, route and dose in a timely fashion for a sufficient duration as well as the timely implementation of source control measures). treatment recommendations from the infectious diseases society of america and the surgical  infection society are available for guidance in the management of both of these infections, yet the increased global prevalence of multidrug-resistant pathogens  has complicated the antibiotic selection process. several pathogens of concern include methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, responsible for problematic  postoperative infections, especially in patients with sstis, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria, including ctx-m-type-producing escherichia coli strains, and multidrug-resistant strains of bacteroides fragilis. new empirical regimens, taking advantage of potent broad-spectrum antibiotic options, may be needed for the treatment of certain high-risk patients with surgical site infections.

TI  == giardia, entamoeba, and trichomonas enzymes activate metronidazole (nitroreductases) and inactivate metronidazole (nitroimidazole reductases).
AB  == infections with giardia lamblia, entamoeba histolytica, and trichomonas vaginalis, which cause diarrhea, dysentery, and vaginitis, respectively, are each treated with metronidazole. here we show that giardia, entamoeba, and trichomonas have oxygen-insensitive nitroreductase (ntr) genes which are homologous to those  genes that have nonsense mutations in metronidazole-resistant helicobacter pylori isolates. entamoeba and trichomonas also have nim genes which are homologous to those genes expressed in metronidazole-resistant bacteroides fragilis isolates. recombinant giardia, entamoeba, and trichomonas nitroreductases used nadh rather  than the nadph used by helicobacter, and two recombinant entamoeba nitroreductases increased the metronidazole sensitivity of transformed escherichia coli strains. conversely, the recombinant nitroimidazole reductases (nims) of entamoeba and trichmonas conferred very strong metronidazole resistance to transformed bacteria. the ehntr1 gene of the genome project hm-1:imss strain of entamoeba histolytica had a nonsense mutation, and the same nonsense mutation  was present in 3 of 22 clinical isolates of entamoeba. while ntr and nim mrnas were variably expressed by cultured entamoeba and trichomonas isolates, there was no relationship to metronidazole sensitivity. we conclude that microaerophilic protists have bacterium-like enzymes capable of activating metronidazole (nitroreductases) and inactivating metronidazole (nims). while entamoeba and trichomonas displayed some of the changes (nonsense mutations and gene overexpression) associated with metronidazole resistance in bacteria, these changes did not confer metronidazole resistance to the microaerophilic protists examined here.

TI  == surface components of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background and objective: research on porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontopathogen, has provided a tremendous amount of information over the last 20 years, which may exceed in part than that on other closely related members in  terms of phylogenetic as well as proteomic criteria, including bacteroides fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron as major anaerobic, opportunistic pathogens in the medical field. in this minireview, we focused on recent research findings concerning surface components such as outer membrane proteins and fimbriae, of p. gingivalis. material and methods: elucidation of the surface components in p. gingivalis was especially difficult because outer membrane proteins are tightly bound to lipopolysaccharide and they are resistant to dissociation and separation from each other, even during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, unless samples are appropriately heated. in addition, p. gingivalis is asaccharolytic and therefore a potent proteolytic bacterium, another factor causing difficulty in research. the study of the surface components was carefully carried out considering these unique features in p. gingivalis when compared with other gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. results: separation of outer membrane proteins,  and characterization of ompa-like proteins and ragab as major proteins, is described herein. our recent findings on fima and mfa1 fimbriae, two unique appendages in this organism, and on their regulation of expression are also described briefly. conclusion: surface components of p. gingivalis somehow have contact with host tissues and cells because of the outermost cell elements. therefore, such bacterial components are potentially important in the occurrence  of periodontal diseases.

AB  == tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from april 2006 to march 2007 were investigated in a multicenter study in  japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 474 strains including 23 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 170 (75.2%) of 226 patients with surgical infections. two hundred and twenty-six strains were isolated from primary infections, and 224 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of staphylococcus spp. was higher from postoperative infections, while enterococcus spp. was higher from primary infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and e. cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by bacteroides fragilis and from postoperative infections, b. fragilis was most predominately isolated, followed by bacteroides caccae, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and b. wadsworthia in this order. in this series, we noticed no  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, nor multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa. there were three strains of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative  staphylococcus aureus, but all of them had good susceptibilities against various  anti-mrsa antibiotics. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia.

TI  == interactive and individual effects of dietary non-digestible carbohydrates and oils on dna damage, scfa and bacteria in the large bowel of rats.
AB  == dietary non-digestible carbohydrates (ndc) play an important role in large-bowel  health and one form of ndc, resistant starch (rs), can promote low levels of dna  damage and other markers of colonic health. the objective of the present study was to determine whether the ability of dietary rs or other ndc to influence colonic health, particularly dna damage, is dependent on the type of dietary oil. we compared the effects of diets containing 10 % of ndc from cellulose, wheat bran, high-amylose maize starch (has, a rich source of rs type 2) or a retrograded has (rhas, a rich source of rs type 3) on dna damage, scfa production and bacterial changes in the large bowel of rats. each carbohydrate source was combined with 10 % fish oil (fo) or sunola oil (so; rich in oleic acid). there was a significant interaction between ndc and oil treatments on single-strand dna breaks in colonocytes isolated from the colon. the damage in rats consuming rhas  was greater for fo consumption than for so consumption. there was a significant interaction between ndc and oils on caecum weights and treatment effects of ndc and oils were observed for the weights and lengths of other gut tissues. significant differences were found in colonic scfa pools and caecal numbers of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis with the  various ndc and oil treatments. the present results demonstrate that the effects  of ndc and oils, particularly on colonic dna damage, can depend on how they are combined within the diet.

TI  == cross-tolerization between nod1 and nod2 signaling results in reduced refractoriness to bacterial infection in nod2-deficient macrophages.
AB  == nod2 is an intracellular innate immune receptor that plays a role in host defense and susceptibility to inflammatory disease. we show in this study that macrophages rendered refractory to tlr4 and nod2 signaling by exposure to lps and muramyl dipeptide (mdp) exhibit impaired tnf-alpha and il-6 production in response to pathogenic listeria monocytogenes and yersinia pseudotuberculosis as  well as commensal bacteria including escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis. surprisingly, nod2 deficiency was associated with impaired tolerization in response to pathogenic and commensal bacteria. mechanistically, reduced tolerization of nod2-null macrophages was mediated by recognition of bacteria through nod1 because it was abolished in macrophages deficient in nod1 and nod2.  consistently, nod2-null macrophages tolerant to lps and mdp showed enhanced production of tnf-alpha and il-6 as well as increased nf-kappab and mapk activation in response to the dipeptide kf1b, the nod1 agonist. furthermore, reduced tolerization of nod2-deficient macrophages in response to bacteria was abolished when mutant macrophages were also rendered tolerant to the nod1 ligand. finally, mdp stimulation induced refractoriness not only to mdp, but also to ie-dap stimulation, providing a mechanism to explain the reduced tolerization of  nod2-deficient macrophages infected with bacteria. these results demonstrate that cross-tolerization between nod1 and nod2 leads to increase recognition of both pathogenic and commensal bacteria in nod2-deficient macrophages pre-exposed to microbial ligands.

TI  == microbial indicators and pathogens: removal, relationships and predictive capabilities in water reclamation facilities.
AB  == four water reclamation facilities in north-eastern spain were monitored over 2 years to determine the occurrence and concentrations of a set of microbial indicators (total coliforms, escherichia coli, enterococci, spores of sulphite reducing clostridia, somatic coliphages, f-specific rna phages, phages infecting  bacteroides fragilis strain ryc2056 and phages infecting bacteroides tethaiotaomicron strain ga-17), and two selected pathogens (cytopathogenic enteroviruses and viable cryptosporidium oocysts). the indicator (survival) and index (presence) functions of the various indicators tested were evaluated through the wastewater treatments. the inactivation pattern of all groups of bacteriophages tested was closer to the inactivation of enteroviruses than to the inactivation of the conventional bacterial indicators tested. the inactivation of sulfite reducing clostridia spores and bacteriophages more closely approximates the reduction of viable cryptosporidium than do the conventional bacterial indicators. we observed neither index functions nor a predictive relationship between any of microbial indicators and viable cryptosporidium oocysts. in contrast, several regression models (r>0.6) and discriminant functions (67-88% well classified samples) based mostly on numbers of bacteriophages were able to predict both the presence and concentrations of enteroviruses. a combination of both bacterial and bacteriophage indicators seem to be the best choice for ensuring the microbial quality of reclaimed water.

TI  == genetic tools for studying capnocytophaga canimorsus.
AB  == capnocytophaga canimorsus, a commensal bacterium from canine oral flora, has been isolated throughout the world from severe human infections caused by dog bites. due to the low level of evolutionary relationship to proteobacteria, genetic methods suitable for the genus capnocytophaga needed to be established. here, we  show that tn4351, derived from bacteroides fragilis, could be introduced by conjugation into c. canimorsus and conferred resistance to erythromycin. by mapping and sequencing a naturally occurring plasmid isolated from a clinical isolate of c. canimorsus, we identified a repa gene that allowed us to construct  escherichia coli-capnocytophaga shuttle vectors. most commonly used antibiotic markers were not functional in c. canimorsus, but cefoxitin (cfxa), tetracycline  (tetq), and erythromycin (ermf) resistances could be used as markers for plasmid  maintenance in c. canimorsus and even in some other capnocytophaga spp. shuttle vectors were introduced into c. canimorsus either by conjugation using the origin of transfer (orit) of rp4 or by electrotransformation. taking advantage of the promoter of ermf, an expression vector was constructed. finally, a method that allows site-directed mutagenesis is described. all these genetic tools pave the way, not only for molecular studies of the pathogenesis of c. canimorsus, but also for studies of other oral capnocytophaga species.

TI  == [etiology, epidemiology and microbiological diagnosis of intra-abdominal infections].
AB  == intra-abdominal infections (iais) are commonly encountered in clinical practice.  the etiology of these infections, often polymicrobial in nature, can be variable  and usually includes organisms derived from the gut microbiota. in community-acquired iais enterobacteria predominate (mostly escherichia coli) in combination with anaerobes (mostly bacteroides fragilis). in nosocomial iais, which can complicate abdominal surgery, other pathogens can also play a role, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp. e candida spp. diagnostic microbiology of iais is complex and plays a relevant role especially in some situations (e. g. presence of foreign bodies, potential presence of resistant or uncommon pathogens, nosocomial infections in subjects with risk factors). antibiotic resistance issues are currently encountered in most pathogenic species causing iais. resistance affects all major classes of antimicrobial agents, often involving multiple classes and resulting in complex resistance phenotypes for which only a very limited number of drugs remain active.

TI  == ceftobiprole: a review of a broad-spectrum and anti-mrsa cephalosporin.
AB  == ceftobiprole, an investigational cephalosporin, is currently in phase iii clinical development. ceftobiprole is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with demonstrated in vitro activity against gram-positive cocci, including meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and meticillin-resistant s. epidermidis, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, gram-negative bacilli including ampc-producing escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but excluding extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. like cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime, ceftobiprole demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis and  non-fragilis bacteroides spp. in single-step and serial passage in vitro resistance development studies, ceftobiprole demonstrated a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is a weak inducer and a poor substrate for ampc beta-lactamases.ceftobiprole medocaril, the prodrug of ceftobiprole, is converted by plasma esterases to ceftobiprole in <30  minutes. peak serum concentrations of ceftobiprole observed at the end of a single 30-minute infusion were 35.5 mug/ml for a 500-mg dose and 59.6 mug/ml for  a 750-mg dose. the volume of distribution of ceftobiprole is 0.26 l/kg ( approximately 18 l), protein binding is 16%, and its serum half-life is approximately 3.5 hours. ceftobiprole is renally excreted ( approximately 70% in  the active form) and systemic clearance correlates with creatinine clearance, meaning that dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal dysfunction. ceftobiprole has a modest post-antibiotic effect (pae) of approximately 0.5 hours for mrsa and a longer pae of approximately 2 hours for penicillin-resistant pneumococci. ceftobiprole, when administered intravenously at 500 mg once every 8 hours (2-hour infusion), has a >90% probability of achieving f t(>mic) (free drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]) for 40% and 60%, respectively, of the dosing interval for isolates with ceftobiprole mic < or =4 and < or =2 mg/l, respectively.currently, only limited clinical trial data are published for ceftobiprole. in a phase iii trial, 784 patients with gram-positive skin infections were randomized to treatment with either ceftobiprole 500 mg or vancomycin 1 g, each administered twice daily for 7-14 days; 93.3% of patients were clinically cured with ceftobiprole compared with 93.5% receiving vancomycin, and the eradication rate for mrsa infections was 91.8% for ceftobiprole compared  with 90% for vancomycin. a phase iii, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial compared ceftobiprole 500 mg every 8 hours with vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours plus ceftazidime 1 g every 8 hours in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections. of the 828 patients enrolled, 31% had diabetic foot infections, 30% had abscesses, and 22% had wounds. no difference in clinical cure was reported in the clinically evaluable, intent-to-treat and microbiologically evaluable populations with cure rates of 90.5%, 81.9%, and 90.8%, respectively, in the ceftobiprole-treated patients and 90.2%, 80.8%, and 90.5%, respectively, in the vancomycin plus ceftazidime-treated group. microbiologic eradication of gram-positive cocci meticillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) [ceftobiprole 91% vs  vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%] and mrsa (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 80%), as well as gram-negative bacilli, e. coli (ceftobiprole 89% vs  vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%), and p. aeruginosa (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 100%), was not significantly different between groups. similar cures rates in the microbiologically evaluable population occurred in both groups for panton-valentine leukocidin (pvl)-positive mssa and pvl-positive mrsa.currently, ceftobiprole has completed phase iii trials for complicated skin and skin structure infections due to mrsa and nosocomial pneumonia due to suspected or proven mrsa; phase iii trials are also ongoing in community-acquired pneumonia. ceftobiprole has so far demonstrated a good safety  profile in preliminary studies with similar tolerability to comparators. the broad-spectrum activity of ceftobiprole may allow it to be used as monotherapy in situations where a combination of antibacterials might be required. further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftobiprole  and to define its role in patient care.

AB  == background: none of the proposed materials tested for the management of perianal  fistulae has proven to be a definitive treatment. aim: to assess a new repair scaffold and drug delivery device conceived to target perianal fistula repair. methods: poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) porous microspheres containing either antibacterial silver-releasing degradable phosphate glass or metronidazole were prepared using thermally induced phase separation. results: ion- and drug-release profiling of the microspheres revealed continued release of silver ions from microspheres filled with silver-doped phosphate glass and high encapsulation efficiency for metronidazole [78% and 82% for microspheres loaded with 2.5% and 1.3% (w/w), respectively]. microbicidal activity was confirmed by growth inhibition of bacterial species (staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis), which characteristically dominate the colonization of perianal fistula tracts. microspheres containing >3 mol% silver or metronidazole  resulted in strong bacterial inhibition/kill against b. fragilis; the presence of one sphere containing >3 mol% silver had a potent inhibitory effect against all the microbes studied. microspheres became rapidly integrated with host tissue following subcutaneous implantation into a rodent wound model. conclusion: the study demonstrates a novel scaffold for guided tissue regeneration providing local release of antimicrobial agents sufficient to counter bacterial colonization and warrants further investigation.

TI  == pbp, a cell-surface exposed plasminogen binding protein of bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == the gram-negative anaerobic bacterium b. fragilis is a member of the commensal flora of the human intestine, but is also frequently found in severe intra-abdominal infections. several b. fragilis virulence factors have been implicated in the development of these infections. a b. fragilis protein of circa 60-kda was identified as a putative plasminogen binding protein (pbp). the corresponding gene was located, cloned, sequenced and the subcellular localization of the protein was investigated. pbp was both determined in the outer membrane of b. fragilis and of e. coli that expressed the cloned protein. protease accessibility studies showed that the protein is expressed at the cell surface. importantly, we demonstrated that pbp is sufficient and required for plasminogen binding to whole cells in both e. coli and b. fragilis. pbp-like proteins were also detected in some other bacteroides subspecies. the role of this potential b. fragilis virulence factor in pathogenicity is discussed.

AB  == metal pins used to apply skeletal traction or external fixation devices protruding through skin are susceptible to the increased incidence of pin site infection. in this work, we tried to establish the photokilling effects of titanium dioxide (tio2) nanoparticles on an orthopedic implant with an in vitro study. in these photocatalytic experiments, aqueous tio2 was added to the tested  microorganism. the time effect of tio2 photoactivation was evaluated, and the loss of viability of five different bacteria suspensions (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus hirae, and bacteroides fragilis) was examined by the viable count procedure. the bactericidal effect of tio2 nanoparticle-coated metal plates was also tested. the ultraviolet (uv) dosage used in this experiment did not affect the viability of bacteria, and all bacteria survived well in the absence of tio2 nanoparticles. the survival curve of microorganisms in the presence of tio2 nanoparticles showed that nearly complete killing was achieved after 50 min of uv illumination. the formation of bacterial colonies above the tio2 nanoparticle-coated metal plates also decreased significantly. in this study, we clearly demonstrated the bactericidal effects of titanium dioxide nanoparticles. in the presence of uv light, the titanium dioxide nanoparticles can be applicable to medical facilities where the potential for infection should be controlled.

TI  == microbiology and management of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis.
AB  == necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) is a clinical syndrome of ischemic necrosis of the bowel of multiple etiological factors that include the presence of intestinal ischemia, abnormal bacterial flora, and intestinal mucosal immaturity. numerous reports have implied that the fecal microflora may contribute to the pathogenesis of nec. a broad range of organisms generally found in the distal gastrointestinal tract have been recovered from the peritoneal cavity and blood of infants with nec. the predominant organisms include enterobacteriaceae (i.e., escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae) , clostridium spp., enteric pathogens (salmonellae,  coxsackie b2 virus, coronavirus, rotavirus), and potential pathogens (bacteroides fragilis). the goals of the initial management is preventing ongoing damage, restoring hemostasis, and minimizing complications. medical management includes withholding oral feeding, placement of nasogastric tube, abdominal decompression, paracentesis, vigorous intravenous hydration containing electrolytes and calories, support of the circulation, administration of antibiotics, and surveillance for deterioration or complications that require surgical intervention. indications for surgery include clinical deterioration, perforation, peritonitis, obstruction, and abdominal mass. prevention remains crucial to decrease the incidence of nec. preventive methods include cautious feeding regimens, the use of maternal breast milk, and the use of probiotics.

TI  == portal vein thrombosis associated with coronary artery bypass surgery.
AB  == portal vein thrombosis is a rare but well-known complication after abdominal surgery. to our knowledge, there have been no reports about this complication after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. this can probably be explained by the variety of clinical pictures and difficulties in the establishment of a diagnosis of portal vein thrombosis. among the possible trigger factors, bacteremia, that is usually caused by bacteroides fragilis or by escherichia coli, has been assessed. in this case, several blood culture specimens and fluid from abdominal  paracentesis consistently grew coagulase-negative staphylococci which have been proved to be one of the most common pathogens in postoperative infection after cardiac surgery. the patient received clopidogrel before and after coronary artery bypass grafting. we speculate that in this clinical situation associated with coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia, clopidogrel resistance may play an important role. the natural history of portal vein thrombosis in this case is complicated by massive fatal gastrointestinal bleeding from rupture of the esophageal varices. emergency endoscopic therapy with esophageal variceal ligation, injection of a sclerosing solution and using of vasoconstrictive agents helped only in the first episode of bleeding. portal vein thrombosis after coronary artery bypass grafting is a serious complication. the clinical picture of portal vein thrombosis may vary greatly and the presence of this condition should be suspected when faced with abdominal pain with gastrointestinal bleeding of unknown origin and sepsis.

TI  == an arac/xyls family transcriptional regulator homologue from bacteroides fragilis is associated with cell survival following dna damage.
AB  == a putative transcriptional regulator of the arac/xyls family was identified in a  genomic genebank of bacteroides fragilis bf-1, which partially relieved the sensitivity of escherichia coli dna repair mutants to the dna-damaging agents, metronidazole and mitomycin c. a homologue of this gene with the same phenotype was identified as bf638r3281 in b. fragilis 638r. transcription of bf638r3281 was constitutive with respect to exposure to sublethal doses of metronidazole. bf638r3281 was interrupted by single cross-over gene-specific insertion mutation, and the gene disruption was confirmed by pcr and dna-sequencing analysis. the mutant grew more slowly than the wild type, and the mutation rendered b. fragilis more sensitive to metronidazole and mitomycin c. this indicates that the bf638r3281 gene product plays a role in the survival of b. fragilis following dna damage by these agents.

TI  == bacteremic sepsis disturbs alveolar perfusion distribution in the lungs of rats.
AB  == objective: sepsis often leads to lung injury, although the mechanisms that initiate this are unclear. one preinjury phenomenon that has not been explored previously is the effect of bacterial (nonlipopolysaccharide) sepsis on the distribution of alveolar perfusion. the goals of our studies were to measure this. design: randomized, controlled, prospective animal study. setting: university animal laboratory. subjects: male sprague-dawley rats (450-550 g). interventions: we induced sepsis by placing gelatin capsules containing escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis into the abdomens of rats (n = 9). empty capsules (n = 6) were placed into the abdomens of controls. after 24 hrs, 4-microm-diameter fluorescent latex particles (2 x 10(8)) were infused into the pulmonary circulation. sepsis was induced in additional rats and controls to assess lung injury, as follows: lung histology was performed on eight septic rats and on seven controls; lung lavage was performed on three septic rats and three controls after their plasma albumin had been labeled with evans blue dye. measurements and main results: confocal microscopy was used to prepare digital maps of latex particle trapping patterns (eight per lung). analysis of these patterns revealed statistically more clustering (perfusion inhomogeneity) down to tissue volumes less than that of ten alveoli in septic lungs compared with controls (p < or = .05). bacterial counts and neutrophil counts were significantly higher in the circulation of septic rats (p < or = .05). blood pressures and arterial po2s were unchanged. cell counts in histological images were three-fold higher in septic lungs than in controls (p < or = .05). lung lavage revealed 0.41 +/- 0.03 ml of plasma in the lungs of septic rats, and 0.06  +/- 0.05 ml in the lungs of controls (p < or = .05). conclusions: bacterial sepsis caused significant maldistribution of interalveolar perfusion in the lungs of rats in the absence of significant lung injury.

TI  == fournier's gangrene: ten-year experience in a medical center in northern taiwan.
AB  == background and purpose: fournier's gangrene is a life-threatening infection. the  mortality is still high despite the rapid advancement of modern intensive care and surgical technique. in this study, we present our institution's recent experience with a large series of patients with fournier's gangrene. methods: a retrospective chart review was performed including 44 consecutive patients with fournier's gangrene over a 10-year period. results: the 44 cases comprised 39 males and 5 females, with a mean age of 55.5 years. the mean duration of hospitalization was 27.9 days. overall mortality was 22.7%. diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic liver disease, liver cirrhosis and chronic renal insufficiency were the 5 leading predisposing factors. liver cirrhosis was highly related to mortality (p=0.009). the etiologic origin of the gangrene was colorectal, urological and dermatological in 52.3%, 25.0%, and 11.4% of patients, respectively. the most common isolated pathogens were escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus spp., and proteus mirabilis. there were a total of 74 debridements. other related surgical procedures were reconstruction surgery (n = 18), colostomy (2), cystostomy (1), vasectomy (1), orchiectomy (1) and penectomy (1). major complications of fournier's gangrene, including respiratory failure, renal failure, septic shock,  hepatic failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, were significantly to mortality (p<0.05). conclusions: early diagnosis, intensive medical care (aggressive resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics), and prompt and repeated surgical intervention are the mainstays of treatment. liver cirrhosis in particular is a poor prognostic factor. reconstructive surgery should also be a consideration once the acute condition has improved. patients with comorbid condition, serious infection, and major complications should be treated carefully and aggressively.

TI  == exposure-response analyses of tigecycline efficacy in patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections.
AB  == exposure-response analyses were performed to test the microbiological and clinical efficacies of tigecycline in complicated intra-abdominal infections where escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis are the predominant pathogens. data from evaluable patients enrolled in three clinical trials were pooled. patients received intravenous tigecycline (100-mg loading dose followed by 50 mg  every 12 h or 50-mg loading dose followed by 25 mg every 12 h). at the test-of-cure visit, microbiological and clinical responses were evaluated. patients were prospectively classified into cohorts based on infection with a baseline pathogen(s): e. coli only (cohort 1), other mono- or polymicrobial enterobacteriaceae (cohort 2), at least one enterobacteriaceae pathogen plus an anaerobe(s) (cohort 3), at least one enterobacteriaceae pathogen plus a gram-positive pathogen(s) (cohort 4), and all other pathogens (cohort 5). the cohorts were prospectively combined to increase sample size. logistic regression  was used to evaluate ratio of steady-state 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve (auc) to mic as a response predictor, and classification-and-regression-tree (cart) analyses were utilized to determine auc/mic breakpoints. analysis began with cohorts 1, 2, and 3 pooled, which included 71 patients, with 106 pathogens. the small sample size precluded evaluation of cohorts 1 (34 patients, 35 e. coli pathogens) and 2 (16 patients, 24 enterobacteriaceae). cart analyses identified a significant auc/mic breakpoint of 6.96 for microbiological and clinical responses (p values of 0.0004 and 0.399, respectively). the continuous auc/mic ratio was also borderline predictive of microbiological response (p = 0.0568). cohort 4 (21 patients, 50 pathogens) was evaluated separately; however, an exposure-response relationship was not detected; cohort 5 (31 patients, 60 pathogens) was not evaluated. the prospective approach of creating homogenous populations of pathogens was critical for identifying exposure-response relationships in complicated intra-abdominal infections.

AB  == many bacteroides transfer factors are mobilizable in escherichia coli when coresident with the incp conjugative plasmid rp4, but not f. to begin characterization and potential interaction between bacteroides mobilizable transfer factors and the rp4 mating channel, both mutants and deletions of the dna processing (dtr), mating pair formation (mpf) and trag coupling genes of rp4  were tested for mobilization of bacteroides plasmid plv22a. all 10 mpf but none of the four dtr genes were required for mobilization of plv22a. the rp4 trag coupling protein (cp) was also required for mobilization of plv22a, but could be  substituted by a c-terminal deletion mutant of the f trad cp. potential interactions of the trag cp with relaxase protein(s) and transfer dna of both rp4 and plv22a were assessed. overlay assays identified productive interactions between trag and the relaxase proteins of both mbpb and trai from plv22a and rp4  respectively. the agrobacterium transfer-immunoprecipitation (trip) assay also identified an interaction between trag and both rp4 and plv22a transfer dna. thus, mobilization of the bacteroides plv22a in e. coli utilizes both rp4 mpf and cp functions including an interaction between the relaxosome and the rp4 cp similar to that of cognate rp4 plasmid.

AB  == objectives: to determine the potential of active compounds (acs) present in commonly used analgesics/antiseptics and cleaning agents (detergents and disinfectants) to induce multiple antibiotic resistance (mar) in bacteroides fragilis. methods: b. fragilis atcc 25285 untreated or pretreated with sublethal  concentrations of acs (n = 25) was grown for 12 h. susceptibility of cells pre-treated with various acs to antibiotics and expression of resistance nodulation division family (bmeb) efflux pumps and putative mara-like global activators (pgas) were measured. results: twelve aromatic acs containing benzene  or its activated derivatives (salicylate, acetaminophen, gingerol, benzoate, phenol, chlorhexidine gluconate, capsaicin, juglone, cinnamaldehyde, benzene, ibuprofen and triton x-100) induced mar, which was reduced by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. there was a positive correlation between the predicted degree of benzene activation and the level of induction. deactivated benzene or non-aromatic acs were either poor inducers or non-inducers. efflux pumps bmeb1, 3, 4, 7 and two pgas bfra1 and bfra2 were overexpressed. expression of bfra1 or bfra2 in escherichia coli caused a >2-fold increase in the mar and overexpression of acrb, suggesting that they were putative mara orthologues. conclusions: these  data demonstrate (i) the presence of an mara-like system(s) in b. fragilis and (ii) the propensity of benzene or its activated derivatives present in pharmaceutical products to induce mar.

AB  == severe secondary peritonitis is diagnosed in only 20-30% of all patients, but studies to date have persisted in using a standard fixed duration of antibiotic therapy. this prospective, double-blind, multicenter, randomized clinical study compared the clinical and bacteriological efficacy and tolerability of ertapenem  (1 g/day) 3 days (group i) vs >or=5 days (group ii) in 111 patients with localized peritonitis (appendicitis vs non-appendicitis) of mild to moderate severity, requiring surgical intervention. in evaluable patients, the clinical response as primary efficacy outcome were assessed at the test-of-cure 2 and 4 weeks after discontinuation of antibacterial therapy. ninety patients were evaluable. in groups i and ii, 92.9 and 89.6% of patients were cured, respectively; 95.3% in group i and 93.7% in group ii showed eradication. these differences were not statistically significant. the most frequent bacteria recovered were escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis. a wound infection developed in seven patients (7.7%) and an intraabdominal infection in one patient (1.1%). there was a low frequency of drug-related clinical or laboratory adverse  effects in both groups. our study demonstrated that, in patients with localized community-acquired intraabdominal infection, a 3-day course of ertapenem had the  same clinical and bacteriological efficacy as a standard duration.

TI  == characterization of bcta, a mating apparatus protein required for transfer of the bacteroides fragilis conjugal element btf-37.
AB  == we have previously described the identification of btf-37, an autonomously transferable chromosomal element isolated from bacteroides fragilis clinical isolate lv23. in this study, we determined that btf-37 harbors a 16kb conjugal transfer-encoding region that contains an almost identical copy of a previously identified bacteroides sp. conjugation-specific gene bcta. bcta has been shown to be required for conjugation in other bacteroides sp. strains, but no information  is available regarding its function. we now report strain distribution and gene expression profiles of bcta. the bcta gene was present in conjugative transposon-harboring b. fragilis strains, but not on a non-transferable b. fragilis plasmid. we also showed that recombinant bcta predominantly localized to the bacterial membrane, and that its n-terminal 32 amino acids were cleaved in an escherichia coli protein expression system, indicating the presence of a signal sequence. expression of bcta consistently increased ~3-fold upon pre-exposure of  conjugating b. fragilis lv23 to subinhibitory concentrations of tetracycline. maximum expression occurred 60min post-tetracycline induction, which also coincided with the time at which highest conjugation frequencies were seen for strain lv23. based on localization, signal sequence and tetracycline inducibility, our results indicate that bcta is indeed an important member of the bacteroides conjugal apparatus, since its gene is regulated by conditions that specifically control conjugation.

TI  == bmerabc5 is a multidrug efflux system that can confer metronidazole resistance in bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == the rnd-family efflux pump gene bmeb5 was previously shown to be overexpressed in metronidazole-resistant laboratory mutants of bacteroides fragilis. in the present study, we characterized the bmeabc5 genes and an upstream putative tetr-family regulator gene (bmer5). bmer5 (645 bp) was located 51 bp upstream of  bmea5 and encoded a 24.9-kda protein. deletant strains lacking bmeb5 or bmer5 were constructed from a wild-type b. fragilis strain adb77. strain antimicrobial  susceptibility was determined and gene expression was quantified. bmer5 was overexpressed in escherichia coli using a 6x-his tag system; bmer5-his6 was isolated from inclusion bodies and its binding to bmeabc5 promoter regions was determined. bmer5-his6 bound specifically to the bmer5-bmec5 intergenic region (it1). deletion of bmer5 (adb77deltabmer5) resulted in a significant (p < 0.05) increase in expression of bmea5, bmeb5, and bmec5, and > two-fold increase in minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ampicillin, cefoxitin, cefoperazone,  ciprofloxacin, imipenem, metronidazole, ethidium bromide, and sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds). mics were reduced by the efflux pump inhibitor carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (cccp). the mics of ampicillin, cefoperazone, metronidazole, and sds were reduced by approximately two-fold in adb77deltabmeb5. a multidrug (metronidazole)-resistant, nim-negative b. fragilis clinical isolate  overexpressed bmeabc5 genes, had a g-->t point mutation in it1, and significantly reduced binding to bmer5-his6. these data demonstrate that bmer5 is a local repressor of bmeabc5 expression and that mutations in it1 can lead to a derepression and resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents, including metronidazole.

TI  == infections related to coils used for embolization of arteries: review of the published evidence.
AB  == the embolization of arteries with the use of coils has been an advance in the management of patients such as those at risk for aneurysm rupture. however, this  procedure is not without complications. a systematic review was undertaken to evaluate the available evidence regarding infectious complications directly related to endovascular coil embolization. seven case reports of patients who experienced infection related to coils used for embolization of arteries were discovered. arteries embolized with coils in these patients were intracranial, intraabdominal, and intrathoracic, respectively, in four, two, and one case. abscess formation in the area of coil placement (n = 6; 85.7%) was the most common infectious complication directly related to endovascular coil embolization. staphylococcus aureus was the predominant isolated pathogen (n = 3; 42.9%). other isolated pathogens included salmonella species type d (n = 1; 14.3%), s. epidermidis (n = 1; 14.3%), escherichia coli (n = 1; 14.3%), and bacteroides fragilis (n = 1; 14.3%). surgical procedures were performed in four of the seven patients described (57.1%), and three patients were treated with only the administration of antimicrobial agents. all reviewed patients were cured. even though it may partially be a result of reporting bias, the scarcity of reports describing infections directly related to endovascular coils despite the increasing number of patients who received this treatment in various parts of the world suggests that infectious complications associated with this foreign endovascular material are very rare. however, the existence of the identified case reports suggests that clinicians should include coil-related infection in the differential diagnosis of patients with fever after this procedure.

TI  == soluble cd14 and cd83 from human neonatal antigen-presenting cells are inducible  by commensal bacteria and suppress allergen-induced human neonatal th2 differentiation.
AB  == cd14 is expressed on the cell surface of various antigen-presenting cells, and cd83 is a maturation marker for dendritic cells (dc). cd14 and cd83 are also present as soluble proteins, and both have immunoregulatory functions. we examined whether neonatal cord blood monocytes or dc released soluble cd14 (scd14) or scd83 when exposed to the commensal intestinal bacteria clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, escherichia coli, and bacteroides fragilis. we found that the gram-positive bacteria c. perfringens and s. aureus, but not gram-negative bacteria, induced the release of scd14 from  monocytes. dc, on the other hand, released scd14 in response to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. moreover, the expression of the virulence factor staphylococcal protein a seemed to be important for s. aureus-induced scd14 production from both monocytes and dc. soluble cd83 was released from dc, but not from monocytes, when exposed to both gram-positive and  gram-negative bacteria. finally, to investigate whether scd14 or scd83 could modulate neonatal allergen-induced t-cell differentiation, dc were exposed to birch allergen alone or in the presence of scd14 or scd83 and then cocultured with autologous t cells. we demonstrate that scd14 and scd83 inhibited the birch  allergen-induced th2 differentiation by suppressing interleukin 13 production. together, these results suggest that the commensal intestinal flora may be an important stimulus for the developing immune system by inducing the immunoregulatory proteins scd14 and scd83, which may be involved in preventing t-cell sensitization to allergens in infants.

TI  == mutational analysis of the ompa promoter from flavobacterium johnsoniae.
AB  == sequences that mediate the initiation of transcription in flavobacterium species  are not well known. the majority of identified flavobacterium promoter elements show homology to those of other members of the phylum bacteroidetes, but not of proteobacteria, and they function poorly in escherichia coli. in order to analyze the flavobacterium promoter structure systematically, we investigated the -33 consensus element, -7 consensus element, and spacer length of the flavobacterium  ompa promoter by measuring the effects of site-directed mutations on promoter activity. the nonconserved sequences in the spacer region and in regions close to the consensus motifs were randomized in order to determine their importance for promoter activity. most of the base substitutions in these regions caused large decreases in promoter activity. the optimal -33/-7 motifs (tttg/tanntttg) were identical to bacteroides fragilis sigma(abfr) consensus -33/-7 promoter elements  but lacked similarity to the e. coli sigma(70) promoter elements. the length of the spacer separating the -33 and -7 motifs of the ompa promoter also had a pronounced effect on promoter activity, with 19 bp being optimal. in addition to  the consensus promoter elements and spacer length, the gc content of the core promoter sequences had a pronounced effect on flavobacterium promoter activity. this information was used to conduct a scan of the flavobacterium johnsoniae and  b. fragilis genomes for putative promoters, resulting in 188 hits in b. fragilis  and 109 hits in f. johnsoniae.

AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == randomized, multicenter, double-blind study of efficacy, safety, and tolerability of intravenous ertapenem versus piperacillin/tazobactam in treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections in hospitalized adults.
AB  == background: complicated intra-abdominal infections are a common problem in surgical practice. this study compared the effectiveness of ertapenem (1 g qd) and piperacillin/tazobactam (3.375 g q6h) in the treatment of these infections. methods: this was a multicenter, double-blinded, randomized study conducted in patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections. of the 535 patients screened, 500 were stratified on the basis of disease severity (acute physiology  and chronic health evaluation [apache] ii score < or =10 or >10), then randomized (1:1) to 4-14 days of treatment with one of the regimens and six weeks of followup. nearly all patients (n = 494) were treated. the primary endpoint was the proportion of microbiologically evaluable patients with a favorable clinical  response (cure) at two weeks. non-inferiority of ertapenem was based on a difference in response rate of <15 percentage points compared with piperacillin/tazobactam (lower bound of the 95% ci > -15). results: of the 494 treated patients, 231 were microbiologically evaluable, with 123 and 108 patients in the ertapenem and piperacillin/tazobactam groups, respectively. statistically  similar cure rates were observed in the ertapenem (82.1%) and piperacillin/tazobactam (81.7%) groups (difference 0.3 [95% ci: -9.6, 10.5]). the pathogens isolated most frequently were escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, and bacteroides thetaiotamicron, typical isolates associated with intra-abdominal infections. there were no statistical differences between the groups in serious drug-related clinical adverse events, drug-related clinical adverse experiences leading to study discontinuation, or mortality. conclusions: ertapenem was non-inferior to piperacillin/tazobactam in the cure of intra-abdominal infections caused by susceptible pathogens. both study drugs generally were well tolerated.

TI  == luminex detection of fecal indicators in river samples, marine recreational water, and beach sand.
AB  == research to understand and remediate coastal pollution is moving toward a multitiered approach in which traditional enumeration of fecal indicators is accompanied by molecular analysis of a variety of targets. technology that rapidly detects multiple microbial contaminants would benefit from such an approach. the luminex 100 system is a suspension array that assays multiple analytes rapidly in a single well of a microtiter plate. the ability of the system to simultaneously detect multiple fecal indicating bacteria in environmental samples was tested. primer/probe sets were designed to simultaneously detect the following fecal indicators: the bacteroides fragilis group, enterococcus spp., escherichia coli and shigella spp., bacteroides distasonis, and ent. faecalis. specificity and sensitivity of the luminex probes  was tested against laboratory cultures. in addition, sequencing, culture plate testing, and specificity testing with environmental isolates were steps taken to  validate the function of the assay with environmental samples. luminex response to cultures and to environmental samples was consistent with sequencing results,  suggesting that the technology has the potential to simultaneously detect multiple targets for coastal water quality applications, particularly as progress is made to efficiently extract dna from water and sediment matrices.

TI  == antagonic effect of the inhibition of inducible nitric oxide on the mortality of  mice acutely infected with escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == sepsis, the leading cause of death in intensive care units, is associated with overproduction of nitric oxide (no) due to inducible no synthase (inos), responsible for some of the pathologic changes. aminoguanidine (ag) is a selective inos inhibitor with reported inconsistent actions in sepsis. to investigate the influence of inos, we studied models of acute bacterial sepsis using acute challenges with aerobic (escherichia coli) and anaerobic (bacteroides fragilis) bacteria in the presence of ag. six-week-old, 23 g, male and female balb/c and c57bl/6j mice, in equal proportions, were inoculated (ip) with bacteria in groups of 4 animals for each dose and each experiment in the absence  or presence of ag (50 mg/kg, ip, starting 24 h before challenge and daily until day 6) and serum nitrate was measured by chemiluminescence. both types of bacteria were lethal to mice, with an ld50 of 6 nephelometric units (u) for e. coli and 8 u for b. fragilis. nitrate production peaked on the second day after e. coli inoculation with 8 and 6 u (p < 0.05), but was absent after non-lethal lower doses. after challenge with b. fragilis this early peak occurred at all tested doses after 24 h, including non-lethal ones (p < 0.05). ag-treated mice challenged with e. coli presented higher survival (p < 0.05) and increased ld50.  ag-treated mice challenged with b. fragilis had lower ld50 and higher mortality.  control ag-treated animals presented no toxic effects. the opposite effect of inos blockade by ag in these models could be explained by restriction of oxygen for immune cells or an efficient action of no in anaerobic localized infections.  the antagonic role of no production observed in our bacterial models could explain the reported discrepancy of no action in sepsis.

TI  == bacterial pathogens associated with secondary peritonitis in lagos university teaching hospital (luth).
AB  == secondary peritonitis is a common and serious form of intra-abdominal infection,  often associated with high morbidity and mortality. the overall patient outcome has not markedly improved in spite of advances in patient management. there is therefore need to study the pattern of bacterial pathogens associated with secondary peritonitis in lagos university teaching hospital (luth) and the antibiotic susceptibility pattern as that would help in formulation of empiric antibiotic policy on peritonitis and improve the outcome/prognosis of the patients. a prospective study of 35 patients with suspected peritonitis at luth between february, 2002 and june 2003 was done. peritoneal fluids of these patients were collected intra-operatively under aseptic conditions. the specimens were subjected to aerobic and anaerobic studies. twenty-seven isolates were identified aerobically with escherichia coli being the most predominant organism  11 (31.4%) followed by staphylococcus aureus 6 (17.1%) then klebsiella spp 4 (11.4%). anaerobic culture showed prevotella species as the most predominant 14 (40%) followed by bacteroides fragilis group 8 (22.9%). overall, prevotella species were the most predominant organisms isolated in luth patients with secondary peritonitis.

AB  == the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the subgingival aerobic and  anaerobic flora of 13 dogs with periodontal disease and the susceptibility of these bacteria to antibiotics currently approved in italy for treatment of canine infections. of the anaerobic bacteria, bacteroides fragilis was most frequently isolated, followed by peptostreptococcus + porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. of the aerobic bacteria, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus was most frequently isolated, often associated with escherichia coli or pasteurella multocida. resistance of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria to various antibiotics was generally high. anaerobic bacteria appeared to be susceptible to amoxicillin  + clavulanic acid, doxycycline, and erythromycin; aerobic bacteria appeared to be susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, erythromycin, gentamycin, and sulfa-trimethoprim. bacteroides fragilis was resistant to all of the antibiotics  tested. the emerging worldwide problem of bacterial resistance to antibiotics resulting from overuse and misuse of antibiotics is discussed.

TI  == [the presence of bacteriophages in human feces and their potential importance].
AB  == bacteriophages are widely distributed throughout the environment as well as in the bodies of humans and animals (feces, urine, saliva, sputum). higher presence  of escherichia coli phages compared with bacteroides fragilis and salmonella phages was noticed in the feces of healthy human individuals and patients, mainly those with gastro-intestinal tract diseases. a strict correlation exists between  the number of bacteria and of phages in the feces of healthy individuals as well  as of patients with different diseases. the presence of phages in human feces correlates with the character of the coexisting disease. the frequency of phages  in the feces depends on the different indicator bacterial host strains and the numbers of indicator strains. the role of bacteriophages in protecting against pathogenic microorganisms and controlling bacterial flora in the human organism is of major significance.

TI  == non-enterobacterial endotoxins stimulate human coronary artery but not venous endothelial cell activation via toll-like receptor 2.
AB  == objective: to determine whether non-enterobacterial endotoxins, which are likely  to constitute the majority of the circulating endotoxin pool, may stimulate coronary artery endothelial cell activation. methods and results: interleukin-8 secretion, monocyte adhesion, and e-selectin expression were measured in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvecs) and coronary artery endothelial cells (hcaecs) challenged in vitro with highly purified endotoxins of common host colonisers escherichia coli, porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis. hcaecs but not huvecs expressed toll-like receptor (tlr)-2 and were responsive to non-enterobacterial endotoxins. transfection of tlr-deficient hek-293 cells with tlr2 or tlr4/md2 revealed that while e. coli endotoxin utilised solely tlr4 to signal, the endotoxins, deglycosylated endotoxins (lipid-a), and whole heat-killed bacteria of the other species stimulated tlr2-but not tlr4-dependent cell-signalling. blockade of tlr2 with neutralizing antibody prevented hcaec activation by non-enterobacterial endotoxins. comparison of each endotoxin with e. coli endotoxin in limulus amoebocyte lysate assay revealed that the non-enterobacterial endotoxins are greatly underestimated by this assay, which has been used in all previous studies to estimate plasma endotoxin concentrations. conclusion: circulating non-enterobacterial endotoxins may be an underestimated contributor to endothelial activation and atherosclerosis in individuals at risk of increased plasma endotoxin burden.

TI  == tissue-type plasminogen activator prevents formation of intra-abdominal abscesses after surgical treatment of secondary peritonitis in a rat model.
AB  == background: optimal therapy of secondary peritonitis frequently results in the formation of residual abscesses, which bear a substantial mortality and morbidity. this study aims to prove that fibrinolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtpa) can reduce abscess formation after surgical treatment of secondary peritonitis in a rat model, without causing unwanted side  effects. materials and methods: male wistar rats received an intra-abdominal injection with a suspension of sterile feces, 10(5) cfu escherichia coli and 10(4) cfu bacteroides fragilis. surgical debridement was performed 1 h after inoculation. animals were randomized into four groups (n = 14 each). three groups received human rtpa at 1 h (rtpa1); 1 h and 6 h (rtpa2); and 1, 6, and 24 h (rtpa3), respectively. each dose contained 1.25 mg rtpa. controls received saline only. animals were killed after 5 days. results: rtpa treatment reduced abscess formation in surviving animals, depending on number of doses given. animals in group rtpa3 had no abscesses in contrast to 88% of the controls (mean 3.6 +/- 2.7 abscesses per rat; p < 0.05). in the rtpa1 and rtpa2 group, frequency of abscess  formation was 58 and 33%, respectively. mortality, course of body weight, and bacteremia were not affected by rtpa and neither were peritoneal cell counts and  levels of tnf-alpha, il-1beta, il-6 and il-10. no bleeding complications were observed. conclusion: rtpa reduces intra-abdominal abscess formation after surgical treatment of generalized peritonitis without increasing mortality or affecting the local inflammatory response.

TI  == bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. it is active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. the aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers  and non-producers). gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteroides fragilis. ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs). killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the  first few hours of the kinetic curves against e. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) reduction in the first 2h), b. fragilis (4 log(10) cfu reduction in 4h), mssa (3 log(10) cfu reduction in 4-6h), k. ozaenae (esbl+), k. pneumoniae (esbl+ and -), e. cloacae (esbl-) in 1h and p. mirabilis (esbl+) in the first 2h. the potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of e. coli-b. fragilis and e. coli-b. fragilis-e. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of s. aureus-p. mirabilis. these results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == a peritonitis model with low mortality and persisting intra-abdominal abscesses.
AB  == intra-abdominal abscesses are a potential source of recurrent or residual infection after surgical intervention for secondary peritonitis. the development  of therapies requires a model which combines low mortality with the formation of  persisting abscesses and which is also suitable to study the local inflammatory response. male wistar rats were injected intraperitoneally with a mixture of sterile rat faeces, increasing doses of e. coli (10(4)-10(8) cfu/ml) and a fixed  dose of b. fragilis (10(4) cfu/ml). after one h a laparotomy was performed and the peritoneal cavity was debrided. blood samples were taken under anaesthesia after 6 and 24 h. abdominal fluid samples were collected (by laparotomy) after 24 and 72 h. the rats were killed after 5 days and the abdomen was inspected for abscesses. mortality was 90% in the two groups with the highest doses of e. coli  and 30% in those with the two lowest doses. in the latter groups all surviving rats but one showed intraabdominal abscesses and bacteremia was encountered frequently, especially after 24 h in the 10(5) cfu e. coli group. the groups receiving 10(4)-10(6) cfu e. coli showed similar plasma il-6 concentrations after 6 h which were lowered significantly after 24 h. no circulating tnf-alpha was found. considerable concentrations of tnf-alpha, il-6, il-1beta, and il-10, were  found in the peritoneal fluid after 24 h but no differences were observed between the contro groups and those receiving 10(4)-10(6) cfu e. coli. at 72 h cytokine levels were reduced significantly and remained the highest in the animals dosed with 10(6) cfu e. coli. the present model is suitable to study the mechanisms involved in, and prevention of, intra-abdominal abscess formation after surgical  treatment of generalized peritonitis.

TI  == dna microarray for detection of macrolide resistance genes.
AB  == a dna microarray was developed to detect bacterial genes conferring resistance to macrolides and related antibiotics. a database containing 65 nonredundant genes selected from publicly available dna sequences was constructed and used to design 100 oligonucleotide probes that could specifically detect and discriminate all 65 genes. probes were spotted on a glass slide, and the array was reacted with dna templates extracted from 20 reference strains of eight different bacterial species (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, and bacteroides fragilis) known to harbor 29 different macrolide resistance genes. hybridization results showed that probes reacted with, and only with, the expected dna templates and allowed discovery of three unexpected genes, including msr(sa) in b. fragilis, an efflux gene that has not yet been described for gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == bacteroides species produce vibrio harveyi autoinducer 2-related molecules.
AB  == quorum sensing is a density-dependent gene regulation mechanism that has been described in many bacterial species in the last decades. bacteria that use quorum sensing as part of their gene regulation circuits produce molecules called autoinducers that accumulate in the environment and activate target genes in a quorum-dependent way. some specific clues led us to hypothesize that bacteroides  species can produce autoinducers and possess a quorum sensing system. first, bacteroides are anaerobic bacteria that are frequently involved in polymicrobial  infections. these infections often involve pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, two of the best understood examples of bacteria that employ quorum sensing systems as part of their pathogenesis. also, studies have detected the presence of a quorum sensing gene involved in the production of autoinducers in porphyromonas gingivalis, a species closely related to the bacteroides genus. these and other evidences prompted us to investigate if bacteroides strains could produce autoinducer molecules that could be detected by a vibrio harveyi reporter system. in this paper, we show that supernatants of b.  fragilis, b. vulgatus and b. distasonis strains are able to stimulate the v. harveyi quorum sensing system 2. also, we were able to demonstrate that the stimulation detected is due to the production of autoinducer molecules and not the growth of reporter strains after addition of supernatant. moreover, the phenomenon observed does not seem to represent the degradation of repressors possibly present in the culture medium used. we could also amplify bands from some of the strains tested using primers designed to the luxs gene of escherichia coli. altogether, our results show that b. fragilis, b. vulgatus and b. distasonis (but possibly some other species) can produce v. harveyi autoinducer 2-related molecules. however, the role of such molecules in the biology of these  organisms remains unknown.

TI  == anti-lipopolysaccharide antibodies in acute appendicitis detected by elisa.
AB  == in acute appendicitis the bowel transmissibility of the intestinal flora increases in relation to inflammation and edema formation. we can therefore observe an immunologic response in patients, which is detectable using different  bacteria isolated from the normal intestinal flora. our aim was to measure this immunologic reaction and to detect the relationship between this response and histologic types of acute appendicitis. sera from 47 cases, comprising 38 patients suffering from appendicitis and 9 healthy controls, were examined. the sera were taken shortly before appendectomy and 14 days after operation. the antigens were lipopolysaccharides (lps) extracted from bacteria of normal intestinal flora: escherichia coli o21, o22, o33, o61, o68, bacteroides fragilis  and an absolute rough mutant: shigella sonnei re 4350. antibodies were detected by elisa. we showed a direct relationship between severity of appendicitis and registered antibody titer. both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria play a role in infection in appendicitis. according to our serologic results the synergy of b. fragilis with e. coli from normal flora is more important in the initiation of inflammation, but in the perforation process the role of e. coli seems more important compared to that of b. fragilis.

TI  == efficacy and safety of ertapenem versus piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections requiring surgical intervention.
AB  == complicated intra-abdominal infections usually mandate prompt surgical intervention supplemented by appropriate antimicrobial therapy. the aim of this study was to demonstrate that ertapenem was not inferior to piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of community-acquired intra-abdominal infections. a randomized open-label active-comparator clinical trial was conducted at 48 medical centers on four continents from december 2001 to february 2003. adult patients with intra-abdominal infections requiring surgery were randomized to receive either ertapenem 1 g daily or piperacillin/tazobactam 13.5  g daily in 3-4 divided doses. the primary analysis of efficacy was the clinical response rate in clinically and microbiologically evaluable patients at the test-of-cure assessment 2 weeks after completion of therapy. all treated patients were included in the safety analysis. patient demographics, disease characteristics, and treatment duration in both treatment groups were generally similar. the most commonly isolated pathogens at baseline were e coli (greater than 50% of cases in each group) and b fragilis ( approximately 9%). favorable clinical response rates were 107/119 (90%) for ertapenem recipients and 107/114 (94%) for piperacillin/tazobactam recipients. the frequencies of drug-related adverse events, most commonly diarrhea and elevated serum alanine aminotransferase levels, were similar in both treatment groups. six of 180 ertapenem recipients (3%) and two of 190 piperacillin/tazobactam recipients (1%)  had serious drug-related adverse experiences. in this study, ertapenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were comparably safe and effective treatments for adult patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == the use of bacteriophages for monitoring the microbiological quality of sewage sludge.
AB  == the use of bacteriophages as potential indicators of faecal pollution has recently been studied. the correlation of the number of bacterial indicators and  the presence of three groups of bacteriophages, namely somatic coliphages (somcph), f-rna specific phages (frnaph) and phages of bacteroides fragilis (bfrph), in raw and treated sludge is presented in this study. raw and anaerobically digested sewage sludge samples from two wastewater treatment plants in athens were collected on a monthly basis, over a 2-year period, and analyzed for total coliforms, e. coli, intestinal enterococci and the three groups of bacteriophages. a clear correlation between the number of bacterial indicators and the presence of bacteriophages was observed. e. coli concentrations of > or =10(3) cfus g(-1) and <10(3) cfus g(-1) comprise a threshold for the presence of  frnaph and bfrph, respectively. likewise, intestinal enterococci concentrations of > or =10(4) cfus g(-1) and <10(3) cfus g(-1) comprise a threshold for the presence of frnaph and bfrph, respectively. in the case of somcph, it was not possible to define a threshold, since they were detected with the lowest observed indicator concentrations in all samples.

TI  == characterization of bacteroides fragilis hemolysins and regulation and synergistic interactions of hlya and hlyb.
AB  == this study describes the presence of 10 hemolysin orthologs in the genome of the  opportunistic human anaerobic pathogen bacteroides fragilis, which is currently classified as a nonhemolytic bacterium. the hemolysins were designated hlya through hlyi plus hlyiii. all cloned hemolysin genes were able to confer hemolytic activity to a nonhemolytic escherichia coli strain on blood agar plates. interestingly, hlyh was found to be present in the genome of the b. fragilis nctc9343 strain but absent in strains 638r, ych46, and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron vpi-5482. the hemolysins hlya, hlyb, and hlyiii were selected for further characterization. hlya, hlyb, and hlyiii were cytolytic to erythrocytes on liquid hemolytic assay. when hlya and hlyb were expressed together in a nonhemolytic e. coli strain, the strain showed enhanced hemolytic activity on blood agar plates. further analysis revealed that hlya and hlyb have  synergistic hemolytic activity as detected by the liquid hemolytic assay. in addition, the two-component hemolysins hlya and hlyb form a protein-protein complex in vivo as determined by bacterial two-hybrid system assay. the hlyb and  hlya genes are organized in an operon that is coordinately regulated by iron and  oxygen. northern blot hybridization analysis revealed that hlyba were expressed as a bicistronic mrna induced approximately 2.5-fold under low-iron conditions and repressed in iron-rich medium. the normal iron-regulated expression of hlyba  mrna was lost in the fura mutant strain. in contrast, the hlya gene was also expressed as a single mrna in iron-rich medium, but its expression was reduced approximately threefold under low-iron conditions in a fur-independent manner. this suggests that hlya alone is regulated by an unidentified iron-dependent regulator. moreover, the expression levels of hlyba and hlya were reduced about threefold following oxygen exposure and treatment with hydrogen peroxide. taken together, these results suggest that iron and oxidative stress have an effect on  the control of hlyba and hlya transcriptional levels. a hlyba mutant was constructed, and its hemolytic activity was greatly diminished compared to those  of the hlyiii mutant and parent strains. in addition, the hlyba mutant had a significant modification in colony morphology and growth deficiency compared to the parent strain. the implications of these findings for the pathophysiology of  b. fragilis in extraintestinal infections and competition in ecological systems for this organism are discussed.

TI  == neutropenia induced in outbred mice by a simplified low-dose cyclophosphamide regimen: characterization and applicability to diverse experimental models of infectious diseases.
AB  == background: for its low cost and ease of handling, the mouse remains the preferred experimental animal for preclinical tests. to avoid the interaction of  the animal immune system, in vivo antibiotic pharmacodynamic studies often employ cyclophosphamide (cpm) to induce neutropenia. although high doses (350-450 mg/kg) are still used and their effects on mouse leukocytes have been described, a lower dose (250 mg/kg) is widely preferred today, but the characteristics and applicability of this approach in outbred mice have not been determined. methods: fifteen female icr mice were injected intraperitoneally with 150 and 100 mg/kg of cpm on days 1 and 4, respectively. blood samples (approximately 160 microl) were  drawn from the retro-orbital sinus of each mouse on days 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 11. leukocytes were counted manually and the number of granulocytes was based on microscopic examination of wright-stained smears. the impact of neutropenia induced by this method was then determined with a variety of pathogens in three different murine models of human infections: pneumonia (klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus), meningoencephalitis (s. pneumoniae), and the thigh model (s. aureus, escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis). results: the basal count of leukocytes was within the normal range for outbred mice. on day 4, there was an 84% reduction in total white blood cells, and by day 5 the leukopenia reached its nadir (370 +/- 84 cells/mm3). profound neutropenia (< or =10 neutrophils/mm3) was demonstrated at day 4 and persisted through days 5 and 6. lymphocytes and monocytes had a 92% and 96% decline between days 1 and 5, respectively. leukocytes recovered completely by day 11. mice immunosupressed under this protocol displayed clinical and microbiological patterns of progressive and lethal infectious diseases after inoculation in different organs with diverse human pathogens. conclusion: a cpm total dose of 250 mg/kg is sufficient to induce profound and sustained neutropenia (<10 neutrophils/mm3) at least during 3 days in outbred mice, is simpler than previously described methods, and allows successful induction of infection in a variety of experimental models.

TI  == hepatic growth hormone resistance during sepsis is associated with increased suppressors of cytokine signaling expression and impaired growth hormone signaling.
AB  == objective: during sepsis, a two- to four-fold increase in circulating growth hormone (gh) is seen with 40-50% reductions in plasma insulin-like growth factor  (igf)-i. the suppressors of cytokine signaling (socs), inhibitors of cytokine, and growth factor signaling via the janus kinase (jak)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat) pathway have been implicated in the development of hepatic gh resistance. in this study we examine the effects of sepsis on gh-induced igf-i expression and potential mechanisms for gh resistance. design: prospective experimental study. setting: university research laboratory. subjects: male sprague-dawley rats. interventions: rats were randomized to laparotomy alone (control) or implantation of fecal agar pellets inoculated with  escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis (sepsis). gh was injected intravenously to assess hepatic igf-i synthesis and gh signaling. measurements and main results: plasma igf-i was measured in both groups at baseline (4 hrs postoperatively) and then again at 12 hrs and 24 hrs after gh administration. basal igf-i levels were similar in both groups, but controls had a 35% increase in igf-i at 12 hrs, whereas septic rats demonstrated reductions in circulating igf-i at 12 and 24 hrs after gh. hepatic expression of socs-1, -2, -3, and cytokine-inducible sh2-containing protein (cis) were determined at 1, 4, 8, and 24 hrs in septic and control rats by northern blot. socs-1, socs-3, and cis messenger rna in liver were increased from 4 to 8 hrs after the induction of sepsis (p < .05 for socs-1 and -3). total gh receptor (ghr), jak2, and stat5 signaling proteins and the time course of stat5 activation were also measured in  liver after recombinant human gh administration by immunoblot and electrophoretic mobility shift analysis. levels of total ghr, jak2, and stat5 were unaltered in liver from septic rats. however, phosphorylated stat5 and stat5 dna binding were  significantly reduced 30 mins after gh administration in liver from septic rats.  conclusions: sepsis diminished stat5 phosphorylation and activity in liver as well as plasma igf-i following gh administration. hepatic messenger rna expression of socs-1, socs-3, and cis was transiently increased during abdominal  sepsis and temporally associated with the development of hepatic gh resistance.

TI  == evaluation of microbiological quality of coastal waters in greece.
AB  == to evaluate the microbiological water quality of bathing sites along the achaia coastline (south western greece), a survey was conducted to determine the concentration of faecal bacterial and phage indicators as well as the presence of human viruses. seawater samples (234) were collected from nine bathing sites on the achaia coastline and were analysed for the presence of: total coliforms, faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci, escherichia coli, somatic coliphages, f-rna bacteriophages, bacteriophages infecting bacteroides fragilis, enteroviruses, adenoviruses and hepatitis a viruses. most of the bacteriological  analysis results were in accordance with the european union standards. in all sites, bacteriophages were detected occasionally. enteroviruses and adenoviruses  were detected in 24 samples (10.26%) and 37 samples (15.81%) respectively. no samples were positive for the presence of hepatitis a virus. the overall data indicates that bathing sites are impacted by human faecal material. both bacterial indicators and phages have low predictive capability for the presence of human viruses in coastal waters. none of the environmental parameters analysed was strongly related to the presence of the indicator organisms and viruses. appropriate and effective administrative measures that should be taken into account may be considered in order to improve water quality and reduce public health risk.

TI  == etiology and epidemiology of diarrhea in children in hanoi, vietnam.
AB  == objectives: this paper provides a preliminary picture of diarrhea with regards to etiology, clinical symptoms, and some related epidemiologic factors in children less than five years of age living in hanoi, vietnam. methods: the study population included 587 children with diarrhea and 249 age-matched healthy controls. the identification of pathogens was carried out by the conventional methods in combination with elisa, immunoseparation, and pcr. the antibiotic susceptibility was determined by mic following the nccls recommendations. results: of those with diarrhea, 40.9% were less than one year old and 71.0% were less than two years old. a potential pathogen was identified in 67.3% of children with diarrhea. they were group a rotavirus, diarrheagenic escherichia coli, shigella spp, and enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, with prevalences of 46.7%, 22.5%, 4.7%, and 7.3%, respectively. no salmonella spp or vibrio cholerae  were isolated. rotavirus and diarrheagenic e. coli were predominant in children less than two years of age, while shigella spp, and enterotoxigenic b. fragilis were mostly seen in the older children. diarrheagenic e. coli and shigella spp showed high prevalence of resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. children attending the hospitals had fever (43.6%), vomiting (53.8%), and dehydration (82.6%). watery stool was predominant  with a prevalence of 66.4%, followed by mucous stool (21.0%). the mean episodes of stools per day was seven, ranging from two to 23 episodes. before attending hospitals, 162/587 (27.6%) children had been given antibiotics. overall, more children got diarrhea in (i) poor families; (ii) families where piped water and a latrine were lacking; (iii) families where mothers washed their hands less often  before feeding the children; (iv) families where mothers had a low level of education; (v) families where information on health and sanitation less often reached their households. conclusions: group a rotavirus, diarrheagenic escherichia coli, shigella spp, and enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis play an  important role in causing diarrhea in children in hanoi, vietnam. epidemiological factors such as lack of fresh water supply, unhygienic septic tank, low family income, lack of health information, and low educational level of parents could contribute to the morbidity of diarrhea in children.

TI  == immune-enhancing diet and cytokine expression during chronic sepsis: an immune-enhancing diet containing l-arginine, fish oil, and rna fragments promotes intestinal cytokine expression during chronic sepsis in rats.
AB  == chronic feeding with enteral immune-enhancing diets (ieds) provides benefits based on composition of the diet, route of feeding, and timing of feeding in relation to timing of trauma or surgery. our prior studies of acute feeding in naive rats demonstrated that ied promotes blood flow and proinflammatory cytokines in the ileum. we hypothesized that chronic feeding with ied would shift gut immune status to an anti-inflammatory state during chronic sepsis, resulting  in an altered state of cytokine expression in the gut. five days prior to feeding, gauze was implanted subcutaneously in the backs of male sprague-dawley rats, which were fed for 3 days with either control diet (cd, boost; mead-johnson, evansville, il) or ied (impact; novartis) and randomly assigned to  one of four groups: saline control (ns) + control diet (cd), sepsis (ec) + cd, ns + ied, or ec + ied. ec rats were inoculated with 10(9) cfu escherichia coli and 10(9) cfu bacteroides fragilis in 2 ml normal saline into the back sponge while ns rats received 2 ml normal saline alone. after 3 days, animals were anesthetized and gut tissue samples were harvested and frozen at -80 degrees c. tissue protein was extracted and elisa was performed for interleukin (il-1beta, il-5, il-6, il-10, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and interferon (ifn)-gamma. in saline controls, ied feeding decreased il-1beta, il-5, il-6, tnf-alpha, and ifn-gamma and increased il-10 compared with cd-fed animals. in septic animals, ied feeding increased il-5 and il-6, while decreasing ifn-gamma and il-10 in the  distal third of the small intestine compared with cd-fed septic rats, whereas il-1beta and tnf-alpha levels were unchanged. chronic ied feeding produced a anti-inflammatory state via decreased ifn-gamma and increased il-5 and il-6, which both promote gut iga class switching, suggesting that the gut is shifted toward humoral immunity during chronic ied feeding in septic rats.

TI  == bacteroides fragilis mobilizable transposon tn5520 requires a 71 base pair origin of transfer sequence and a single mobilization protein for relaxosome formation during conjugation.
AB  == tn5520 is the smallest known bacterial mobilizable transposon and was isolated from an antibiotic resistant bacteroides fragilis clinical isolate. when a conjugation apparatus is provided in trans, tn5520 is mobilized (transferred) efficiently within, and from, both bacteroides spp. and escherichia coli. only two genes are present on tn5520; one encodes an integrase, and the other a multifunctional mobilization (mob) protein bmph. bmph is essential for tn5520 mobility. the focus of this study was to identify the tn5520 origin of conjugative transfer (orit) and to study bmph-orit binding. we delimited the functional tn5520 orit to a 71 bp sequence upstream of the bmph gene. a plasmid vector harbouring this minimal 71 bp orit was mobilized at the same frequency as  that of intact tn5520. the minimal orit contains one 17 bp inverted repeat (ir) sequence. we constructed and tested multiple ir mutants and showed that the ir was essential in its entirety for mobilization. a nick site sequence (5'-gctac-3') was also identified within the minimal orit; this sequence resembled nick sites found in plasmids of gram positive origin. we further showed that mutation of a highly conserved gc dinucleotide in the nick site sequence completely abolished mobilization. we also purified bmph and showed that it specifically bound a tn5520 orit fragment in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. we also identified non-nick site sequences within the minimal orit that were essential for mobilization. we hypothesize that transposon-based single mob  protein systems may contribute to efficient gene dissemination from bacteroides spp., because fewer dna processing proteins are required for relaxosome formation.

TI  == [therapeutic management of peritonitis].
AB  == antibiotherapy is a fundamental for the treatment of peritonitis. it may be used  before surgery or as a complementary treatment after. experimental models have demonstrated that infections are both aerobic and anaerobic. during the first stage, septicemic with a high death rate, the infection is due to enterobacteria, mostly escherichia coli. between d5 and d7 in surviving animals, there is a second stage with abscesses due to anaerobic bacteria, mostly bacteroides fragilis. the antibiotic treatment must include these two types of bacteria in its spectrum. the role of enterococcus faecalis is not clearly defined, but this  bacterium must be taken into account in case of organ failure or associated septic shock. treatment options for secondary peritonitis may be, according to severity, cefoxitin, an augmentin + gentamycin combination, tazocillin, or ertapenem. the reference treatment for nosocomial or tertiary peritonitis is the  imipenem + amikacin combination. an antifungal treatment (fluconazole) is usually necessary, at least until the results of peritoneal fluid culture are available.  the duration of treatment is quite variable, ranging from 48 h in less severe forms to 14 days.

AB  == an evaluation of the microbiota present in cutaneous ulcers from 31 patients with a clinical and parasitological diagnosis of american tegumentary leishmaniasis (atl) was carried out by the standard filter paper disc technique, including antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterial isolates. microbial examination indicated that 21 patients (67.7%) were contaminated with one to four bacteria and some of them also with yeast. a total of 142 micro-organisms were isolated. staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently recovered bacterium (95.2% of positive patients) and was found to produce type b (70% of the staphylococcal isolates) and type c (50%) enterotoxins as well as toxic shock syndrome toxin (60%). proteus mirabilis (33.3% of the positive patients), streptococcus pyogenes (19.0 %), h(2)s-negative proteus species (19.0%), klebsiella oxytoca (14.3%), enterobacter species (9.5%), peptostreptococcus species (9.5%), pseudomonas species (4.8%), prevotella bivia (4.8%), escherichia coli (4.8%), streptococcus agalactiae (4.8%), bacteroides fragilis (4.8%), candida albicans (9.5%) and candida tropicalis (4.8%) were also isolated. surprisingly, staph. aureus isolates were susceptible to almost all tested drugs, although some of them were  resistant to penicillin (69%) and ampicillin + sulbactam (68%). concerning obligate anaerobes, all the gram-negative isolates (25% of the total) were resistant to metronidazole. the results of the present study show that microbial  secondary contaminants, particularly staph. aureus, should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of atl lesions.

AB  == in this study penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of bacteroides fragilis and the  resistance mechanisms of this micro-organism to 11 beta-lactam antibiotics were analysed. the study focused on the role of pbp2bfr and metallo-beta-lactamase in  the mechanism of resistance to imipenem. the mechanism of beta-lactam resistance  in b. fragilis was strain dependent. the gene encoding the orthologue of escherichia coli pbp3 gene (pbpbbfr, which encodes the protein pbp2bfr) was sequenced in five of the eight strains studied, along with the ccra (cfia) gene in strain 119, and their implications for resistance were examined. differences were found in the amino-acid sequence of pbp2bfr in strains ak-2 and 119, and the production of beta-lactamases indicated that these differences may be involved in the mechanism of resistance to imipenem. in vitro binding competition assays with membrane extracts using imipenem indicated that the pbp that bound imipenem with  the highest affinity was pbp2bfr, and that increased affinity in strain 7160 may  be responsible for the moderate susceptibility of this strain to imipenem. in the same way, the importance of the chromosomal class a beta-lactamase cepa in the resistance mechanism of the b. fragilis strains nctc 9344, 7160, 2013e, ak-4, 0423 and r-212 was studied. in these strains this is the principal resistance mechanism to antimicrobial agents studied other than imipenem.

AB  == the antibacterial effects of moxifloxacin against bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac) were studied in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model. initially, a dose-ranging study with area under the concentration-time curve (auc)/mic ratios of 6.7 to 890 was used to investigate the effect of anaerobic conditions on the auc/mic antibacterial effect (abe) relationship with escherichia coli. the auc/mic ratios for 50% and 90% effects, using a log cfu drop at 24 h as the antibacterial effect measure, were 34 and 59, respectively, aerobic and 54 and 96, respectively, anaerobic. these values are not significantly different. dose ranging at auc/mic ratios of 9 to 216 against the anaerobes indicated a differing auc/mic abe pattern, and the auc/mics for 50% and 90% effects were lower: for b. fragilis, they were 10.5 and  25.7, respectively; for c. perfringens, they were 8.6 and 16.2; and for gpac, they were 7.3 and 17.4. the maximum-effect log drops were as follows: for b. fragilis, -3.2 +/- 0.2 logs; for c. perfringens, -3.7 +/- 0.1 logs; and for gpac, -2.5 +/- 0.1 logs. although the anaerobes were not eradicated, there was no emergence of resistance. comparison of the abe of moxifloxacin to that of ertapenem against b. fragilis indicated that moxifloxacin was superior at 24 h and 48 h. in contrast, ertapenem was superior to moxifloxacin against gpac at 24  h and 48 h and against c. perfringens at 48 h. both drugs performed equivalently  against c. perfringens at 24 h. monte carlo simulations using human serum auc data and an auc/mic anaerobe target of 7.5 suggests a >90% target achievement at  mics of <2 mg/liter. this divides the b. fragilis wild-type mic distribution. the pharmacodynamic properties of moxifloxacin against anaerobes are different than those against aerobic species. the clinical implications of these differences need further exploration.

TI  == comparative in vitro antimicrobial activity of a novel quinolone, garenoxacin, against aerobic and anaerobic microbial isolates recovered from general, vascular, cardiothoracic and otolaryngologic surgical patients.
AB  == objectives: the aim of the study was to analyse the susceptibility of unique and  non-duplicate aerobic and anaerobic isolates from surgical patients to a novel des-f(6)-quinolone (garenoxacin) and other selected antimicrobial agents. methods: eleven hundred and eighty-five aerobic and anaerobic isolates from general, vascular, cardiothoracic and otolaryngologic surgical patients were tested for susceptibility to garenoxacin and seven other antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole) using the referenced microbroth and agar-dilution  method. results: garenoxacin exhibited greater antimicrobial activity than comparator quinolones such as ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and other antimicrobials when tested against selected gram-positive organisms. the in vitro aerobic and anaerobic activity of garenoxacin was similar to that of moxifloxacin. all fluoroquinolones tested were effective against most gram-negative facultative anaerobes including escherichia coli. garenoxacin and moxifloxacin demonstrated similar in vitro antimicrobial activity against selected anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria such as members of the bacteroides fragilis group. overall, the in vitro activity of the  advanced spectrum quinolones against anaerobic surgical isolates compared favourably with selected comparator agents, metronidazole, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam. conclusions: these findings suggest that 82.4% of aerobic surgical isolates were susceptible to a concentration of garenoxacin < or = 1.0 mg/l, whereas 84.5% of the anaerobic isolates were susceptible to a garenoxacin concentration < or = 1.0 mg/l. garenoxacin may be a valuable surgical anti-infective for treatment of serious head and neck, soft tissue, intra-abdominal and diabetic foot infections.

TI  == [surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2003].
AB  == for the post-marketing surveillance of cefmetazole (cmz, cefmetazon), mics of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including cmz against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 574 isolates of 13 species were tested, 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002, and 654 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the third surveillance from april 2002 to march 2003. no remarkable changes in the activity of cmz were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. the activity of cmz in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before cefmetazon was launched. this result suggests that cmz still maintains potent activity. changes in percent resistance of each species to cmz (mic of cmz > or = 32 microg/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa, 0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 72.9% --> 87.2% --> 88.7%), staphylococcus epidermidis (18.5% --> 31.6% --> 14.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (cns, 13.3% --> 18.2% --> 21.4%), escherichia coli (3.6% -->  0.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 3.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella oxytoca (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), proteus mirabilis (2.3% --> 2.1% --> 0.0%), proteus vulgaris (13.6% --> 6.7% --> 0.0%), morganella morganii (7.3% --> 0.0% --> 14.0%), providencia spp. (12.5% --> 0.0% --> 18.2%), peptostreptococcus spp.  (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), bacteroides fragilis (10.3% --> 10.8% --> 17.1%), bacteroides spp. (78.6% --> 87.5% --> 62.5%). the change in percent resistance of mrsa, other cns, and b. flagiris tended to increase. it is necessary to pay much  attention to trends observed in these species. compared to other drugs tested, against mssa, the activity of cmz was inferior to that of cez, ctm, and fmox and  superior to that sbt/cpz. against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and cns, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and inferior to that of fmox. against b. flagiris and other bacteroides spp., the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and comparable to or inferior to that of sbt/cpz and fmox.

TI  == synergy in polymicrobial infections in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes.
AB  == human diabetics frequently suffer delayed wound healing, increased susceptibility to localized and systemic infections, and limb amputations as a consequence of the disease. lower-limb infections in diabetic patients are most often polymicrobial, involving mixtures of aerobic, facultative anaerobic, and anaerobic bacteria. the purpose of this study is to determine if these organisms  contribute to synergy in polymicrobial infections by using diabetic mice as an in vivo model. the model was the obese diabetic mouse strain bks.cg-m +/+ lepr(db)/j, a model of human type 2 diabetes. young (5- to 6-week-old) prediabetic mice and aged (23- to 24-week-old) diabetic mice were compared. the mice were injected subcutaneously with mixed cultures containing escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, and clostridium perfringens. progression of the infection (usually abscess formation) was monitored by examining mice for bacterial populations and numbers of white blood cells at 1, 8, and 22 days postinfection. synergy in the mixed infections was defined as a statistically significant increase in the number of bacteria at the site of injection when coinfected with a second bacterium, compared to when the bacterium was inoculated alone. e. coli provided strong synergy to b. fragilis but not to c. perfringens.  c. perfringens and b. fragilis provided moderate synergy to each other but only in young mice. b. fragilis was anergistic (antagonistic) to e. coli in coinfections in young mice at 22 days postinfection. when age-matched nondiabetic mice (c57blks/j) were used as controls, the diabetic mice exhibited 5 to 35 times the number of cfu as did the nondiabetic mice, indicating that diabetes was a significant factor in the severity of the polymicrobial infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against isolates from patients enrolled in phase 3 clinical trials of treatment for complicated skin and skin-structure infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections.
AB  == the in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against 4913 baseline pathogens isolated from 1986 patients enrolled in 4 pivotal phase 3 clinical trials. the trials, which were conducted in 38 countries worldwide, involved patients with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections. tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens for each infection type, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (mics, < or =2 microg/ml for most  pathogens). the spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant s. aureus), streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacteroides  fragilis. a few genera, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the tribe proteeae, were generally less susceptible to tigecycline than were other gram-negative pathogens. the susceptibility of the pathogens to tigecycline was similar for isolates obtained from patients enrolled in the studies of complicated skin and skin-structure infection or of complicated intra-abdominal infection. for most pathogens, the susceptibility to tigecycline was similar across all geographic regions. the excellent expanded broad-spectrum activity of  tigecycline demonstrated in vitro against clinical isolates confirmed its potential utility for pathogens associated with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == activity of moxifloxacin against bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli in an  in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model employing pure and mixed cultures.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine the pharmacodynamic (pd) activity of moxifloxacin against four selected bacteroides fragilis strains (three strains with low mics and one strain with a high mic) and two escherichia coli strains (one strain with a low mic and one strain with a high mic) in a pharmacokinetic (pk) in vitro model in pure cultures as well as in mixed cultures. pk/pd assays of moxifloxacin were carried out with an initial maximum concentration of 4.0 mg  l-1 and a half-life of 13 h. the e. coli strain with the low mic was rapidly killed in both pure and mixed cultures in the in vitro pk/pd model, while the e.  coli strain with the high mic was not killed. none of the b. fragilis strains were rapidly killed in pure or mixed cultures. the bacterial numbers of the b. fragilis strains with low mics were reduced by about one to two logs after 12 h in pure cultures. the presence of an e. coli strain with a low or a high mic in the mixed culture reduced this effect even further.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of competitive exclusion bacteria applied to newly hatched chickens.
AB  == competitive exclusion (ce) products are mixtures of obligate and facultative anaerobic bacteria applied to poultry hatchlings for prevention of salmonella colonization. these mixtures have the potential to introduce bacteria with undesirable antimicrobial drug resistance traits into the human food supply. antimicrobial drug susceptibilities of 27 obligate and facultative anaerobes isolated from a commercial ce product were evaluated with a microdilution minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) assay. bacteroides distasonis and bacteroides fragilis isolates were resistant to tetracycline and other antimicrobial drugs. an escherichia coli isolate was resistant to four antimicrobial drugs: erythromycin, penicillin, vancomycin, and tylosin. erythromycin-resistant enterococci and vancomycin-resistant lactococcus lactis isolates in the ce product were detected. these findings suggest that more work needs to be done to  assess the potential effects of ce product use in poultry on the food supply.

TI  == toll-like receptors-2, -3 and -4 expression patterns on human colon and their regulation by mucosal-associated bacteria.
AB  == the colonic epithelium provides an interface between the host and micro-organisms colonising the gastrointestinal tract. molecular recognition of bacteria is facilitated through toll-like receptors (tlr). the colonic epithelium expresses relatively high levels of mrna for tlr3 and less for tlr2 and -4. little is known of the expression patterns and mode of induction of expression for these pattern  recognition receptors in human colon. the aim of this study was to investigate their localization in the gut and induction of expression in epithelial cell lines by mucosal bacteria. tlr2 and -4 were expressed only in crypt epithelial cells, expression was lost as the cells matured and moved towards the gut lumen.  in contrast, tlr3 was only produced in mature epithelial cells. ht29 and caco-2 had different levels of expression for tlr1-4. co-culture of ht29 cells with different mucosal isolates showed that they were highly responsive to bacterial challenge, with up-regulation of mrna for tlr1-4. in contrast, caco-2 cells were  refractive to bacterial challenge, showing little difference in mrna levels. tlr3 was induced in ht29 only by gram-positive commensals with up-regulation of both mrna and protein and an enhancement of the antiviral immune response. this pattern of expression allows induction of responsiveness to bacteria only by the  crypt epithelium so that tolerance to commensal organisms can be maintained. in contrast, mature columnar epithelium is able to respond to viral pathogens, which are not part of the normal gut commensal microbiota.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2003  and march 2004].
AB  == tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from april 2003 to march 2004 were investigated in a multicenter study in  japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 455 strains including 14 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 191(75.2%) of 254 patients with surgical infections. two hundred and thirty-nine strains were isolated from primary infections, and 216 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-positive bacteria and aerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, while aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus spp. and staphylococcus aureus were higher from both types of infections. among anaerobic  gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, e. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. the isolation rate  of anaerobic gram-positive bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. in this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci, but a few strains of moderately arbekacin-resistant mrsa. carbapenm-resistant p. aeruginosa was seen in less than 10 per cents. last year we noticed that there were cefazolin-resistant e. coli producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase, but there was no highly cefazolin-resistant e. coli in this year. in the next series, increase of both anaerobic bacteria and enterococcus spp. should be carefully followed up.

TI  == sixteen homologs of the mex-type multidrug resistance efflux pump in bacteroides  fragilis.
AB  == sixteen homologs of multidrug resistance efflux pump operons of the resistance-nodulation-cell division (rnd) family were found in the bacteroides fragilis genome sequence by homology searches. disruption mutants were made to the mexb homologs of the four genes most similar to pseudomonas aeruginosa mexb.  reverse transcription-pcr was conducted and indicated that the genes were transcribed in a polycistronic fashion and that the promoter was upstream of bmea (the mexa homolog). one of these disruption mutants (in bmeb, the mexb homolog) was more susceptible than the parental strain to certain cephems, polypeptide antibiotics, fusidic acid, novobiocin, and puromycin. the gene for this homolog and the adjacent upstream gene, bmea, were cloned in a hypersensitive escherichia coli host. the resultant transformants carrying b. fragilis bmeab were more resistant to certain agents; these agents also had lower mics for the b. fragilis bmeb disruption mutants than for the parental strain. the putative efflux pump operon is composed of bmea, bmeb, and bmec (a putative outer membrane channel protein homologous with oprm). addition of the efflux pump inhibitors, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (a proton conductor that eliminates the energy source) and phe-arg beta-naphthylamide (mc-207,110) (the first specific inhibitor described for rnd pumps in p. aeruginosa), resulted in lowered mics in the parental strain but not in the bmeb disruption mutant, indicating that the bmeb pump is affected by these inhibitors. this is the first description of rnd type pumps in the genus bacteroides.

TI  == analysis of chromosomal insertion sites for bacteroides tn4555 and the role of tnpa.
AB  == tn4555, a mobilizable transposon carrying cefoxitin resistance, is directed to a  preferred target site in the bacteroides fragilis chromosome by a transposon-encoded targeting protein tnpa. in an effort to characterize target site selection for tn4555, the existence of preferred target sites in other species of bacteroides and in escherichia coli was examined. for these analyses a tn4555 mini element, pfd660, was transferred from e. coli donors to bacteroides thetaiotaomicron or bacteroides ovatus recipients and the resulting sites of insertion analyzed. a similar construct, pfd794 was used to determine insertion sites in e. coli, and preferred sites were found in all bacteria tested. also the ability of tnpa to bind to various targets was examined in mobility shift assays. although tnpa bound to all tested sequences, it displayed higher affinity for the target sites. the binding characteristics of tnpa and the lack of significant base sequence homology between targets suggested that secondary structure of the  sites was important for tnpa binding. circular permutation tests supported the idea that tnpa targets bent dna.

AB  == as part of a european project on bacteriophages in bathing waters two interlaboratory comparison studies were carried out (may 1997 and march 1998). during these studies phage reference materials as well as naturally polluted standard samples were analysed in 16 european laboratories. three groups of bacteriophages were tested using standardised methods: somatic coliphages, f-specific rna-phages and phages of bacteroides fragilis. many of the participating laboratories applied one or more of the phage methods for the first time, after a one-week training session in a central laboratory. nevertheless, the values of repeatability (r=1.35-1.38 calculated on log(10)-scale) and reproducibility (r=1.52-2.04 calculated on log(10)-scale) when analysing phage reference materials were close to the theoretical optimum for a poisson distribution. when analysing the naturally polluted samples more variation in results within and between laboratories was found (r=1.63-2.34; r=3.10-5.72), in  comparison with the results obtained with the pure phage reference materials.

TI  == an unusual primary sigma factor in the bacteroidetes phylum.
AB  == the presence of housekeeping gene promoters with a unique consensus sequence in bacteroides fragilis, previously described by bayley et al. (2000, fems microbiol lett 193: 149-154), suggested the existence of a particular primary sigma factor. the single rpod-like gene observed in the b. fragilis genome, and similarly in those of other members of the bacteroidetes phylum, was found to be essential. it encodes a protein, sigma(abfr), of only 32.7 kda that is produced with equal abundance during all phases of growth and was concluded to be the primary sigma factor. sigma(abfr) and its orthologues in the bacteroidetes are unusual primary  sigma factors in that they lack region 1.1, have a unique signature made up of 29 strictly identical amino acids and are the only rpod factors that cluster with the rpos factors. although binding to the escherichia coli core rna polymerase, sigma(abfr) does not support transcription initiation from any promoter when it is part of the heterologous holoenzyme, while in the reconstituted homologous holoenzyme it does so only from typical b. fragilis, including rrs, promoters but not from the lacuv5 or rna i promoters.

AB  == background: a considerable number of tests are recommended in the literature to evaluate in vitro commercial chemical solutions. the variety of tests reflects their limitations and the need to enhance disinfection process. methods: in this  study the efficacy of 4 chemical disinfectants selected by their practical use in health care services and by literature recommendation in aerobic and in strict anaerobic bacteria were evaluated by their practical use in health care services  and by literature recommendation in aerobic and in strict anaerobic bacteria. viability was tested in biofilms grown on glass and rubber tip carriers. results: the results showed microbial growth in chemical solutions at concentrations recommended by the literature or at very close concentrations to them. viable cells were recovered from biofilms after 30 minutes (bacteroides fragilis) and 60 minutes (streptococcus mutans and salmonella tiphymurium) contact with 2.4% glutaraldehyde and after 60 minutes (s tiphymurium) in 2.0% glutaraldehyde. in 70% ethyl alcohol, s tiphymurium was viable up to 10 minutes, escherichia coli up to 30 minutes, and s mutans up to 60 minutes. in 1% sodium hypochlorite, s mutans was viable up to 30 minutes and s tiphymurium up to 45 minutes. detection of cell viability could be related to methodologic differences, including biofilm formation, as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. it should be emphasized that b fragilis, the most clinically relevant obligate anaerobe, remained viable in one routinely used solution. conclusion: these findings pointed out the need of periodic surveillance of disinfectants' activity used in  health care services and the need of reviewing routines of disinfection protocols.

TI  == detection of microbial dna in the blood of surgical patients for diagnosing bacterial translocation.
AB  == bacterial translocation sometimes occurs in patients during surgical stress and is associated with an increased incidence of septic morbidity. however, no reliable method has been established for diagnosing bacterial translocation in humans. identification of minute quantities of microbial-specific dna has been made possible using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) techniques. the aims of this  study were to determine the prevalence of bacterial translocation in patients with surgical stress using pcr techniques and to evaluate the usefulness of blood pcr techniques for diagnosing bacterial translocation. dna was extracted from the blood of 52 surgical patients (24 elective major surgery patients and 28 septic patients) and 10 healthy controls. pcr techniques were used to amplify genes from escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, a region of 16s ribosomal rna found in many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and candida albicans. bacterial and candida albicans dna were not detected in healthy volunteers. enteric bacterial dna was detected in patients with hepatic lobectomy, and candida albicans dna was detected in patients with esophagectomy on the first postoperative day. enteric bacterial and candida albicans dna were detected in septic patients with findings diagnostic of bacterial translocation, such as small bowel obstruction, ulcerative colitis, or supramesenteric arterial occlusion or in those who had undergone chemotherapy for advanced colon cancer. however, none of the patients were positive by the blood culture technique. the pcr method is more sensitive than blood cultures for detecting bacterial components in the blood of septic patients and is a valuable tool for verifying bacterial translocation in patients who have undergone hepatic lobectomy or esophagectomy. it is also valuable in septic patients who do not have a defined focus of infection.

AB  == the obligately anaerobic bacterium bacteroides fragilis, an opportunistic pathogen and inhabitant of the normal human colonic microbiota, exhibits considerable within-strain phase and antigenic variation of surface components. the complete genome sequence has revealed an unusual breadth (in number and in effect) of dna inversion events that potentially control expression of many different components, including surface and secreted components, regulatory molecules, and restriction-modification proteins. invertible promoters of two different types (12 group 1 and 11 group 2) were identified. one group has inversion crossover (fix) sites similar to the hix sites of salmonella typhimurium. there are also four independent intergenic shufflons that potentially alter the expression and function of varied genes. the composition of the 10 different polysaccharide biosynthesis gene clusters identified (7 with associated invertible promoters) suggests a mechanism of synthesis similar to the o-antigen capsules of escherichia coli.

TI  == induction of colonic transmural inflammation by bacteroides fragilis: implication of matrix metalloproteinases.
AB  == background: commensal bacteria are implicated in the pathophysiology of intestinal inflammation, but the precise pathogenetic mechanisms are not known. we hypothesized that bacteroides fragilis-produced metalloproteinases (mmps) are  responsible for bacterial migration through the intestinal wall and transmural inflammation. aim: to investigate the role of bacterial-mmp activity in an experimental model of colitis induced by the intramural injection of bacteria. methods: suspensions of viable b. fragilis or escherichia coli were injected into the colonic wall, and the effect of the mmp inhibitor (phenantroline) on histologic lesion scores was tested. mmp activity in bacterial suspensions was measured by azocoll assay. results: the inoculation with b. fragilis induced chronic inflammatory lesions that were preferentially located in the subserosa, whereas inoculation with e. coli induced acute-type inflammatory reactions, evenly distributed in both the submucosa and subserosa. treatment with phenantroline significantly decreased subserosal lesion scores in rats inoculated with b. fragilis, but not in rats inoculated with e. coli. bacterial suspensions  of b. fragilis showed mmp activity, but e. coli suspensions did not. sonication of b. fragilis reduced mmp activity and virulence to induce serosal lesions. conclusion: our data suggest that bacterial mmps may be implicated in the serosal migration of b. fragilis and in the induction of transmural inflammation.

TI  == levofloxacin plus metronidazole administered once daily versus moxifloxacin monotherapy against a mixed infection of escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model.
AB  == moxifloxacin has been suggested as an option for monotherapy of intra-abdominal infections. recent data support the use of a once-daily metronidazole regimen. the purpose of this study was to investigate the activity of levofloxacin (750 mg every 24 h [q24h]) plus metronidazole (1,500 mg q24h) compared with that of moxifloxacin (400 mg q24h) monotherapy in a mixed-infection model. by using an in vitro pharmacodynamic model in duplicate, escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis were exposed to peak concentrations of 8.5 mg of levofloxacin/liter q24h, 32 mg of metronidazole/liter q24h, and 2 mg for moxifloxacin/liter q24h for 24 h. the activities of levofloxacin, metronidazole, moxifloxacin, and levofloxacin plus metronidazole were evaluated against e. coli, b. fragilis, and  e. coli plus b. fragilis. the targeted half-lives of levofloxacin, metronidazole, and moxifloxacin were 8, 8, and 12 h, respectively. time-kill curves were analyzed for time to 3-log killing, slope, and regrowth. pre- and postexposure mics were determined. the preexposure levofloxacin, metronidazole, and moxifloxacin mics for e. coli and b. fragilis were 0.5 and 1, >64 and 0.5, and 1  and 0.25 mg/liter, respectively. levofloxacin and moxifloxacin achieved a 3-log killing against e. coli and b. fragilis in all experiments, as did metronidazole  against b. fragilis. metronidazole did not decrease the starting inoculum of e. coli. the area under the concentration-time curve/mic ratios for e. coli and b. fragilis were 171.7 and 85.9, respectively, for levofloxacin and 26 and 103.9, respectively, for moxifloxacin. levofloxacin plus metronidazole exhibited the fastest rates of killing. the levofloxacin and moxifloxacin mics for b. fragilis  increased 8- to 16-fold after the organism was exposed to moxifloxacin. no other  changes in the postexposure mics were found. levofloxacin plus metronidazole administered once daily exhibited activity similar to that of moxifloxacin against the mixed e. coli and b. fragilis infection. a once-daily regimen of levofloxacin plus metronidazole looks promising for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

AB  == bacteroides fragilis, a human gastrointestinal commensal and an opportunistic pathogen, utilizes simple and complex sugars and polysaccharides for growth in the large intestine and at sites of infection. because b. fragilis lacks transport-linked sugar phosphorylation systems, cytoplasmic kinase(s) was expected to be required for the phosphorylation of hexoses and hexosamines. we have now identified two hexose kinases that are important for growth of b. fragilis on glucose, mannose, and other sugars. one kinase (roka), a member of the rok family of proteins, was found to be the sole kinase for activation of n-acetyl-d-glucosamine (nag). the other kinase (hexa) is responsible for the majority of the glucose kinase activity in the cell, although a hexa deletion mutant strain was not defective for growth on any substrate tested. deletion of both the roka and hexa kinase genes resulted in inability of the cell to use glucose, mannose, nag, and many other sugars. we purified roka and determined its approximate molecular mass to be 36.5 kda. the purified roka protein was shown to phosphorylate several substrates, including glucose, nag, and mannose, but not n-acetylmannosamine or n-acetylneuraminic acid. phylogenetic analysis of roka showed that it is most similar to kinases from the cytophaga-flavibacterium-bacteroides group, while hexa was most similar to other  bacterial hexokinases and eukaryotic hexokinases.

TI  == whole blood-mediated endothelial permeability and adhesion molecule expression: a model study into the effects of bacteria and antibiotics.
AB  == aim: to investigate whether the inflammatory response of cultured endothelial cells, as induced by conditioned plasma, depends on the bacterial species or type of antibiotic used for incubation with whole blood. materials and methods: blood  from healthy volunteers was stimulated ex vivo with different microorganisms, and with bacteria killed with different antibiotics. the resultant plasmas were incubated on monolayers of cultured human endothelial cells, followed by measurement of their permeability to albumin and expression of e-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1. results: incubation of escherichia coli in blood yielded plasmas that induced a marked increase in endothelial permeability  and e-selectin expression. the response to bacteroides fragilis or enterococcus faecalis was generally weaker. similar effects were observed after incubation of  whole blood with lipopolysaccharide (lps). much of the permeability and adhesion  molecule response to e. coli remained after removal of intact microorganisms from the culture. whereas antibiotic treatment of e. coli with imipenem or cefuroxime  resulted in a divergent production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) in blood, no significant differences between these treatments were observed with respect to the plasma-induced endothelial response. conclusion: bacteria differ in their capacity to generate a whole blood-mediated increase of endothelial permeability and adhesion molecule expression; this response depends, at least in part, on the presence of soluble bacterial components, such as lps. whereas treatment with various antibiotics may generate varying amounts of tnf-alpha, these differences are not translated into differences in endothelial permeability or adhesion molecule expression.

TI  == new antibiotic agents: problems and prospects.
AB  == background: surgical site infections are the third most common healthcare-associated infection, often leading to prolonged hospital stay and excessive expenditures. management of these infections has become more challenging due to rising rates of multi-drug-resistant organisms and few new antibiotic options. methods: this paper reviews the literature, summarizes the epidemiology of surgical site infections and the threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and provides an insight into new treatment options for this condition.  results: patients with surgical site infections are at greater risk of acquiring  healthcare-associated antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) sp., and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-(esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. multi-drug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacteroides fragilis are also a growing problem. several useful drugs have recently become available for the management of serious, gram-positive infections (e.g., daptomycin, linezolid, telithromycin). tigecycline, the first-in-class glycylcycline, has broad-spectrum in vitro activity, including against mrsa, vre, resistant enteric gram-negative bacilli (e.g., acinetobacter sp.), "atypical" pathogens, and anaerobes. phase 3 clinical trials suggest that tigecycline will be an excellent option for antibiotic monotherapy for complicated skin and soft tissue infections (csssi) and intra-abdominal infections. oritavancin and dalbavacin, two novel glycopeptide antibiotics that are also in late-stage clinical development, appear that they, too, will be useful for csssi due to resistant, gram-positive bacteria. conclusions: multi-drug-resistant pathogens are threatening the success of available antibiotic therapy. many new options are useful for infections due to multi-drug-resistant, gram-positive bacteria. tigecycline is a promising new agent that provides coverage against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative, aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic strains, including resistant isolates, and may make broad-spectrum, single-agent therapy possible.

TI  == use of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of hospitalized patients with intra-abdominal infections.
AB  == background: numerous combination and single-agent antimicrobial regimens are available for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections. selection of empiric agents must be directed at providing reliable activity against endotoxin-generating escherichia coli, other gram-negative facultative bacteria,  and anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis. safety profiles, pharmacokinetic profiles, and cost-effectiveness must also be considered. use of fluoroquinolones for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections has recently been advocated. methods: we review 2 prospective, comparative clinical trials conducted between 1992 and 2002 that evaluated the efficacy and safety of iv ciprofloxacin in patients with intra-abdominal infections. separate pharmacoeconomic analyses conducted for each study are also reviewed. results: a total of 4 ciprofloxacin studies (2 clinical, 2 pharmacoeconomic) comprise the database. the combination of ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole was at least as effective as imipenem/cilastatin and clinically more effective than piperacillin/tazobactam therapy, based on clinical success end points. in 1 trial, treatment success for  the clinically valid population was reported for 84% (93/111) of patients treated with iv ciprofloxacin/metronidazole, 86% (91/106) of those treated with iv/oral ciprofloxacin/metronidazole, and 81% of those treated with iv imipenem/cilastatin (91/113). the iv/oral ciprofloxacin/metronidazole regimen had a statistically significant lower mean infection-related cost than the iv only ciprofloxacin/metronidazole plus imipenem groups (difference of approximately 1100 us dollars; p = 0.029). in the second clinical trial, clinical resolution rates were statistically different for patients receiving iv/oral ciprofloxacin/metronidazole (74%) versus iv piperacillin/tazobactam therapy (63%; p = 0.047). ciprofloxacin/metronidazole was more cost-effective compared with piperacillin/tazobactam (2200 us dollars-3600 us dollars lower cost-effective ratios per patient) regardless of whether the patient had a diagnosis of appendicitis or whether a switch to an oral drug was permissible. conclusions: in the studies reviewed herein, the combination of ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole  was an effective and safe regimen for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections. this regimen has potential advantages over exclusively iv regimens, including the option of sequential iv/oral therapy, patient convenience, cost savings, and reduced hospital stay.

TI  == pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intravenous levofloxacin at 750 milligrams and various doses of metronidazole in healthy adult subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of intravenous levofloxacin at 750 mg administered once daily combined with three different dosages of intravenous metronidazole (500 mg every 8 h [q8h], 1,000 mg q24h, and 1,500 mg q24h). eighteen healthy adult subjects received all three combinations in a randomized,  crossover fashion. serial blood and urine samples were collected on the third day of each study period. the 24-h areas under the inhibitory (auic(0-24)) and bactericidal (aubc(0-24)) curves of these three combination regimens were determined against clinical isolates of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and escherichia coli. the  mean concentrations of levofloxacin were not different between study periods and  were similar to those previously published. the mean (+/- standard deviation) areas under the metronidazole plasma concentration-time curve (auc(0-24)) for 1,500-mg q24h (338 +/- 105 mg.h/liter) and 500-mg q8h (356 +/- 68 mg.h/liter) regimens were not different (p > 0.05), but both were significantly higher than the 1,000-mg q24h auc(0-24) (p < 0.05, 227 +/- 57 mg.h/liter). mean (+/- standard deviation) total body clearance and renal clearance values were similar among the 500-mg q8h, 1,000-mg q24, and 1,500-mg q24h regimens (62 +/- 7, 67 +/- 13, and 67 +/- 14 and 11 +/- 3, 12 +/- 2, and 12 +/- 5 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively). levofloxacin at 750 mg q24h plus metronidazole at 500 mg q8h or 1,500 mg q24h resulted in similar auic(0-24) and aubc(0-24) values with one exception: the auic(0-24) for the 1,500-mg q24h regimen against b. thetaiotamicron was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those of the other regimens. overall, the combination of levofloxacin at 750 mg once daily and metronidazole at 500 mg q8h  or 1,500 mg q24h appeared to have greater auic(0-24) and aubc(0-24) values than did the 1,000-mg q24h regimen. all combination regimens of levofloxacin and metronidazole were well tolerated, and no serious drug-related adverse effects were reported. the pharmacokinetic, safety, and pharmacodynamic data from our study suggest that a once-daily regimen of intravenous levofloxacin at 750 mg and metronidazole at 1,500 mg warrants further clinical investigation.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of neonatal sepsis by 16srrna genes pcr amplification and genechip hybridization].
AB  == objective: to explore a method for rapid diagnosis of sepsis in newborn infants.  methods: (1) the primers and oligonucleotide probes were designed and synthesized based on the sequences of bacterial 16srrna gene. the gene chip was prepared through the probes printed onto special glass slides. the gene chip included 18 special probes: universal probe 1, universal probe 2, gram positive bacterial probe, gram negative bacterial probe 1, gram negative bacterial probe 2, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons) 1, cons 2, escherichia coli, hemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus, meningococcus, corynebacterium, propionibacterium; (2) blood specimens from 285 cases of suspected septicemia were cultured and bacterial 16s rrna gene was detected separately; dna isolated from blood specimens and cerebrospinal fluid was amplified by pcr, and pcr products were hybridized with the probes on the gene chips. hybridization results were scanned and read by laser-scanner. results: (1) of the 285 cases, 17 were positive by pcr and the positive rate (5.96%) was significantly higher than that of blood culture (2.81%) (p < 0.01). when blood culture was taken as control, the sensitivity of pcr was 100% and specificity was 96.75%, the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.968. (2) the 17 specimens which showed positive results by pcr were further hybridized on the gene chip. all were positive by universal probes. among all of them, 5 were positive by e. coli probe; 4 were positive by staphylococcus epidermidis; two were positive by bacillus and propionibacterium probes, separately; 4 were positive by cons. the 8 specimens which showed positive results by both pcr and blood culture, the result of gene chip hybridization coincided with the result of blood culture. conclusion: detection of the bacterial 16srrna genes in clinical specimens by gene chip hybridization technology can diagnose neonatal septicemia  rapidly. this method has higher sensitivity and specificity than blood culture or other methods and can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia. therefore the genechip method may be valuable and practical  in early diagnosis of neonatal septicemia.

TI  == tetx is a flavin-dependent monooxygenase conferring resistance to tetracycline antibiotics.
AB  == the tetracycline antibiotics block microbial translation and constitute an important group of antimicrobial agents that find broad clinical utility. resistance to this class of antibiotics is primarily the result of active efflux  or ribosomal protection; however, a novel mechanism of resistance has been reported to be oxygen-dependent destruction of the drugs catalyzed by the enzyme  tetx. paradoxically, the tetx genes have been identified on transposable elements found in anaerobic bacteria of the genus bacteroides. overexpression of recombinant tetx in escherichia coli followed by protein purification revealed a  stoichiometric complex with flavin adenine dinucleotide. reconstitution of in vitro enzyme activity demonstrated a broad tetracycline antibiotic spectrum and a requirement for molecular oxygen and nadph in antibiotic degradation. the tetracycline products of tetx activity were unstable at neutral ph, but mass spectral and nmr characterization under acidic conditions supported initial monohydroxylation at position 11a followed by intramolecular cyclization and non-enzymatic breakdown to other undefined products. tetx is therefore a fad-dependent monooxygenase. the enzyme not only catalyzed efficient degradation  of a broad range of tetracycline analogues but also conferred resistance to these antibiotics in vivo. this is the first molecular characterization of an antibiotic-inactivating monooxygenase, the origins of which may lie in environmental bacteria.

TI  == intra-abdominal, retroperitoneal, and visceral abscesses in children.
AB  == this review describes the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of intra-abdominal abscesses (including subphrenic, hepatic, splenic, and retroperitoneal abscesses) in children. they often occur as a complication of local or generalized peritonitis, commonly secondary to appendicitis, necrotizing enterocolitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and tubo-ovarian infection, surgery or trauma. the original infection generally occurs because of the entry of enteric microorganisms into the peritoneal cavity through a defect in the wall of the intestine or other viscus as a result of obstruction, infarction, or direct trauma. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora can be recovered from most abscesses. the predominant aerobic isolates are escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus spp. and the main anaerobic bacteria are bacteroides fragilis group  peptostreptococcus spp., fusobacterium spp., and clostridium spp. the treatment of intraabdominal abscesses includes drainage, surgical correction of pathology,  and administration of antimicrobials effective against both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.

TI  == microbial contamination of drinking water and disease outcomes in developing regions.
AB  == drinking water is a major source of microbial pathogens in developing regions, although poor sanitation and food sources are integral to enteric pathogen exposure. gastrointestinal disease outcomes are also more severe, due to under-nutrition and lack of intervention strategies in these regions. poor water  quality, sanitation and hygiene account for some 1.7 million deaths a year world-wide (3.1% of all deaths and 3.7% of all daly's), mainly through infectious diarrhoea. nine out of 10 such deaths are in children and virtually all of the deaths are in developing countries. major enteric pathogens in these children include: rotavirus, campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, shigella spp. and vibrio cholerae o1, and possibly enteropathogenic e. coli, aeromonas spp. v. cholerae o139, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile and cryptosporidium parvum. all except the latter are easily control by chlorination of water, but recontamination of treated water is  a huge problem. emerging environmental pathogens, such as helicobacter pylori and burkholderia pseudomallei, may well be of significance in some regions. in adults, much less is understood of various sequellae such as myocarditis, diabetes, reactive arthritis and cancers some months-years after initial infections. so in addition to the traditional pathogens (helminths, entamoeba histolytica, giardia lamblia hepatitis a and e) various enteroviruses, c. jejuni  and h. pylori are emerging issues in adults.

AB  == tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from april 2002 to march 2003 were investigated in a multicenter study in  japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 334 strains were  isolated from 131 (75.3%) of 174 patients with surgical infections. one hundred and seventy-one strains were isolated from primary infections, and 163 strains were isolated from post-operative infections. from primary infections, anaerobic  gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, although the isolation rate of staphylococcus aureus was the highest, followed by that of enterococcus faecalis from primary infections, the isolation  rate of e. faecalis was the highest from postoperative infections. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this  order, and from postoperative infections, e. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, and citobacter freundii. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the  last several years. we noticed no vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci nor p. aeruginosa producing metallo-beta-lactamase. but we noticed cefazolin-resistant e. coli probably producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase.

TI  == factors influencing the replication of somatic coliphages in the water environment.
AB  == the potential replication of somatic coliphages in the environment has been considered a drawback for their use as viral indicators, although the extent to which this affects their numbers in environmental samples has not been assessed.  in this study, the replication of somatic coliphages in various conditions was assayed using suspensions containing naturally occurring somatic coliphages and escherichia coli wg5, which is a host strain recommended for detecting somatic coliphages. the effects on phage replication of exposing strain wg5 and phages to a range of physiological conditions and the effects of the presence of suspended  particles or other bacteria were also assayed. phage replication was further tested using a strain of klebsiella terrigena and naturally occurring e. coli cells as hosts. our results indicate that threshold densities of both host bacterium and phages should occur simultaneously to ensure appreciable phage replication. host cells originating from a culture in the exponential growth phase and incubation at 37 degrees c were the best conditions for phage replication in e. coli wg5. in these conditions the threshold densities required  to ensure phage replication were about 10(4) host cells/ml and 10(3) phages/ml, or 10(3) host cells/ml and 10(4) phages/ml, or intermediate values of both. the threshold densities needed for phage replication were higher when the cells proceeded from a culture in the stationary growth phase or when suspended particles or other bacteria were present. furthermore e. coli wg5 was more efficient in supporting phage replication than either k. terrigenae or e. coli cells naturally occurring in sewage. our results indicate that the phage and bacterium densities and the bacterial physiological conditions needed for phage replication are rarely expected to be found in the natural water environments.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of cefmetazole (cmz) against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan was evaluated yearly for two years from june  2000 to march 2002 and compared with that of other parenteral beta-lactams, cefazolin (cez), cefotiam (ctm), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and flomoxef (fmox). in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 575 isolates of 13 species were tested, and 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002. in these surveillances spanning two years, the mic90s of cmz against the bacterial species tested hardly differed. changes in percent resistance of each species to cmz (mic of cmz > or = 32 micrograms/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (mssa, 0%-->0%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 73%-->87%), staphylococcus epidermidis (19%-->32%), other coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (other cns, 13%-->18%), escherichia coli (4%-->1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3%-->4%), klebsiella oxytoca (0%-->0%), proteus mirabilis (2%-->2%), proteus vulgaris (14%-->7%), morganella morganii (7%-->0%), providencia spp. (17%-->0%),  peptostreptococcus spp. (0%-->0%), bacteroides fragilis (10%-->11%), and other bacteroides spp. (79%-->88%). the change in percent resistance of mrsa, s. epidermidis, other cns, and other bacteroides spp. tended to increase. in addition, the percent resistance of b. fragilis was 10%. it is necessary to pay much attention to the trends observed in these species. compared to other drugs tested, against mssa, the activity of cmz was inferior to that of cez, ctm, and fmox and superior to that of sbt/cpz. against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and cns, the  tested drugs exhibited little activity. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and inferior to that  of fmox. against b. fragilis and other bacteroides spp., the activity of cmz was  almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and comparable to or inferior to that of  sbt/cpz and fmox. no remarkable changes in the activity of cmz were observed in this study compared with studies conducted before cmz was launched. this result suggests that cmz still maintains potent activity.

TI  == relationship between penicillin-binding protein patterns and beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of bacteroides fragilis with different susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == this study examines the role of the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of bacteroides fragilis in the mechanism of resistance to different beta-lactam antibiotics. six of the eight strains used were beta-lactamase-positive by the nitrocefin assay. these strains displayed reduced susceptibility to imipenem (mic, 2-16 mg l(-1)) and some of them were resistant to the actions of ampicillin, cefuroxime, cephalexin, cefoxitin and piperacillin. when studying specific enzymic activity, the capacity to degrade cefuroxime was only detected in strains ak-4, r212 and 0423 and the capacity to degrade cephalexin was only detected in strains r212 and 2013e; no specific activity was detected on imipenem. metallo-beta-lactamase activity was only detected in strains ak-2 and 119, despite the fact that the cfia gene was identified in four strains (ak-2, 2013e, 119 and 7160). the cepa gene was detected in six of the eight strains studied. three high-molecular-mass pbps were detected in all strains; however, in some cases, pbp2bfr and/or pbp3bfr appeared as a faint band. pbp4bfr and pbp5bfr  were detected in six strains. pbp6bfr only was detected in b. fragilis strains ak-2, 0423, 119 and 7160. by analysis of the sequence of b. fragilis chromosomal  dna and comparison with genes that are known to encode pbps in escherichia coli,  six genes that encode pbp-like proteins were detected in the former organism. the gene that encodes the pbp2 orthologue of e. coli (pbpabfr, pbp3bfr) was sequenced in six of the eight strains and its implications for resistance were examined. differences in the pbp3bfr amino acid sequences of strains ak-2 and 119 and their production of beta-lactamases indicate that these differences are not involved in the mechanism of resistance to imipenem and/or cephalexin.

AB  == objectives: to study the effect of moxifloxacin versus imipenem/cilastatin (hereafter referred to as imipenem) treatment on the mortality of mice infected intravenously with different strains of bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli. methods: groups of 20 mice each were infected intravenously with different  strains of b. fragilis [moxifloxacin and imipenem susceptible or resistant, and enterotoxin (et) positive or negative] and e. coli (moxifloxacin and imipenem susceptible). twenty-four hours post-infection, intravenous therapy with either moxifloxacin (2.0 mg twice a day) or imipenem (2.4 mg three times a day) was started and continued for 3 days. control groups were left untreated. survival rates were recorded at day 7 post-infection. at that time, surviving mice were killed and numbers of bacteria in the liver and kidneys were determined. results: if compared with untreated animals, mice treated with either moxifloxacin or imipenem showed significantly improved survival (p < 0.001). there was no significant difference (p = 0.97) in the survival rates comparing the two treatment regimens irrespective of the et positivity or the susceptibility to moxifloxacin or imipenem of the infective b. fragilis strain. however, there was  a tendency that b. fragilis was recovered more often from the liver and kidneys of mice infected with et positive strains. conclusions: the data show that moxifloxacin was as efficacious as imipenem in reducing the mortality rate of mice suffering from a severe systemic aerobic/anaerobic infection.

TI  == potential role of helicobacter pylori in hepatocarcinogenesis.
AB  == helicobacter species can induce carcinoma in the liver of certain mice. furthermore, helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) exhibits hepatotoxicity in vitro. these reports indicate that h. pylori may play a role in hepatocarcinogenesis. the aim of this study was to assess the presence of h. pylori in human hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) to determine if h. pylori may affect the development of this disease. liver specimens from 15 hcc patients dissected into  tumor and non-tumor tissues were examined for h. pylori by pcr using two sets of  primers for 16s rrna and urease b. dna sequencing analysis was performed to confirm that pcr products with 16s rrna primers were derived from h. pylori dna.  the specimens were also examined for h. pylori by immunohistochemistry using anti-h. pylori antibody. h. pylori was found in 13 of 15 tumor tissues, not in the non-tumor tissues. by contrast, escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis, frequent colonizers of gut, were not detected by pcr in the hcc tumors. ten cirrhotic liver tissue specimens and seven normal liver tissue specimens were also negative for h. pylori dna by pcr. the nucleotide sequence of the amplified  fragment shared 100% identity with the 16s rrna gene of h. pylori. h. pylori was  also detected in hcc tissue by immunohistochemical analysis. the presence of h. pylori in human hcc tissue was demonstrated by pcr and immunohistochemical analysis. these findings suggest that h. pylori might contribute to the development of hcc. further study is needed to prove the pathogenetic role of h.  pylori in the development of human hcc.

TI  == role of commensal bacteria in development of gut-associated lymphoid tissues and  preimmune antibody repertoire.
AB  == intestinal bacteria are required for development of gut-associated lymphoid tissues (galt), which mediate a variety of host immune functions, such as mucosal immunity and oral tolerance. in rabbits, the intestinal microflora are also required for developing the preimmune ab repertoire by promoting somatic diversification of ig genes in b cells that have migrated to galt. we studied the mechanism of bacteria-induced galt development. bacteria were introduced into rabbits in which the appendix had been rendered germfree by microsurgery (we refer to these rabbits as germfree-appendix rabbits). we then identified specific members of the intestinal flora that promote galt development. the combination of bacteroides fragilis and bacillus subtilis consistently promoted galt development and led to development of the preimmune ab repertoire, as shown by an increase in somatic diversification of vdj-c micro genes in appendix b cells. neither species alone consistently induced galt development, nor did clostridium subterminale, escherichia coli, or staphylococcus epidermidis. b. fragilis, which by itself is  immunogenic, did not promote galt development; hence, galt development in rabbits does not appear to be the result of an ag-specific immune response. to identify bacterial pathways required for galt development, we introduced b. fragilis along with stress-response mutants of b. subtilis into germfree-appendix rabbits. we identified two spo0a-controlled stress responses, sporulation and secretion of the protein yqxm, which are required for galt development. we conclude that specific members of the commensal, intestinal flora drive galt development through a specific subset of stress responses.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == adrenomedullin is increased in the portal circulation during chronic sepsis in rats.
AB  == background: a clinical hallmark of sepsis is an early, hyperdynamic cardiac phase (increased cardiac output) that degrades to a hypodynamic phase, which results in poor gut perfusion and subsequent gastrointestinal (gi) hypoxemia, tissue ischemia, necrosis and loss of gut barrier function. studies in rat cecal-ligation and puncture suggest that the potent vasodilator adrenomedullin (am) might initiate or maintain the hypodynamic phase. we hypothesize that am expression is increased in acute escherichia coli bacteremia and chronic e coli-bacteroides fragilis sepsis. methods: acute bacteremia: male sprague-dawley  rats were anesthetized (urethane/alpha-chloralose), tracheotomized, and cannulated for monitoring blood pressure (mabp) and heart rate (hr) and for infusion of e coli (10(9) colony-forming units [cfu] e coli per 1 ml normal saline) and blood sampling. arterial blood was withdrawn for arterial blood gas (abg) measurements every 60 minutes. after 6 hours, we harvested lung, liver, kidney, spleen, and small intestine tissue samples and drew arterial and portal blood for am enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). chronic sepsis: a sterile gauze pad was implanted and animals recovered for 5 days. twenty-four hours (10(9) cfu e coli and 10(9) cfu b fragilis per 1 ml normal saline; 1 injection) or 72 hours (2 injections) after the inoculation of the back sponge, rats were anesthetized, intubated, and cannulated as above. mabp, hr, and abg were measured for 1 hour before tissue and serum harvest for am elisa. results: sepsis increased hr and mabp in all groups. acute sepsis caused a respiratory alkalosis  and ph was also elevated in chronic sepsis. serum am levels were increased in all groups compared with baseline and remained elevated at every time point, but were not different between saline controls and septic animals at any time point, except for the portal serum from the 72-hour chronic sepsis, which was elevated.  conclusions: these data suggest that surgical manipulation alone is sufficient to stimulate am secretion, most probably from endothelial cells. while the am levels were decreasing at 72 hours compared with 6 hours or 24 hours in the arterial blood and the saline control portal blood, it remained elevated in the septic portal samples, suggesting that the sepsis-induced increase of am was derived from the gut by a different mechanism than that which elevated arterial serum levels.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == beta-lactamase stability of faropenem.
AB  == faropenem (far) is an orally available member of the penem class unique among carbapenems and other available beta-lactams. this study compared far to cephalosporins and imipenem with respect to beta-lactamase (bla) stability and emergence of resistance to staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. bla stability was studied using enzyme preparations from sonicated/centrifuged 24-hour cultures of e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus vulgaris, providencia  rettgeri, klebsiella pneumoniae, s. aureus, and bacteroides fragilis grown in the presence of 20 mg/l ampicillin or cephaloridine to induce penicillinase or cephalosporinase, respectively. substrate hydrolysis was quantitated spectrophotometrically. multistep acquisition of resistance was promoted by growing bacteria in broth containing 2-fold dilutions of antibiotic over 10 cycles. aliquots from test tubes with visible growth provided the inoculum for the next series of dilutions. far as well as other cephalosporins tested were highly stable to penicillinase derived from s. aureus and e. coli. however, e. coli- and p. vulgaris-derived cephalosporinase hydrolyzed cephaloridine, cefaclor and cefotiam considerably, whereas far was highly stable. far was highly stable against hydrolysis by various blas prepared from four b. fragilis strains and the rate of far hydrolysis by metallo-bla was 5 times lower than that for imipenem. additionally, the acquisition of resistant s. aureus strains was less pronounced  for far compared to other agents tested. mics rose 8-fold after the 10th sub-mic  exposure, while mics rose 16-, 31- and 512-fold for cefixime, cefazolin and cefaclor, respectively. e. coli shifts in mics were moderate for all the agents tested. in conclusion, far is characterized by pronounced bla stability compared  to other cephalosporins and imipenem. furthermore, a lower propensity for resistance development with far as compared to cephalosporins was observed.

TI  == [effect of a polyoxydonium immunoregulator on the biological properties of microorganisms].
AB  == the effect of the synthetic immunomodulator polyoxydonium (po) on some biological properties of pathogenic bacteria (shigella flexneri, salmonella enteritidis), opportunistic bacteria (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, prevotella melaninogenica, propionibacterium propionicum, clostridium difficile) and fungi (candida albicans), isolated during enteric infections, enteric dysbiosis, pyoinflammatory diseases, was evaluated in a number of in vitro experiments. the study revealed that the recommended therapeutic concentration of po decreased antilysozyme activity (ala) and the anticomplement  activity in klebsiella, shigella, propionibacterium, clostridium, bacteroids, fungi of the genus candida, but increased ala in nonhemolytic escherichia. under  the action of po an increased sensitivity of the microorganisms under study to definite antibiotics of the lincosamide, fluoroquinolon, carbapenem and cephalosporin groups was noted. the data obtained in this study reveal one of the possible mechanisms of the corrective action of po on the microbiocenosis of the  intestine in dysbiosis, enteric infections and pyoinflammatory diseases.

TI  == bacterial reduction by cell salvage washing and leukocyte depletion filtration.
AB  == background: blood conservation techniques are being increasingly used because of  the increased cost and lack of availability of allogeneic blood. cell salvage offers great blood savings opportunities but is thought to be contraindicated in  a number of areas (e.g., blood contaminated with bacteria). several outcome studies have suggested the safety of this technique in trauma and colorectal surgery, but many practitioners are still hesitant to apply cell salvage in the face of frank bacterial contamination. this study was undertaken to assess the efficacy of bacterial removal when cell salvage was combined with leukocyte depletion filtration. methods: expired packed erythrocytes were obtained and inoculated with a fixed amount of a stock bacteria (escherichia coli american type culture collections [atcc] 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, or bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285) in amounts  ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 colony forming units/ml. the blood was processed via  a cell salvage machine. the washed blood was then filtered using a leukocyte reduction filter. the results for blood taken during each step of processing were compared using a repeated-measures design. results: fifteen units of blood were contaminated with each of the stock bacteria. from the prewash sample to the postfiltration sample, 99.0%, 99.6%, 100%, and 97.6% of e. coli, s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, and b. fragilis were removed, respectively. discussion: significant but not complete removal of contaminating bacteria was seen. an increased level of patient safety may be added to cell salvage by including a leukocyte depletion filter when salvaging blood that might be grossly contaminated with bacteria.

TI  == activity of faropenem and imipenem for ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria.
AB  == aim: to determine whether an association exists between ciprofloxacin and faropenem resistance in bacteria including multiply drug-resistant isolates. methods: the mics were determined for 150 fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria, plus 20 nalidixic acid-resistant strains of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. results: faropenem was very active against escherichia coli and streptococcus pneumoniae, but 5/31 staphylococcus aureus and 2/26 bacteroides fragilis required > or =16 mg/l for inhibition. of 30 multiply drug-resistant isolates with a phenotype suggestive of enhanced efflux, only for one strain (a bacteroides fragilis) was the faropenem mic higher than that associated with the  other isolates of the same species. conclusions: faropenem was in general as active as imipenem. there was no association between resistance to ciprofloxacin  and faropenem or imipenem resistance.

TI  == the phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase from bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == the bacteroides fragilis capsular polysaccharide complex is the major virulence factor for abscess formation in human hosts. polysaccharide b of this complex contains a 2-aminoethylphosphonate functional group. this functional group is synthesized in three steps, one of which is catalyzed by phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase. in this paper, we report the cloning and overexpression of the b.  fragilis phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase gene (aepy), purification of the phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase recombinant protein, and the extensive characterization of the reaction that it catalyzes. the homotrimeric (41,184-da subunit) phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase catalyzes (kcat = 10.2 +/- 0.3 s-1) the  decarboxylation of phosphonopyruvate (km = 3.2 +/- 0.2 microm) to phosphonoacetaldehyde (ki = 15 +/- 2 microm) and carbon dioxide at an optimal ph  range of 7.0-7.5. thiamine pyrophosphate (km = 13 +/- 2 microm) and certain divalent metal ions (mg(ii) km = 82 +/- 8 microm; mn(ii) km = 13 +/- 1 microm; ca(ii) km = 78 +/- 6 microm) serve as cofactors. phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase  is a member of the alpha-ketodecarboxylase family that includes sulfopyruvate decarboxylase, acetohydroxy acid synthase/acetolactate synthase, benzoylformate decarboxylase, glyoxylate carboligase, indole pyruvate decarboxylase, pyruvate decarboxylase, the acetyl phosphate-producing pyruvate oxidase, and the acetate-producing pyruvate oxidase. the mg(ii) binding residue asp-260, which is  located within the thiamine pyrophosphate binding motif of the alpha-ketodecarboxylase family, was shown by site-directed mutagenesis to play an important role in catalysis. pyruvate (kcat = 0.05 s-1, km = 25 mm) and sulfopyruvate (kcat approximately 0.05 s-1; ki = 200 +/- 20 microm) are slow substrates for the phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase, indicating that this enzyme is promiscuous.

TI  == a life-threatening infection: fournier's gangrene.
AB  == fournier's gangrene is a life-threatening disorder in which infection of the perineum and scrotum spreads along fascial planes, causing soft tissue necrosis.  if urgent surgery is delayed, the disease will soon result in septic shock, multiorgan failure, and death. in this study, we present 21 patients with fournier's gangrene who were treated in period between 1994 and 2001. patients' charts were reviewed retrospectively and are discussed in the light of literature. all patients received aggressive surgical debridment. penicillin or ceftriaxone, aminoglicoside and metronidazole were administered intravenously. of the 21 patients, 5 had scrotal carbuncle, 1 had urethral stricture, 1 had chronic indwelling urethral catheterization, 2 had perirectal abscess, and 1 had hemorrhoidectomy. in eleven patients we couldn't identify any cause. twelve patients had diabetes mellitus, and two had chronic alcoholism. escherichia coli  was isolated in 12 purulent tissue cultures, and bacteroides fragilis in eight. seventeen patients survived, whereas four died. fourier's gangrene is considered  a surgical emergency. early surgical intervention is essential, as the gangrene can spread rapidly at rates reaching 2 mm per hour. so that fournier's gangrene is an abrupt, rapidly progressive, gangrenous infection of the external genitalia and perineum and is a real urologic emergency.

TI  == capsaicin-sensitive nerves regulate the metabolic response to abdominal sepsis.
AB  == background: both the systemic release of inflammatory mediators and activation of the neuroendocrine axis by sensory afferent nerves (sans) have been implicated as initiators of the metabolic response to infection. in this study, we investigate  the role of sans as mediators of protein catabolism and the insulin-like growth factor (igf) axis during abdominal sepsis using capsaicin (cap) to selectively destroy nociceptive sensory axons. methods: four groups of male sprague-dawley rats were studied: control, control+cap, sepsis, and sepsis+cap. rats were injected with cap (75 mg/kg) on day 1 and (50 mg/kg) on day 2 to destroy sans. time-matched control and septic rats were pair-fed and injected with vehicle on the same schedule. controls underwent sham laparotomy, while septic rats had a fecal-agar pellet inoculated with escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis implanted in the peritoneal cavity. blood and tissues were harvested 5 days after the induction of sepsis. plasma igf-i, igfbp-1, and -3 were measured by radioimmunoassay and western blot analysis. igf-i, acid-labile subunit (als), igfbp-1 and -3 mrna levels were determined by northern blot analysis. results: mortality was 40% in septic rats vs 0% in the sepsis+cap group. capsaicin had no  effect on muscle mass, protein content, or the igf system in control rats. however, sepsis-induced reductions in gastrocnemius mass (25%) and protein content (35%) were ameliorated by capsaicin. the sepsis-induced decrease in hepatic igf-i mrna and circulating igf-i (26%), as well as the 4-fold increase in plasma igfbp-1 and hepatic igfbp-1 mrna were prevented by capsaicin. conclusions: capsaicin-sensitive nerves mediate mortality, the catabolism of skeletal muscle,  and selected elements of the igf system during abdominal sepsis. the results suggest an important role for nociceptive sans and the neuroendocrine system in mediating the host response to abdominal infection.

TI  == [psoas abscesses. genesis, diagnosis, and therapy].
AB  == background: a psoas abscess is a rarely encountered entity with various etiologies and nonspecific clinical presentation, frequently resulting in delayed diagnosis, increased morbidity, and prolonged or recurrent hospitalization. patients and methods: between january 1996 and january 2002 we treated ten patients (approximately 54.8, 5 males,5 females). these cases were analyzed retrospectively relative to a review of the literature. results: ct scanning was  decisive in the final diagnosis of psoas abscess. primary psoas abscess occurred  in four cases and six patients had secondary abscesses. in all except one case, the psoas abscess was located on the right side. the causes of primary abscesses  were retroperitoneal perforated appendicitis, paravertebral injections for lumboischialgia, pott's disease, and repeated intravenous drug application in the groin. five patients underwent retroperitoneal open drainage and four patients ct-guided drainage. one patient with retroperitoneal perforated appendicitis was  treated by laparotomy. staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, and escherichia coli were the most common infective agents. there was no postoperative mortality and no cases of abscess recurred. conclusions: ct scan is a diagnostic "gold standard" for psoas abscess. ct-guided drainage is the method  of first choice, but is not possible in all cases. open retroperitoneal drainage  is a standard method of treatment. postoperative antibiotic therapy is obligatory and should be adapted individually.

AB  == sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the c-2 side chain. in agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) with a mic(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. furthermore, sm-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against mrsa, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the mic. sm-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of mrsa in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. the mics of sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and  penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. these drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against enterococcus faecium, and the mic(90) s for ampicillin-resistant e. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. however, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity  of sm-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an e. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in cfu at four times the mic after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. in addition, sm-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the e. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the mics (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), moraxella catarrhalis, and bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus spp. thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including mrsa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

TI  == effects of laparoscopic models on anaerobic bacterial growth with bacteroides fragilis in experimentally induced peritonitis.
AB  == background: previous reports of recurrent intra-abdominal abcess formation after  the laparoscopic treatment of perforated acute appendicitis led us to investigate the possible effects of gas insufflation on the spread of infection. we previously showed that escherichia coli counts were significantly higher in a laparoscopy group that underwent carbon dioxide (co2) insufflation than in control and laparotomy groups. the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of intra-abdominal co2 and nitrous oxide (n2o) insufflation on anaerobic  bacterial growth in a rat model. methods: a standard strain of bacteroides fragilis (atcc 25285) was injected intraperitoneally (1 x 10(6) cfu/ml per kilogram) in 40 wistar rats under sterile conditions. forty rats with induced peritonitis were randomly divided into five groups: control, laparotomy, co2 insufflation, n2o insufflation, and one group without pneumoperitoneum. eight hours after the intraperitoneal injection of b. fragilis, peritoneal aspirates were obtained and inoculated onto brucella agar. at the sixteenth hour of induced peritoneal infection (corresponding to hour 8 in the laparoscopy groups) all animals underwent laparotomy; peritoneal aspirates were obtained and inoculated into brucella agar for bacterial counts. the colonies of b. fragilis were counted manually, and the results were expressed as the mean number of colony-forming units per milliliter. results: no significant differences in microorganism counts were noted between the study groups before the procedure (p>.05 for all comparisons). we observed a significant increase in the number of bacteria (mean  +/- sd) in the co2 insufflation group between hour 8 and hour 16 of peritoneal contamination. conclusion: the results suggest that co2 insufflation may promote  the growth of intra-abdominal anaerobic bacteria. such bacterial growth may lead  to intra-abdominal abcess formation or cause localized peritonitis to develop into generalized peritonitis. we suggest that laparoscopy without pneumoperitoneum may be preferred in patients with peritonitis.

TI  == bacterial translocation after cirrhotic liver resection: a clinical investigation of 181 patients.
AB  == background: cirrhotic patients are usually associated with a high susceptibility  to infection. although bacterial translocation from gut mucosa to mesenteric lymph node (mln) and systemic circulation is a well-known phenomenon after hepatectomy, its role in cirrhotic patients remains unclear. materials and methods: mln was harvested for bacterial culture before and after liver resection in 181 cirrhotic patients. the characteristics and postoperative courses of patients with positive and negative bacterial culture for mln after hepatectomy were compared. postoperative systemic antibiotics were administered if infectious complications occurred. results: no bacteria were cultured in mln before hepatectomy. bacterial translocation (bt) to mln after hepatectomy occurred in 36 patients (bt group). after multivariate analysis, intraoperative blood transfusion was the only independent factor that influenced bacterial translocation rates after cirrhotic liver resection. bt group patients also had higher infectious and overall complication rates, with a longer postoperative hospital stay. among the cultured bacteriae from infected sites in bt group patients with infectious complications, only 2 patients (12.5%) had totally different bacterial species to those cultured from mlns. conclusions: bacterial translocation more often occurred after liver resection in cirrhotic patients who received intraoperative blood transfusion. such patients had higher postoperative infectious and overall complication rates. thus, avoidance of intraoperative blood transfusion is mandatory for cirrhotic liver resection.

TI  == mechanism of quinolone resistance in anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == several recently developed quinolones have excellent activity against a broad range of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and are thus potential drugs for the treatment of serious anaerobic and mixed infections. resistance to quinolones is  increasing worldwide, but is still relatively infrequent among anaerobes. two main mechanisms, alteration of target enzymes (gyrase and topoisomerase iv) caused by chromosomal mutations in encoding genes, or reduced intracellular accumulation due to increased efflux of the drug, are associated with quinolone resistance. these mechanisms have also been found in anaerobic species. high-level resistance to the newer broad-spectrum quinolones often requires stepwise mutations in target genes. the increasing emergence of resistance among  anaerobes may be a consequence of previous widespread use of quinolones, which may have enriched first-step mutants in the intestinal tract. quinolone resistance in the bacteroides fragilis group strains is strongly correlated with  amino acid substitutions at positions 82 and 86 in gyra (equivalent to positions  83 and 87 of escherichia coli). several studies have indicated that b. fragilis group strains possess efflux pump systems that actively expel quinolones, leading to resistance. dna gyrase seems also to be the primary target for quinolones in clostridium difficile, since amino acid substitutions in gyra and gyrb have been  detected in resistant strains. to what extent other mechanisms, such as mutational events in other target genes or alterations in outer-membrane proteins, contribute to resistance among anaerobes needs to be further investigated.

TI  == pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration of pefloxacin plus metronidazole after administration as surgical prophylaxis in colorectal surgery.
AB  == the levels of metronidazole and pefloxacin in plasma and tissue penetration of both drugs were studied after prophylactic administration to 7 patients undergoing colorectal surgery. metronidazole (1,500 mg) and pefloxacin (800 mg) were administered as an intravenous infusion 1 hour before surgery. mean plasma levels of pefloxacin decreased from 12.92 +/- 4.10 microg/ml at the end of the infusion to 2.18 +/- 1.03 microg/ml at 36 h. these values were above the mic90 for e. coli (0.125 microg/ml) and e. faecalis (0.5 microg/ml), microorganisms responsible for abdominal infections. tissue pefloxacin levels were also measured with a range from 0.72 - 7.78 microg/g in subcutaneous cell tissue, from 1.94 - 17.55 microg/g in peritoneum and from 2.76 - 21.99 microg/g in colon wall. mean plasma concentrations of metronidazole decreased from 39.89 +/- 17.08 microg/ml at the end of the infusion to 2.63 +/- 1.11 microg/ml at 36 h. during this period, concentrations were higher than 2 microg/ml, the mic90 value for b. fragilis, the anaerobic pathogen more frequently involved in postoperative infections after rectal and colonic surgery. tissue metronidazole levels ranged from 3.64 - 13.37 microg/g in subcutaneous cell tissue, from 3.26 - 41.66 microg/g in peritoneum and from 6.72 - 43.12 microg/g in colon wall. the auc/mic  values (efficacy parameter for concentration-dependent killing antibiotics such as pefloxacin and metronidazole) obtained were the following: metronidazole auc/mic value for b. fragilis was 173; pefloxacin auc/mic values for e. coli and  e. faecalis were 941 and 235, respectively. the values of these parameters are higher than the recommended values to ensure efficacy, which means good exposure  of the antimicrobials to the microorganisms. in conclusion, the combination of pefloxacin and metronidazole as prophylactic agents to prevent infections in patients undergoing colorectal surgery produce plasma and tissue levels above the mic values of the main pathogens responsible for this kind of infections.

TI  == usefulness of different groups of bacteriophages as model micro-organisms for evaluating chlorination.
AB  == aims: to assess the usefulness of bacterial and viral indicators in chlorination  processes and to collect quantitative information necessary for risk assessment analysis in water disinfection processes based on chlorination. methods and results: naturally occurring bacterial indicators, bacteriophages and enteroviruses were determined to evaluate the effect of chlorination in groundwater and secondary sewage effluents. additionally, the effect of chlorinating on selected bacteriophages, enteroviruses and escherichia coli was also tested in spiked samples of bottled water and sewage effluents. results indicate that chlorination inactivates more efficiently bacteria than phages and  enteroviruses. among the human viruses, phages infecting bacteroides fragilis and selected somatic coliphages belonging to the siphoviridae family were the most persistent to chlorination. conclusions: the three groups of bacteriophages studied were all more resistant to chlorination than bacteria and some of the phages were more resistant than enteroviruses. results presented here indicate that it is very risky to generalize from information obtained with inactivation experiments done with single isolates of any phage or virus. if possible, inactivation studies should be done with naturally occurring populations. phages  offer a good opportunity for studying naturally occurring populations. thus, the  bacteriophages offer a range of resistance to chlorination that may represent most of the viruses that can be found in water. significance and impact of the study: data reported in this study support the inclusion of bacteriophages as additional indicators of the efficiency of water chlorination processes and water quality.

TI  == growth-inhibiting effects of seco-tanapartholides identified in artemisia princeps var. orientalis whole plant on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == aims: the present work aimed at isolating antibacterial constituents from the whole plant of artemisia princeps var. orientalis active towards nine human intestinal bacteria. methods and results: the growth-inhibiting activities of materials derived from the artemisia whole plant towards test bacteria were examined using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active constituents of the artemisia whole plant were characterized as the sesquiterpene lactones seco-tanapartholides a and b by spectroscopic analysis. in a test using  1 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b produced a clear inhibitory effect against clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus aureus.  these compounds did not affect the growth of test lactic acid-producing bacteria  (bifidobacterium adolescentis, bif. breve, lactobacillus acidophilus and lact. casei) and escherichia coli, whereas weak growth inhibition towards bif. bifidum  was observed. at 0.5 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b exhibited moderate growth inhibition towards cl. perfringens but weak growth inhibition towards bact. fragilis and staph. aureus. conclusions: inhibitory action of seco-tanapartholides a and b towards specific bacteria without any adverse effects on lactic acid-producing bacteria may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of a. princeps var. orientalis whole plant. significance and impact of the study: these naturally occurring artemisia whole plant-derived materials could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria such as clostridia.

TI  == immunomodulatory consequences of oral administration of lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg in healthy volunteers.
AB  == probiotic microorganisms, especially lactic acid bacteria, are effective in the treatment of infectious diarrhoeal diseases and experimental colitis. although the mechanisms by which these organisms exert their anti-inflammatory effects are largely unknown, immunomodulating effects are suggested. the objective of this study was to examine the effect of a 5-week oral administration of lactobacillus  rhamnosus subspecies gg (lb. gg) on the cellular immune response to intestinal microorganisms in ten healthy volunteers. peripheral blood cells (pb) were stimulated with either 'self' or 'non-self' preparations of faecal samples and isolated bacteroides fragilis group-organisms (bfg) or escherichia coli (esch. coli), and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (il-10, il-4, il-6, ifn-gamma, tnf-alpha) were measured in the culture supernatant. cd4+ t-lymphocyte activation was determined by measurement of intracellular atp following lysis of the cells.  the activational response of cd4+ t-lymphocytes towards isolated and heat-inactivated intestinal organisms was increased after the probiotic treatment. additionally, tnf-alpha, il-6 and in part ifn-gamma cytokine secretion by pb cells following stimulation with whole stool preparations and single members of the flora was significantly decreased, whereas the il-10 and in part il-4 cytokine secretion was increased at the end of the study. in contrast, the activational response of cd4+ t-lymphocytes following stimulation with whole 'non-self' intestinal flora was higher than by 'self' intestinal flora, but both  responses showed a trend towards a reduction at the end of the study. this study  documents a direct effect by lb. gg on the cellular immune system of healthy volunteers and offers a promising tool to investigate systemic immunomodulation due to oral administration of probiotic microorganisms.

AB  == inactivation of the bacteriophages phi x 174 (somatic coliphage), ms2 (f-specific coliphage) and b40-8 (phage infecting bacteroides fragilis) suspended in tap water was studied applying gamma and electron beam irradiation as well. phi x 174 phage was found to be a suitable viral indicator for water disinfection by means  of ionizing radiation. the nutrient broths introduced simultaneously with the bacteriophages into the water when it is spiked with the phages for the experiments did not significantly change the scavenging capacity of the water matrix. no dose rate effect was observed with ms2 and b40-8 phages but phi x 174  phage showed a clear dose rate effect. it was found that in water ms2 phage is significantly more sensitive to ionizing radiation than escherichia coli.

TI  == monocytes heterozygous for the asp299gly and thr399ile mutations in the toll-like receptor 4 gene show no deficit in lipopolysaccharide signalling.
AB  == toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4)-mediated recognition of lipopolysaccharide (lps) is required for efficient recognition of gram-negative bacterial infections. two commonly occurring mutations in the human tlr4 gene (asp299gly and thr399ile) have recently been shown to be associated with blunted physiological responses to inhaled lps, and with increased risk of gram-negative bacteraemia in sepsis patients and reduced risk of atherosclerosis in an italian population. here we show that monocytes from individuals heterozygous for both mutations in the tlr4  gene exhibit no deficit in recognition of lps of escherichia coli, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, yersinia pestis, chlamydia trachomatis, porphyromonas gingivalis, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. we propose that the relatively high frequency of these mutations in the caucasian population may reflect modified responses of carriers to alternative tlr4 agonists.

TI  == intestinal mucosa-associated bacteria modulate rat mast cell reactivity.
AB  == it is well known that in some conditions bacteria of physiological flora of gastrointestinal tract may become pathogenic. each complaint which causes injury  of gastrointestinal wall integrity permits bacteria to penetrate the tissues and  affect the tissue cells. since mast cells represent one of very important and numerous cellular elements of the gastrointestinal tract walls, bacteria can exert the effects on them. therefore, the aim of our study was to examine the influence of four strains of intestinal mucosa-associated bacteria--bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides fragilis, bifidobacterium adolescentis and escherichia coli on the mast cell reactivity. our experiments were performed in vitro on isolated rat peritoneal mast cells and the reactivity of these cells was estimated on the basis of histamine release. we used the suspensions of whole bacteria, killed by heating at 65 degrees c. we have noticed that the magnitude of bacteria-induced histamine release from mast cells was very low (up to 6.0%) when compared with histamine release induced with con a, compound 48/80 and tnf-alpha. however, all studied bacteria changed the reactivity of mast cells in  anaphylactic (with cona) and anaphylactoid (with compound 48/80) reactions. after 40 min preincubation with b. thetaioataomicron, b. fragilis, b. adolescentis or e. coli cona-induced histamine release was diminished up to 25%, 71%, 58% and and 68% of maximal histamine release, respectively. preincubation of rat mast cells with b. thetaioataomicron, b. fragilis, b. adolescentis or e. coli also changed their reactivity in anaphylactoid reaction with compound 48/80 (histamine release was diminished up to 70%, 63%, 63% and 60%, respectively).

TI  == sepsis alters vessel contraction by adrenoceptor-induced nitric oxide and prostanoid.
AB  == background: alpha-adrenergic agents contract vascular smooth muscle (vsm) and stimulate endothelial release of secondary factors which modulate vsm contraction. our study examined constrictor prostanoid (cpn) and nitric oxide (no) as secondary factors which could alter alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediated contraction during sepsis. methods: sepsis was induced in rats by inoculation of  an implanted sponge with escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis. aortic rings  at 24 h from septic (n = 21) and control (n = 21) rats were suspended in physiological salt solution (pss) with or without blockers to no (n(g)-monomethylarginine), cpn (mefenamic acid, mfa), or thromboxane a2 (sq29548). contraction dose-response curves were generated to determine maximal contraction force (f(max)) and pd2 (sensitivity) to phenylephrine in each experimental group. results: sepsis increased f(max) to phenylephrine (phe) (1.18 vs 0.90 g, sem 0.0703). cox inhibition reduced the f(max) in control (0.63 vs 0.90 g, sem 0.0675) but not in septic animals (1.19 vs 1.18 g, sem 0.0433). txa2  receptor inhibition did not alter f(max) in control (1.017 vs 0.973 g, sem 0.0959) or septic animals (1.28 vs 1.12 g, sem 0.0823). nos inhibition enhanced the f(max) in both nonseptic (2.03 vs 0.83 g, sem 0.0523) and septic rats (1.96 vs 1.15 g, sem 0.0526), but did less so in the septic animals. conclusions: phe-induced f(max) is determined by a balance between phe-stimulated vsm alpha-adrenoceptor activity, and phe-stimulated endothelial release of cpn and no. sepsis enhances total phe-induced f(max) by increasing vsm alpha-adrenoceptor activity and reducing phe-stimulated endothelial release of dilator no. sepsis abolishes the phe-stimulated endothelial release of cpn. phe-stimulated cpn is not thromboxane a2, but could be a nonprostanoid dilator in the lipoxygenase (hete) or cytochrome p450 (eet) pathways.

TI  == elution of metronidazole and gentamicin from polymethylmethacrylate beads.
AB  == objective: to characterize the elution and bioactivity of metronidazole and gentamicin sulfate polymerized, individually and in combination, with polymethylmethacrylate (pmma). study design: in vitro experimental study. methods: pmma beads containing metronidazole (3 concentrations), gentamicin sulfate, or metronidazole and gentamicin sulfate were immersed in 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline in triplicate. eluent was replaced at specified time intervals for 1 or 21 days, and antibiotic concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. changes in antibiotic bioactivity attributable to polymerization or copolymerization of the antibiotics with pmma,  ethylene oxide sterilization, and storage of aipmma beads containing metronidazole were evaluated. results: antibiotic elution patterns were similar for all groups. day 1 elution for groups containing metronidazole or gentamicin individually represented a mean 63%-66% and 79%, respectively, of the 21-day total. approximately 50% of the day 1 elution occurred during the first hour. the elution of metronidazole was dose dependent. the elution of metronidazole (day 3-21) and gentamicin (all days) was significantly greater when metronidazole and  gentamicin were combined (p <.05). the addition of metronidazole delayed polymerization of pmma. neither polymerization nor copolymerization of metronidazole and gentamicin with pmma, gas sterilization, or 2-month storage of  beads containing metronidazole significantly affected antimicrobial bioactivity.  conclusions: metronidazole elution from pmma was dose dependent. copolymerization of metronidazole and gentamicin sulfate in pmma resulted in increased rates of elution. intraoperative preparation of metronidazole-impregnated pmma beads is not practical, but sterilization and storage for 2 months should not affect efficacy. clinical relevance: the local delivery of biologically active metronidazole and gentamicin by elution from pmma is feasible.

TI  == comparative analysis of viral pathogens and potential indicators in shellfish.
AB  == shellfish can be responsible of outbreaks of infectious diseases and current health measures do not guarantee the absence of viral pathogens in this product.  here we examine the presence of pathogenic viruses and potential indicators in shellfish in a comparative analysis.sixty shellfish samples collected in three areas with different levels of faecal contamination were analysed for escherichia coli, total coliforms, clostridium perfringens, somatic coliphages, f-specific phages of rna (f-rna), bacteriophages infecting bacteroides fragilis ryc2056, human adenovirus, enterovirus and hepatitis a virus (hav). viruses were eluted in a glycine buffer at ph 10. the overall percentage of viral pathogens detected was 47% for human adenoviruses, 19% for enteroviruses and 24% for hav. since all the  samples positive for enterovirus and hav were also positives for human adenovirus, the latter may be considered useful as a molecular index of viral contamination in shellfish. no significant differences in the bioaccumulation of  bacteria and bacteriophages for oysters or mussels were observed. it was found that the probability of detection of any of the pathogenic virus decreases as the temperature of shellfish growing waters increases. however, the probability of detecting viruses increases when phages of b. fragilis are found. although more data are needed in order to fulfil the need of viral indicators for controlling the presence of human viruses in shellfish, the obtained results indicate that phages infecting b. fragilis ryc2056 could be a suitable group of bacteriophages  to be used as an indicator of the presence of viruses in shellfish.

TI  == t-cell proliferative responses following sepsis in neonatal rats.
AB  == both experimental and clinical evidence suggest a suppression of t-cell function  in burn and sepsis. the objective of the present study was to evaluate splenocyte and purified t-cell proliferative response and il-2 production in septic neonatal rats. we also examined if alterations in t-cell proliferation and il-2 production in neonatal sepsis is due to elevation in pge2. pge2 is known to play a significant role in t-cell suppression during sepsis in adults. sepsis was induced in 15-day-old neonatal sprague-dawley rats by implanting 0.1 cm3 of fecal pellet impregnated with escherichia coli (50 cfu) and bacteroides fragilis (10(3) cfu). animals receiving fecal pellets without the bacteria were designated as sterile. a group of septic and sterile rats were treated with pge2 synthesis inhibitors, ns398 and resveratrol. these treatments of animals allowed us to evaluate the role of pge2 in t-cell suppression during neonatal sepsis. splenocytes as well as purified t cells were prepared and then proliferative response and il-2 productive capacities were measured. a significant suppression  of splenocyte proliferation and il-2 production was noticed in both sterile and septic animals compared to the t cells from unoperated control rats. in contrast, the proliferation and il-2 production by nylon wool purified t cells in sterile rats was not significantly different from control rats, whereas, a significant suppression in con a-mediated t-cell proliferation and il-2 production noticed in septic rat t cells compared to the sterile and control rat t cells. such decrease in t-cell proliferation and il-2 production was accompanied with 20-25% deaths in neonates implanted with septic pellets. no mortality was noted in sterile-implanted neonates. treatment of animals with cox-1 inhibitor had no effect on t-cell proliferation response in both septic and sterile groups, whereas cox-2 inhibitor abrogated the decrease in t-cell proliferative response in the septic group. the treatment of animals with cox-2 inhibitor also significantly prevented the sepsis-associated mortality in neonates. in conclusion, the present study demonstrated t-cell suppression during neonatal sepsis is accompanied by a decrease in il-2 production. such suppressions were ameliorated with cox-2 inhibitor suggesting a role for pge2 in the suppressed t-cell-mediated immune function in neonatal sepsis.

TI  == transposon-induced norfloxacin-sensitive mutants of bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.
AB  == to elucidate the mechanism of norfloxacin (a fluoroquinolone) resistance of bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a member of the b. fragilis group, we isolated transposon-induced mutants sensitive to this agent using tn4351. four norfloxacin-sensitive mutants showed reduced levels of resistance, at least, to ethidium bromide. cloning and sequencing of three chromosomal fragments adjacent  to tn4351 from the mutants revealed that two partial open reading frames (orfs) were disrupted by a transposon. amino acid sequences of partial orf products had  strong homologies to those of escherichia coli recb and b. ovatus transketolase.  two mutants carried a recb homolog inserted by tn4351 together with r751 (cointegration) and by itself (simple transposition) at the amino- and carboxyl-terminal portions, respectively. since mutations in recb produce e. coli cells sensitive to dna-damaging treatments by quinolones, it is concluded that decreases of the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the agents for b. thetaiotaomicron resulted from disruption of the recb homolog. another mutant carried a transketolase gene inserted by tn4351. there is no reasonable explanation why disruption of the transketolase gene caused a decrease of the mic of norfloxacin for this organism, although streptococcus pneumoniae recp related  to dna recombination was reported to be transketolase.

TI  == evaluation of potential indicators of viral contamination in shellfish and their  applicability to diverse geographical areas.
AB  == the distribution of the concentration of potential indicators of fecal viral pollution in shellfish was analyzed under diverse conditions over 18 months in diverse geographical areas. these microorganisms have been evaluated in relation  to contamination by human viral pathogens detected in parallel in the analyzed shellfish samples. thus, significant shellfish-growing areas from diverse countries in the north and south of europe (greece, spain, sweden, and the united kingdom) were defined and studied by analyzing different physicochemical parameters in the water and the levels of escherichia coli, f-specific rna bacteriophages, and phages infecting bacteroides fragilis strain ryc2056 in the shellfish produced, before and after depuration treatments. a total of 475 shellfish samples were studied, and the results were statistically analyzed. according to statistical analysis, the presence of human viruses seems to be related to the presence of all potential indicators in the heavily contaminated areas, where e. coli would probably be suitable as a fecal indicator. the f-rna phages, which are present in higher numbers in northern europe, seem to be significantly related to the presence of viral contamination in shellfish, with a very weak predictive value for hepatitis a virus, human adenovirus, and enterovirus and a stronger one for norwalk-like virus. however, it is important to note that shellfish produced in a or clean b areas can sporadically contain human viruses even in the absence of e. coli or f-rna phages. the data presented  here will be useful in defining microbiological parameters for improving the sanitary control of shellfish consumed raw or barely cooked.

AB  == aim: the present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. methods: we identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). results: nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. a single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per ml of bile (> 105 cfu/ml). the predominant gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). the predominant gram-positive bacteria were enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. all gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (cim90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/ml. gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. although all five isolates of e. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) e. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. conclusion: e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis and streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.

TI  == relevance and utility of peritoneal cultures in patients with peritonitis.
AB  == background: the pathogenic organisms responsible for the manifestations of secondary peritonitis have been well characterized through almost 30 years of experimental and clinical studies. enteric gram-negative organisms and anaerobes  predominate, with escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis, respectively, being  the most frequent isolates. this flora is remarkably consistent across patients and institutions. as a result of this consistency and the availability of well-established effective empiric antimicrobial regimens, many surgeons believe  that cultures of peritoneal exudates in patients with peritonitis offer no useful information and no clinical benefit. methods: review of pertinent antibiotic and  management trials in the management of intraabdominal infection. results: there is increasing evidence that identification of organisms resistant to the chosen empiric antibiotic regimen portends a higher likelihood of failure. what is not clear is whether postoperative changes in the regimen in accordance with sensitivity patterns of the isolates offers any clinical advantage. in most circumstances, the data provided allow for simplification of the antibiotic regimen. conclusion: the potential for reducing antibiotic exposure and the value of information derived from surveillance of microbial sensitivity patterns support the routine performance of peritoneal cultures.

TI  == bacteriology of anal fistulae.
AB  == objective: to evaluate by bacteriological analysis the possible relationship between the chronicity of perianal fistulae and the presence of probable permanent infection of the fistulae. material and methods: the study included 27  patients, 21 men and 6 women who had undergone surgery for chronic perianal fistulae type ii (according to the parks classification). a total of 27 samples of their fistulous tracts were sent to the microbiology department for the identification of germs. all samples were taken from the theatre and delivered to the laboratory in the same manner. they were then processed under de same conditions in terms of dilutions, inoculation and culture mediums used for the identification of germs in the tracks of the fistulae. results: a total of 45 were isolated from 21 different species of microorganisms. most samples (78.26%)  had polymicrobic growth. the predominant species were: escherichia coli (45.45%), bacteroides fragilis (16.66%), staphylococcus aureus (12.12%) and streptococcus viridans (12.12%). no mycobacteria were found in any specimen. conclusions: anal  fistulae can be colonized by poli- or mononormal intestinal or skin microbacterial flora or a combination of both. this report suggests that neither  the type or the number of germs its related to the chronicity of cryptoglandular  anal fistulae.

TI  == [a questionnaire survey on the theory of postoperative infection prophylaxis in urology].
AB  == a questionnaire survey on the theory of postoperative infection prophylaxis was conducted to obtain the consensus on perioperative antimicrobial use among urologists in japan in the period from april to july 2000. sixty-three of the 87  urologists replied, and the following consensus was obtained. an antimicrobial prophylaxis (amp) agent should be chosen based on their efficacy against the pathogens expected to be contaminants, such as escherichia coli, staphylococcus spp., klebsiella pneumoniae and bacteroides fragilis group. use an amp agent that achieves a bactericidal concentrations in both the serum and operating site. use  an amp agent that has little unfavourable side effects. the newer agents should be considered as a therapeutics for postoperative infections. the therapeutic antimicrobial agents having no cross-resistance to the amp agents should be used, if postoperative infection is suspected or developed. the most commonly used agent for clean operations are cefazolin (cez), followed by cefotiam (ctm) and piperacillin (pipc), in this order. for clean-contaminated operations, the most commonly used agent is ctm, followed by pipc and cez.

TI  == development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == a membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. the 16s rdna sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. digoxigenin (dig)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. hybridization signals were read by nbt/bcip color development. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. fragilis, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, r. bromii, r. callidus, r. albus, bifidobacterium  longum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, eubacterium biforme, e. aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus,escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. the result was also confirmed by  using specific pcr methods for these bacteria.

TI  == occurrence and levels of indicator bacteriophages in bathing waters throughout europe.
AB  == somatic coliphages, f-specific rna bacteriophages, bacteriophages infecting bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli and enterococci were counted in bathing waters in the late spring and summer. we tested fresh and marine bathing waters from north, south, east and west europe expected to contain between 100 and 500 e. coli per 100 ml, although wider ranges were sometimes found. bacteriophages were counted after concentration, since a preliminary study proved that this step was necessary to obtain positive counts. during monitoring, a first-line quality  control with reference materials for bacteria and bacteriophages was performed by all the laboratories participating in the study. the same microbes were also counted in raw sewage samples from various areas in europe, where the bacterial indicators and the three groups of bacteriophages were detected in roughly the same numbers. all groups of bacteriophages were detected in both fresh and marine bathing waters throughout europe. reliable and complete results from 147 samples  showed that for log-transformed values, e. coli and bacteriophages were slightly  correlated. however, the slope of the regression line changed according to e. coli concentration and the correlation diminished when this concentration was close to zero per 100 ml. the ratios between e. coli and phages in bathing waters differed significantly from those in sewage. the relative amounts of bacteriophages, mainly somatic coliphages and phages infecting bact. fragilis ryc2056, increased in bathing waters with low e. coli concentration, especially in seawater samples containing < 100 e. coli per 100 ml. the relationship of bacteriophages with respect to enterococci paralleled that of bacteriophages with respect to e. coli. somatic coliphages and bacteriophages infecting bact. fragilis are useful to predict the presence of some pathogens with the same origin as present bacterial indicators but with higher survival rates.

TI  == effect of a single percutaneous abscess drainage puncture and imipenem therapy, alone or in combination, in treatment of mixed-infection abscesses in mice.
AB  == the importance of supplementary imipenem therapy after a single percutaneous abscess drainage puncture was studied in a mouse model of established mixed-infection abscesses. animals were treated for 3 days with daily dosing regimens of 384 to 1,536 mg/kg of body weight that took into account the short half-life of this antibiotic in mice. imipenem therapy in conjunction with abscess drainage was significantly better than drainage alone in reducing the escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis counts in the mixed infections. furthermore, the killing of b. fragilis by the combination of imipenem therapy and abscess drainage was significantly better than that by imipenem treatment alone. the maximum reductions in e. coli and b. fragilis counts were 1.1 and 2.2  log(10) cfu/abscess, respectively. in contrast, the in vitro activity of imipenem was significantly better (maximum reduction, > or =6.2 log(10) cfu/ml) against mixed cultures of the same strains even when bacterial numbers similar to those found in the abscesses were used. comparable in vivo activity was achieved only when treatment was started 30 min before inoculation (reduction for both strains, > or =6.1 log(10) cfu/abscess), but this killing was significantly diminished if  the start of treatment was delayed until > or =12 h after inoculation. imipenem concentrations in abscess tissue reached levels above the mic for e. coli for >60% of the dosing interval. possible reasons for the reduced activity of imipenem in vivo are discussed, and we conclude that standard susceptibility tests overestimate the efficacy of this antibiotic against the organisms present  in these abscesses.

TI  == effects of laparoscopic lavage on adhesion formation and peritoneum in an animal  model of pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  == study objectives: to develop an animal model of pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) that simulates intraluminal tubal damage and adhesion formation seen in human pid, and to evaluate peritoneal effects of laparoscopic lavage with 1% povidone-iodine, 0.5% povidone-iodine, and 0.05% chlorhexidine gluconate solutions. design: prospective, randomized, controlled study (canadian task force classification i). setting: animal research operating room facility. subjects: forty-five 1-year-old pasteurella-free new zealand white rabbits. intervention: laparoscopy with instillation of one of five lavage solutions after bacterial inoculation with neisseria gonorrhoeae, bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, and peptococcus niger. measurements and main results: histologic evaluation revealed significantly more peritoneal inflammation after lavage with all three solutions than after no lavage or lavage with normal saline. gross adhesion formation was visible in only one rabbit after lavage with normal saline. one animal having lavage with 1% povidone-iodine died immediately after injection for sedation before laparoscopic lavage, and was not included in the final results. conclusion: bacterial inoculation using an intrauterine insemination catheter did not produce clinical adhesions in 43 of 44 rabbits. histologic evaluation revealed significantly more peritoneal inflammation in the lavage with povidone-iodine and chlorhexidine gluconate compared with no lavage or lavage with normal saline.

TI  == environmental factors influencing human viral pathogens and their potential indicator organisms in the blue mussel, mytilus edulis: the first scandinavian report.
AB  == this study was carried out in order to investigate human enteric virus contaminants in mussels from three sites on the west coast of sweden, representing a gradient of anthropogenic influence. mussels were sampled monthly  during the period from february 2000 to july 2001 and analyzed for adeno-, entero-, norwalk-like, and hepatitis a viruses as well as the potential viral indicator organisms somatic coliphages, f-specific rna bacteriophages, bacteriophages infecting bacteroides fragilis, and escherichia coli. the influence of environmental factors such as water temperature, salinity, and land  runoff on the occurrence of these microbes was also included in this study. enteric viruses were found in 50 to 60% of the mussel samples, and there were no  pronounced differences between the samples from the three sites. e. coli counts exceeded the limit for category a for shellfish sanitary safety in 40% of the samples from the sites situated in fjords. however, at the site in the outer archipelago, this limit was exceeded only once, in march 2001, when extremely high levels of atypical indole-negative strains of e. coli were registered at all three sites. the environmental factors influenced the occurrence of viruses and phages differently, and therefore, it was hard to find a coexistence between them. this study shows that, for risk assessment, separate modeling should be done for every specific area, with special emphasis on environmental factors such as temperature and land runoff. the present standard for human fecal contamination, e. coli, seems to be an acceptable indicator of only local sanitary contamination; it is not a reliable indicator of viral contaminants in mussels. to protect consumers and get verification of "clean" mussels, it seems necessary to analyze for viruses as well. the use of a molecular index of the human contamination of swedish shellfish underscores the need for reference laboratories with high-technology facilities.

TI  == toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4)-deficient murine macrophage cell line as an in vitro  assay system to show tlr4-independent signaling of bacteroides fragilis lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps) activate cells of innate immunity, such as macrophages, by stimulating signaling through toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4). we and others have hypothesized that lps derived from different bacterial species may function through tlr4-independent mechanisms. to test this hypothesis, we have generated using a nonviral transformation procedure a bone marrow-derived macrophage cell line called 10scncr/23 from mouse strain c57bl/10scncr. this mouse strain has a deletion of the tlr4 locus, causing the mouse strain to be nonresponsive to stimulation by lps from escherichia coli while responding normally to other bacterial substrates, such as lipoteichoic acid (lta) from staphylococcus aureus, which signal tlr4 independently. stimulation with lta induces five- and sixfold increases in 10scncr/23 cell line tumor necrosis factor alpha and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (mip-2) secretion, but no increases in either cytokine were found when cells were stimulated with e. coli lps. bacteroides fragilis-derived lps, however, can effectively stimulate mip-2 expression in the absence of functional tlr4 in the 10scncr/23 cell line. this gives rise to the notion that lps from some bacterial species will utilize alternative receptors to stimulate the innate immune response.

TI  == evaluation of a new etest for detecting metallo-beta-lactamases in routine clinical testing.
AB  == several etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) gradient formats were developed for detection of metallo-beta-lactamases based on the reduction of imipenem (ip) or ceftazidime (tz) mics in the presence of edta or 2-mercaptopropionic acid (mpa).  the etest metallo-beta-lactamase (etest mbl) strips consisted of a double-sided seven-dilution range of ip or tz (4 to 256 microg/ml) and ip or tz (1 to 64 microg/ml) overlaid with a constant concentration of edta or mpa. the prototype strips were evaluated on several agar media (brain heart infusion agar, isosensitest agar, nutrient agar, and mueller-hinton agar for aerobes and brucella blood agar for anaerobes) with 138 challenge strains: acinetobacter spp. (n = 9), aeromonas spp. (n = 8), chryseobacterium spp. (n = 28), escherichia coli (n = 1), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 14), proteus  mirabilis (n = 3), serratia spp. (n = 10), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 43), sphingobacterium spp. (n = 3), and bacteroides fragilis group (n = 15). pcr analysis using specific primers for imp-1, l1, ccra, and bla(b/c) confirmed the presence of the metallo-beta-lactamase genes. enzyme assays were also performed with ip as an indicator substrate followed by edta inhibition profiles. edta was  found to be a better inhibitor of metallo-beta-lactamases, especially for anaerobes. ip was a better than tz. mueller-hinton agar was the preferred medium, particularly when compared to isosensitest agar, which frequently produced falsely low mics for ip. etest ip plus ip-edta with mueller-hinton agar had a sensitivity of 94% (79 of 84) and specificity of 95% (124 of 130). the etest mbl  strip appears to be an acceptable diagnostic reagent to detect metallo-beta-lactamase phenotypes in the clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == depuration dynamics of viruses in shellfish.
AB  == the consumption of shellfish has been associated with viral infections even in cases where shellfish complied with the current regulation, which is based on bacterial analysis. in this study, depuration rates of potential indicators and human viruses have been analysed in order to study the use of complementary parameters for evaluating the microbiological quality of depurated shellfish. depuration of naturally highly polluted mussels has been evaluated and analyses for escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, somatic coliphages, f-rna phages and bacteriophages infecting bacteroides fragilis ryc2056 and hsp40, human adenovirus, enterovirus have been done. seawater of the depuration tank was disinfected by uv irradiation, ozone and passed through a skimmer and a biological filter. the correct functioning of the depuration tank was monitored by the quantification of total organic carbon (toc), nh4+ and total aerobic bacteria in the seawater. to study the relation between the bacteriophages and the human viruses analysed, a logistic regression model was applied. f-rna phages are significantly related to human adenoviruses and enteroviruses. thus, they can be used as a complementary parameter for evaluating the efficiency of the depuration treatment. somatic coliphages are also significantly associated with enteroviruses. bacteriophages infecting b. fragilis hsp40 were analysed by the double-agar-layer (dal) method, which quantifies infectious viruses, and by nested pcr, which detects the presence of the genome of these phages. the highest sensitivity of the molecular techniques was demonstrated and the results obtained are an indicator of a close relation between positive results by pcr and the presence of infectious viral particles in shellfish. all shellfish samples were negative for human viruses by pcr after 5 days of depuration treatment and the results obtained applying a regression model also showed negative results or nearly for f-rna phages and bacteriophages infecting b. fragilis ryc2056. thus, in this specific depuration treatment, 5 days may be necessary to assess the sanitary quality of shellfish.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems.  thirty-two species 2,697 strains of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of  moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), escherichia coli (n = 250), citrobacter freundii (n = 153), citrobacter koseri (n = 97), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), serratia marcescens (n = 153), proteus mirabillis (n = 103), proteus vulgaris (n = 77), morganella morganii (n = 141), providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii; n = 154), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), pseudomonas putida (n = 49), burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), acinetobactor iwoffii (n = 30), bacteroides fragilis group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola; n = 124). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lowffii throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae  yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained  the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however,  the decrease in the antibacterial activity of czop against h. influenzae was suggested.

AB  == gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus produces levan from sucrose by a secreted levansucrase (lsda). a levanase-encoding gene ( lsdb), starting 51 bp downstream  of the lsda gene, was cloned from strain srt4. the lsdb gene (1605 bp) encodes a  protein (calculated molecular mass 58.4 kda) containing a putative 36-amino-acid  signal peptide at the n-terminus. the deduced amino acid sequence shares 34%, 33%, 32%, and 29% identities with levanases from actinomyces naeslundii, bacillus subtilis, paenibacillus polymyxa, and bacteroides fragilis, respectively. the lsdb expression in escherichia coli under the control of the t7 rna polymerase promoter resulted in an active enzyme which hydrolyzed levan, inulin, 1-kestose,  raffinose, and sucrose, but not melezitose. levanase activity was maximal at ph 6.0 and 30 degrees c, and it was not inhibited by the metal ion chelator edta or  the denaturing agents dithiothreitol and beta-mercaptoethanol. the recombinant lsdb showed a fourfold higher rate of hydrolysis on levan compared to inulin, and the reaction on both substrates resulted in the successive liberation of the terminal fructosyl residues without formation of intermediate oligofructans, indicating a non-specific exo-levanase activity.

TI  == the biological activity of a liposomal complete core lipopolysaccharide vaccine.
AB  == a vaccine that induces humoral immunity to lipopolysaccharide (lps), while remaining non-pyrogenic should be beneficial, as high levels of antibodies against lps are associated with a reduced risk of adverse outcome. however, pure  lps or bacteria expressing lps are generally considered too toxic to be used as vaccines. recently, a novel, immunogenic complete core lipopolysaccharide vaccine has been described, which has been designed to prevent endotoxin-related inflammatory reactions in surgical and high-risk hospitalized patients. in vivo studies have shown that while administration of the vaccine to rabbits results in no toxicity over 7 days, it does induce significantly enhanced antibody responses towards a broad range of clinically relevant gram-negative lpss. here we show that encapsulation of the four complete core lps types escherichia coli k12, escherichia coli r1, bacteroides fragilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa into liposomes greatly reduces the ability of a given amount of lps to induce tnf-alpha production in vitro from human monocytes. in contrast to previous studies of liposomal lps, we demonstrate a reduction in activity of approximately 100,000-fold; a reduction approximately 100-1,000-fold more than that previously  described. the signalling by the liposomal lps appears to be entirely dependent on serum factors, though this can be partially restored by soluble cd14 or, to a  lesser extent, by lipopolysaccharide binding protein. time-course experiments reveal that liposomal lps signalling shows similar kinetics to pure lps signalling. therefore, as well as inducing specific antibody responses, liposomal lps demonstrates characteristics suitable for use as a vaccine to be used in human beings.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == isolation and characterization of clv25, a bacteroides fragilis chromosomal transfer factor resembling multiple bacteroides sp. mobilizable transposons.
AB  == horizontal dna transfer contributes significantly to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes in bacteroides fragilis. to further our understanding of dna transfer in b. fragilis, we isolated and characterized a new transfer factor, clv25. clv25 was isolated from b. fragilis lv25 by its capture on the nonmobilizable escherichia coli-bacteroides shuttle vector pgat400deltabglii. similar to other bacteroides sp. transfer factors, clv25 was mobilized in e. coli by the conjugative plasmid r751. using tn1000 mutagenesis and deletion analysis of clv25, two mobilization genes, bmga and bmgb, were identified, whose predicted proteins have similarity to dna relaxases and mobilization proteins, respectively. in particular, bmga and bmgb were homologous to moca and mocb, respectively, the two mobilization proteins of the b. fragilis mobilizable transposon tn4399. a cis-acting origin of transfer (orit) was localized to a 353-bp region that included nearly all of the intergenic region between bmgb and  orf22 and overlapped with the 3' end of orf22. this orit contained a putative nic site sequence but showed no significant similarity to the orit regions of other transfer factors, including tn4399. despite the lack of sequence similarity between the orits of clv25 and tn4399, a mutation in the clv25 putative dna relaxase, bmga, was partially complemented by tn4399. in addition to the functional cross-reaction with tn4399, a second distinguishing feature of clv25 is that predicted proteins have similarity to proteins encoded not only by tn4399 but by several bacteroides sp. transfer factors, including nbu1, nbu2, ctndot, tn4555, and tn5520.

TI  == characterization of omp200, a porin gene complex from bacteroides fragilis: omp121 and omp71, gene sequence, deduced amino acid sequences and predictions of  porin structure.
AB  == the high mw porin protein complex (omp200, composed of omp121 and omp71) from bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285 was purified and tryptic peptide sequences were used to design degenerate oligonucleotide primers which were then used as a first step in amplification, identification and sequencing of the omp121 gene (genbank  accession number af357210). sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 3378 bases. the deduced amino acid sequence (which contained the experimentally determined peptide sequences) has 1125 or 1116 amino acids (depending on which start codon is used); the mature protein consists of 1096 amino acids, has a predicted mw of 121.4 and a theoretical pi of 6.32. it is preceded by a 29 or 18  amino acid signal peptide which includes a typical hydrophobic region near the n-terminus (vlvlvl). hydropathy plots of the deduced amino acid sequence of b. fragilis omp121 display striking similarity with those of escherichia coli ompc (a 16-stranded porin) and fepa (a 22-stranded ligand-gated transport protein). three-dimensional modeling of b. fragilis omp121 (based on 1d and 3d sequence profiles, coupled with secondary structure and solvation potential information) indicated that the closest homologues in terms in fold conservation were the e. coli 16-stranded porins (e.g. osma) and 22-stranded ligand gated transport proteins (e.g. fepa). the omp71 gene sequence was identified using the tryptic peptides to search the published bacteroides genome data base. we found that omp71 is located immediately downstream of omp121 and confirmed this with pcr analysis. omp71 has no known homologues but does share some characteristics with  the porphyromonas ragb antigen.

TI  == early bacterial and inflammatory responses to antibiotic therapy in a model of polymicrobial peritonitis in rats.
AB  == objective: to assess the consequences of different more or less selective treatments on the microbiological and inflammatory responses within the peritoneum. methods: the early effects of various antibiotic regimens were evaluated in a model of polymicrobial peritonitis with specifically prepared organisms. six regimens (amoxycillin plus gentamicin, pefloxacin, ornidazole, pefloxacin plus ornidazole, imipenem and imipenem plus gentamicin) were evaluated at 24 h and 3 days in a non-fatal model of peritonitis in rats achieved by implantation of a capsule containing escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis and enterococcus faecalis. results: therapies that disregarded several organisms were associated with persistence of the strains and an increased peritoneal inflammatory response within the peritoneum. in contrast, therapies active against enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes were associated with decreases of all the inoculated organisms and a smaller inflammatory response. conclusion: therapies that disregarded the microorganisms implicated in peritoneal infection  are associated with delayed bacterial eradication. the persistence of these organisms within the peritoneal fluid might be involved in prolonged peritoneal inflammation. although it disregards enterococci, the standard therapy, represented by therapy against enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes, demonstrates satisfactory effects towards all the inoculated organisms. this apparent contradiction could be related to mechanisms of bacterial synergy.

TI  == removal of bacterial and viral faecal indicator organisms in a waste stabilization pond system in choconta, cundinamarca (colombia).
AB  == a major objective for domestic wastewater treatment using waste stabilization pond systems is the removal of pathogenic microorganisms. traditional evaluation  parameters for faecal contamination are the total and faecal coliforms. however,  epidemiological studies, environmental resistance and the behaviour in the treatment systems, show that viruses are an important disease agent and even more resistant to disinfection than bacteria. therefore, it is important to introduce  viruses as a faecal indicator and to compare them with the traditional bacterial  indicators. a waste stabilization pond system was evaluated in the municipality of choconta, cundinamarca (colombia), for the removal of faecal indicators (such  as escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, clostridium perfringens) and viruses like f+, somatic and bacteroides fragilis phages. the system includes two facultative ponds in series with a flow of 1555 m3/day. samples were collected at the entrance of the system, in the two ponds and from the final effluent. results show a decrease between 0.3 and 4.7 logarithmic units in the bacterial indicators and between 1 and 4.6 logarithmic units with viral indicators.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against local bacterial isolates.
AB  == introduction: the emergence of resistance to common antimicrobials in bacteria has been increasingly reported in various countries. empirical antimicrobial therapy of various infections would therefore need to be reviewed. the introduction of new fluoroquinolones has created an interest in the use of these  as possible agents in the empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections. materials and methods: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, against 400 clinical bacterial isolates was determined by the e-test method. results: all streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (penicillin sensitive or resistant) were susceptible to moxifloxacin. similarly,  both beta-lactamase and non beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin. as for enterobacteriaceae, 88.6% of the isolates tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin with mic < 8 mg/l, but resistance was noted for some of proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli. enterococci and acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to moxifloxacin, whilst the anaerobes tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin. conclusion: moxifloxacin has good in vitro activity against common  organisms associated with community and nosocomial infections, with the exception of enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria. there was good anti-anaerobic activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridum spp. results of this study are consistent with other similar published in vitro studies.

TI  == aerobic-type ribonucleotide reductase in the anaerobe bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis, a component of the normal intestinal flora, is an obligate  anaerobe capable of long-term survival in the presence of air. survival is attributed to an elaborate oxidative stress response that controls the induction  of more than 28 peptides, but there is limited knowledge concerning the identities of these peptides. in this report, rna fingerprinting by arbitrarily primed pcr identified five new genes whose expression increased following exposure to o2. nucleotide sequence analysis of the cloned genes indicated that they encoded an outer membrane protein, an aspartate decarboxylase, an efflux pump, heat shock protein htpg, and an nrda ortholog constituting the large subunit of a class ia ribonucleotide reductase (rrase). attention was focused on  the nrda gene since class i rrases are obligate aerobic enzymes catalyzing the reduction of ribonucleoside 5'-diphosphates by a mechanism that requires molecular oxygen for activity. sequence analysis of the nrd locus showed that two genes, nrda and nrdb, are located in the same orientation in a 4.5-kb region. northern hybridization and primer extension experiments confirmed induction of the genes by o2 and suggested they are an operon. the b. fragilis nrda and nrdb genes were overexpressed in escherichia coli, and cdp reductase assays confirmed  that they encoded an active enzyme. the enzyme activity was inhibited by hydroxyurea, and atp was shown to be a positive effector of cdp reductase activity, while datp was an inhibitor, indicating that the enzyme was a class ia  rrase. a nrda mutant was viable under anaerobic conditions but had decreased survival following exposure to o2, and it could not rapidly resume growth after o2 treatment. the results presented indicate that during aerobic conditions b. fragilis nrdab may have a role in maintaining deoxyribonucleotide pools for dna repair and growth recovery.

TI  == isolation and characterization of btf-37: chromosomal dna captured from bacteroides fragilis that confers self-transferability and expresses a pilus-like structure in bacteroides spp. and escherichia coli.
AB  == we report the isolation and preliminary characterization of btf-37, a new 52-kb transfer factor isolated from bacteroides fragilis clinical isolate lv23. btf-37  was obtained by the capture of new dna in the nonmobilizable bacteroides-escherichia coli shuttle vector pgat400deltabglii using a functional  assay. btf-37 is self-transferable within and from bacteroides and also self-transfers in e. coli. partial dna sequencing, colony hybridization, and pcr  revealed the presence of tet element-specific sequences in btf-37. in addition, tn5520, a small mobilizable transposon that we described previously (g. vedantam, t. j. novicki, and d. w. hecht, j. bacteriol. 181:2564-2571, 1999), was also coisolated within btf-37. scanning and transmission electron microscopy of tet element-containing bacteroides spp. and btf-37-harboring bacteroides and e. coli  strains revealed the presence of pilus-like cell surface structures. these structures were visualized in bacteroides spp. only when btf-37 and tet element strains were induced with subinhibitory concentrations of tetracycline and resembled those encoded by e. coli broad-host-range plasmids. we conclude that we have captured a new, self-transferable transfer factor from b. fragilis lv23 and  that this new factor encodes a tetracycline-inducible bacteroides sp. conjugation apparatus.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. special references to bacteria isolated between april 1998  and march 1999].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from april 1998 to march 1999). the number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. a total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). in primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of gram-positive aerobes and pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. on the whole, among gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from  postoperative infections. among gram-positive anaerobes, peptostreptococcus spp.  and streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. among gram-negative aerobes,  e. coli, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. among gram-negative anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. in primary infections, the percentage of gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of gram-positive and gram-negative  anaerobes have gradually declined. in postoperative infections, the percentage of gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. the percentage of mrsa among s. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. the susceptibilities of b. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. among other bacteria in b. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. e. coli and k. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. we found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of s. aureus and enterococcus spp.

TI  == production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines of human placental trophoblasts in response to pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == objective: we studied the production of cytokines in purified cultures of human term trophoblasts in the presence of pathogenic strains of escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, mycoplasma hominis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae, which have been identified in intrauterine infections.  methods: human villous trophoblasts were isolated from term placentas after cesarean section and purified by several steps. after 6, 12, and 24 hours of incubation with the different heat-inactivated bacteria, interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), interleukin-6 (il-6), interleukin-8 (il-8), and interleukin-10 (il-10) as well as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) were measured from supernatants by commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. expression of cytokine mrnas was determined by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). results: in nonstimulated cultures, low (il-1beta and tnf-alpha) and high (il-6, il-8, and il-10) basal secretion of cytokines was detectable. the pathogenic microorganisms induced a dose- and time-dependent release of il-1beta, il-6, il-8, and il-10, whereas tnf-alpha secretion was not elevated. e coli was the most potent inducer followed by b fragilis, s agalactiae, s aureus, and m hominis. transcripts encoding il-1beta, il-6, il-8, or il-10 were elevated in the rt-pcr reactions, suggesting  that transcriptional mechanisms contribute to elevated cytokine expression. conclusion: pathogenic microorganisms stimulated mrna expression and polypeptide  release of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines from placental trophoblasts. induction of both inflammation-promoting and inflammation-inhibiting cytokines by bacterial products could play a role in modulating the inflammatory response associated with chorioamnionitis.

TI  == escherichia coli hemoglobin protease autotransporter contributes to synergistic abscess formation and heme-dependent growth of bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == intra-abdominal infections (iai) continue to be a serious clinical problem. bacterial synergism is an important factor that influences the shift from contamination to iai, leading to the development of lesions and abscess formation. escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis are particularly abundant in iai. the underlying molecular mechanisms of this pathogenic synergy are still unclear. the role of the hemoglobin protease (hbp) autotransporter protein from e. coli in the synergy of iai was investigated. hbp is identical to tsh, a temperature-sensitive hemagglutinin associated with avian pathogenic e. coli. clinical isolates from miscellaneous extraintestinal infections were phenotypically and genotypically screened for hbp. the presence of hbp was significantly associated with e. coli isolated from iai and other extraintestinal infections. in a murine infection model, hbp was shown to contribute to the pathogenic synergy of abscess development. mice immunized with hbp were protected against mixed infections and did not develop abscess lesions. furthermore, an e.  coli wild-type strain that did not induce abscess formation in the synergy model  was transformed with a plasmid encoding the hbp gene, and mixed infections with this strain lead to increased growth of b. fragilis and induction of abscess lesions. growth-promoting studies showed that purified hbp is able to deliver heme to b. fragilis strain be1. in conclusion, results suggest the synergy of abscess formation by e. coli and b. fragilis can be partly explained by the capacity of b. fragilis to intercept hbp and iron from heme to overcome the iron  restrictions imposed by the host.

AB  == sepsis-induced suppression in t-cell proliferation follows deranged ca(2+) signaling in adult rats. in preliminary studies, we observed suppression in t-cell proliferation in septic neonatal rats as well. in this study, we assessed  splenic t-cell cytosolic ca(2+) concentration, [ca(2+)](i), as its elevation plays an important role in t-cell proliferation. also, we investigated the role of pge(2) in sepsis-related changes in t-cell [ca(2+)](i) in animals pretreated with cyclooxygenase-1 (cox-1) inhibitor (resveratrol) and cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) inhibitor (ns-398). sepsis was induced in 15-day-old rat pups by intraperitoneal implantation of fecal pellets containing escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis. the sham group consisted of pups implanted with sterile fecal pellets. septic and sham pups were sacrificed 24 h after implantation and their spleens were removed. the spleens from sham and septic pups, along with spleens from unoperated control pups, were processed for single cell suspensions, and t cells were isolated using nylon wool columns. fura-2 fluorophotometry was employed for the measurement of [ca(2+)](i) (in nm units) in t cells stimulated with concanavalin a (cona). our results show that cona-mediated t-cell [ca(2+)](i) response is significantly suppressed in septic neonatal rats. pretreatment of pups with cox-2, but not cox-1 inhibitor, prevented the decrease  in the [ca(2+)](i) response. these findings suggest that pge(2) might induce the  attenuation in t-cell ca(2+) signaling during sepsis in neonatal rats.

AB  == the treatment of acute bacterial cholangitis requires broad-spectrum antibiotics  to cover against gram-negative aerobic enteric organisms (escherichia coli, klebsiella species, and enterobacter species), gram-positive enterococcus and anaerobic bacteria (bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens). approximately 20% of patients with acute cholangitis fail to respond to conservative treatment with antibiotic therapy and require urgent biliary decompression, which is the mainstay of therapy. this is best accomplished by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp) and placement of a nasobiliary drainage tube or a large bore (10 f or larger) indwelling plastic stent. alternative therapy includes percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage or surgical biliary decompression, but these carry a significantly higher morbidity  and mortality. supportive care includes intravenous fluid hydration to prevent renal failure and close monitoring of vital signs for determination of potential  septicemia.

TI  == gyra mutations associated with quinolone resistance in bacteroides fragilis group strains.
AB  == mutations in the gyra gene contribute considerably to quinolone resistance in escherichia coli. mechanisms for quinolone resistance in anaerobic bacteria are less well studied. the bacteroides fragilis group are the anaerobic organisms most frequently isolated from patients with bacteremia and intraabdominal infections. forty-four clinafloxacin-resistant and-susceptible fecal and clinical isolates of the b. fragilis group (eight bacteroides fragilis, three bacteroides  ovatus, five bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, six bacteroides uniformis, and 22 bacteroides vulgatus) and six atcc strains of the b. fragilis group were analyzed as follows: (i) determination of susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and clinafloxacin by the agar dilution method and (ii) sequencing of the gyra quinolone resistance-determining region (qrdr) located between amino  acid residues equivalent to ala-67 through gln-106 in e. coli. amino acid substitutions were found at hotspots at positions 82 (n = 15) and 86 (n = 8). strains with ser82leu substitutions (n = 13) were highly resistant to all quinolones tested. mutations in other positions of gyra were also frequently found in quinolone-resistant and -susceptible isolates. eight clinical strains that lacked mutations in their qrdr were susceptible to at least two of the quinolones tested. although newer quinolones have good antimicrobial activity against the b. fragilis group, quinolone resistance in b. fragilis strains can be readily selected in vivo. mutational events in the qrdr of gyra seem to contribute to quinolone resistance in bacteroides species.

AB  == to study the utility of an in vitro model system for assessing the effect of low  concentrations of a fluoroquinolone (fq) drug on the ecology of the human intestinal microflora, chemostats containing human fecal flora were exposed to 0.43, 4.3, and 43microg of ciprofloxacin (ci) per milliliter. prior to and during drug exposure, we assayed short-chain fatty acids (scfa), bacterial populations,  and the relative levels of susceptibility of these populations to ci and trovafloxacin (tv), a newer related fq with increased activity against anaerobes. the degree to which ci affected the chemostat ecology was measured statistically  by comparing observed data with the corresponding predicted "no effect" level. no changes in total scfa were observed; only butyrate was significantly higher at the intermediate and high-dose levels. enterococci counts and the levels of susceptibility to ci among enterococci were also unaffected. escherichia coli counts decreased in a dose-dependent manner. susceptibility levels in e. coli followed no interpretable pattern. bacteroides fragilis group (bfg) counts decreased significantly following exposure to 43 and 4.3microg/ml ci. ciprofloxacin susceptibility among the bfg in these chemostats was not determined because the bfg counts were too low (less than 30 colonies per plate) when undiluted chemostat samples were plated. however, within 2 days of exposure to 0.43microg/ml ci, the percentage of bfg resistant to 4microg/ml ci increased to over 95%. before exposure, all bfg were susceptible to both ci (2microg/ml) and tv (0.25microg/ml). all bfg isolated during exposure were resistant to both ci (4microg/ml) and tv (2microg/ml). resistance selection in the bfg was unexpected  as the mic(90) of ci for b. fragilis is 8microg/ml. since the average colon flora is about 20% b. fragilis and other bacteroides, ci may impact the human gut flora even at subtherapeutic levels.

AB  == prri2 is a small cryptic plasmid from the rumen bacterium prevotella ruminicola 223/m2/7 which has been used for the construction of shuttle vectors (prh3 and prri207) that replicate in many bacteroides/prevotella strains as well as in escherichia coli. sequence analysis of prri2 reveals that it is a 3240-bp plasmid carrying two clear open reading frames. rep, encoded by orf1, shows 48 and 47% amino acid sequence identity with repa proteins from bacteroides vulgatus and bacteroides fragilis, respectively. orf2, named pre, shares 34% amino acid sequence identity with a putative plasmid recombination protein from the flavobacterium spp. plasmid pfl1 and 30% amino acid sequence identity with bmph from b. fragilis tn5520. disruption of orf1 with hindiii prevents replication and maintenance in bacteroides spp. hosts, but shuttle vectors carrying prri2 interrupted within orf2, by ecori*, are able to replicate. prri2 shows no significant similarity with the only other p. ruminicola plasmid to have been studied previously, pram4.

TI  == in vivo efficacy of trovafloxacin against bacteroides fragilis in mixed infection with either escherichia coli or a vancomycin-resistant strain of enterococcus faecium in an established-abscess murine model.
AB  == the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of trovafloxacin were studied  in a standardized murine model of established subcutaneous abscesses. daily dosing regimens of 37.5 to 300 mg/kg every 8 h (q8h) or every 24 h (q24h) were started 3 days after inoculation with mixtures containing either bacteroides fragilis-escherichia coli-autoclaved cecal contents (acc) or b. fragilis-vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref)-acc. treatment was continued for 3 or 5 days. the efficacy of treatment was determined by the decrease in abscess bacterial counts and abscess weights, as well as by the reduction in inflammation (biodistribution of (99m)tc-hynic immunoglobulin g) compared to saline-treated controls. trovafloxacin showed a significant dose-response effect on the bacterial counts, weight, and inflammation of b. fragilis-e. coli abscesses after 3 and/or 5 days of treatment. a maximum 3.4 and  3.1 log(10) reduction in cfu/abscess in the respective b. fragilis and e. coli bacterial counts was attained after 5 days of treatment with daily doses of 300 mg/kg. the peak serum concentration was more predictive for effect than the area  under the concentration-time curve. the c(max) was the pharmacodynamic index most predictive for success, and the efficacy of the q24h regimens was significantly better than the q8h regimens. the antibiotic was ineffective against the vref in  mixed infection with b. fragilis, while the killing of the anaerobe in the same combination was significantly less than in the e. coli combination (p < 0.05). we conclude that this is a useful model for studying the activity of antimicrobials  for the treatment of small (<1-cm), undrainable, mixed-infection abscesses. in addition, we have shown for the first time that a decrease in bacterial numbers also leads to a reduction in both abscess weight and inflammation.

TI  == the dnab.dnac complex: a structure based on dimers assembled around an occluded channel.
AB  == replicative helicases are motor proteins that unwind dna at replication forks. escherichia coli dnab is the best characterized member of this family of enzymes. we present the 26 a resolution three-dimensional structure of the dnab hexamer in complex with its loading partner, dnac, obtained from cryo-electron microscopy. analysis of the volume brings insight into the elaborate way the two proteins interact, and provides a structural basis for control of the symmetry state and inactivation of the helicase by dnac. the complex is arranged on the basis of interactions among dnac and dnab dimers. dnac monomers are observed for the first time to arrange as three dumb-bell-shaped dimers that interlock into one of the faces of the helicase. this could be responsible for the freezing of dnab in a c(3) architecture by its loading partner. the central channel of the helicase is  almost occluded near the end opposite to dnac, such that even single-stranded dna could not pass through. we propose that the dnab n-terminal domain is located at  this face.

TI  == modulation of colonic barrier function by the composition of the commensal flora  in the rat.
AB  == background and aims: altered intestinal permeability is a key pathogenetic factor of idiopathic bowel inflammation. we investigated in the rat if changes in the composition of the bowel flora can alter colonic permeability. methods: a colonic segment was surgically excluded from faecal transit and brought out as a loop to  the abdominal wall through two colostomies. the loop was used for colonisation with specific bacterial strains after eradication of the native flora with antibiotics. lumen to blood clearance of dextran (molecular weight 70 000) and mannitol (molecular weight 182) was measured in rats recolonised with a single bacterial strain from rat colonic origin, and in control rats whose colonic loop  was kept free of bacteria by antibiotics. actual colonisation was confirmed by culture of segment effluents. results: colonisation with escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and streptococcus viridans significantly increased lumen to blood clearance of mannitol. colonisation with lactobacillus brevis had the opposite effect and reduced permeability to mannitol. bacteroides fragilis did not induce significant changes. permeability to dextran was not altered by any of the strains tested. conclusions: certain commensal bacteria can modify colonic wall permeability to luminal substances.

TI  == synergy of bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli in the induction of kc gene  expression in mouse peritoneal tissues.
AB  == b. fragilis induces cytokine expression, which can serve as a host signal leading to inflammatory reaction and abscess formation in the peritoneal cavity. we assessed the hypothesis that enteric bacteria may alter the b. fragilis-induced expression of kc genes in mouse peritoneal tissues (mpt). after c57bl/6 mice were inoculated with abscess-forming mixture containing b. fragilis in the presence or absence of e. coli, rna was extracted from mpt. expression of kc mrna was quantified using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and standard rna. kc and tnfalpha proteins were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. kc mrna in mpt was upregulated following inoculation of b. fragilis and this was  paralleled by increased kc protein secretion. when the mice were co-infected with e. coli and b. fragilis intraperitoneally, there was a synergistic increase in the expression of kc of mpt. co-infection with l. acidophilus and b. fragilis downregulated kc mrna expression, but co-infection with e. faecalis and b. fragilis synergistically increased kc expression in the infected mpt. inhibition  of tnfalpha production could downregulate kc expression in mixed infected mpt. these results suggest that enteric bacteria may significantly affect the kc signal produced by the host peritoneal cavity in response to b. fragilis infection.

TI  == sepsis increases nos-2 activity and decreases non-nos-mediated acetylcholine-induced dilation in rat aorta.
AB  == introduction: acetylcholine (ach) is frequently used to assess endothelium-dependent vasodilation during sepsis. however, the effects of sepsis  on constitutive nitric oxide synthase activity (nos-1 and -3) and other non-nos effects of ach are unclear. methods: sepsis was induced in rats by inoculation of an implanted sponge with escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis (10(9) cfu each). thoracic aortic rings (2 mm) were harvested at 24 h from septic (n = 9) and control (n = 9) rats and were suspended in physiological salt solution (pss), pss + l-n(6)-(1-iminoethyl)lysine (l-nil: nos-2 inhibitor, 10 microm), or pss + l-n(g)-monomethylarginine (l-nmma: nos-1, -2, and -3 inhibitor, 60 microm). rings were set at 1-g preload and precontracted with phenlyephrine (10(-8) m). relaxation dose-response curves were generated with six doses of ach (3 x 10(-8)  to 10(-5) m). results: sepsis increased the maximal relaxation to ach under basal conditions. nos 2 inhibition with l-nil decreased ach-induced relaxation in controls (66% vs 84%, p < 0.05, two-way anova) and more so in septic rats (44% vs 93%, p < 0.05). total nos inhibition with l-nmma decreased ach-induced relaxation to 45% (p < 0.05) in controls and to 30% (p < 0.05) in septic animals. conclusions: inhibition of nos-1, -2, and -3 failed to abolish ach-induced relaxation, suggesting the presence of other ach-induced vasodilator mechanisms.  nos-2 inhibition reduced ach-induced relaxation by 20-25% in the normal thoracic  aorta, but by 50% in septic animals. the remaining ach-induced non-nos vasodilation (after inhibition of nos-1 + nos-2 + nos-3) was reduced from 45% in  normals to 30% in septic animals. vascular dysregulation in sepsis is a complex event involving increased nos-2, decreased nos-1 + nos-3, and decreased ach-induced non-nos vasodilator mechanisms.

TI  == comparative in vitro pharmacodynamics of imipenem and meropenem against atcc strains of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == we evaluated the pharmacodynamics of imipenem and meropenem, utilizing time-kill  studies over a concentration/mic (c/mic) range of 0.0625-1024 for e. coli atcc 35218 (ec) and s. aureus atcc 29213 (sa) and from 0.125-512 for b. fragilis atcc  25285 (bf). area under the time-kill curves were converted to percent response (%r). aucs were calculated from drug concentrations corrected for degradation and %r vs. c/mic and auc/mic were fit to a sigmoidal emax model. emax was similar for both agents for all organisms. meropenem was 4x more potent than imipenem against ec based on the mic and required 7 and 13.5-fold lower aucs to achieve e50 and e90, (50% and 90% of the maximal response, respectively) respectively, whereas imipenem was 8x more potent than meropenem against sa based on the mic and required 8 and 13-fold lower aucs to achieve e50 and e90, respectively. the c/mic and auc/mic to achieve e50 and e90 with imipenem were 2- and fourfold higher, respectively than meropenem against ec. there was less than a twofold difference  in c/mics and auc/mic between imipenem and meropenem for both e50 and e90 against sa. against bf, concentrations and aucs at e50 were similar for both agents; however, imipenem required 4 to 6-fold higher concentrations and auc to achieve e90. although there are differences in the potency of these agents as assessed by the mic or auc vs. response, when normalized by the mic and corrected for drug degradation, these agents displayed similar pharmacodynamic parameter-response relationships.

AB  == heat shock proteins play an important role in bacterial survival and response to  environmental stress. we cloned the prevotella loescheii hsp70 homolog (dnak) and characterized the coding sequence, regulatory regions, and evolutionary relationships to other bacteria. predicted proteins encoded by the p. loescheii dnak homolog (open reading frame orf-1) and two downstream coding regions, orf-2  and orf-3, are highly homologous to the proteins encoded by orf-4 (dnak), orf-5,  and orf-6 from the dnak region of porphyromonas gingivalis. the dnak promoter resembles other hsp (heat shock protein) promoters. alignment of the predicted protein encoded by orf-2 showed significant homology to the bacteroides fragilis  tnpa gene from the transposon tn4555, whereas the orf-3 protein showed homology to b. fragilis transposase (tn5220) and integrase (tn4555) proteins. this suggests a transposition-like event may be responsible for transfer of these genes between porphyromonas and prevotella.

TI  == in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against bacteroides fragilis in mixed culture  with either escherichia coli or a vancomycin- resistant strain of enterococcus faecium determined by an anaerobic time-kill technique.
AB  == to determine the efficacy of trovafloxacin as a possible treatment for intra-abdominal abscesses, we have developed an anaerobic time-kill technique using different inocula to study the in vitro killing of bacteroides fragilis in  pure culture or in mixed culture with either escherichia coli or a vancomycin-resistant strain of enterococcus faecium (vref). with inocula of 5 x 10(5) cfu/ml and trovafloxacin concentrations of </=2 microg/ml, a maximum observed effect (e(max)) of >/=6.1 (log(10) cfu/ml) was attained with all pure and mixed cultures within 24 h. with inocula of 10(8) cfu/ml, a similar e(max) and a similar concentration to produce 50% of e(max) (ec(50)) for b. fragilis were found in both pure cultures and mixed cultures with e. coli. however, to produce a similar killing of b. fragilis in the mixed cultures with vref, a 14-fold increase in the concentration of trovafloxacin was required. a vancomycin-susceptible strain of e. faecium and a trovafloxacin-resistant strain  of e. coli were also found to confer a similar "protective" effect on b. fragilis against the activity of trovafloxacin. using inocula of 10(9) cfu/ml, the activity of trovafloxacin was retained for e. coli and b. fragilis and was negligible against vref. we conclude that this is a useful technique to study the anaerobic killing of mixed cultures in vitro and may be of value in predicting the killing of mixed infections in vivo. the importance of using mixed cultures and not pure cultures is clearly shown by the difference in the killing of b. fragilis in the mixed cultures tested. trovafloxacin will probably be ineffective in the treatment of infections involving large numbers of enterococci. however, due to its ability to retain activity against large cultures of b. fragilis and e. coli, trovafloxacin could be beneficial in the treatment of intra-abdominal abscesses.

TI  == early attachment of anaerobic bacteria may play an important role in biliary stent blockage.
AB  == background: in vitro studies have demonstrated that ciprofloxacin suppresses escherichia coli attachment on stents, and ciprofloxacin has been shown to prolong stent patency in cats. however, clinical studies with antibiotic prophylaxis have produced conflicting results. the aim of this study was to isolate and identify the bacteria that attach early on unblocked stents removed from patients and to study their enzyme activities. methods: eighteen unblocked biliary stents were removed from 17 patients (benign obstruction in 14 and malignant obstruction in 4). all patients received antibiotic prophylaxis (mean of 6 days). stents were in place for a mean of 33 days. the inside of stents was  scraped and sludge was cultured aerobically and anaerobically. identification of  isolated bacteria and measurement of beta-glucuronidase and phospholipase c activities were performed by using standard techniques. gastric and duodenal juice from 18 patients with no biliary diseases was used as control samples. results: all stents were patent and only 6 had visible sludge. there were 19 anaerobes isolated from 16 stents (clostridium perfringens 13, clostridium bifermentans 4 and bacteroides fragilis 2). phospholipase c was detected in all clostridium species. beta-glucuronidase was produced only by 12 of 13 c perfringens isolates. sixteen aerobes including enterococcus species and bacillus species were isolated but none produced beta-glucuronidase or phospholipase c. there were no aerobic gram-negative bacteria isolated from stents. clostridium species and b fragilis were not recovered from the control samples. conclusions:  in patients who had received antibiotic prophylaxis against gram-negative bacterial infection, anaerobic bacteria may play a role in initiating stent blockage.

TI  == bacterial toxins modifying the actin cytoskeleton.
AB  == numerous bacterial toxins recognize the actin cytoskeleton as a target. the clostridial binary toxins (iota and c2 families) adp-ribosylate the actin monomers causing the dissociation of the actin filaments. the large clostridial toxins from clostridium difficile, clostridium sordellii and clostridium novyi inactivate, by glucosylation, proteins from the rho family that regulate actin polymerization. in contrast, the cytotoxic necrotic factor from escherichia coli  activates rho by deamidation and increases the formation of actin filaments. the  enterotoxin of bacteroides fragilis is a protease specific for e-cadherin and it  promotes the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. the bacterial toxins that  modify the actin cytoskeleton induce various cell disfunctions including changes  in cell barrier permeability and disruption of intercellular junctions.

AB  == there is little known about the sequences that mediate the initiation of transcription in bacteroides fragilis, thus transcriptional start sites for 13 new genes were determined and a total of 23 promoter regions upstream of the start sites were aligned and similarities were noted. a region at about -7 contained a consensus sequence of tanntttg and upstream in the region centered at about -33, another tttg motif was found in the majority of promoters examined. canonical, escherichia coli, -10 and -35 consensus sequences were not readily apparent. mutations within the -7 motif indicated the tttg residues were essential since changes in this sequence reduced the promoter activity to that of a no promoter control in a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase transcriptional fusion model system. additional fusion studies indicated that the -33 region was  also necessary for full activity.

TI  == strain differentiation in bacteroides fragilis by ribotyping and computer-assisted gel analysis.
AB  == it is important to distinguish between bacteroides fragilis strains as their virulence may vary and as b. fragilis seems to be a heterogeneous species. the aim of our study was to evaluate ribotyping for differentiation of 46 strains of  b. fragilis and for assessment of strain heterogeneity within and between the two dna-dna homology strain groups established in this species. twenty-seven strains  belonged to johnson's dna homology group i and eight to group ii. eleven strains  had not been assigned to any group (ni group). dna from all strains was cut with  bgli, ecori and hindiii. restriction fragment length polymorphisms were investigated using a non-radioactive digoxigenin-labelled cdna probe transcribed  from escherichia coli 16s+23s rrna. ribotyping with bgli was most discriminatory, revealing a total of 26 different patterns by visual inspection of gels. ecori followed with 20 patterns and hindiii with 13 patterns. the gels from ribotyping  were processed using the dendron computer-assisted program. strain clusters established using dendron were not always in agreement with homology-based strain groups. strains of the ni group fell into both homology groups. ribotyping, as it is based on a relatively small portion of the genome, is useful for strain distinction in epidemiological studies with b. fragilis, whereas dna-dna homology, using the entire genome, is more reliable for taxonomy. the dendron computer-assisted program, which enabled objective assessment of multiple banding patterns, increased the reliability of ribotyping.

AB  == background: altered intestinal blood flow during systemic inflammation leads to organ dysfunction. mucosal ischemia occurs during sepsis despite an increase in portal blood flow. we hypothesized that separate mechanisms are active in the large resistance and small mucosal microvessels to account for this dichotomy. methods: chronic infection was induced in rats by bacterial inoculation (escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis) of an implanted subcutaneous sponge.  separate groups were studied at 24 and 72 hours after a single inoculation of bacterium or 24 hours after a second inoculation (ie, 72 hours of sepsis). time-matched controls were used for each group. intravital microscopy of the terminal ileum was used to assess endothelial-dependent vasodilation to acetylcholine (10(-9) to 10(-5) mol/l) in resistance (a(1)) and premucosal (a(3)) arterioles. threshold sensitivity (-log of 20% response dose) was calculated from dose response curves for each animal. results: vasodilator sensitivity to acetylcholine in a(1) arterioles was significantly decreased at 24 hours, and these changes persisted up to 72 hours after a single bacterial inoculation. there was no change in the dilator sensitivity of a(3) arterioles after a single  inoculation. when there was a challenge with a second bacterial inoculation, there was a reversal of the a(1) dilator response and an increase in a(3) sensitivity. conclusions: an initial septic event results in a decrease in dilator reactivity in the resistance a1 arterioles that persists for at least 72  hours. a sustained septic challenge results in increased dilator reactivity in both a(1) and a(3) vessels. this enhanced sensitivity during sepsis suggests that more than 1 therapeutic approach to preservation of intestinal blood flow will be necessary.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new injectable carbapenem, s-4661, against gynaecological pathogens.
AB  == carbapenems are often used to treat infections in obstetrics and gynaecology because of their activity against anaerobes. s-4661, a new injectable carbapenem  antibiotic, has favourable pharmacokinetic properties and is not hydrolysed by dehydropeptidase i. we investigated the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of s-4661 against strains of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia, which are major pathogens in the fields of obstetrics and gynaecology. the mic(50) and  mic(90) of s-4661 for these strains were 0.25 and 1 mg/l, respectively. the in vivo efficacy of s-4661 was evaluated in a rat model of intrauterine infection, namely pyometra caused by e. coli and b. fragilis. the accumulation of neutrophils in the uterus in the s-4661-treated group was less marked and the number of bacteria significantly lower than those in the untreated group. these results suggest that s-4661 may be useful for treating polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynaecology.

TI  == accumulation of norfloxacin by bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == the accumulation of norfloxacin by bacteroides fragilis nctc 9343 was determined  by the modified fluorescence method. the time required to achieve a steady-state  concentration (ssc) after allowing b. fragilis to accumulate norfloxacin in an aerobic or an anaerobic environment was approximately 2 min; the ssc achieved in  air was 90.28 +/- 9.32 ng of norfloxacin/mg (dry weight) of cells, and that achieved anaerobically was 98.45 +/- 3.7 ng of norfloxacin/mg (dry weight) of cells. initial rates of accumulation were determined with a range of external concentrations, as up to 8 microg/ml the concentration of norfloxacin accumulated increased proportionally to the external concentration, 12.13 ng/mg (dry weight)  of cells per microg of exogenous norfloxacin per ml. at concentrations above 10 microg/ml no increase in the rate of norfloxacin accumulation was observed. from  the kinetic data, a lineweaver-burk plot calculated a k(m) of 5.03 microg/ml and  a v(max) of 25.1 ng of norfloxacin/s. with an increase in temperature of between  0 and 30 degrees c, the concentration of norfloxacin accumulated also increased proportionally at 4.722 ng of norfloxacin/mg (dry weight) of cells/ degrees c. at low concentrations of glucose (<0.2%; 11 mm), the concentration of norfloxacin accumulated was decreased. with the addition of 100 microm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (cccp) the mean ssc of norfloxacin was increased to 116 +/- 7.01 ng of norfloxacin/mg (dry weight) of cells; glucose had no significant effect in the presence of cccp. magnesium chloride (20 mm) decreased the ssc of norfloxacin to 40.5 +/- 3.76 ng of norfloxacin per mg (dry weight) of cells. these data suggest that the mechanism of accumulation of norfloxacin by b. fragilis is similar to that of aerobic bacteria and that the fluoresence procedure is suitable for use with an anaerobic bacterium.

TI  == lipopolysaccharide induces expression of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines and the elastin-degrading enzyme, cathepsin s, in human cervical smooth-muscle cells.
AB  == objective: vaginal and amniotic infection with gram-negative bacteria is associated with preterm birth. we previously reported that human cervical smooth-muscle cells (csmc) respond to pro-inflammatory cytokines by expressing enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix. our objective was to characterize  the effects of lipopolysaccharide (lps) from escherichia coli (e coli), bacteroides fragilis, (b frag)and fusobacterium nucleatum (f nuc)on the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the elastin-degrading enzyme, cathepsin s, in human csmc. methods: human csmc were exposed to lps and the expression of mrnas encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines and cathepsin s, and selected matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) was analyzed by northern blotting. the  effect of cytokine-neutralizing antibodies on lps-induced cathepsin s mrna expression also was determined. results: e coli lps increased expression of cathepsin s 12.5-fold after 12 hours; mmp-1 and mmp-3 mrnas also were increased 2.9- and 3.5-fold, respectively. tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, interleukin (il-1)alpha, and il-1beta mrnas were markedly up-regulated after 3 hours of lps treatment. b frag and f nuc lps also induced tnf-alpha and cathepsin s mrnas. e coli lps caused a sevenfold increase in tnf-alpha secretion after 5 to 8 hours. antihuman tnf-alpha monoclonal antibody, but not a monoclonal antibody to the low-density lipoprotein receptor, reduced the lps-induced increase in cathepsin s mrna by 27%, whereas neutralizing antibodies against il-1alpha and il-1beta did not suppress the response. human csmc were shown to express the toll-like receptor (tlr-2) and tlr-4 genes, which mediate the action of lps. tlr-2 mrna was up-regulated by tnf-alpha. conclusion: csmc respond to lps with increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cathepsin s. increases in cathepsin  s mrna result only in part from the rapid induction of tnf-alpha gene expression. tnf-alpha may also augment the csmc response to lps by increasing expression of the lps signaling receptor, tlr-2, which probably directly mediates lps action. these observations provide a mechanism by which gram-negative bacteria can precipitate cervical changes associated with preterm birth.

TI  == characterization of a bacteroides mobilizable transposon, nbu2, which carries a functional lincomycin resistance gene.
AB  == the mobilizable bacteroides element nbu2 (11 kbp) was found originally in two bacteroides clinical isolates, bacteroides fragilis erl and b. thetaiotaomicron dot. at first, nbu2 appeared to be very similar to another mobilizable bacteroides element, nbu1, in a 2.5-kbp internal region, but further examination  of the full dna sequence of nbu2 now reveals that the region of near identity between nbu1 and nbu2 is limited to this small region and that, outside this region, there is little sequence similarity between the two elements. the integrase gene of nbu2, intn2, was located at one end of the element. this gene was necessary and sufficient for the integration of nbu2. the integrase of nbu2 has the conserved amino acids (r-h-r-y) in the c-terminal end that are found in members of the lambda family of site-specific integrases. this was also the only  region in which the nbu1 and nbu2 integrases shared any similarity (28% amino acid sequence identity and 49% sequence similarity). integration of nbu2 was site specific in bacteroides species. integration occurred in two primary sites in b.  thetaiotaomicron. both of these sites were located in the 3' end of a serine-trna gene nbu2 also integrated in escherichia coli, but integration was much less site specific than in b. thetaiotaomicron. analysis of the sequence of nbu2 revealed two potential antibiotic resistance genes. the amino acid sequences of the putative proteins encoded by these genes had similarity to resistances found in gram-positive bacteria. only one of these genes was expressed in b. thetaiotaomicron, the homolog of lina, a lincomycin resistance gene from staphylococcus aureus. to determine how widespread elements related to nbu1 and nbu2 are in bacteroides species, we screened 291 bacteroides strains. elements with some sequence similarity to nbu2 and nbu1 were widespread in bacteroides strains, and the presence of lina(n) in bacteroides strains was highly correlated with the presence of nbu2, suggesting that nbu2 has been responsible for the spread of this gene among bacteroides strains. our results suggest that the nbu-related elements form a large and heterogeneous family, whose members have similar integration mechanisms but have different target sites and differ in whether they carry resistance genes.

AB  == background: microbes have been suspected as provocateurs of polycystic kidney disease (pkd), but attempts to isolate viable organisms have failed. bacterial endotoxin is the most often reported microbial product found in pkd fluids. we assessed potential microbial origins of endotoxin in cyst fluids from 13 pkd patients and urines of pkd and control individuals. methods: fluids were probed for endotoxin and nanobacteria, a new bacterium, by the differential limulus amebocyte lysate assay (dlal), genus-specific antilipopolysaccharide (lps) antibodies, monoclonal antibodies to nanobacteria, and hyperimmune serum to bartonella henselae (hs-bh). selected specimens were also assessed by transmission electron microscopy (tem) and nanobacterial culture methods. results: lps or its antigenic metabolites were found in more than 75% of cyst fluids tested. nanobacteria were cultured from 11 of 13 pkd kidneys, visualized in 8 of 8 kidneys by tem, and immunodetected in all 13 pkd kidneys. by immunodetection, nanobacterial antigens were found in urine from 7 of 7 pkd males, 1 of 7 pkd females, 3 of 10 normal males, and 1 of 10 normal females. "nanobacterium sanguineum" was dlal positive and cross-reactive with antichlamydial lps and hs-bh. some cyst fluids were also positive for lps antigens from escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis and/or chlamydia, and hs-bh, as were liver cyst fluids from one patient. tetracycline and citrate inhibited nanobacterial growth in vitro. conclusion: nanobacteria or its antigens were present in pkd kidney, liver, and urine. the identification of candidate microbial pathogens is the first step in ascertaining their contribution, if any, to human disease.

AB  == the aim of the present study was to evaluate the incidence of enteric viruses in  mussels and to verify the possibility of using phages as indirect indicators of mussel viral contamination. mussels (36 samples) collected from three different areas of the adriatic sea were analysed to determine the following parameters: escherichia coli, somatic coliphage (t6 phage), f-plus (ms2 phage), b40-8 (phage  of bacteroides fragilis), enteroviruses and hepatitis a virus. most of the results of the bacteriological analysis (most probable number (mpn) ml-1) were in accordance with the bacteriological limits established by european law, with the  exception of seven samples. the bacteriophage analyses were always negative for f-plus and b40-8, with the exception of a few samples, whereas the somatic coliphages were generally between 0 and 20 mpn g-1, with the exception of two samples (110 mpn g-1). the virological analysis showed five samples positive for  the presence of enteroviruses and 13 for the presence of hepatitis a virus (in three samples both viruses were present). most of these samples presented acceptable bacteriological parameters and the bacteriophages were absent or their value was generally very low. the results show that the detection of e. coli and  phages does not seem to be a good indicator of viral contamination.

AB  == escherichia coli r170, isolated from the urine of an infected patient, was resistant to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin but was susceptible to amikacin, cefotetan, and imipenem. this particular strain contained three different plasmids that encoded two beta-lactamases with pis of 7.0 and 9.0. resistance to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole was transferred by conjugation from e. coli r170 to e. coli j53-2. the transferred plasmid, rza92, which encoded a single beta-lactamase, was 150 kb in length. the cefotaxime resistance gene that  encodes the tla-1 beta-lactamase (pi 9.0) was cloned from the transconjugant by transformation to e. coli dh5alpha. sequencing of the bla(tla-1) gene revealed an open reading frame of 906 bp, which corresponded to 301 amino acid residues, including motifs common to class a beta-lactamases: (70)sxxk, (130)sdn, and (234)ktg. the amino acid sequence of tla-1 shared 50% identity with the cme-1 chromosomal class a beta-lactamase from chryseobacterium (flavobacterium) meningosepticum; 48.8% identity with the veb-1 class a beta-lactamase from e. coli; 40 to 42% identity with cbla of bacteroides uniformis, per-1 of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and per-2 of salmonella typhimurium; and 39% identity with cepa of bacteroides fragilis. the partially purified tla-1 beta-lactamase had a molecular mass of 31.4 kda and a pi of 9.0 and preferentially hydrolyzed cephaloridine, cefotaxime, cephalothin, benzylpenicillin, and ceftazidime. the enzyme was markedly inhibited by sulbactam, tazobactam, and clavulanic acid. tla-1 is a new  extended-spectrum beta-lactamase of ambler class a.

AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa col-1 was identified in a blood culture of a 39-year-old-woman treated with imipenem in marseilles, france, in 1996. this strain was resistant to beta-lactams, including ureidopenicillins, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, and meropenem, but  remained susceptible to the monobactam aztreonam. the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase gene of p. aeruginosa col-1 was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in escherichia coli dh10b. the deduced 266-amino-acid protein was an ambler class b beta-lactamase, with amino acid identities of 32% with b-ii from bacillus cereus; 31% with imp-1 from several gram-negative rods in japan, including p. aeruginosa; 27% with ccra from bacteroides fragilis; 24% with blab from chryseobacterium meningosepticum; 24% with ind-1 from chryseobacterium indologenes; 21% with cpha-1 from aeromonas hydrophila; and 11% with l-1 from stenotrophomonas maltophilia. it was most closely related to vim-1 beta-lactamase recently reported from italian p. aeruginosa clinical isolates (90% amino acid identity). purified vim-2 beta-lactamase had a pi of 5.6, a relative molecular mass of 29.7 kda, and a broad substrate hydrolysis range, including penicillins,  cephalosporins, cephamycins, oxacephamycins, and carbapenems, but not monobactams. as a metallo-beta-lactamase, its activity was zinc dependent and inhibited by edta (50% inhibitory concentration, 50 microm). vim-2 conferred a resistance pattern to beta-lactams in e. coli dh10b that paralleled its in vitro  hydrolytic properties, except for susceptibility to ureidopenicillins, carbapenems, and cefepime. bla(vim-2) was located on a ca. 45-kb plasmid that in  addition conferred resistance to sulfamides and that was not self-transmissible either from p. aeruginosa to e. coli or from e. coli to e. coli. bla(vim-2) was the only gene cassette located within the variable region of a novel class 1 integron, in56, that was weakly related to the bla(vim-1)-containing integron. vim-2 is the second carbapenem-hydrolyzing metalloenzyme characterized from a p.  aeruginosa isolate outside japan.

TI  == antimicrobial chemotherapy in the control of surgical infectious complications.
AB  == in spite of the progress in surgical technique and antibiotic prophylaxis, postoperative infection still accounts for both the commonest surgical complication and one of the most frequent nosocomial infections, also causing an  increase in duration and costs of hospital stay. the choice of treatment for post-surgical infections requires an understanding of the usual infecting flora,  available antimicrobial agents, and susceptibility patterns. the most common organisms in simple wound infection are gram-positive cocci and mainly staphylococcus aureus. staphylococcus epidermidis and s. aureus (quite often methicillin-resistant strains) are the organisms which predominate in the infectious complications following clean surgical procedures with implantation of vascular grafts or prosthetic devices. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora are mainly responsible for cases of intra-abdominal and intra-pelvic postoperative infections: the most common aerobes are enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, proteus spp., and others) and enterococci, and among anaerobes bacteroides fragilis group prevails. adequate drainage and surgical control of the source of  infection, when needed, and adjunctive effective antimicrobial therapy are important factors in successful treatment of postoperative infections. semisynthetic penicillinase-resistant penicillins and glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin) are the drugs of choice for the treatment of infections caused by penicillin-resistant methicillin-sensitive, and methicillin-resistant, respectively, s. aureus and s. epidermidis. for the treatment of intra-abdominal  and intra-pelvic infections, animal and human studies support the recommendation  that treatment should be directed against both gram-negative enteric and anaerobic bacteria. combinations of aminoglycosides with clindamycin or metronidazole have been widely used with great success; however adverse reactions such as nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity have been a problem in some patients. in recent years monotherapy with either a carbapenem (imipenem/cilastatin or meropenem) or a penicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination has been proposed. among these combination antimicrobials, piperacillin combined with tazobactam is a very well designed formulation. indeed, piperacillin is active against a broad range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, and tazobactam is a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor which acts on a variety of clinically important plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. this combination seems particularly attractive for the treatment of mixed polymicrobial anaerobic-aerobic infections such as intra-abdominal and intra-pelvic postoperative infections.

AB  == background: previous reports on faecal microflora have demonstrated that the total number of aerobes and coliforms was increased in patients with ulcerative colitis (uc). based on the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of uc may be closely  associated with the mucosal microflora, we investigated alterations in the mucosa-associated microflora of uc patients. methods and results: the bacterial counts for both aerobes and anaerobes increased in uc patients. in particular, we detected the highest bacterial counts of bacteroides vulgatus and these bacteria  were isolated most frequently. in addition, we also investigated the serum antibody responses against the bacteria isolated from the affected mucosa by serum bacterial agglutination tests and immunoblotting. a high agglutination titre against b. vulgatus, bacteroides fragilis, and clostridium ramosum was detected in most uc patients, and the percentage of positive immunoreactivity was much higher in uc patients than in healthy controls. from the results of the immunoblotting, a unique antigenic determinant of b. vulgatus (bv43-26), a 26-kda protein from the outer membrane, was discovered. the serum immunoreactivity (immunoglobulin (ig) g) against this 26-kda protein was much higher in uc patients (53.8%) than in the control sera (9.1%). the serum immunoreactivity (igg) against a 50-kda protein isolated from the whole cell protein of escherichia coli (ec48-1) was also higher in uc patients (29.2%) than in normal controls (6.3%). conclusions: these results suggest that b. vulgatus and a specific antibody response directed against it may play an important role in the  pathogenesis of uc.

TI  == inhibition of bacterial peptide deformylase by biaryl acid analogs.
AB  == peptide deformylase is an essential eubacterial metalloenzyme involved in the maturation of proteins by cleaving the n-formyl group from n-blocked methionine polypeptides. biaryl acid analogs containing tetrazole, acyl sulfonamide, or carboxylate pharmacophores were found to be potent inhibitors of recombinant escherichia coli peptide deformylase. two of these compounds, a biphenyl tetrazole, compound 1, and a biphenyl acyl sulfonamide, compound 4, were competitive inhibitors with k(i) values of 1.2 and 6.0 microm, respectively. by analogy to the binding of related compounds to other metalloenzymes such as bacteroides fragilis metallo-beta-lactamase ccra and human carbonic anhydrase, a  mechanism of inhibition is proposed for these peptide deformylase inhibitors where the acidic moieties form direct ionic interactions with the active site metal cation.

AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative, black-pigmented, oral anaerobe strongly associated with adult periodontitis. previous transposon mutagenesis studies with this organism were based on the bacteroides transposon tn4351. characterization of tn4351-disrupted genes by cloning has not been an efficient way to analyze large numbers of mutants and is further complicated by the high rate of cointegration of the suicide delivery vector containing tn4351. in this study, we mutagenized p. gingivalis with a modified version of the bacteroides fragilis transposon tn4400. plasmid pyt646b carrying the transposon was mobilized from escherichia coli to p. gingivalis atcc 33277 by conjugation. both normal and inverse transposition frequencies were similar (3 x 10(-8)). however, the inverse transposon (tn4400') contains a pbr322 replicon and a beta-lactamase gene; thus,  the cloning of disrupted genomic dnas from inverse transposition mutants was easily accomplished after ligation of genomic fragments and transformation into e. coli. thousands of transconjugants could be obtained in a single mating experiment, and inverse transposition was random as demonstrated by southern hybridization. by this procedure the disrupted genes from p. gingivalis pleiotropic mutants were quickly cloned, sequenced, and identified.

TI  == contribution of escherichia coli alpha-hemolysin to bacterial virulence and to intraperitoneal alterations in peritonitis.
AB  == alpha-hemolysin (hly) is a common exotoxin produced by escherichia coli that enhances virulence in a number of clinical infections. the addition of hemolysin  production to laboratory bacterial strains is known to increase the lethality of  e. coli peritonitis. however, the mechanisms involved have not been determined and the contribution of hemolysin to the alterations in the host intraperitoneal  environment and the leukocyte response is not known. utilizing a rat peritonitis  model, we show that wild-type hemolytic e. coli strains have a significant competitive advantage over nonhemolytic strains within the peritoneum. to examine the specific contribution of hly to e. coli-induced virulence and alterations within the peritoneum, a mixed peritonitis model of e. coli, bacteroides fragilis, and sterile fecal adjuvant was used. three transformed e. coli strains  were utilized: one strongly secretes active hemolysin (waf 270), a second secretes active hemolysin but a reduced amount (waf 260), and the third does not  produce hemolysin (waf 108). after an equal inoculum of each of the three strains, waf 270 produced a markedly increased lethality and an increased recovery of both e. coli and b. fragilis from the host relative to the other strains. changes in the intraperitoneal ph, degree of erythrocyte lysis, and recruitment and viability of leukocytes within the peritoneum following the induction of peritonitis differed significantly between the strongly hemolytic and nonhemolytic strains. induction of peritonitis with waf 270 caused a pronounced decrease in intraperitoneal ph, lysis of most of the intraperitoneal erythrocytes, and a marked decrease in recoverable viable leukocytes compared to  waf 108. thus, hemolysin production by e. coli within the peritoneum may alter not only the host's ability to control the hemolytic strain itself but also other organisms.

TI  == glucose utilisation in the lungs of septic rats.
AB  == sequestration and degranulation of leucocytes in the pulmonary microcirculation is considered to be a key event in the development of acute respiratory distress  syndrome in patients with sepsis. glucose serves as the main source of energy in  activated leucocytes. the aim of this study was to assess whether glucose utilisation in the lungs can be used as an indicator of pulmonary leucocyte accumulation in an experimental model of sepsis of intra-abdominal origin. sepsis was induced in rats by abdominal implantation of a gelatine capsule containing bacteria and rat colonic contents. empty gelatine capsules were implanted in control animals. animals were studied 6 and 12 h after sepsis induction. glucose  utilisation was measured as the tissue uptake of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)fdg) 1 h after intravenous injection of the tracer. micro-autoradiography was also performed after injection of tritiated deoxyglucose. we found increased  uptake of (18)fdg in the lungs of septic animals. the uptake also increased with  time after sepsis induction. (18)fdg uptake in circulating leucocytes was increased in septic animals compared with controls, and micro-autoradiography showed intense accumulation of deoxyglucose in leucocytes in the lungs of septic  animals. we conclude that glucose utilisation is increased in the lungs of septic rats. measurements of pulmonary glucose utilisation as an index of leucocyte metabolic activity may open new possibilities for studies of the pathophysiology  of sepsis and for evaluation of therapeutic interventions.

TI  == local treatment of generalised peritonitis in rats; effects on bacteria, endotoxin and mortality.
AB  == objective: to assess the effect of debridement, intraoperative lavage with saline, and additional instillation of taurolidine or imipenem/cilastatin in rats with faecal peritonitis. design: laboratory study. setting: university hospital,  the netherlands. material: 60 male wistar rats. interventions: rats were given an intraperitoneal injection of a faecal suspension containing escherichia coli and  bacteroides fragilis. six groups of 10: sham operation, debridement, debridement  with saline lavage, debridement with saline lavage with intraperitoneal instillation of saline or taurolidine, or imipenem/cilastatin, were studied. main outcome measures: bacterial growth and endotoxin concentration in abdominal exudate and plasma, abscess formation, and mortality. results: debridement temporarily reduced bacterial growth and the concentration of endotoxin in abdominal exudate, and delayed mortality. lavage with saline further reduced bacterial growth and the endotoxin concentration. it also reduced the plasma endotoxin concentration, and mortality. additional instillation of taurolidine did not reduce bacterial growth, but did initially reduce the endotoxin concentration in abdominal exudate and plasma. instillation of imipenem/cilastatin, after debridement and lavage, significantly reduced all variables measured. conclusion: in rats with faecal peritonitis, debridement, lavage with saline, and additional instillation of imipenem/cilastatin, all have  cumulatively reducing effect on bacterial growth, endotoxin concentrations, abscess formation, and mortality. instillation of taurolidine reduces only the amount of endotoxin.

TI  == microbiology of subphrenic abscesses: a 14-year experience.
AB  == the objective of the review was to study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of subphrenic abscesses in relation with predisposing conditions. a retrospective review of clinical and laboratory data of 52 patients treated between 1974 and 1988 was conducted. forty-three (83%) patients developed the abscesses after an operative procedure. these included 11 patients after colonic, 9 patients after gastric or duodenal, 7 patients after abdominal trauma, 7 patients after biliary, and 6 patients after appendix surgery. a total of 194 organisms (3.7 isolates/specimen), 83 aerobic (1.6/specimen), and 111 anaerobes (2.1/specimen) were recovered. aerobic bacteria only were recovered in 7 (13%) abscesses, anaerobic bacteria only in 11 (21%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in  34 (65%). polymicrobial infection was present in 47 (90%). the predominant aerobic isolates were escherichia coli (28 isolates), enterococcus group d(9), and staphylococcus aureus (9). the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus  species (33 isolates), bacteroides fragilis group (25), clostridium species (13), and prevotella species (6). the number of isolates/site varied. the number of anaerobic bacteria/site outnumbered or was equal to the number of aerobic or facultatives in all instances, except in abscesses after biliary surgery. their number/site was especially high in abscesses after appendectomy, and the number of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was the lowest after gastric or duodenal surgery. s. aureus predominated after gastric, duodenal and posttrauma surgery; b. fragilis predominated after colonic, appendix, and postabdominal trauma surgery; enterococcus group d predominated after biliary surgery; fusobacterium and prevotella species predominated after gastric or duodenal surgery; and clostridium species predominated after colonic or appendix surgery. these data highlight the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic nature of subphrenic abscesses and  their correlation with predisposing surgery.

TI  == molecular evolution of the pathogenicity island of enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis strains.
AB  == enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis (etbf) strains, which produce a 20-kda zinc  metalloprotease toxin (bft), have been associated with diarrheal disease in animals and young children. studying a collection of etbf and nontoxigenic b. fragilis (ntbf) strains, we found that bft and a second metalloprotease gene (mpii) are contained in an approximately 6-kb pathogenicity island (termed b. fragilis pathogenicity island or bfpai) which is present exclusively in all 113 etbf strains tested (pattern i). of 191 ntbf strains, 100 (52%) lack both the bfpai and at least a 12-kb region flanking bfpai (pattern ii), and 82 of 191 ntbf strains (43%) lack the bfpai but contain the flanking region (pattern iii). the nucleotide sequence flanking the left end of the bfpai revealed a region with the same organization as the mobilization region of the 5-nitroimidazole resistance plasmid pip417 and the clindamycin resistance plasmid pbftm10, that is, two mobilization genes (bfma and bfmb) organized in one operon and a putative origin  of transfer (orit) located in a small, compact region. the region flanking the right end of the bfpai contains a gene (bfmc) whose predicted protein shares significant identity to the trad mobilization proteins encoded by plasmids f and  r100 from escherichia coli. nucleotide sequence analysis of one ntbf pattern iii  strain (strain i-1345) revealed that bfmb and bfmc are adjacent to each other and separated by a 16-bp gc-rich sequence. comparison of this sequence with the appropriate sequence of etbf strain 86-5443-2-2 showed that in this etbf strain the 16-bp sequence is replaced by the bfpai. this result defined the bfpai as being 6,036 bp in length and its precise integration site as being between the bfmb and bfmc stop codons. the g+c content of the bfpai (35%) and the flanking dna (47 to 50%) differ greatly from that reported for the b. fragilis chromosome  (42%), suggesting that the bfpai and its flanking region are two distinct genetic elements originating from very different organisms. etbf strains may have evolved by horizontal transfer of these two genetic elements into a pattern ii ntbf strain.

TI  == case-control study of enteropathogens associated with childhood diarrhea in dhaka, bangladesh.
AB  == the international centre for diarrhoeal disease research, bangladesh, is a major  center for research into diarrheal diseases. the center treats more than 100,000  patients a year. to obtain useful information representative of all patients, a surveillance system in which a 4% systematic sample of all patients is studied in detail, including etiological agents of diarrhea, was installed in october 1979.  the first paper on etiology for the surveillance patients was published in 1982,  which identified a potential enteric pathogen in 66% of patients. in subsequent years, several new agents of diarrhea have been identified. to assess the importance of a broader spectrum of diarrheal agents including the ones identified relatively recently, we studied 814 children with diarrhea. the children were up to 5 years of age and were part of the surveillance system. they were matched with an equal number of community controls without diarrhea. the study was conducted from february 1993 to june 1994. a potential enteric pathogen was isolated from 74.8% of diarrheal children and 43.9% of control children (p =  0.0001). even though the first study was not a case-control study, it identified  rotavirus, campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, shigella spp.  , and vibrio cholerae o1 as major pathogens. the present study identified these pathogens as being significantly associated with diarrhea. in addition, the study also identified six additional agents, including enteropathogenic e. coli, aeromonas spp., v. cholerae o139, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and cryptosporidium parvum, as being significantly associated with diarrhea. plesiomonas shigelloides, salmonella spp., diffusely adherent e. coli, enteroaggregative e. coli, entamoeba histolytica, and giardia lamblia were not significantly associated with diarrhea. enteroinvasive e. coli,  enterohemorrhagic e. coli, and cyclospora cayetanensis were not detected in any of the children. the major burden of diseases due to most pathogens occurred in the first year of life. as in the previous study, seasonal patterns were seen for diarrhea associated with rotavirus, v. cholerae, and enterotoxigenic e. coli, and infections with multiple pathogens were common. with a few exceptions, these findings are in agreement with those from other developing countries. this knowledge of a broader spectrum of etiological agents of diarrhea in the surveillance patients will help us plan studies into various aspects of diarrheal diseases in this population.

TI  == molecular cloning of the gyra and gyrb genes of bacteroides fragilis encoding dna gyrase.
AB  == the genes encoding the dna gyrase a and b subunits of bacteroides fragilis were cloned and sequenced. the gyra and gyrb genes code for proteins of 845 and 653 amino acids, respectively. these proteins were expressed in escherichia coli, and the combination of gyra and gyrb exhibited atp-dependent supercoiling activity. to analyze the role of dna gyrase in quinolone resistance of b. fragilis, we isolated mutant strains by stepwise selection for resistance to increasing concentrations of levofloxacin. we analyzed the resistant mutants and showed that ser-82 of gyra, equivalent to resistance hot spot ser-83 of gyra in e. coli, was  in each case replaced with phe. these results suggest that dna gyrase is an important target for quinolones in b. fragilis.

AB  == background: bacterial infections can occur in lesions of pustular psoriasis (pp). the objective of this study was to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of secondarily infected pp. methods: a retrospective 10-year review  was carried out of clinical and microbiology laboratory records from patients with secondarily infected pp lesions, whose specimens of infected sites were processed for the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. results: bacterial  growth was noted in 23 specimens. aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only  were present in 12 patients (52%), anaerobic bacteria only in four (17%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in seven (30%). thirty-six isolates were recovered (1.6 per specimen), 23 aerobic or facultative bacteria and 13 strict anaerobes. the predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (15 isolates), group d enterococcus (two isolates), and escherichia coli (two isolates). the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus spp. (six isolates) and bacteroides fragilis group, propionibacterium acnes, and pigmented prevotella spp. in two each. single bacterial isolates were recovered in 14 patients (61%), 11 of which were s. aureus. nineteen of the organisms isolated from 18 patients (78%) produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. s. aureus was isolated from all body sites. organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the lesions predominated in these infections. enteric gram-negative rods and bacteroides fragilis group predominated in lesions on the legs and buttocks. group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, pigmented prevotella, and fusobacterium spp. were most frequently recovered in lesions of the hand. conclusions: the polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected pp lesions and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomic site of the lesions were demonstrated.

TI  == role of the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (ahpcf) gene in oxidative stress defense of the obligate anaerobe bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == in this study we report the identification and role of the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (ahp) gene in bacteroides fragilis. the two components of ahp, ahpc, and ahpf, are organized in an operon, and the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that b. fragilis ahpcf shares approximately 60% identity to orthologues  in other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. northern blot hybridization analysis of total rna showed that the ahpcf genes were transcribed as a polycistronic 2.4-kb mrna and that ahpc also was present as a 0.6-kb monocistronic mrna. ahpc and ahpcf mrnas were induced approximately 60-fold following h(2)o(2) treatment or oxygen exposure of the parent strain but were constitutive in a peroxide-resistant strain. further investigation using an ahpcf'::beta-xylosidase gene transcriptional fusion confirmed that ahpcf had lost normal regulation in the peroxide-resistant strain compared to the parent. the ahpcf mutant was more sensitive to growth inhibition and mutagenesis by organic peroxides than the parent strain, as determined by disk inhibition assays and the frequency of mutation to fusidic acid resistance. this finding suggests that the  ahp genes play an important role in peroxide resistance in b. fragilis. under anaerobic conditions, we observed increases in the number of spontaneous fusidic  acid-resistant mutants of five- and sevenfold in ahpcf and ahpf strain backgrounds, respectively, and eightfold in the ahpcf katb double mutant strain compared to the parent and katb strains. in addition, ahpcf, ahpf, and ahpcf katb mutants were slightly more sensitive to oxygen exposure than the parent strain. moreover, the isolation of a strain with enhanced aerotolerance and high-level resistance to alkyl hydroperoxides from an ahpcf katb parent suggests that the physiological responses to peroxide toxicity and to the toxic effects of molecular oxygen are overlapping and complex in this obligate anaerobe.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between july 1996 and june 1997].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during period from july 1996 to june 1997. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. a total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). from primary infections 162 strains were isolated,  and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. from primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was the highest.  in postoperative infections, the majority of them were enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were enterococcus avium. the isolation  rate of staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of enterococcus spp. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like b. fragilis group and of aerobic gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. we found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither staphylacoccus aureus nor enterococcus spp.; however, the mic of arbekacin for one of strains of s. aureus  was 100 micrograms/ml. both the mic90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against p. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.

TI  == [trovafloxacin in gynecology].
AB  == presence of microorganisms in the female lower genital tract (lgt) in concentrations that modify the established normal equilibrium produce different symptoms that make necessary to consult the gynecologist. it is currently accepted that infections of the lgt are due to microorganisms that are normally integrating the internal flora, except for the erroneously called "sexually transmitted diseases" that are caused by external microorganisms. this means that all those microorganisms usually present without causing any disease manifestations may, under certain circumstances and determined concentrations, originate or be associated to infections. lactobacillus sp. and corynebacterium sp. are normally the most frequent microorganisms in the vagina together with streptococcus (aerobe), streptococcus agalactiae and others like enterococcus, peptostreptococcus, bacteroides sp., bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, pseudomonas, klebsiella, fusobacterium, escherichia coli. different antibiotic schemes are proposed for different infections (bacterial vaginosis, gonococcia, chlamydial infections, pelvic inflammatory disease). they  are discussed in different sections. trovafloxacin has shown to be effective in the treatment of infections due to chlamydia with excellent clinical results and  a good tolerance. it was effective as single dose therapy in the treatment of acute gonococcia with therapeutic success in 99% of the treated patients. new fluoroquinolones are also effective in the treatment of infections due to aerobial pathogens. the use of trovafloxacin in the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease would present great advantages: on one hand, it would cover  the wide spectrum of microorganisms responsible for the infection and, on the other, would permit an early switch to oral therapy once the acute phase is over.

TI  == [intra-abdominal infection and new quinolones].
AB  == intra-abdominal infection is defined as the presence of an infectious process within the peritoneal cavity. it may be local or have a systemic consequence generating multiple organic disfunction. most of the studies report a mortality of 30% in severe intra-abdominal infection. secondary peritonitis is caused by the loss of integrity of the gastrointestinal apparatus, which contaminates with  pathogens the peritoneal cavity. invariably they are polymicrobial infections, mostly due to facultative anaerobic and anaerobic gram negative bacilli. prognosis of peritonitis depends on the struggle between two forces: local and systemic immunity of the host and the volume, nature and length of the contamination. microorganisms and their products estimulate cellular defenses in  the host and activate numerous inflammatory mediators responsible for sepsis. antibiotic treatment of secondary peritonitis must act mainly against escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis. the adequate and early empirical administration of antibiotics against these bacteria is well established. it is necessary to consider if the infection is localized or generalized and if it is accompanied or not by organic disfunction. it also has to be taken into account if peritonitis is community or hospital-acquired when choosing the antibiotic scheme. in community-acquired peritonitis with low to moderate infections a combination of metronidazole-ceftriaxone, metronidazole-gentamycin or a monodrug like ampicillin-sulbactam may be used. in severe hospital-acquired peritonitis imipenem or the combination piperacillin-tazobactam are effective. new quinolones such as trovafloxacin or clinafloxacin, with excellent activity against aerobes and anaerobes producing intra-abdominal infections, may be effective. future clinical trials are needed to determine their utility. tertiary peritonitis represent a systemic inflammatory response with multiorganic failure due to the uncontrolled activation of the inflammatory cascade. it is considered a persistent, systemic peritoneal inflammation. antibiotics and new surgery do not  seem to be useful in this situation.

AB  == an in vitro model simulating trovafloxacin concentrations in human serum after standard doses was used to investigate the activity of this drug with time against bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus. antibiotic concentrations used for each incubation period  were: 4.24 mg/l (0-1 h), 3.69 mg/l (1-3 h), 3.25 mg/l (3-6 h), 2.38 mg/l (6-8 h), 1.35 mg/l (8-24 h). a 99.9% initial inoculum reduction (> 3 log10 cfu/ml) was defined as bactericidal activity. bactericidal activity against these organisms was obtained with trovafloxacin after the first hour of incubation, and similar activity was obtained against b. fragilis, e. faecalis and s. aureus after 3 h, when they were tested individually. when the strains were tested as mixed culture, there was bactericidal activity against e. coli after 1 h incubation and after 3 h for s. aureus. this activity was observed against b. fragilis and e. faecalis after 6 h incubation in the mixed culture assays and after 3 h when organisms were tested individually. regrowth was not observed over a 24 h period. these data show that trovafloxacin might be effective in intraabdominal infections caused by mixed aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.

TI  == cloning and characterization of blavim, a new integron-borne metallo-beta-lactamase gene from a pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate.
AB  == production of a metallo-beta-lactamase activity was detected in a carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate (isolate vr-143/97)  from an italian inpatient at the verona university hospital (northern italy). the metallo-beta-lactamase determinant was isolated from a genomic library of vr-143/97, constructed in an escherichia coli plasmid vector, by screening for clones with reduced susceptibility to imipenem. sequencing of the cloned gene revealed that it encoded a new class b beta-lactamase that was named vim-1. at the sequence level vim-1 was rather divergent from the other class b enzymes (16.4 to 38.7% identity), overall being more similar to members of subclass b1 including the beta-lactamase ii of bacillus cereus (bc-ii), the bacteroides fragilis ccra, the chryseobacterium meningosepticum blab, and the cassette-encoded imp-1 enzymes. among these, vim-1 showed the highest degree of similarity to bc-ii. similarly to blaimp, blavim was also found to be carried on  a gene cassette inserted into a class 1 integron. the blavim-containing integron  was located on the chromosome of p. aeruginosa vr-143/97, and the metallo-beta-lactamase-encoding determinant was not transferable to e. coli by conjugation. expression of the integron-borne blavim gene in e. coli resulted in  a significant decrease in susceptibility to a broad array of beta-lactams (ampicillin, carbenicillin, piperacillin, mezlocillin, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, cefoperazone, cefepime, and carbapenems), revealing a very broad substrate specificity of the vim-1 enzyme.

AB  == a biological assay was developed for the detection of carbapenemases, particularly metallo-beta-lactamases, in bacteroides fragilis. the isolates tested possessed the gene (cfia) responsible for metallo-beta-lactamase production, and showed reduced susceptibility to imipenem. carbapenemase activity was investigated spectrophotometrically and by a biological assay in which sonicates of bacterial cells were mixed with imipenem in wells cut into isosensitest agar inoculated with an escherichia coli indicator organism. after incubation, zones of inhibition were measured. reductions in zone size compared to a beta-lactamase-negative control, indicating carbapenemase production, were observed with all strains that exhibited hydrolysis of imipenem when measured spectrophotometrically, and with one isolate in which activity was not detected by spectrophotometry. inclusion of edta in the well mixtures abolished the reduction in zone size, indicating the presence of metallo-beta-lactamase. this simple method can detect weak carbapenemase activity that may be overlooked by spectrophotometry.

TI  == prostaglandin e2 down-regulation of t cell il-2 production is independent of il-10 during gram-negative sepsis.
AB  == the present study ascertained the role of pge2 in sepsis associated modulation of il-2 and il-10 production by t cells. sepsis was induced in 225-250 g male rats (sprague dawley) by implanting fecal pellets containing escherichia coli (100-150 cfu) and bacteroides fragilis (10(4) cfu) into the abdominal cavity. animals implanted with fecal pellets without the bacteria were designated as sterile. for the assessment of pge2 role in sepsis, a group of septic and sterile rats were pretreated with indomethacin to inhibit endogenous pge2 synthesis. splenic t cells were obtained 48 h after septic or sterile implantations, and their il-2 and il-10 production was measured. a significant suppression in the levels of il-2 production and mrna expression was observed in t cells from septic rats compared with the t cells from sterile and control rats. il-10 protein and mrna expression was found to be significantly higher in septic rat t cell compared to  sterile and control rat t cells. although, treatment of animals with indomethacin significantly prevented the sepsis-related suppression of il-2 production, such treatment of animals was associated with a further upregulation of il-10 production. these data suggest that although pge2 released during sepsis can cause t cell il-2 down-regulation, it may not mediate the t cell il-10 upregulation. the il-2 down-regulation may not be an effect of il-10 upregulation.

AB  == t-3762 is an injectable new quinolone with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. pazufloxacin (t-3761) is an active form of t-3762. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of pazufloxacin for 50% of the clinical isolates tested were 3.13 microg/ml for streptococcus agalactiae, 6.25 microg/ml for gardnerella vaginalis, 0.025 microg/ml for escherichia coli, 0.78 microg/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6.25 microg/ml for peptostreptococcus magnus, 6.25 microg/ml for bacteroides fragilis and 12.5 microg/ml for prevotella bivia. the mics of t-3762 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 3.13 microg/ml for s. agalactiae, 6.25 microg/ml for g. vaginalis, 0.10 microg/ml for e. coli, 12.5 microg/ml for p. aeruginosa, 25 microg/ml for p. magnus, 12.5 microg/ml for b. fragilis and 25 microg/ml for p. bivia. the results of this study suggest that, subject to confirmation by clinical trials, t-3762, in combination with an agent  with reliable activity against anaerobic bacteria, is suitable as an empirical therapy of patients with obstetric and gynecological infections.

TI  == effects of short-chain fatty acids on in vitro bacterial growth of bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli.
AB  == short-chain fatty acids (scfa) are produced in the large bowel of nonruminant mammals by bacterial anaerobic fermentation. the aim of the present study was to  investigate the effects of scfa on the in vitro growth of bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli. b. fragilis and e. coli isolated from fresh human clinical  samples and a reference strain for each species were incubated in a meat infusion broth with increasing amounts of scfa and grown under anaerobic conditions at a temperature of 37 degrees c. bacterial growth was estimated by spectrophotometry. rate of growth was calculated from the logarithmic growth phase. scfa, in concentrations normally found in the human colon, had a significant (p<0.01) inhibitory effect of the in vitro growth rate for e. coli, while they were without effect on the in vitro growth rate of b. fragilis. it may be concluded that under in vitro conditions scfa had growth-inhibitory effects on e. coli, while they had no effect on b. fragilis.

TI  == subacute sepsis impairs vascular smooth muscle contractile machinery and alters vasoconstrictor and dilator mechanisms.
AB  == introduction: sepsis results in hyporesponsiveness to alpha-adrenergic stimulation. this is thought to be mediated by the release of vasoactive compounds from the septic endothelium or by the direct effect of sepsis on vascular smooth muscle (vsm) contractile mechanics and machinery. previous studies have used lethal models of sepsis or endotoxemia to examine this phenomenon. the present study utilizes a clinically relevant, nonlethal model of  soft tissue infection to determine the effects of sepsis on alpha-adrenergic mechanisms. we hypothesize that subacute sepsis causes impaired alpha-adrenergic  vascular responsiveness by a combination of effects on adrenergic constrictor mechanisms, endogenous dilator tone, and vsm contractile function. methods: male  sprague-dawley rats underwent implantation of a 2 x 2-cm2 gauze sponge into a subcutaneous pocket created at the base of the tail. five days after implantation, sepsis (s) was induced by inoculation of the sponge with 10(9) cfu  escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis. controls (c) were inoculated with saline. thoracic aortic harvest was performed 24 and 48 h after sponge inoculation for organ bath ring studies. receptor-mediated (phenylephrine) and nonreceptor-mediated (kcl) maximum force of contraction (fmax) was measured. vessel sensitivity (pd2) to phenylephrine, acetylcholine, and kcl was calculated  from dose-response curves. results: at 24 h, sepsis resulted in a lower fmax to phenylephrine (1.15 for c vs 0.5 for s, p < 0.05 by anova), despite an increase in vessel sensitivity (pd2) to alpha-adrenergic stimulation (6.70 for c vs 6.88 for s, p < 0.05 by anova). fmax to kcl was lower in septic animals at 24 h (3. 50 for c vs 2.77 for s, p < 0.05 by anova) and sensitivity to acetylcholine (pd2) was markedly increased (6.56 for c vs 7.23 for s, p < 0.05 by anova). at 48 h, the impairment in fmax to alpha-adrenergic stimulation (2.29 for c vs 1.72 for s, p < 0.05 by anova) and kcl (3.5 for c vs 3.08 for s. p < 0.05 vs 24 h c by anova) persisted without any change in sensitivity to phenylephrine or acetylcholine. conclusions: subacute sepsis results in an early suppression of maximum contractile force despite an increase in adrenergic receptor sensitivity (pd2). this may be secondary to an elevation in dilator sensitivity combined with a direct effect of sepsis on vsm contractile mechanisms. later in the septic process, however, alpha-adrenergic hyporesponsiveness ( downward arrow fmax) is primarily due to changes in vsm contractile machinery.

TI  == reduced bacterial dissemination and liver injury in cd14-deficient mice following a chronic abscess-forming peritonitis induced by bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == the cd14 myelomonocytic differentiation antigen plays a major role in acute gram-negative infections with escherichia coli; however, its role in chronic infections has not yet been analyzed. to address this question, we studied the role of cd14 in a chronic abscess-forming peritonitis, induced by bacteroides fragilis. b. fragilis (3x10(8) cfu/ml) were resuspended in a liquid nutrient agar and injected into the peritoneal cavity of cd14-deficient (cd 14-/-) and normal c57bl/6j (cd 14+/+) mice, respectively. after 3 days there was a severe phlegmonous intra-abdominal inflammation in both groups. after 7 days an abscess-forming peritonitis developed and by 14 days the infectious foci were compartimentalized. these observations were indistinguishable between cd14-/- and cd14+/+ mice. although no differences were seen in abscess formation, cd14-/- mice were able to clear b. fragilis more efficiently from the blood than cd14+/+  mice. after 3, 7, and 14 days blood cultures were b. fragilis positive in 11% (1/9), 20% (2/10), and 0% (0/9) in cd14-/-compared with 90% (9/10), 78% (7/9), and 20% (2/10) in cd14+/+ mice, respectively (p<0.05). furthermore, although the  infection resulted in hepatocellular necrosis and severe hepatitis in both groups, at day 14 the liver cell damage was more severe in cd14+/+ than in cd14-/- mice (p<0.05). these results show that the chronic abscess formation induced by b. fragilis capsular polysaccharides is cd14 independent; however, bacterial clearance and/or dissemination and liver cell damage are at least partially influenced by cd14-dependent mechanisms.

TI  == tnf-binding protein ameliorates inhibition of skeletal muscle protein synthesis during sepsis.
AB  == we examined the effects of tnf-binding protein (tnfbp) on regulatory mechanisms of muscle protein synthesis during sepsis in four groups of rats: control; control+tnfbp; septic; and septic+tnfbp. saline (1. 0 ml) or tnfbp (1 mg/kg, 1.0  ml) was injected daily starting 4 h before the induction of sepsis. the effect of tnfbp on gastrocnemius weight, protein content, and the rate of protein synthesis was examined 5 days later. sepsis reduced the rate of protein synthesis by 35% relative to controls by depressing translational efficiency. decreases in protein synthesis were accompanied by similar reductions in protein content and muscle weight. treatment of septic animals with tnfbp for 5 days prevented the sepsis-induced inhibition of protein synthesis and restored translational efficiency to control values. tnfbp treatment of control rats for 5 days was without effect on muscle protein content or protein synthesis. we also assessed potential mechanisms regulating translational efficiency. the phosphorylation state of p70(s6) kinase was not altered by sepsis. sepsis reduced the gastrocnemius content of eukaryotic initiation factor 2bepsilon (eif2bepsilon), but not eif2alpha. the decrease in eif2bepsilon content was prevented by treatment of septic rats with tnfbp. tnfbp ameliorates the sepsis-induced changes in protein metabolism in gastrocnemius, indicating a role for tnf in the septic process. the data suggest that tnf may impair muscle protein synthesis by reducing expression of specific initiation factors during sepsis.

TI  == bacteroides fragilis transfer factor tn5520: the smallest bacterial mobilizable transposon containing single integrase and mobilization genes that function in escherichia coli.
AB  == many bacterial genera, including bacteroides spp., harbor mobilizable transposons, a class of transfer factors that carry genes for conjugal dna transfer and, in some cases, antibiotic resistance. mobilizable transposons are capable of inserting into and mobilizing other, nontransferable plasmids and are  implicated in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance. this paper presents the isolation and characterization of tn5520, a new mobilizable transposon from bacteroides fragilis lv23. at 4,692 bp, it is the smallest mobilizable transposon reported from any bacterial genus. tn5520 was captured from b. fragilis lv23 by using the transfer-deficient shuttle vector pgat400deltabglii. the termini of tn5520 contain a 22-bp imperfect inverted repeat, and transposition does not result in a target site repeat. tn5520 also demonstrates insertion site sequence  preferences characterized by a-t-rich nucleotide sequences. tn5520 has been sequenced in its entirety, and two large open reading frames whose predicted protein products exhibit strong sequence similarity to recombinase-integrase enzymes and mobilization proteins, respectively, have been identified. the transfer, mobilization, and transposition properties of tn5520 have been studied, revealing that tn5520 mobilizes plasmids in both b. fragilis and escherichia coli at high frequency and also transposes in e. coli.

TI  == lipopolysaccharide structure influences the macrophage response via cd14-independent and cd14-dependent pathways.
AB  == cd14, a protein expressed on the surface of monocytes and neutrophils, is a major receptor for lipopolysaccharide (lps). studies with normal and cd14-deficient macrophages show that responses to low concentrations of lps require expression of cd14, whereas responses to high concentrations of lps are cd14-independent. since lps isolated from different bacterial species shows structural variability, studies were performed to determine whether differences in lps structure influence cd14-dependent and cd14-independent responses. studies with lps purified from escherichia coli, salmonella abortus subspecies equi, salmonella minnesota, pseudomonas aeruginosa, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis,  and rhodobacter sphaeroides show that the strongest cd14-dependent responses require a typical o-antigen, long carbohydrate chains, at least 6 acyl chains in  their lipid a, and 2-phosphorylated kdo moieties; wild-type lps lacking a typical o-antigen and containing short carbohydrate chains and 2-phosphorylated kdo moieties induces the strongest cd14-independent response.

TI  == microbiological and inflammatory effects of murine recombinant interleukin-10 in  two models of polymicrobial peritonitis in rats.
AB  == a protective effect of interleukin-10 (il-10) against the development of lethal shock has been demonstrated in various animal models. in contrast, the immunosuppressant properties of this mediator have been minimally evaluated in low-mortality models of infections. the clinical, microbiological, and inflammatory effects of murine recombinant il-10 (mril-10) therapy were evaluated in two models of peritonitis in rats, which differed in the degree of severity of peritoneal inflammation 3 days after inoculation of escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis with or without enterococcus faecalis. the severity of the disease remained unchanged compared to that in control animals. a dose-related decrease in the peritoneal phagocyte count was observed in the treated groups compared to the counts in control animals. the subsequent experiments were performed exclusively in the mixed gram-positive-gram negative model, which exhibits an intense and prolonged inflammatory response with similar criteria. the early effects of mril-10 (evaluated 6 h after inoculation), repeated injections of mril-10 (four doses injected from 0 to 9 h after bacterial challenge), and pretreatment (two doses injected 6 and 3 h before inoculation) were evaluated. the clinical and microbiological parameters remained unchanged in the treated animals. decreases in the peritoneal phagocyte count and the peritoneal concentration of tumor necrosis factor were observed following repeated injections of mril-10. in summary, our data suggest that mril-10 does not worsen the manifestations of sepsis. however, these results need to be confirmed in clinical practice.

AB  == cl 188,624, cl 190,294, and cl 191,121 are novel aminomethyl tetrahydrofuranyl (thf)-1 beta-methylcarbapenems. the in vitro antibacterial activities of these thf carbapenems were evaluated and compared with those of biapenem, imipenem, and meropenem against 554 recent clinical isolates obtained from geographically distinct medical centers across north america. the antibacterial activities of the thf carbapenems were equivalent to that of biapenem, and the thf carbapenems  were slightly more active than imipenem and less active than meropenem against most of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae but lacked significant activity against pseudomonas isolates. in general, cl 191,121 was two- to fourfold more active than cl 188,624 and cl 190,294 against the staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates tested. cl 191,121 was twofold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and was as activity as imipenem against enterococcus faecalis isolates. biapenem and meropenem were two- and fourfold less active than cl 191,121, respectively, against the methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and e. faecalis. all the carbapenems displayed equivalent good activities against the streptococci. biapenem was slightly more active than the other carbapenems against bacteroides fragilis isolates. time-kill curve studies demonstrated that the thf carbapenems were bactericidal in 6 h against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus isolates.  the postantibiotic effect exerted by cl 191,121 was comparable to or slightly longer than that of imipenem against isolates of s. aureus, e. coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae.

AB  == the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of surgical-site infections (ssi) following spinal fusion was retrospectively studied. this was done by reviewing the clinical and microbiological records at the naval hospital in bethesda, md.,  from 1980 to 1992. aspirates of pus from 25 infection sites showed bacterial growth. aerobic bacteria only were recovered from 9 (36%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria only were recovered from 4 (16%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 12 (48%). sixty isolates were recovered: 38 aerobes  (1.5 isolates per specimen) and 22 anaerobes (0.9 isolate per specimen). the predominant aerobes were escherichia coli (n = 8) and proteus sp. (n = 7). the predominant anaerobes were bacteroides fragilis group (n = 9) and peptostreptococcus sp. (n = 6) isolates. an increase in recovery of e. coli and b. fragilis was noted in patients with bowel or bladder incontinence. this study  highlights the polymicrobial nature of ssi and the importance of anaerobic bacteria in ssi following spinal fusion.

AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in taiwan. meropenem was active against most gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis. for many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. it is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. it is uncommon for these common bacteria, except mrsa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to  other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.

TI  == ecological and physiological studies on large intestinal bacteria in relation to  production of hydrolytic and reductive enzymes involved in formation of genotoxic metabolites.
AB  == several hydrolytic and reductive bacterial enzymes (beta-glucuronidase, gn; beta-glucosidase, gs; arylsulphatase, as; azoreductase, ar; nitroreductase, nr) involved in production of mutagenic or genotoxic metabolites were measured in human colonic contents. cell-associated as and extracellular gs were approximately twice as high in the distal colon compared with the proximal bowel, while ar changed little throughout the gut. measurements of these enzymes in faeces from seven healthy donors confirmed that the majority were cell-associated, and demonstrated high levels of inter-individual variability. nr decreased four-fold between the proximal and distal colon while extracellular gn  was reduced by 50%. most probable number (mpn) analysis on faeces obtained from six healthy donors showed that counts of intestinal bacteria producing gs and ar  were c. 10(10) and 10(11)/g, respectively, in all samples tested. numbers of gn-  and as-forming organisms were between two and three orders of magnitude lower. inter-individual carriage rates of bacterial populations synthesising nr were highly variable. screening of 20 pure cultures of intestinal bacteria, belonging  to six different genera, showed that bacteroides ovatus, in particular, synthesised large amounts of gs, whereas b. fragilis, b. vulgatus and bifidobacterium pseudolongum formed the highest cell-associated levels of gn. in  general, bifidobacteria and lactobacillus acidophilus did not produce significant amounts of ar. all five clostridia studied (clostridium bifermentans, c. septicum, c. perfringens, c. sporogenes and c. butyricum) produced nr and ar, as  did the bacteroides (b. fragilis, b. ovatus and b. vulgatus). escherichia coli and c. perfringens formed large amounts of nr. levels of as production were invariably low and few of the organisms screened synthesised this enzyme. in-vitro studies investigating the effect of intestinal transit time on enzyme production, in a three-stage (v1-v3) continuous culture model of the colon operated at system retention times (r) of either 31.1 or 68.4 h, showed that specific activities of gs were up to four-fold higher (v3) at r = 31.1 h. bacteriological analysis demonstrated that representative populations of colonic  micro-organisms were maintained in the fermentation system, and indicated that changes in gs activity were not related to numbers of the predominant anaerobic or facultative anaerobic species within the model, but were explainable on the basis of substrate-induced modulation of bacterial metabolism.

TI  == microvascular endothelial cell control of peripheral vascular resistance during sepsis.
AB  == objective: to determine the endothelial-dependent control of decreased peripheral vascular resistance in skeletal muscle microvessels during evolving sepsis. materials and interventions: acute (4 hours, n=7), established (24 hours, n=7), or chronic (72 hours, n=8) infection was induced in sprague-dawley rats (150-175  g) by injecting escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis (1 x 10(9) colony-forming units for both) into a subcutaneous sponge. control animals were injected with an isotonic sodium chloride solution and analyzed at the same time  points: (n=6-8 per group). dilation in response to the topically applied endothelial-dependent agonist acetylcholine (ach) (1 x 10(-9) to 1 x 10(-5) mol/l) was measured in inflow first-order (a1) and precapillary fourth-order (a4) arterioles in cremaster muscle in vivo with videomicroscopy. acetylcholine dose-response curves were used to determine vascular reactivity by calculating the concentration of ach necessary to elicit 50% of the maximal dilator response. main outcome measures: in vivo reactivity of striated muscle microvessels to the  dilation agonist ach during acute, established, and chronic infection. results: a1 vessels were unresponsive to all doses of ach at all time points. a4 vessels showed an increased dilator response during short-term treatment, which deteriorated over time to depressed dilation during chronic infection. conclusions: precapillary a4 vessels have increased dilator reactivity during early sepsis, which progresses to depressed levels with chronic infection. a1 microvessels remain dilated and are not substantially influenced by endothelial dilator mechanisms initiated by ach. maximum dilation of the large a1 vessels appears to contribute to the decrease in peripheral vascular resistance noted during systemic infection.

TI  == microbiological examinations and in-vitro testing of different antibiotics in therapeutic endoscopy of the biliary system.
AB  == background and study aims: prior to endoscopic therapeutic procedures, no antibiotic prophylaxis is administered routinely. because of the reported incidence of infectious complications, which may reach up to 10%, a prospective study was undertaken to investigate the effects of a prophylactic dose of cefuroxime on the incidence of bacteremia and clinical signs of infection, but no significant effects could be demonstrated. in addition to this published work, blood and bile cultures obtained in this trial were also investigated, and the in-vitro susceptibility to several antibiotics was tested in order to recommend the appropriate substances. patients and methods: ninety-nine consecutive patients (51 men, 48 women; mean age 61.4 +/- 17 years) with biliary obstruction  who underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp) or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography with drainage (ptcd) were included. sequential blood cultures were taken before and up to 60 minutes after the endoscopic intervention. bile cultures were obtained in 56 patients with biliary  drainage. aerobic and anaerobic cultures were prepared from all obtained specimens and the isolated organisms were identified. in the case of positive cultures, an in-vitro resistance test for 15 different antibiotics was performed. results: the incidence of bacteremia was 11.1% (n = 11), and 16 bacteria were isolated. twelve different microorganisms were detected, with escherichia coli found in four cases. from 41 positive out of 56 prepared bile cultures (73.2%), 91 isolates were found with 25 different species. a single agent was detected in  eight cases (19.5%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to six species, was found in 33 cases (80.5%). the seven most frequently isolated germs  were e. coli and enterococcus (each n = 19), klebsiella (n = 10), streptococcus viridans (n = 9), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 5), morganella morganii (n = 4), and bacteroides fragilis (n = 3), representing 76% of all agents. examination for fungal infection revealed positive cultures of candida albicans in 16.1% of bile cultures (nine of 56). interestingly, the use of proton-pump inhibitors (ppis), with a consequent rise in the gastric ph value, led to an increase in the rate of bacteremia to 26.2% (five of 19) compared to the other patients not on ppis (n = 80), who developed bacteremia in only six cases (7.5%; p = 0.02). in-vitro testing of different antibiotics was carried out in 73 isolates. imipenem showed the best antimicrobial activity (98.4%), followed by trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (90%), amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid (87.3%), vancomycin  (82.4%), and ofloxacin (76.9%). conclusions: escherichia coli was found to be the pathogen most frequently detected in blood and bile following endoscopic interventions in the biliary tract. enterococci, klebsiella and streptococcus viridans were found in bile cultures with an incidence exceeding 10%. in view of  the in-vitro test results, possible side effects, and contraindications, amoxicillin plus beta-lactamase inhibitors or quinolones are considered to be suitable antibiotics for the prophylaxis of biliary infections.

TI  == activities of the porphyromonas gingivalis prtp proteinase determined by construction of prtp-deficient mutants and expression of the gene in bacteroides  species.
AB  == prtp is a major cysteine proteinase of porphyromonas gingivalis. the gene encoding this proteinase, prtp, was cloned into the escherichia coli-bacteroides  shuttle vectors pfd288 and pfd340 and was expressed in bacteroides cells, apparently under the control of its own promoter, when in pfd288, or a bacteroides promoter present on pfd340. proteolytically active prtp was detected  by fibrinogen zymography in cells or spent growth medium of several bacteroides species harboring the recombinant plasmids. the proteinase was recovered from bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285(pfd340-prtp) cells by 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethyl-ammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (chaps) extraction and characterized with regard to exopeptidase specificity and sensitivity to proteinase inhibitors. lys-amidolytic activity, but not arg-amidolytic activity,  was detected. prtp was activated by cysteine and, to a lesser extent, dithiothreitol, and it was stimulated by glycine-containing compounds. it also was inhibited by nalpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (tlck) and, to a lesser extent, h-d-tyr-l-pro-l-arginyl chloromethyl ketone (yprck) and was relatively insensitive to edta and leupeptin. neither b. fragilis atcc 25285(pfd340-prtp) cells nor the chaps extract effected hemagglutination of sheep red blood cells or collagen cleavage, but the cells did cleave gelatin. furthermore, p. gingivalis w12, atcc 33277, kdp110, and hg66 with knockout mutations in prtp were constructed by allelic replacement. unlike the parent strains, the mutant strains produced beige colonies on plates containing sheep blood. these strains also were affected in their ability to effect hemagglutination, cleave collagen, and cleave a lys-specific peptide substrate. this report presents the results of the first characterization of the prtp proteinase clearly in the absence of any influence by other p. gingivalis proteins and describes the properties of p. gingivalis cells defective in the production of prtp.

TI  == mechanism of inhibition of tannic acid and related compounds on the growth of intestinal bacteria.
AB  == tannic acid, propyl gallate and methyl gallate, but not gallic acid, were found to be inhibitory to the growth of intestinal bacteria bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285, clostridium clostridiiforme atcc 25537, c. perfringens atcc 13124, c. paraputrificum atcc 25780, escherichia coli atcc 25922, enterobacter cloacae atcc 13047, salmonella typhimurium ta98 and s. typhimurium yg1041 at 100-1000 microg/ml in culture broth. neither bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697 nor lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 was inhibited by any of the above compounds up to 500 microg/ml. tannic acid has a much greater relative binding efficiency to iron than propyl gallate, methyl gallate or gallic acid. the inhibitory effect of tannic acid to the growth of intestinal bacteria may be due to the strong iron binding capacity of tannic acid; whereas the effect of propyl gallate and methyl  gallate probably occurs by a different mechanism. the growth of e. coli was restored by the addition of iron to the medium after the precipitate caused by tannic acid was removed. neither b. infantis nor l. acidophilus require iron for  growth. this probably contributes to their resistance to tannic acid. because tannins are abundant in the human diet, tannins may affect the growth of some intestinal bacteria and thus may have an impact on human health.

AB  == in this study, three types of treated wastewater were tested for infectious enteroviruses, the enterovirus genome, somatic coliphages, and bacteroides fragilis phages. the aim of this work was to determine whether the presence of the two types of bacteriophages or of the enterovirus genome was a good indicator of infectious enterovirus contamination. the enterovirus genome was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. infectious enteroviruses were quantified by cell culturing (bgm cells), and the bacteriophages were quantified  by plaque formation on the host bacterium (escherichia coli or b. fragilis) in agar medium. forty-eight samples of treated wastewater were analyzed. sixteen samples had been subjected to a secondary treatment for 8 to 12 h (a), 16 had been subjected to a secondary treatment for 30 h (b1), and 16 had been subjected  to both secondary and tertiary treatments (b2). the mean concentrations of somatic coliphages were 4.9 x 10(4) pfu . liter-1 for treatment line a, 9.8 x 10(3) pfu . liter-1 for b1, and 1.4 x 10(3) pfu . liter-1 for b2, with all the samples testing positive (100%). the mean concentrations of b. fragilis phages were 1.7 x 10(3) pfu . liter-1 for a (100% positive samples), 17 to 24 pfu . liter-1 for b1 (44% positive samples), and 0.8 to 13 pfu . liter-1 for b2 (6% positive samples). the mean concentrations of infectious enteroviruses were 4 most probable number of cytopathogenic units (mpncu) . liter-1 for a (31% positive samples) and <1 mpncu . liter-1 for b1 and b2 (0% positive samples). the percentages of samples testing positive for the enterovirus genome were 100% for  a, 56% for b1, and 19% for b2. the percentages of samples testing positive for the enterovirus genome were significantly higher than those for infectious enteroviruses. this finding may have been due to the presence of noninfectious enteroviruses or to the presence of infectious enteroviruses that do not multiply in bgm cell cultures. however, under our experimental conditions, nondetection of the genome implies the absence of infectious viruses. there was a significant correlation between the concentration of somatic coliphages or b. fragilis phages and the presence of infectious enteroviruses or the presence of the enterovirus genome. however, the somatic coliphage concentration did not lead to fluctuations in the infectious enterovirus concentration, whereas the b. fragilis phage concentration did.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of endodontic medications].
AB  == background: the successful outcome of endodontic treatment depends on the elimination of bacteria present inside the root canal system. in the pulpal chronic infection, intracanal medicaments are necessary to obtain the sterilization. this study evaluated the antibacterial activities of some intracanal medicaments. methods: the bacteria used were: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus viridans, escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis and candida albicans; the medicaments used were: stomidros, stomilex, endoidros and cresatina. wells were punched in plates and filled with the medicaments to be tested. the diameters of the areas of bacterial inhibition were measured and recorded after 24.48 hours and 7 days. results and conclusions: the most important result of this study is the demonstration of the inefficiency of medicaments like calcium hydroxide against candida albicans. the cresatina showed antibacterial activity against all bacteria used.

TI  == tnf binding protein prevents hyperlactatemia and inactivation of pdh complex in skeletal muscle during sepsis.
AB  == background: hyperlactatemia is a metabolic complication of hypermetabolic, hyperdynamic sepsis. an important mechanism responsible for elevating plasma lactate concentrations in sepsis is altered regulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (pdh) in skeletal muscle. we investigated the ability of a  specific tumor necrosis factor binding protein, tnfbp, to modulate lactate concentrations and skeletal muscle pdh activity in a rodent model of chronic abdominal sepsis. materials and methods: we examined the regulation of lactate metabolism in four groups of animals: control, control + tnfbp, septic, and septic + tnfbp. chronic (5 days) sepsis was induced by the creation of a stable intraabdominal abscess using a sterile fecal-agar pellet inoculated with e. coli  plus b. fragilis as the foreign body nidus. tnfbp (1 mg/kg/day) was injected subcutaneously daily. results: sepsis increased plasma and skeletal muscle lactate concentrations 2-fold compared with control. in septic rats treated with  tnfbp, plasma and skeletal muscle lactate concentrations were significantly decreased compared with untreated septic rats. in skeletal muscle, sepsis resulted in a 70% decrease in the proportion of the pdh in the active form compared with controls. the sepsis-induced inhibition in the pdh complex activity was prevented by tnfbp. pdh kinase was enhanced 1.8-fold in sepsis, and the increase in pdh kinase activity was prevented by treatment with tnfbp. tnfbp treatment did not have any effects on plasma lactate or the proportion of active  skeletal muscle pdh activity in control animals. conclusions: tnfbp prevents the  sepsis-induced hyperlactatemia and derangements in skeletal muscle lactate concentrations and pdh activity. these observations suggest that tnf is an important mediator responsible for lactate dyshomeostasis during sepsis.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of infection after trauma.
AB  == clinical and laboratory data from 1973 to 1988 were retrospectively reviewed to study the microbiology of infection following trauma. a total of 368 specimens obtained from 340 trauma patients showed bacterial growth. the traumas included lacerations (163), blunt trauma (76), penetrating trauma (65), bites (20), and open fractures (10). anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 119 (32%) specimens, aerobic bacteria only in 58 (16%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 191 (52%). a total of 444 anaerobic (1.2 isolates per specimen) and 267 aerobic or facultative (0.7 per specimen) were recovered. the predominant anaerobic bacteria included bacteroides fragilis group (119 isolates), peptostreptococcus spp (113), clostridium spp (78), prevotella spp (58), and fusobacterium spp (23). the predominant aerobic bacteria included escherichia coli (83), staphylococcus aureus (61), streptococcus pyogenes (27), streptococcus group d (16), and klebsiella pneumoniae (16). the types of infections included abscesses (109), bacteremia (32), bites (13), empyema (10), osteomyelitis (21), peritonitis (52), thrombophlebitis (12), and wounds (116, including posttraumatic wounds, cellulitis, stump wound, decubitus ulcers, myositis, and fasciitis). s. aureus was isolated at all sites. however, organisms of the oropharyngeal flora predominated in infections that originated from that location (ie, head and neck  wounds, and abscesses or bites), and those of the gastrointestinal flora predominated in infections that originated from that site (ie, peritonitis, abdominal abscesses, decubitus ulcers). this study showed the polymicrobial nature of many infections that follow trauma.

TI  == sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == bacterial translocation in thioacetamide induced liver cirrhosis in rats.
AB  == cirrhotic liver is predisposed to bacterial infections. different species of bacteria including escherichia coli, enterobacter and bacteroides fragilis were found to colonize thioacetamide-induced cirrhotic rat liver. zinc treatment of the cirrhotic rats significantly corrected the histological and histochemical changes in the liver. however, this reversal with zinc treatment was not accompanied by any change in the bacterial colonies in the liver. the study shows that cirrhosis predisposes liver to bacterial colonization and the process is not reversible despite the partial reversal of the cirrhotic changes.

TI  == the bacteroides fragilis btga mobilization protein binds to the orit region of pbftm10.
AB  == the bacteroides fragilis conjugal plasmid pbftm10 contains two genes, btga and btgb, and a putative orit region necessary for transfer in bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli. the btga protein was predicted to contain a helix-turn-helix motif, indicating possible dna binding activity. dna sequence analysis of the region immediately upstream of btga revealed three sets of inverted repeats, potentially locating the orit region. a 304-bp dna fragment comprising this putative orit region was cloned and confirmed to be the functional pbftm10 orit by bacterial conjugation experiments using e. coli and b. fragilis. btga was cloned and overexpressed in e. coli, and the purified protein  was used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, demonstrating specific binding of btga protein to its cognate orit. dnase i footprint analysis demonstrated that btga binds apparently in a single-stranded fashion to the orit-containing fragment, overlapping inverted repeats i, ii, and iii and the putative nick site.

TI  == in vitro activities of e1101, a novel oral cephalosporin, against bacteria causing infections in obstetric and gynecological patients.
AB  == e1101 is a new oral cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. it inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli and peptostreptococcus magnus at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. e1101 was the most active agent against s. agalactiae and e. coli.  since none of the compounds was sufficiently active against the bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia isolates, they are not appropriate in the treatment of patients with infections caused by these organisms. the results of this study  suggest that, subject to confirmation by clinical trials, e1101, in combination with an agent with reliable activity against anaerobic bacteria, is suitable as empirical therapy of patients with obstetric and gynecological infections.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == purification, characterization, and kinetic studies of a soluble bacteroides fragilis metallo-beta-lactamase that provides multiple antibiotic resistance.
AB  == resistance to multiple beta-lactam antibiotics traced to the expression of zn(ii) requiring metallo-beta-lactamases has emerged in clinical isolates of several bacterial strains including bacteroides fragilis, a pathogen commonly found in suppurative/surgical infections. a soluble b. fragilis metallo-beta-lactamase has been purified to homogeneity from the cell growth medium after expression as a secretory protein in escherichia coli. the enzyme requires two tightly bound zn(ii) ions for full activity, and the zn(ii) ions can be removed by edta from the enzyme. the apoenzyme is reactivated by stoichiometric amounts of zn(ii) and  co(ii) ions. the co(ii)-substituted enzyme exhibits a uv-visible spectrum characterized by strong co(ii) d-d transitions at 510, 548, 615, and 635 nm and an epr spectrum with g values of 5. 52, 4.25, and 2.01: features that serve as useful spectroscopic handles for the mechanistic studies of the enzyme. although  steady-state and transient-state kinetic studies of the soluble zn(ii) enzyme with nitrocefin as substrate found no ionizable groups with pka values between 5.25 and 10.0 involved in catalysis, a kinetically significant proton transfer step in turnover was implicated by studies in deuterium oxide. these studies also detected the accumulation of an enzyme-bound intermediate and provide the basis for a minimal kinetic scheme describing metallo-beta-lactamase-catalyzed nitrocefin hydrolysis.

TI  == bacterially preexposed t cells impair bacterial elimination by non-th1/th2 cell mechanisms in a model of intra-abdominal infection.
AB  == background: escherichia coli preexposure in mice results in impaired elimination  of subsequent intra-abdominal infections by a cd+4 t cell-dependent process. certain gram-negative infections have been shown to induce t-helper-(th)2 type cd4+ t-cell differentiation, which correlates with impaired elimination of infection and death. we hypothesized that e coli preexposure impairs subsequent bacterial elimination as a consequence of th2 differentiation and that interleukin-12 (il-12) treatment could reverse this differentiation and minimize  the effects of e coli preexposure. methods: after preexposure to e coli or other  species, balb/c mice or interferon-gamma (inf-gamma)-deficient mice, treated with or without il-12, were given a standard intra-abdominal infection (e coli, bacteroides fragilis, and adjuvant). cohorts were killed for abscess quantification, in vitro t-cell proliferative responsiveness, and cytokine secretory profiles. splenic lymphocytes preexposed in vivo to other types of bacteria were transferred to naive mice before intra-abdominal infection to determine whether preexposure, eliciting the lymphocyte-dependent response, was species specific. results: e coli preexposure alone caused no th1 or th2 shift; increased the proliferative responses of t cells; and, in combination with il-12  therapy, caused markedly decreased il-2 and il-4 responses and an increased ifn-gamma response. il-12 therapy did not change the response to intra-abdominal  infection despite its ability to cause marked th1 polarization. ifn-gamma-deficient mice responded to e coli preexposure no differently than did  wild-type mice. transfer of lymphocytes preexposed to pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and hemolytic e coli but not other types of nosocomial pathogens caused the development of more abscesses just as transfer of e coli preexposed lymphocytes had. conclusions: cd4+ t cells responsive to e coli preexposure regulate subsequent intra-abdominal abscess formation by a mechanism  not explained by the th1/th2 paradigm. preexposure to hemolytic e coli and other  enterobacteriaceae alters responses to intra-abdominal infection.

AB  == objective: prevotella bivia is one of the anaerobic bacteria that resides in the  flora of the female genital tract. we studied the pathogenicity of p. bivia in a  rat pyometra model. methods: the experimental animal (rat) model of pyometra was  developed to investigate the pathogenicity of p. bivia in a rat pyometra model. results: in the groups inoculated with aerobes alone, the infection rate was 10%  (1/10) in the staphylococcus aureus- or staphylococcus agalactiae-inoculated group and 20% (2/10) in the escherichia coli-inoculated group. infection was not  established in the groups inoculated with anaerobes alone. high infection rates were observed in all the mixed-infection groups. in the s. agalactiae- and bacteroides fragilis-, s. agalactiae- and p. bivia-, f. coli- and b. fragilis-, and e. coli- and p. bivia-inoculated groups, an infection rate of 100% (10/10) was demonstrated. the efficacy of antibiotics such as flomoxef (fmox) could be determined using a rat pyometra model. in relation to the alteration of vaginal microbial flora during the menstrual cycle, estrogen increased the growth of p. bivia. conclusion: mixture of aerobic bacteria and p. bivia increased the pathogenicity of p. bivia. estrogen would be useful for raising up the inflammatory change of the uterus in experimental models of genital tract infection due to p. bivia.

TI  == spectroscopic characterization of a binuclear metal site in bacillus cereus beta-lactamase ii.
AB  == the zinc metalloenzyme beta-lactamase ii (betalii) from bacillus cereus has been  overexpressed in escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione-s-transferase, and the metal binding properties of recombinant betalii toward zn(ii) and co(ii) have been studied by fluorescence and activity measurements. the apoenzyme is able to bind two metal ion equivalents, which confer on betalii its maximum enzymatic efficiency. the enzyme is partially active with one metal ion equivalent. the dico(ii) and a mixed zn(ii)co(ii) derivative of betalii were obtained and probed by electronic and paramagnetic nmr spectroscopy. in the high-affinity site, the metal is bound to three his residues and a solvent molecule, adopting a tetrahedral geometry. a cys, a his, and an asp residue are coordinated to the low-affinity metal site, together with two or three solvent molecules. this coordination polyhedron resembles the binuclear metal site of the bacteroides fragilis beta-lactamase [concha, n., rasmussen, b.  a., bush, k., and herzberg, o. (1996) structure 4, 823-836; carfi, a., duee, e.,  paul-soto, r., galleni, m., frere, j. m., and dideberg, o.

(1995) embo j. 14, 4914-4921]. these results suggest that this binuclear metal site may be a general feature of metallo-beta-lactamases.

AB  == investigations of possible regulators of bacteroides fragilis glutamine synthetase (gs) activity were done in escherichia coli using a compatible dual-plasmid system. the b. fragilis glna gene, together with upstream and downstream flanking regions, was cloned onto the low copy number plasmid pacyc184 and expressed in the e. coli glna ntrb ntrc deletion strain, ymc11. gs activity was monitored following co-transformation with a b. fragilis genomic library carried on the compatible plasmid pecor251. a gene was cloned that caused a twofold increase in b. fragilis gs activity but did not affect the activity of the e. coli gs enzyme or the b. fragilis sucrase (scrl). deletion of the b. fragilis glna downstream region decreased basal levels of gs activity, but did not affect the ability of the cloned gene to increase the b. fragilis gs activity. reporter gene analysis, using the b. fragilis glna promoter region fused to the promoterless clostridium acetobutylicum endoglucanase gene, showed no increase in reporter gene activity. this demonstrated that the increase in gs  activity was not regulated at the transcriptional level, and that the cloned gene product was not affecting the copy number of the plasmid in trans. sequence data  indicated that the cloned gene had good amino acid identity to a range of elongation factor p (ef-p) proteins, the highest being to that of a synechocystis sp (48%), and the least to mycobacterium genitalium (27%). amino acid identity to the e. coli ef-p was intermediate (37%). a possible role for ef-p in enhancing translation of the b. fragilis glna mrna is proposed.

TI  == the nadh-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase enzyme of bacteroides fragilis bf1 is  induced by peptides in the growth medium.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis bf1 possesses two enzymes having glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) activity. one is dual cofactor nad(p)h-dependent, while the other has nadh-specific activity. the gene encoding the nadh-gdh (gdhb) was cloned by complementation of the glutamate auxotrophic mutant escherichia coli mx3004 and the recombinant protein was characterized with respect to the gdh activities present in the parental organism grown under different nitrogen conditions. the nad(p)h-dependent gdh of b. fragilis was confirmed to be most active under high ammonia conditions, but the nadh-specific gdh levels were increased by high peptide concentrations in the growth medium and not regulated by the levels of ammonia. northern blotting analysis showed that gdhb regulation was at the transcription level, with a single transcript of approximately 1.6 kb being produced. gdh activity was demonstrated by zymography of the parental and recombinant enzymes. the recombinant gdh was nadh-specific and co-migrated with the equivalent enzyme band from b. fragilis cell extracts. the gdhb structural gene comprises 1335 bp and encodes a protein of 445 aa (49 kda). comparisons of the derived protein sequence with that of gdh from other bacteria indicated that  significant sequence homology and conservation of functional domains exists with  enzymes of family i-type hexameric gdh proteins.

TI  == detection of bacteroides fragilis enterotoxin gene by pcr.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis constitutes about 1% of the bacterial flora in intestines of normal humans. enterotoxigenic strains of b. fragilis have been associated with diarrheal diseases in humans and animals. the enterotoxin produced by these isolates induces fluid changes in ligated intestinal loops and an in vitro cytotoxic response in ht-29 cells. we developed a nested pcr to detect the enterotoxin gene of b. fragilis in stool specimens. after dna extraction, a 367-bp fragment was amplified with two outer primers. the amplicon from this reaction was subjected to a second round of amplification with a set of internal  primers. with these inner primers, a 290-bp dna fragment was obtained which was confirmed as part of the b. fragilis enterotoxin gene by southern blotting with a nonradioactive internal probe and a chemiluminescence system. by this approach, b. fragilis enterotoxin gene sequences were detected in eight known enterotoxigenic human isolates and nine enterotoxigenic horse isolates. no amplification products were obtained from dna extracted from 28 nonenterotoxigenic b. fragilis isolates or b. distasonis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, b. ovatus, escherichia coli, or clostridium difficile. the sensitivity of this assay allowed us to detect as little as 1 pg of enterotoxin dna sequences or 100 to 1,000 cells of enterotoxigenic b. fragilis/g of stool. enterotoxin production of all isolates was confirmed in vitro in ht-29 cells. a 100% correlation was obtained between enterotoxin detection by cytotoxin assay and the nested pcr assay. this rapid and sensitive assay can be used to identify enterotoxigenic b. fragilis and may be used clinically to determine the role of b. fragilis in diarrheal diseases.

TI  == therapeutic effects of an injectable new quinolone, pazufloxacin, against polymicrobial infections in the uterine endometritis model.
AB  == polymicrobial infections with aerobes and anaerobes are common in female genital  tract infections. we evaluated the efficacy of an injectable new quinolon, pazufloxacin, using a uterine endometritis model. rats were infected with a mixed inoculation of escherichia coli plus bacteriodes fragilis (mic of pazufloxacin and ceftazidime: e. coli: 0.05 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively, b. fragilis: 3.13 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively). after inoculating 10(7) cfu/rat of each organism, pazufloxacin or ceftazidime (10 or 20 mg/kg, respectively, i.v., b.i.d., 3 days) was administered and compared with the nontreated group. the viable cell counts of the uterine corpus and uterine cervix in pazufloxacin-treated and ceftazidime-treated groups were decreased, compared with the nontreated group. the viable cell counts of the adnexa in the pazufloxacin-treated group were significantly decreased, compared with the ceftazidimetreated group. these results suggest that pazufloxacin would be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections, especially adnexitis.

TI  == the periplasmic, group iii catalase of vibrio fischeri is required for normal symbiotic competence and is induced both by oxidative stress and by approach to stationary phase.
AB  == the catalase gene, kata, of the sepiolid squid symbiont vibrio fischeri has been  cloned and sequenced. the predicted amino acid sequence of kata has a high degree of similarity to the recently defined group iii catalases, including those found  in haemophilus influenzae, bacteroides fragilis, and proteus mirabilis. upstream  of the predicted start codon of kata is a sequence that closely matches the consensus sequence for promoters regulated in escherichia coli by the alternative sigma factor encoded by rpos. further, the level of expression of the cloned kata gene in an e. coli rpos mutant is much lower than in wild-type e. coli. catalase  activity is induced three- to fourfold both as growing v. fischeri cells approach stationary phase and upon the addition of a small amount of hydrogen peroxide during logarithmic growth. the catalase activity was localized in the periplasm of wild-type v. fischeri cells, where its role could be to detoxify hydrogen peroxide coming from the external environment. no significant catalase activity could be detected in a kata null mutant strain, demonstrating that kata is the predominately expressed catalase in v. fischeri and indicating that v. fischeri carries only a single catalase gene. the catalase mutant was defective in its ability to competitively colonize the light organs of juvenile squids in coinoculation experiments with the parent strain, suggesting that the catalase enzyme plays an important role in the symbiosis between v. fischeri and its squid host.

TI  == prostaglandin e2 modulation of p59fyn tyrosine kinase in t lymphocytes during sepsis.
AB  == prostaglandin e2 (pge2) has been implicated in the suppression of t cell il-2 production and proliferation during burn and sepsis. the present study evaluated  the potential intracellular mechanism of suppressed t cell responses by assessing the activation of p59fyn kinase in t cells from septic rats as well as the t cells incubated with pge2. p59fyn is known to regulate t cell functions. sepsis was induced in rats by implanting fecal pellets containing escherichia coli (150  cfu) and bacteroides fragilis (10(4) cfu) into the abdominal cavity. for the assessment of pge2 role in sepsis, a group of septic rats were treated with indomethacin, which inhibits endogenous pge2 synthesis. as assessed by immunoblotting or in vitro kinase assay, a more than 40% inhibition of p59fyn phosphorylation and kinase activity was observed in septic rat t cells compared with the t cells from sterile or control rats. a similar inhibition in p59fyn phosphorylation and kinase activity was observed in pge2-treated t cells compared with the t cells incubated in the absence of pge2. the septic-related suppression in p59fyn phosphorylation and kinase activity in t cells was prevented in rats treated with indomethacin. we observed that the inhibition in p59fyn activation in septic or pge2-treated t cells was due primarily to a suppression in p59fyn phosphorylation and not due to alterations in p59fyn protein expression. these findings suggest that pge2 released during sepsis could contribute to the sepsis-related suppression in t cell proliferation by attenuating p59fyn phosphorylation and its kinase activity.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic infection associated with malignancy.
AB  == the goal of this work was to study the microbiology and clinical characteristics  of patients with infections associated with malignancy treated over a period of 17 years. a total of 668 specimens were obtained from 605 patients. the malignancies include 224 hematological malignancies and 381 nonhematogenic malignancies. anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 201 (30%) specimens, aerobic bacteria in 226 (34%), mixed aerobic-anaerobic bacteria in 231 (35%) and  candida spp. in 10 (1%). a total of 683 anaerobic (1.0 isolates per specimens) and 592 aerobic or facultative (0.9 per specimen) organisms were recovered. the predominant anaerobic bacteria included bacteroides fragilis group isolates (181), peptostreptococcus spp. (166), prevotella spp. (106), clostridium spp. (70), and fusobacterium spp. (43). the predominant aerobic bacteria included escherichia coli (133), staphylococcus aureus (100), klebsiella pneumoniae (48),  and pseudomonas aeroginosa (45). the type of infections included abscesses (221), bacteremia (198), wounds (175), including 61 cellulitis, 24 post-surgical wounds  and 23 decubitus ulcers), peritonitis (48), empyema (12), cholecystitis (6) and thrombophlebitis (5). s. aureus and peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from all sites. however, organisms of the oropharyngeal flora (prevotella and fusobacterium spp.) predominated in local infections and bacteremia that originated from this site (head and neck wounds and abscesses and pulmonary infections), and organisms of the gastrointestinal tract flora predominated in infections that originated from this site (peritonitis, abdominal abscesses and decubitus ulcers). this retrospective study demonstrates polymicrobial features of many infections associated with malignancies.

TI  == cytokine and prostaglandin production by amnion cells in response to the addition of different bacteria.
AB  == objective: our goal was to evaluate the effect of escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, mycoplasma hominis, and staphylococcus aureus on cytokine and prostaglandin production by amnion cells in vitro. study design: amnion cells were obtained from women undergoing elective cesarean section before the onset of labor and cultured in a primary cell culture. confluent amnion cells were incubated with heat-inactivated bacteria in different concentrations (10(1) to 10(6) colony-forming units/ml) for 48 hours. samples for quantification of interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and prostaglandin e2 were collected at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours. results: under basal conditions, minor amounts of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 were detectable. incubation of amnion cells with e. coli enhanced the secretion of interleukin-8 and also induced an transient increase of prostaglandin e2 in a dose-dependent manner. b. fragilis produced an increase in the secretion of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8. m. hominis and s. aureus did not cause an increase in either interleukin-6, interleukin-8, or prostaglandin e2. conclusion: the gram-negative bacteria e. coli and b. fragilis stimulated interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 to a greater degree than the other bacteria investigated in this study. this finding may be of clinical interest in the onset of preterm birth.

TI  == the detection of microbial dna in the blood: a sensitive method for diagnosing bacteremia and/or bacterial translocation in surgical patients.
AB  == objective: the purpose was to determine the sensitivity of detecting microbial dna in the blood of surgical patients as a measure for diagnosing systemic infection and/or translocation from the gut. summary background data: microbial infections and translocation of intestinal bacteria are thought to contribute to  multiple system organ failure, but bacterial cultures are often negative in patients with this complication. methods: dna was extracted from the blood of 40  surgical patients and 20 healthy controls. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) techniques were used to amplify genes from escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, and a region of 16s ribosomal rna found in many gram-positive and -negative bacteria. results: bacterial dna genes were not detected in healthy volunteers but were found in all patients with positive blood cultures. all eight transplant patients receiving okt3 therapy had microbial dna in their blood, possibly indicating translocation from the gut. sixty-four percent of critically  ill patients had microbial dna detected in their blood, but only 3 (14%) had positive blood cultures. conclusions: the pcr method is more sensitive than blood cultures for detecting bacterial components in the blood of critically ill surgical patients and may detect microbial translocation from the intestine.

TI  == comparative in-vitro and in-vivo activity of am-1155 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of am-1155, a 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, was compared with those of temafloxacin, sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin  and cefmetazole, a cephamycin, against a variety of anaerobic bacteria. although  am-1155 demonstrated only modest activity against the bacteroides fragilis group  and prevotella bivia (mic90s > or =3.13 mg/ml), 76% of the b. fragilis strains tested were inhibited at am-1155 concentrations of 0.78 mg/l. am-1155 was highly  active against prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium spp., clostridium perfringens and mobiluncus spp. (mic90s < or =0.39 mg/l). an in-vivo study using a mixed infection with am-1155- and tosufloxacin-susceptible  b. fragilis and escherichia coli strains in rat granuloma pouch was performed. am-1155 was effective against both organisms whereas tosufloxacin was effective only against e. coli. these results correlated well to the higher pouch levels of am-1155 than those of tosufloxacin. clostridium difficile overgrowth was found in the caecum of mice treated with ampicillin both 1 and 7 days after 5 days dosing, but not in am-1155-treated mice. these results suggest that the clinical efficacy of am-1155 against infections involving most anaerobic bacteria except for the b. fragilis group and p. bivia should be evaluated further.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of cs-834, a novel oral carbapenem.
AB  == cs-834 is a novel oral carbapenem antibiotic. this compound is an ester-type prodrug of the active metabolite r-95867. the antibacterial activity of r-95867 was tested against 1,323 clinical isolates of 35 species and was compared with those of oral cephems, i.e., cefteram, cefpodoxime, cefdinir, and cefditoren, and that of a parenteral carbapenem, imipenem. r-95867 exhibited a broad spectrum of  activity covering both gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes. its activity was superior to those of the other compounds tested against most of the  bacterial species tested. r-95867 showed potent antibacterial activity against clinically significant pathogens: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus including ofloxacin-resistant strains, streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin-resistant strains, clostridium perfringens, neisseria spp., moraxella  catarrhalis, most members of the family enterobacteriaceae, and haemophilus influenzae (mic at which 90% of strains are inhibited, < or =0.006 to 0.78 microg/ml). r-95867 was quite stable to hydrolysis by most of the beta-lactamases tested except the metallo-beta-lactamases from stenotrophomonas maltophilia and bacteroides fragilis. r-95867 showed potent bactericidal activity against s. aureus and escherichia coli. penicillin-binding proteins 1 and 4 of s. aureus and 1bs, 2, 3, and 4 of e. coli had high affinities for r-95867. the in vivo efficacy of cs-834 was evaluated in murine systemic infections caused by 16 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens. the efficacy of cs-834 was in many cases superior to those of cefteram pivoxil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefdinir, and cefditoren pivoxil, especially against infections caused by s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, e. coli, citrobacter freundii, and proteus vulgaris. among the drugs tested, cs-834 showed the highest efficacy against experimental pneumonia in mice caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae.

AB  == the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of two multiple-dose regimens of piperacillin-tazobactam (3.375 g every 6 h and 4.5 g every 8 h) were evaluated at steady state for 12 healthy adult volunteers. inhibitory and bactericidal activities for the two regimens were determined with five american type culture collection (atcc) organisms (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella  pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis). the percentage of  time that plasma concentrations remained above the mic (t > mic) for each organism and dosage regimen was calculated. areas under the inhibitory (auic0-24) and bactericidal activity (aubc0-24) curves were calculated with the trapezoidal  rule by using the reciprocal of the inhibitory and bactericidal titers determined for each dosage regimen. in order to assess the validity of predicted measures of bactericidal (auc0-24/mbc) and inhibitory (auc0-24/mic) activity to determine bacteriological response to beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, auc0-24/mbc and auc0-24/mic values were compared with measured aubc0-24 and auic0-24 values. total body clearance values were equivalent for piperacillin (183.96 +/- 22.66 versus 181.72 +/- 19.54 ml/min/1.73 m2, p > 0.05) and tazobactam (184.71 +/- 19.89 versus 184.87 +/- 18.35 ml/min/1.73 m2, p > 0.05) following the administration of the 3.375-g-every-6-h and 4.5-g-every-8-h dosages, respectively. comparison of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (auc0-24) for piperacillin (967.74 +/- 135.56 microg x h/ml versus 978.88 +/- 140.96 microg x h/ml) and tazobactam (120.14 +/- 15.78 microg x h/ml versus 120.01 +/- 16.22 microg x h/ml) revealed no significant differences (p > 0.05) between the 3.375-g-every-6-h and 4.5-g-every-8-h regimens, respectively. both regimens provided t > mic values of > 60% for all organisms tested. measured values of bactericidal (aubc) and inhibitory (auic) activity were significantly different (p < 0.05) from predicted values (auc0-24/mbc and auc0-24/mic) for all  organisms studied with the exception of the bactericidal activity for p. aeruginosa and s. aureus. additionally, atcc organisms possessing the same mics and mbcs exhibited great differences in measured aubc0-24 and auic0-24 values. reasons for this difference may be inherent differences in organism specific susceptibility.

AB  == the ability of rabbit and monkey immune sera to neutralize prostaglandin e2 (pge2) production by human monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (lps) was examined. cd14-dependent lps activation of pge2 was examined under assay conditions which allowed the comparison of preimmune and immune sera. serum obtained from rabbits immunized with formalin-fixed porphyromonas gingivalis cells dramatically reduced the amount of pge2 produced in response to lps obtained from three different strains of p. gingivalis but not that from escherichia coli or bacteroides fragilis. in addition, a significant reduction in the mean pge2 level was observed in the presence of sera from immunized but not control monkeys employed in a vaccine trial. immune serum samples from five of nine immunized monkeys were able to reduce lps-induced production of pge2 by greater than 50% compared to that in the corresponding preimmune sera. immune monkey serum, similar to immune rabbit serum, blocked pge2 production in response to p. gingivalis lps but not e. coli lps. these data demonstrate that immunization with p. gingivalis whole cells can elicit an antibody response that  is able to block the pge2 response to lps. neutralization of lps-mediated inflammatory mediator production may account in part for the observed suppression of alveolar bone loss in immunized monkeys.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the porphyromonas gingivalis w83 reca homolog and construction of a reca-deficient mutant.
AB  == degenerate oligonucleotide primers were used in pcr to amplify a region of the reca homolog from porphyromonas gingivalis w83. the resulting pcr fragment was used as a probe to identify a recombinant lambda dash phage (l10) carrying the p. gingivalis reca homolog. the reca homolog was localized to a 2.1-kb bamhi fragment. the nucleotide sequence of this 2.1-kb fragment was determined, and a 1.02-kb open reading frame (341 amino acids) was detected. the predicted amino acid sequence was strikingly similar (90% identical residues) to the reca protein from bacteroides fragilis. no sos box, characteristic of lexa-regulated promoters, was found in the 5' upstream region of the p. gingivalis reca homolog. in both methyl methanesulfonate and uv survival experiments the reca homolog from p. gingivalis complemented the reca mutation of escherichia coli hb101. the cloned p. gingivalis reca gene was insertionally inactivated with the ermf-ermam  antibiotic resistance cassette to create a reca-deficient mutant (fll33) by allelic exchange. the reca-deficient mutant was significantly more sensitive to uv irradiation than the wild-type strain, w83. w83 and fll33 showed the same level of virulence in in vivo experiments using a mouse model. these results suggest that the reca gene in p. gingivalis w83 plays the expected role of repairing dna damage caused by uv irradiation. however, inactivation of this gene did not alter the virulence of p. gingivalis in the mouse model.

TI  == recovery of bilophila wadsworthiafrom clinical specimens in italy.
AB  == this report is the first survey in italy to evaluate the incidence of recovery of bilophila wadsworthia in clinical situations. the survey was carried out at the departments of microbiology in two northern italian hospitals over a one-year period. tests for b. wadsworthia were carried out on a range of specimens from different body sites, when etiology by anaerobes was suspected. out of a total of 350 samples examined, 67% were positive in bacteriological tests. mixed anaerobic infections were detected in 53 specimens, corresponding to 23% of all cases. strains of b. wadsworthia were isolated from 12 samples, equivalent to 5% and 22% of total and mixed/anaerobic infections, respectively. bilophila wadsworthia was  always isolated in mixed infections, mainly from the large intestine (67% of cases). the infectious process of b. wadsworthia was often complicated by abscess formation, regardless of body site. interestingly, a strain was isolated from one case of bacteremia. the microorganisms most frequently isolated with b. wadsworthia were escherichia coli for facultative species (38%), and bacteroides  fragilis, from anaerobic isolates (25%). production of beta-lactamases by b. wadsworthia isolates was found in ten strains (83%), which appeared to be penicillin g resistant at concentration equal to or greater than the break-point  (4 microg/ml). epidemiological and clinical data from this and previous studies point to the involvement of b. wadsworthia in mixed infections. to assess the specific contribution of the species to the disease, studies of pathogenetic factors are to be considered in parallel. nonetheless, production of beta-lactamases by most b. wadsworthia isolates could easily interfere with the therapeutical approach to infections involving the new species. the addition of a selective medium to culture specimens from the abdominal cavity should be considered in order to detect the presence of b. wadsworthia.

TI  == inhibition of phagocytosis of e. coli by b. fragilis group--an in vitro study.
AB  == bacteriodes fragilis group can inhibit the phagocytosis and killing of co-existing aerobes. forty six strains of b.fragilis group are tested for their ability to resist phagocytosis and inhibit the killing of indicator organism, e.  coli by denoting the viable count. among the species of b. fragilis group, the inhibitory index of the phagocytic system was the highest with b. fragilis followed by b. thetaiotamicron. none of the strains of b. fragilis group were phagocytosed or killed in this system. this property of resisting the phagocytosis and killing of e. coli by b. fragilis group might be the contributing factor towards their prevalence in mixed infections.

TI  == animal models for intra-abdominal infection.
AB  == animal models are widely used to study intra-abdominal infections. experimental intra-abdominal infections. experimental intra-abdominal infection is a bi-phasic process; initially a peritonitis or septic phace caused by e. coli and later a chronic-abscess forming stage, caused by b. fragilis similar to human beings. various methods have been described. these methods includes challenge of the peritoneum with either endogenous bacteria or inoculation of pure bacteria or fectal material. non-bacterial models have also been described. each of these models have their own advantages and disadvantages. the aim and the end points should govern the selection of the right model to be used for experimental purposes. the ideal model should be reliable, standard, reproducible and resembling human disease. a single model with those specifications is yet to be described.

TI  == differential induction of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in whole blood by  bacteria: effects of antibiotic treatment.
AB  == the in vitro production of interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), il-6, and the il-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra) in whole blood upon stimulation with different bacterial strains was measured to study the possible relationship between disease severity and the cytokine-inducing capacities of these strains. escherichia coli, neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, bacteroides fragilis, capnocytophaga canimorsus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes induced the cytokines il-1beta, il-6, and il-1ra. gram-negative bacteria induced significantly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokine production than gram-positive bacteria. these  differences were less pronounced for the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-1ra. in addition, blood was stimulated with e. coli killed by different antibiotics to study the effect of the antibiotics on the cytokine-inducing capacity of the bacterial culture. e. coli treated with cefuroxime and gentamicin induced higher  levels of il-1beta and il-6 production but levels of il-1ra production similar to that of heat-killed e. coli. in contrast, ciprofloxacin- and imipenem-cilastatin-mediated killing showed a decreased or similar level of induction of cytokine production as compared to that by heat-killed e. coli; polymyxin b decreased the level of production of the cytokines.

TI  == the effect of in vitro bacterial association on virulence of entamoeba histolytica.
AB  == when trophozoites of axenic e. histolytica strains nih : 200 were associated in vitro with escherichia coli k12 for three hours at 37 degrees c, the virulence was enhanced as shown by increased cytopathogenicity to baby hamster kidney (bhk) cell monolayer. further, the trophozoites were observed to adhere to the polystyrene surface, a hitherto unreported phenomenon. the co-association of e. histolytica trophozoites with bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens for three hours duration at 37 degrees c neither led to increase in cytotoxicity  potential nor to adherence phenomenon; in contrast significant inhibition of cytotoxicity was observed. we have thus shown that while co-association of e. histolytica (nih : 200) with e. coli k12 leads to enhanced amoebic virulence, that with anaerobic bacteric leads to its inhibition.

TI  == identification and dna sequence of the mobilization region of the 5-nitroimidazole resistance plasmid pip421 from bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the dna mobilization region of the 5-nitroimidazole resistance plasmid pip421, from strain bf-f239 of bacteroides fragilis, was determined. it contains a putative origin of transfer (orit) including three sets of inverted repeats and two sequences reminiscent of specific integration host factor binding sites. the product of the mobilization gene mob421 (42.2 kda) is a member of the bacteroides mobilization protein family, which includes the moba of pbi143, nbus, and tn4555. sequence similarity suggests that it has both orit binding and nicking activities. the transfer frequency of pip421 in a b. fragilis donor strain possessing a tc(r) or tc(r) em(r)-like conjugative transposon was significantly enhanced by tetracycline. moreover, the mobilization region of pip421 confers the ability to be mobilized from escherichia coli by an incp plasmid.

TI  == cefotaxime in the treatment of prophylaxis of surgical infections.
AB  == cefotaxime has retained its broad-spectrum activity against the key pathogens in  surgical infection, despite 15 years of widespread use. it has good activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and most anaerobes, except bacteroides fragilis but, combined with metronidazole, it offers clinically complete coverage of b. fragilis and escherichia coli, the two  most important species involved in intra-abdominal infections. for mixed infections involving b. fragilis, 500 mg metronidazole 12-hourly should be added  to the cefotaxime regimen. cefotaxime therapy is simple, generally inexpensive and has a relatively broad spectrum of activity compared to many other antimicrobials used for postoperative nosocomial pneumonia. treatment with cefotaxime at 1 g or 2 g can be 12-hourly. surgical prophylaxis with single-dose  cefotaxime (1 g or 2 g) is as effective as with many other agents, with no documented selection of resistance. clinical experience gained worldwide strongly supports the use of cefotaxime for the treatment of prophylaxis and surgical infections.

TI  == microbiology of nonbullous impetigo.
AB  == our objective was to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of nonbullous impetigo (ni) in children. we used a retrospective review of clinical  microbiology laboratory and patients' records. specimens were obtained from 40 patients with ni lesions and showed bacterial growth. aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 24 patients (60%), strict anaerobic bacteria only in 5 patients (12.5%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 11 patients (27.5%). sixty-four isolates were recovered (1.6 per specimen): 43 aerobic or facultative, and 21 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (29 isolates), group a beta hemolytic streptococcus (gabhs) (13 isolates), and escherichia coli (1 isolate).  the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus spp. (12), pigmented prevotella spp. (5), fusobacterium spp. (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). single bacterial  isolates were recovered in 17 patients (42.5%), 13 of which were s. aureus. s. aureus alone or mixed with gabhs or peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from all body sites. mixed flora of peptostreptococcus spp. with prevotella spp. or fusobacterium spp. was mostly found in infections of the head and neck, while e.  coli mixed with b. fragilis and peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from one infection of the buttocks area. thirty-three organisms isolated from 32 patients  (80%) produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. this study demonstrates the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic microbiology of ni lesions.

TI  == superoxide radical scavenging prevents cellular calcium dysregulation during intraabdominal sepsis.
AB  == the role of superoxide in sepsis-altered hepatocyte ca2+i regulation was studied  by examining the effect of treatment of septic rats with superoxide dismutase-polyethylene glycol (sod-peg) on hepatocyte ca2+ influx and efflux, and cytosolic [ca2+]. rats were implanted with sterile or bacteria-laden (escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis) fecal pellets into the abdominal cavity. eight hours after the implantation, rats were treated with sod-peg or its vehicle peg.  septic and sterile implanted rats were killed 24 h postimplantation, and their livers were removed to isolate viable hepatocytes. isolated hepatocytes were incubated with traces of 45ca to assess ca2+ influx and efflux. the 45ca exchange assessments also allowed calculation of the intracellular exchangeable ca2+ contents. [ca2+]i was quantified by the use of fluorescent dye indo-1 and microfluorometric techniques. there were no differences in the ca2+ influx, ca2+  efflux, intracellular exchangeable ca2+, or [ca2+]i between the treated or untreated sterile and unoperated controls. however, compared with the nonseptic groups, the septic rats with or without administration of the vehicle (peg) showed marked increases in ca2+ influx, intracellular exchangeable ca2+ and [ca2+]i but not ca2+ efflux. when challenged with vasopressin, the hepatocytes from septic rats, administered with peg alone, did not elevate their [ca2+]i as was characteristic of the hepatocytes from the nonseptic rats. the treatment of septic rats with sod-peg was effective in restoring ca2+ influx, cellular exchangeable ca2+, [ca2+]i, and the [ca2+]i response to vasopressin to levels found in the control and sterile groups. these findings support the concept that  the generation of the superoxide free radical leads to ca2+i-related derangements and related cell/organ dysfunction in sepsis.

TI  == the bacteroides mobilizable transposon tn4555 integrates by a site-specific recombination mechanism similar to that of the gram-positive bacterial element tn916.
AB  == the bacteroides mobilizable transposon tn4555 is a 12.2-kb molecule that encodes  resistance to cefoxitin. conjugal transposition is hypothesized to occur via a circular intermediate and is stimulated by coresident tetracycline resistance elements and low levels of tetracycline. in this work, the ends of the transposon were identified and found to consist of 12-bp imperfect inverted repeats, with an extra base at one end. in the circular form, the ends were separated by a 6-bp "coupling sequence" which was associated with either the left or the right transposon terminus when the transposon was inserted into the chromosome. tn4555  does not duplicate its target site upon insertion. using a conjugation-based transposition assay, we showed that the coupling sequence originated from 6 bases of genomic dna flanking either side of the transposon prior to excision. tn4555 preferentially transposed into a 589-bp genomic locus containing a 207-bp direct  repeat. integration occurred before or after the repeated sequence, with one integration site between the two repeats. these observations are consistent with  a transposition model based on site-specific recombination. in the bacteriophage  lambda model for site-specific recombination, the bacteriophage recombines with the escherichia coli chromosome via a 7-bp "crossover" region. we propose that the coupling sequence of tn4555 is analogous in function to the crossover region  of lambda but that unlike the situation in lambda, recombination occurs between regions of nonhomologous dna. this ability to recombine into divergent target sites is also a feature of the gram-positive bacterial transposon tn916.

TI  == a rat model of non-lethal bacterial infection.
AB  == the purpose of the study was to develop a small animal model of intraperitoneal infection without mortality and with a catabolic response to the infection, viz., to mimic the clinical situation in man. intraperitoneal infection was induced in  female wistar rats by deposition of a gelatin capsule containing a mixture of escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis and adjuvant substances. seven groups of animals were infected with different bacterial inocula (0.2-4.3 x 10(6) cfu) to establish reproducible and dose-dependent changes in mortality, body weight in relation to food intake, blood cultures, peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and abscess formation on autopsy. no mortality was observed in animals with an inoculum below 2.2 x 10(6) cfu in spite of positive blood cultures. initial weight loss was followed by weight gain in all animals except the group infected  with the low inoculum (0.2 x 10(6) cfu). this group had no mortality, was in a catabolic state for three days, indicated by weight loss in spite of nearly normal food intake, and the infectious state was supported by intraperitoneal dissemination of small abscesses. the low-grade character of the infection was reflected by changes in peripheral blood lymphocyte and neutrophil granulocyte concentrations. in conclusion, this study presents a small animal model with a reproducible dose response to the bacterial challenge, allowing prolonged studies of metabolic changes following infection.

TI  == in vivo efficacy of trovafloxacin (cp-99,217), a new quinolone, in experimental intra-abdominal abscesses caused by bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli.
AB  == the efficacy of trovafloxacin in treating bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli infections was investigated and compared to the efficacy of combined clindamycin and gentamicin therapy in an experimental model of intra-abdominal abscesses in rats. rats were treated with different doses of cp-116,517-27, a parenteral prodrug of trovafloxacin. response to treatment was evaluated by mortality rate and elimination of infection (cure rate). mortality in the control group was 85.4%, whereas in rats treated with trovafloxacin, it was close to 0%.  the highest cure rate (89.3%) resulted from the administration of 40 mg of cp-116,517-27 per kg of body weight three times a day (tid) for 10 days (equivalent to 18.15 mg of active drug trovafloxacin per rat per day). the therapeutic response with trovafloxacin was comparable to that of a combination therapy of clindamycin (75 mg/kg) plus gentamicin (20 mg/kg) tid (cure rate, 74%; mortality rate, 5%). the measured peak levels of trovafloxacin in serum and abscess pus were 2.6 +/- 0.3 and 5.2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the tumor necrosis factor alpha levels in the untreated animals were high compared to those for rats treated with trovafloxacin or clindamycin plus gentamicin. these results demonstrate that trovafloxacin as a single agent appears to be as successful as clindamycin plus gentamicin in the treatment of experimental intra-abdominal abscesses in rats.

TI  == transforming growth factor-beta negatively modulates t-cell responses in sepsis.
AB  == sepsis is associated with depressed t-cell functions and increased circulating levels of immunosuppressive agents. tgf-beta is a potential anti-inflammatory cytokine that can modify t-cell growth and differentiation. the up-regulation of  tgf-beta and the mechanism of its action on the t-cells during septic injury have not been resolved. we hypothesized that in sepsis tgf-beta produced by macrophages acts on t-cells in a paracrine manner to suppress interleukin (il)-2  production and proliferation. in this study, we examined the circulating tgf-beta levels in a rat model of gram-negative bacterial sepsis, and compared the abilities of adherent and non-adherent splenocytes to produce tgf-beta. additionally, we investigated the causal relationships of hrtgf-beta to concanavalin a (cona)-induced t-cell responses and the intracellular mechanism of the generation of these responses in normal splenic rat t-cells. sepsis was induced in rats by intraabdominally implanting fecal pellets containing escherichia coli (150 cfu) and bacteroides fragilis (10000 cfu). adherent and non-adherent splenocytes were isolated by differential adherence using ficoll gradient centrifugation. t-cells were purified by use of nylon wool columns. we observed a 3-6-fold increase in the circulating levels of tgf-beta in sepsis. western blots and elisa determinations revealed a 2.5-3-fold increase in cell-associated tgf-beta protein levels in adherent splenic cells. northern analyses also showed a marked increase in tgf-beta mrna expression in adherent cells during sepsis. on the other hand, a significant change was not observed in  the tgf-beta protein and mrna expression in non-adherent splenocytes. pretreatment of control rat t-cells with hrtgf-beta decreased both cona-induced proliferation (by 35-40%) and il-2 mrna expression (by > 50%). further, whereas incubation of control rat t-cells with either cona or tgf-beta for 24 h resulted  in a 10-15-fold increase in camp generation, the addition of hrtgf-beta along with cona resulted in a 50-60-fold increase in camp. these results suggest that in sepsis, tgf-beta produced by splenic macrophages can act in a paracrine manner on t-cells to depress their il-2 mrna expression, il-2 production and proliferation after up-regulation of camp which can interfere with t-cell signaling for proliferation.

TI  == comparison of the bactericidal activities of piperacillin-tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, and ampicillin-sulbactam against clinical isolates of bacteroides fragilis, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == owing to the broad spectrum of activity afforded by beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor preparations, these agents are frequently selected as empiric therapy for the treatment of mixed infections such as intra-abdominal and diabetic foot infections, either alone or in combination with an aminoglycoside. twelve healthy volunteers were enrolled in a randomized, open-label, four-way crossover trial comparing the bactericidal activities of piperacillin-tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, and ampicillin-sulbactam against microorganisms commonly isolated from mixed infections. subjects received the following regimes: (i) 3.375 g of piperacillin-tazobactam intravenously (i.v.) every 6 h (q6h) (ii) 4.5  g of piperacillin-tazobactam i.v. q8h, (iii) 3.1 g of ticarcillin-clavulanate i.v. q6h, and (iv) 3.0 g of ampicillin-sulbactam i.v. q6h. serum bactericidal titers were determined and used to calculate the duration of measurable bactericidal activity over the dosing interval of each of the regimens against two clinical isolates of bacillus fragilis, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the percentage of the dosing interval over  which drug concentrations in serum remained above the mic for each organism was determined and compared with the observed duration of bactericidal activity was noted (r = 0.78; p < 0.001). all of the regimens demonstrated good activity against b. fragilis and e. coli. against e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa, however,  all of the regimens provided bactericidal activity for less than 50% of the respective dosing intervals. these data suggest that use of shorter dosing intervals or continuous-infusion regimens should be considered in combination with an aminoglycoside to improve the bactericidal profiles of these agents for e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == evidence of the proinflammatory role of enterococcus faecalis in polymicrobial peritonitis in rats.
AB  == although the role of members of the enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes in the pathogenesis of intra-abdominal infections has been extensively demonstrated, the role played by enterococci in these infections remains controversial. the pathophysiological mechanisms induced by enterococci in intra-abdominal infection were studied in a nonfatal model of peritonitis in rats by implanting a gelatin capsule containing escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis with or without increasing concentrations of enterococcus faecalis or heat-inactivated enterococci. the ability of the rat peritoneal cavity to sterilize itself after bacterial challenge was evaluated by quantifying the inflammatory response in the peritoneal cavity, reflected by both phagocyte and cytokine responses. effects were evaluated 6, 12, and 24 h and 3 and 6 days after inoculation. on day 6 after inoculation, the highest enterococcal concentration (10(8) cfu/ml) was accompanied by significantly increased concentrations of e. coli in peritoneal fluid and peritoneal phagocytes when compared to other groups. in the first 12 h  after inoculation, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6 concentrations were significantly increased in the peritoneal fluid of the animals that had received  the highest inoculum of enterococci or heat-inactivated enterococci. in the late  period of the study (3 and 6 days), significantly increased leukocyte counts were observed in the peritoneal fluid of these animals. these results suggest that e.  faecalis somehow inhibited phagocytosis and intracellular killing of the other pathogens and also played an inflammatory role, which might account for the bacterial synergy observed in this model.

TI  == antimicrobial therapy for intraabdominal infection.
AB  == timely and appropriate antimicrobial therapy is an essential component of the management of intraabdominal infection. over the past three decades, our ability  to treat these infections optimally has been enhanced by an increased understanding of the underlying microbial pathogens, by the development of new antimicrobial agents, and by the completion of several well-controlled clinical trials that guide treatment. this article provides an overview of the approach to antimicrobial therapy in patients with intraabdominal infection. a literature review was performed to collect the information used in this article. data were derived from experimental and clinical studies evaluating the microbiology and treatment of intraabdominal infections. evidence from both animal studies and clinical trials supports the initiation of empiric antimicrobial therapy directed against escherichia coli and other common members of the family enterobacteriaceae, as well as the anaerobe bacteroides fragilis. based on this premise, the clinician is faced with a broad selection of possible single agents, as well as combinations of agents that fulfill these criteria. the factors involved in selecting a specific regimen include consideration of the antimicrobial spectrum of various agents, experimental animal studies evaluating  their efficacy, and, importantly, efficacy in well-designed clinical trials. in addition, consideration of safety profiles, pharmacokinetics, and cost of specific pharmaceutical agents should be made when selecting a regimen. antimicrobial therapy is an important component of the management of intraabdominal infection. the results of well-designed clinical trials evaluating various aspects of therapy should serve to guide treatment.

TI  == cloning and genetic characterization of helicobacter pylori catalase and construction of a catalase-deficient mutant strain.
AB  == the n-terminal sequence of a protein, originally described as an adhesin of helicobacter pylori, was used in an oligonucleotide-based screening procedure of  an h. pylori plasmid library in escherichia coli. five independent plasmid clones were isolated, all mapping to the same chromosomal region and encoding the h. pylori catalase. the gene, designated kata, comprises 1,518 nucleotides and encodes a putative protein of 505 amino acids with a predicted mr of 58,599. a second open reading frame, orf2, encoding a putative 32,715-da protein of unknown function, follows kata. the transcriptional start site of kata mrna was determined, but no typical consensus promoter sequence was present. a potential binding site for the fur protein is located upstream of kata. when introduced into the catalase-deficient e. coli double-mutant um255, the cloned gene readily  complemented e. coli for catalase activity. h. pylori kata is highly homologous to catalases in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, with the highest homology being  shown to bordetella pertussis (64.9%), bacteroides fragilis (59.8%), and haemophilus influenzae (57.9%) catalases. transposon insertion mutants were generated in three independent h. pylori strains by tnmax5-mediated transposon shuttle mutagenesis. in contrast to the wild-type strains, no significant catalase-specific enzymatic activity could be detected in the mutant strains, consistent with the fact that no additional kata-homologous gene copies were found in the h. pylori chromosome. no significant difference between wild-type and mutant strains for binding to epithelial cells was apparent, suggesting that  kata is not involved in h. pylori adhesion. the cloning and genetic characterization of kata are essential steps for further investigation of the role of catalase in the defense of h. pylori against oxygen-dependent killing mechanisms by polymorphonuclear granulocytes, a process not well understood for this chronically persisting pathogen.

TI  == staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage in rheumatoid arthritis: antibody response to toxic shock syndrome toxin-1.
AB  == objective: to determine the prevalence of staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage and to compare antibody responses to two superantigens, staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (tsst-1) and staphylococcal enterotoxin a (sea), in rheumatoid arthritis patients and normal subjects. methods: 88 rheumatoid arthritis patients and 110 control subjects were cultured for nasal carriage of s aureus; 62 isolates were bacteriophage typed. twenty five patients and 11 spouses were tested for antibodies to tsst-1, sea, and sonicate extracts of bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli; 19 patients were hla-dr typed. results: 50% of patients and 33% of normal subjects were s aureus carriers. bacteriophage typing  of isolates suggested significant differences between strains isolated from the two groups. patients showed higher igg (p = 0.0025) and iga (p = 0.0372) antibody levels to tsst-1 than normal spouses and these responses were not related to rheumatoid factor titres or hla-dr type. conclusion: when compared to normals, rheumatoid arthritis patients more often carry s aureus in their nasal vestibule, carry a distinct subpopulation of s aureus strains, and have higher average antibody levels to tsst-1.

TI  == in vitro activity of bay 12-8039, a new 8-methoxyquinolone.
AB  == bay 12-8039 is a new 8-methoxyquinolone with antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria which is significantly better than those of sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.062 and 2 mg/l, respectively. the mic90s for ciprofloxacin-resistant, methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant s. aureus were 8 mg/l. against  the staphylococcal strains tested sparfloxacin was 2-fold and ciprofloxacin > or  = 10-fold less active. mic90s for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae were 0.125-0.5 mg/l, irrespective of whether strains with diminished ciprofloxacin susceptibility or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains were tested. against the streptococci sparfloxacin was 2- to 4-fold less active. against gram-negative bacteria bay 12-8039 is almost as active as ciprofloxacin, except for pseudomonas aeruginosa.  against bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides spp. and clostridium spp. bay 12-8039 was as active as metronidazole. the bactericidal activity against s. aureus and s. pneumoniae was in contrast to that of the other quinolones tested, penicillin  g, amoxicillin+/-clavulanate, cefuroxime and clarithromycin, concentration-dependent. as compared to ciprofloxacin, development of resistance  was less pronounced. the spontaneous mutation frequency towards bay 12-8039 resistance was 2.8 x 10(-8) in escherichia coli, 7.06 x 10(-8) in s. aureus and < 1.4 x 10(-9) in s. pneumoniae.

TI  == microbiology of infected atopic dermatitis.
AB  == background: bacterial infections occur frequently in lesions of atopic dermatitis (ad). the objectives of the study were to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of secondarily infected ad. methods: a retrospective review was carried out of clinical and microbiology laboratory records and of data obtained  from patients with secondarily infected ad lesions, whose specimens of infected sites were processed for the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. results: bacterial growth was noted in 41 specimens. aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 15 patients (36%), anaerobic bacteria only in eight (20%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 18 (44%). seventy-two isolates were recovered (1.8 per specimen), 34 aerobic or facultative bacteria, 35 strict anaerobes, and three candida sp. the predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (12 isolates), group a beta hemolytic streptococcus in five isolates, and escherichia coli in four. the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus spp. (13 isolates), pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp. in eight, and fusobacterium spp. in four isolates. single bacterial isolates were recovered in 14 patients (34%), seven of which were s. aureus. twenty-one of the organisms isolated from 16 patients (39%) produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the lesions predominated in these infections. enteric gram-negative rods and bacteroides fragilis group predominated in lesions on legs and buttocks. group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, pigmented prevotella, and porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. were most frequently recovered in lesions of the finger, scalp, face, and neck. conclusions: the polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected ad lesions and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomic site of the lesions are demonstrated.

TI  == cloning, sequencing and complementation analysis of the reca gene from prevotella ruminicola.
AB  == degenerate pcr primers based on conserved reca protein regions were used to amplify a portion of reca [corrected] from prevotella ruminicola strain 23, which was used as a probe to isolate the full-length reca gene from the p. ruminicola genomic library. the p. ruminicola reca gene encoded a protein of 340 amino acids with a molecular mass of 36.81 kda, p. ruminicola reca was highly similar to other reca proteins and most closely resembled that of bacteroides fragilis (75%  identity). it alleviated the methyl methanesulfonate and mitomycin c sensitivities of escherichia coli reca mutants, but did not restore the resistance to uv-light irradiation. mitomycin c treatment of otherwise isogenic e. coli strains showed a higher level of prophage induction in a reca harboring lysogen.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against clinical isolates].
AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (cdzm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cdzm and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in  our laboratory from september to december of 1992 and from september to december  of 1995. the results are summarized as follows: 1. bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cdzm included streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the  range of mic values of cdzm against klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. other strains, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., peptostreptococcus spp.  and bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including cdzm. 2. the mic90's of cdzm were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against streptococcus  spp., h. influenzae, m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently  found in daily treatment of infections. it appears that the effectiveness of cdzm was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. among h. influenzae isolates included imipenem (ipm)-resistant and norfloxacin (nflx)-resistant strains. the mic-range of cdzm against strains collected in 1995 including ipm-resistant and nflx-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and mic90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. cdzm showed strong antimicrobial activities against h. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == objective: to describe the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria, compared with other antibacterial agents. design: survey of susceptibility of clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli. setting: academic hospitals of the university isolates of the witwatersrand teaching complex. bacterial strains: 180 selected clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli. main outcome measures: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) determined by agar dilution using techniques according to the recommendations of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards.  results: ciprofloxacin, biapenerm, imipenem, cefepime and cefpirome were all highly active against most of the enterobacteriaceae. all the ampicillin-resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam, mic90 values being 4/4 mg/l for klebsiella and proteus/providencia spp., 8/4 mg/l for citrobacter and serratia spp., and 16/4 mg/l for escherichia coli. all the agents, with the exception of ampicillin (mic90 4 mg/l) and chloramphenicol (mic90 4 mg/l), were highly active against the haemophilus influenzae isolates tested. all bacteroides fragilis strains were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (mic90 8/4 mg/l), as well as to co-amoxiclav (mic90 4/2 mg/l), biapenem and imipenem (mic90s 0.5 mg/l). the pseudomonas spp. tested included strains resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, biapenem, gentamicin, tobramycin and ciprofloxacin. cefepime was the most active agent against pseudomonas isolates, with 90% of the strains being susceptible to this agent, while biapenem was the most active agent against the acinetobacter isolates investigated. conclusions: the in vitro spectrum of activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against the majority of isolates was comparable to those of the other new agents tested.

TI  == molecular characterization of a heme-binding protein of bacteroides fragilis be1.
AB  == an iron-repressible 44-kda outer membrane protein plays a crucial role in the acquisition of heme by the anaerobic bacterium bacteroides fragilis. the dna sequence of the gene encoding the 44-kda protein (hupa) was determined. the hupa  gene encodes a protein of 431 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 48,189 da. the hupa gene is preceded by an open reading frame of 480 bp that probably encodes a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 18,073 da. hupa and this open reading frame are likely organized in an operon, and a sequence homologous to the escherichia coli consensus fur box was present in the  putative promoter region of the operon. heme-binding studies showed that hupa binds heme. analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed signature heme-binding consensus motifs, characteristic of heme lyases. subcellular localization studies in e. coli revealed that hupa was mainly found in the cytoplasmic membrane but not in the outer membrane of e. coli. this suggested that b. fragilis uses another strategy for the translocation of this outer membrane protein across its cell envelope than e. coli does. hupa did not have significant homology with other putative bacterial heme receptors.

TI  == characterization of the metal-binding sites of the beta-lactamase from bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == in an effort to better understand the structure and function of the metallo-beta-lactamase from bacteroides fragilis, spectroscopic and metal-binding studies were performed on the native, metal-substituted, and mutant forms of the  enzyme. atomic absorption studies demonstrate that the native b. fragilis enzyme  tightly binds 2 mol of zn(ii) and, along with mutagenesis studies, that the presence of both metal ions is required for full catalytic activity. epr spectroscopy was used to confirm that the co(ii)-substituted beta-lactamase binds 2 mol of co(ii) per mole of enzyme, that the two co(ii)'s are highspin and probably uncoupled, with apparent g values of 6.5, 4.2, and 2.0, and that the coordination number of the co(ii) is 5 or 6. this number of ligands for the co(ii)-substituted enzyme is confirmed by uv-vis spectra, which demonstrate the presence of very weak d-d transitions between 550 and 650 nm (epsilon approximately 30 m-1.cm-1) and an intense feature at 320 nm (epsilon approximately 1570 m-1.cm-1). the latter is assigned to a cysteine sulfur to co(ii) ligand-to-metal charge transfer band, and this assignment is confirmed by  the disappearance of this band in the uv-vis spectrum of a co(ii)-substituted c168s mutant. h nmr studies on the co(ii)-substituted enzyme suggest the presence of three histidine ligands bound to co(ii). taken together, these studies support the sequence comparison study of rasmussen et al., in which there is a catalytic  metal-binding site with three histidines and one cysteine (c168). the remaining ligands are postulated to be water molecules involved in catalysis. mutagenesis studies, in combination with activity assays and metal-binding studies, have been used to identify asp61, asp90, asp152, and asp183 as possible ligands to the second metal-binding site, with asp90 and asp152 having a pronounced effect on kcat. these results are discussed in light of the recent crystal structure of the metallo-beta-lactamase from b. cereus.

TI  == cellular mechanisms of abscess formation: macrophage procoagulant activity and major histocompatibility complex recognition.
AB  == background: macrophage procoagulant activity (pca) has been proposed as a key mediator of abscess formation. experimentally, transient systemic bacterial infection lead to increased numbers of intraabdominal abscesses after a subsequent episode of peritonitis. we tested the hypothesis that these events were regulated by classic major histocompatibility complex (mhc)-restricted antigen processing and presentation to lymphocytes followed by lymphocyte-mediated up-regulation of macrophage pca. methods: in vitro, macrophages and lymphocytes from balb/c or c57bl/6 mice either untreated or preexposed to escherichia coli were coincubated with bacteria or lipopolysaccharide. cell lysates were tested for pca in a one-step dotting assay. in vivo, mice were either preexposed to e. coli or received passive transfer of lymphocytes from mhc-compatible or mhc-incompatible and naive or preexposed donors; peritonitis and intraabdominal abscesses were afterwards induced with e.  coli, bacteroides fragilis, and a sterile fecal adjuvant. mice were killed after  10 days and were studied for abscess number and bacterial composition. results: the presence of lymphocytes consistently increased macrophage pca; lymphocytes from preexposed donors induced twice as much pca as lymphocytes from naive donors regardless of mhc background. both bacterial preexposure and passive transfer of  lymphocytes from preexposed donors increased later intraabdominal abscess number  in an mhc-restricted fashion. conclusions: transient infections enhance subsequent lymphocyte-mediated macrophage pca, correlating with increases in abscess formation after peritonitis. the need for mhc identity to reproduce these results via passive transfer in vivo is consistent with classic t-cell receptor-mediated antigen presentation and lymphocyte activation before enhancement of pca during peritonitis.

TI  == penetration of cefpodoxime into uterine and vaginal secretions from postpartum women after a single oral dose of cefpodoxime proxetil.
AB  == we evaluated the usefulness of cefpodoxime proxetil (cpdx-pr) in the treatment of puerperal infection and obtained the following results. (i) the susceptibilities  of 124 clinical isolates from 85 uterine lochia samples were determined. the mic  at which the growth of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, and bacteroides fragilis isolates was inhibited by 90% (mic90) was 0.39 micrograms/ml or less. the mic90 for staphylococcus aureus was 3.13 micrograms/ml. (ii) seven puerperal women received 200 mg of cpdx-pr orally. the cpdx concentration in the  lochias in the uterine cavity was not statistically different from that in the vagina, suggesting that the vaginal samples, which can be obtained more safely and aseptically, can be substituted for the uterine samples. the cpdx concentration in cubital venous blood reached a peak of 1.61 micrograms/ml at 3 hours after cpdx-pr administration. the cpdx concentration in the lochias gradually increased and reached a peak of 1.20 micrograms/ml in the uterine cavity and 1.27 micrograms/ml in the vagina at 5 h after drug administration and  gradually declined thereafter. these results suggest that cpdx-pr, with its good  transfer to the lochia and its potent antimicrobial activity, is a promising drug for the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of puerperal infections caused by  susceptible organisms.

TI  == sepsis inhibits synthesis of myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic proteins: modulation by interleukin-1 receptor antagonist.
AB  == the breakdown of myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic (nonmyofibrillar) proteins are regulated independently in sepsis, however, the factors regulating their synthesis are unknown. in this study, we assessed the effects of sepsis and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist on sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar protein synthesis in gastrocnemius. the rate of sarcoplasmic protein synthesis was 3.5 times that of myofibrillar proteins in control and septic rats. the synthesis of  both sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar proteins was diminished proportionately during sepsis (p < .05). infusion of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (2 mg.kg.-1.h.-1) prevented the sepsis-induced inhibition of total, sarcoplasmic, and myofibrillar  protein synthesis. changes in the abundance of messenger rna could not account for the inhibition of protein synthesis observed in sepsis. furthermore, in vitro translation of messenger rna isolated from control and septic muscle revealed no  major differences. these results suggest the following: 1) the inhibition of total mixed proteins during sepsis is a consequence of reduced synthesis of both  myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic proteins; 2) il-1ra maintains control values of protein synthesis by sparing the reduction in synthesis of both myofibrillar and  sarcoplasmic proteins during sepsis; and 3) the abundance of messenger rna is not a rate-limiting determinant of protein synthesis in muscle from septic rats. an alteration in the translational efficiency of existing mrna appears to be the major mechanism responsible for the inhibition of protein synthesis during sepsis.

TI  == lung microvessel injury from peritoneal abscesses and gram-negative bacteremia.
AB  == to analyze the effect of an extrathoracic focus of infection on lung vessel wall  structure, we produced peritoneal abscesses in the rat, over a period of 3 to 7 weeks, by implanting capsules containing live gram-negative bacteria (3.0 x 10(7) escherichia coli and 5.0 x 10(7) bactercides fragilis) with an adjutant. we document here by arteriography, morphometric analysis, and high resolution microscopy, microvessel cell injury, and wall remodeling. in the sepsis-injured lung, both dilated and thick-walled microvessels are present. the walls of dilated vessels are disrupted by extensive endothelial and precursor smooth muscle cell injury. in thick-walled vessels these cells are hypertrophied, and the precursor smooth muscle cells express filaments, demonstrating a shift toward a contractile phenotype. infiltrating monocytic cells focally consolidate alveolar regions. in the residual nonconsolidated regions, alveolar-capillary membrane cells are attenuated and the capillaries dilated. vessel changes after 7 weeks are similar to those after 3 weeks but alveolar-capillary membrane injury is more extensive. these structural changes, including the development of precursor smooth muscle cells, may contribute to the known increase in reactivity of these lung vessels to challenge by vasoactive agents.

TI  == saline wound irrigation reduces the postoperative infection rate in guinea pigs.
AB  == wound irrigation with saline is widely used alone or together with systemic antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent postoperative wound infection. this study was aimed to investigate the effect of saline irrigation upon the bacterial load on wound surfaces and on the wound infection rate in an animal model. in 16 guinea pigs, two wounds were contaminated with bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli. one wound was irrigated with saline, while the other received no prophylaxis. quantitative wound cultures were performed before and after irrigation. the wound infection rate was determined at 10 days. saline irrigation reduced the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial counts in wound margins. the infection rate was also reduced (15/16 nonirrigated vs 6/16 irrigated, p < 0.001). high bacterial counts at the end of operation were associated with wound  infection (p < 0.001). at skin closure, wounds which later became infected harbored fourfold more bacteria than noninfected wounds [8.7 (6.4- 1 1.0) vs 2.3  (0.8-3.7) colony-forming units x 10(3) of e. coli/cm2; p < 0.005]. saline wound irrigation diminishes infection rate in experimental animals by means of a significant reduction of the bacterial inoculum present at the time of skin closure.

AB  == the upjohn oxazolidinones, u-100592 and u-100766, are orally bioavailable synthetic antimicrobial agents with spectra of activity against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens. in several mouse models of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infection, u-100592 and u-100766 yielded oral 50% effective doses (ed50) ranging from 1.9 to 8.0 mg/kg of body weight, which compared favorably with vancomycin subcutaneous ed50 values of 1.1 to 4.4 mg/kg. similarly, both compounds were active versus a staphylococcus epidermidis experimental systemic infection. u-100592 and u-100766 effectively cured an enterococcus faecalis systemic infection, with ed50 values of 1.3 and 10.0 mg/kg, and versus a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infection in immunocompromised mice, both drugs effected cures at 12.5 and 24.0 mg/kg. both compounds were exceptionally active in vivo against penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, with ed50 values ranging from 1.2 to 11.7 mg/kg in systemic infection models. in soft tissue infection models with s. aureus and e. faecalis, both compounds exhibited acceptable curative activities in the range of 11.0 to 39.0 mg/kg. u-100766 was also very active versus the bacteroides fragilis soft tissue infection model (ed50 = 46.3 mg/kg).  in combination-therapy studies, both u-100592 and u-100766 were indifferent or additive in vivo against a monomicrobic s. aureus infection in combination with other antibiotics active against gram-positive bacteria and combined as readily as vancomycin with gentamicin in the treatment of a polymicrobic s. aureus-escherichia coli infection. u-100592 and u-100766 are potent oxazolidinones active against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens in experimental systemic and soft tissue infections.

AB  == equine synovial fluid aliquots were inoculated with salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli, actinobacillus equuli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus zooepidemicus to obtain approximate concentrations of 1000, 100, 10, and 1 colony forming u/ml. synovial fluid aliquots were also inoculated with an unquantitated  inoculum of bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens. inoculated synovial fluid was incubated in trypticase-soy broth or columbia broth for approximately 12 hours. then aliquots were removed for dna extraction and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis for detection of a 531 base-pair segment of bacterial dna corresponding to a region of the 16s ribosomal gene. duplicate samples of inoculated synovial fluid were prepared for microbial culture. bacteria were detected in all samples inoculated with bacteria but not in control synovial fluid samples. under experimental conditions there was no difference between microbial culture and pcr analyses for detection of bacteria. experimentally, pcr was able to detect bacteria in synovial fluid within 24 hours of inoculation.

TI  == [in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, marbofloxacin (ro 09-1168) against strictly anaerobic bacteria and some bacteria from human fecal flora].
AB  == as recommended by the eec, the in vitro activity of a veterinary quinolone has to be evaluated on human strains isolated from the gut and especially against anaerobes. thus, the mics for marbofloxacin were determined by the reference agar method (norma nccls m11 a3) using wilkins chalgren medium for the 124 anaerobic strains and mueller hinton agar for e. coli, proteus, enterococcus and lactobacillus. on the whole aerobes, the activity of marbofloxacin was equal or slightly greater to that of ofloxacin. the modal mic was 0.03 mg/l for enterobacteriaceae, 2 mg/l and 16 mg/l for enterococcus and lactobacillus strains, respectively. considering the anti-anaerobic activity of this new drug,  in comparison with that of ofloxacin, mics for ofloxacin were generally one log2  higher for gram negative bacilli and two log2 higher for gram positive bacilli. modal mics for marbofloxacin were 0.12 mg/l for clostridium perfringens, 0.5 mg/l for bacteroides fragilis, fusobacterium, prevotella, and peptostreptococcus strains, 1 mg/l for bifidobacteria, 2 mg/l for non-fragilis members of the b. fragilis group, and 4 mg/l for c. difficile strains, respectively. it appears in  vitro that marbofloxacin was a more potent agent than ofloxacin on the whole anaerobes.

TI  == an evaluation of the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  == tazobactam is a new, irreversible inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases of staphylococci, plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of the tem and shv types found in escherichia coli and klebsiella species and beta-lactamases of anerobes such as bacteroides species. its combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum ureido-penicillin, would be expected to improve the activity of piperacillin against staphylococci, tem and shv beta-lactamase producing gram negative bacteria and anerobes. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of piperacillin/tazobactam were determined for 1952 individual patient isolates of gram positive and negative bacteria causing significant infections and compared with mic values for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid. mics were determined by agar dilution (nccls 1990 and 1992). piperacillin/tazobactam had excellent activity against methicillin susceptible staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, enterococci and organisms of the bacteroides fragilis group. it was also active against the majority of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates tested. it was not active against extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing klebsiella species and some high level tem and shv beta-lactamase producing e. coli and klebsiella species. activity against gram negative organisms capable of producing chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases was good, since in most organisms tested, the enzymes were not induced in sufficient quantities to cause antibiotic resistance. however some enterobacter species were derepressed hyperproducing mutants; these isolates showed resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam since tazobactam does not inhibit these class i beta lactamases. activity was superior to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid for gram negative rods. imipenem was the most active agent against esbl producing klebsiella species. piperacillin/tazobactam has a suitable spectrum of activity in vitro to suggest its use in monotherapy of mixed anerobic infections, mixed respiratory infections such as aspiration pneumonia and, in combination with an aminoglycoside, it would provide gram positive as well as gram negative cover of  febrile episodes in immunosuppressed patients.

TI  == bacteroides fragilis enterotoxin modulates epithelial permeability and bacterial  internalization by ht-29 enterocytes.
AB  == background & aims: enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis has been associated with  diarrheal disease, and the enterotoxin has a cytopathic effect on cultured ht-29  enterocytes. experiments were designed to determine the effect of b. fragilis enterotoxin on bacteria-enterocyte interactions. methods: confluent ht-29 enterocytes were incubated for 1 hour with b. fragilis enterotoxin, followed by 1 hour of incubation with pure cultures of enteric bacteria, namely, salmonella typhimurium (two strains), listeria monocytogenes (three strains), proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli (three strains), and enterococcus faecalis. enterocyte viability was assessed using vital dyes, epithelial permeability was measured using transepithelial electrical resistance, enterocyte morphology and bacteria-enterocyte interactions were visualized using light and electron microscopy, and bacterial internalization was assessed using a quantitative culture of lysed enterocytes. results: b. fragilis enterotoxin did not affect enterocyte viability but decreased transepithelial electrical resistance, and individual enterocytes pulled apart. enterotoxin pretreatment decreased internalization of l. monocytogenes (p < 0.01) but increased (p < 0.01) internalization of the other strains of enteric bacteria. augmented bacterial internalization was associated with preferential bacterial adherence on the exposed lateral surface of enterotoxin-treated enterocytes. conclusions: b. fragilis enterotoxin was associated with ht-29 cell rounding and with augmented internalization of selected strains of enteric bacteria that were preferentially  adherent on the exposed enterocyte lateral surface.

TI  == bacterial adherence and biofilm formation on latex and silicone t-tubes in relation to bacterial contamination of bile.
AB  == background: t-tube-related bacteriobilia causes infectious complications and obstruction. to prevent these, the choice of t-tube material may be of importance. methods: transected common bile ducts (cbds) of 17 piglets were sutured over latex or silicone t-tubes, or without a t-tube. results: after 6 weeks bacteriobilia was found in all of 12 cbds with and in 1 of 5 cbds without a t-tube (p < 0.05). by scanning electron microscopy (sem) four of five latex and none of five silicone t-tubes had bacterial biofilms (p < 0.05). all tubes remained patent. segments of t-tubes were incubated with five different bacterial strains. sonication and sem showed that 0.1-1.1% of 10(7) colony-forming units of inoculum adhered to t-tubes. two to six times more bacteria adhered to latex than to silicone (p < 0.05). conclusions: silicone offers better long-term patency than latex. less infectious complications occur if t-tubes are omitted.

TI  == ca2(+)-dependent and ca2(+)-independent proteinase contents in the skeletal muscle in septic rats.
AB  == this study assessed sepsis-induced changes in the contents of calpain and cathepsin b in rat soleus muscle. sepsis was induced in rats by intra-abdominally implanting fecal pellets containing escherichia coil and bacteroides fragilis. intact soleus muscles were isolated from non-operated control rats, and from rats sacrificed 1 and 2 days after they were implanted with bacteria-free (sterile implanted) or bacteria-laden (septic implanted) pellets. western blot analyses of muscle homogenates were performed to identify and quantitate these proteinases using specific antibodies. no significant differences in cathepsin b contents were observed between the septic and nonseptic animals on days 1 and 2, post-implantation. among the three distinct bands recognized by anti-calpain, two prominent bands of 80 and 76 kda, representing calpain subunits, did not seem to  be altered in septic rats compared to the nonseptic groups. the content of the 45-kda subunit decreased in both the septic and sterile groups compared with non-operated control. these results along with our previous observations suggest  that although gram-negative sepsis does not appear to have an effect on ca2(+)-insensitive lysosomal cathepsin b content or activity, it upregulates the  activity of the ca2(+)-dependent calpain but not its content in the skeletal muscle during sepsis.

TI  == functional chemotactic factor cp-10 and mrp-14 are abundant in murine abscesses.
AB  == murine abscesses induced by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, and bran are established models for the study of localized infectious and inflammatory lesions. chemotactic factors are though to  mediate the directed migration of large numbers of leukocytes into the abscess. microorganisms located within the encapsulated lesion are not readily eliminated  by the leukocytes, but their numbers are controlled over many weeks. we report the presence of large amounts of two murine s100 proteins, cp-10 and migration inhibition factor-related protein 14 (mrp-14), in abscesses as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blotting (immunoblotting). high levels of cp-10 (7.7 +/- 1 mg/ml) and mrp-14 (5.5 +/- 1 mg/ml) were found throughout the time course of abscess development from early acute-phase lesions, which are predominantly neutrophilic, to late chronic-phase lesions, which contained more mononuclear cells. approximately one-third of these amounts occurred as monomers (2.0 mg/ml for mrp  14 and 2.2 mg/ml for cp-10). abscess fluid was strongly chemotactic, and a portion of the activity was due to cp-10, indicating its important role in leukocyte recruitment. cp-10-mrp-14 complexes were present in abscess fluid, and  the proteins were immunoabsorbed together. in analogy with the related human mrp-8-mrp-14 complex, these proteins could be involved in the inhibition of microbial growth. no growth inhibition occurred with 20 microgram of cp-10 or mrp-14 per ml or with mixtures of both, but these concentrations may have been insufficient and were not representative of the high concentrations found within  abscesses. cp-10 may contribute indirectly to the antimicrobial response in abscesses by virtue of its strong chemotactic properties and its capacity to modulate the activation state of recruited leukocytes.

(13 isolates, including 10 bacteroides fragilis groups) and 13 peptostreptococcus sp. the predominant aerobes were escherichia coli (7), proteus sp. (5), group d streptococci (4), and pseudomonas sp. (3). conclusions: this study highlights the polymicrobial nature and predominance of anaerobic bacteria  in infected hemorrhoids.

TI  == interleukin-4 prevents mortality from acute but not chronic murine peritonitis and induces an accelerated tumor necrosis factor-alpha response.
AB  == interleukin-4 (il-4) demonstrates properties in vitro that suggest an anti-inflammatory role in the immune response, one of which is the inhibition of  tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf) release. we examined the effects of il-4 administration on mortality and serum tnf levels in two murine models of peritonitis. animals infected with intraperitoneal injections of escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis (acute peritonitis) had a decreased mortality and earlier tnf-alpha peak when pretreated with 5,000 units il-4. animals infected with bacteria and a sterile fecal adjuvant (chronic peritonitis) had no alteration in mortality or serum tnf levels (which were consistently low) with il-4 pretreatment. these data demonstrate that, under some in vivo conditions, il-4 can significantly ameliorate a septic insult, but this effect appears to be  highly model-dependent and not clearly related to its effects on tnf-alpha.

TI  == altered expression of eukaryotic initiation factor 2b in skeletal muscle during sepsis.
AB  == sepsis causes an inhibition of protein synthesis in skeletal muscles composed of  fast-twitch fibers, in part, as a result of a decreased activity of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2b (eif-2b). in the present study, we investigated the expression of two subunits of eif-2b, i.e., the beta- and epsilon-subunits during sepsis. the expression of both beta- and epsilon-subunits of eif-2b in gastrocnemius was decreased approximately 50% from control values during the first 5 days after induction of sepsis. the decreased expression of eif-2b epsilon during sepsis correlated with similar reductions in eif-2b epsilon mrna.  restoration of protein synthesis (10 days postsurgery) was associated with a return of eif-2b epsilon expression to values observed in control rats. expression of eif-2b epsilon was not altered in heart during sepsis or in gastrocnemius from nonseptic abscess animals. amrinone, which ameliorated the inhibition of protein synthesis during sepsis, also prevented the fall in eif-2b  epsilon protein after 5 days of infection. the data provide evidence that expression of eif-2b epsilon is markedly influenced in gastrocnemius during the course of the septic episode and support the concept that this change is a mechanism responsible for the inhibition of protein synthesis observed under this condition.

TI  == manipulation of the size and clone of an intra-abdominal abscess in rats.
AB  == a rat grading model of chronic sepsis was developed by inoculation of a small (0.8 ml) or a large (1.5 ml) fecal pellet consisting of sterile rat feces, agar and a known number and strain of bacteria. a uniform spherical abscess containing escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis was formed in 100% of the animals that  survived the initial peritonitis stage. the effects of a large biclonal abscess were compared with those of a small abscess and of a sham operation. the peritonitis stage with high mortality was followed by an abscess stage. in rats with a large abscess, net body weight did not increase and there was 16% mortality during the abscess stage. on the 7th day, severe hepatic energy deficiency and lactic acidosis occurred in the septic liver with b. fragilis bacteremia. rats with small abscesses showed mild metabolic disturbances with no  mortality. standardization of rat models with chronic graded septic abscess is possible by controlling the size of the fecal pellet and the species and number of inoculated bacteria.

TI  == spinal epidural abscess in hemodialysis patients: report of three cases and review of the literature.
AB  == spinal epidural abscess (sea) is a rare infection that can evolve to severe permanent neurologic deficit or death if the diagnosis is delayed. we report three cases of sea in hemodialysis patients and summarize nine previously reported cases occurring in hemodialysis patients, with detailed comparisons to series of sea from the general medical literature. among these 12 patients, hemodialysis catheters and arteriovenous grafts were the major source of infection, in contrast to the usual skin source. staphylococcus aureus was implicated in all cases, but in one patient bacteroides fragilis also was isolated from both the resected arteriovenous fistula and the sea, and escherichia coli was isolated from the arteriovenous fistula. the classic syndrome of sea includes fever, backache, and local spinal tenderness, followed by progressive radicular and cord compression signs and symptoms. in this series, back pain and radicular pain were common at presentation, but only a minority had fever, back tenderness, weakness, or leukocytosis. cerebrospinal fluid was typically abnormal but culture negative, whereas blood and epidural abscess cultures were frequently positive. plain x-ray films, bone scans, and plain computed tomography scans had low diagnostic yield, and magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium had a sensitivity of 80%. only myelography or computed tomography-myelography gave consistently correct diagnoses. the clinical outcome  was poor, with one patient deceased and seven with severe weakness or paralysis.  early intervention provided a higher likelihood of good outcome, whereas late intervention and preoperative neurologic deficits portended a poor functional result. because of the high incidence of bacteremia in hemodialysis patients, we  recommend that symptoms of fever, backache, and spinal tenderness be promptly evaluated for sea before signs or symptoms of cord compression develop. early recognition and treatment with antibiotics and decompressive laminectomy is generally associated with a better outcome.

AB  == semi-quantitative and qualitative bacterial assessment of the vaginal and cervical flora of a total of 202 women was carried out over a period of six months to determine the bacterial flora in three groups of women and changes caused by prior use of antibiotics. the number was made up of 32 healthy volunteers, 80 women with gynaecological problems and 90 women with gynaecological infections who had had antibiotic treatment prior to this study. standard methods were used for the investigations. five main genera of anaerobic  bacteria were isolated from all patients. they included, the bacteroides spp., prevotella spp., porphyromonas spp., peptostreptococcus spp. and clostridium spp. five non-sporing gram negative anaerobic bacteria constituted the bulk of the flora including prevotella bivia, p. disiens, p. melanogenica, p. asaccharolytica and b. fragilis. the predominant flora was p. bivia occurring in 61 pc of cervical swab specimens of the 80 women with proven gynaecological infections who had not used antibiotics and accounting for 27 pc of the total number of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria isolated. escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis were the most frequently encountered aerobic bacteria. the semi-quantitative counts of the different bacterial species in the patient group  were significantly higher than in the control group of healthy individuals (p < 0,025). similarly, prior antibiotic administration significantly reduced the population and quantitative count of the anaerobic bacteria.

AB  == the interesting in vitro antimicrobial activity and pharmacokinetics of the new quinolone trovafloxacin (cp-99,219) warranted further studies to determine its in vivo efficacy in models of infectious disease. the significance of the pharmacokinetic and in vitro antimicrobial profiles of trovafloxacin was shown through efficacy in a series of animal infection models by employing primarily oral therapy. against acute infections, trovafloxacin was consistently more effective than temafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae and other gram-positive pathogens while maintaining activity comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against gram-negative organisms. in a model of murine pneumonia, trovafloxacin was more efficacious than temafloxacin, while  ciprofloxacin failed against s. pneumoniae (50% protective doses, 2.1, 29.5, and  >100 mg/kg, respectively). in addition to its inherent in vitro potency advantage against s. pneumoniae, these data were supported by a pharmacokinetic study that  showed levels of trovafloxacin in pulmonary tissue of s. pneumoniae-infected cf1  mice to be considerably greater than those of temafloxacin and ciprofloxacin (twice the maximum drug concentration in serum; two to three times the half-life, and three to six times the area under the concentration-time curve). against localized mixed anaerobic infections, trovafloxacin was the only agent to effectively reduce the numbers of recoverable cfu of bacteroides fragilis ( >1,000-fold), staphylococcus aureus (1,000-fold), and escherichia coli ( >100-fold) compared with ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, metronidazole, clindamycin, cefoxitin, and ceftriaxone. the in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities of  trovafloxacin and its pharmacokinetics in laboratory animals provide support for  the ongoing and planned human phase ii and iii clinical trials.

AB  == toward the completion of elective colorectal operations, 75 patients had qualitative aerobic and anaerobic cultures of specimens obtained from peritoneal  irrigation fluid, anastomoses sites, and abdominal wound irrigation fluid to determine if a correlation exists between intraoperative flora and postoperative  infectious complications. patients enrolled in this prospective study received a  mechanical bowel prep and a 12-18 hour course of perioperative intravenous antibiotics. comparisons were made between the 60 (80%) patients who had no postoperative infections and the 15 (20%) who developed postoperative infectious  complications (9 wound infections, 6 intraabdominal infections). there were significantly more low anterior resections in patients who developed postoperative infection compared to those who had no postoperative infection (26% vs 2%), while there were more colocolostomies in the group with no infections (38% vs 7%). streptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis group, and escherichia coli were the most commonly isolated organisms from each of the three sites sampled. isolation of > or = 3 organisms from incisional wound cultures (p = 0.017) and <  or = 4 organisms from peritoneal irrigation (p = 0.009) or anastomotic culture (p = 0.004) correlated with development of postoperative infectious complications. thus, patients with infectious complications had significantly more isolates than those without infectious complications, and were more likely to have had a low anterior resection. these data suggest that future clinical studies should reexamine the duration of perioperative antimicrobials based on early laboratory  reports of qualitative and quantitative operative site bacteriology.

TI  == cd4+ t cells mediate preexposure-induced increases in murine intraabdominal abscess formation.
AB  == we have previously shown that an increased number of escherichia coli/bacteroides fragilis intraabdominal abscesses are produced in mice after preexposure to small numbers of live e. coli or b. fragilis. splenic lymphocyte subset changes and the importance of different elements of the immune response in this system were studied. preexposure to bacteria induced a significant increase in the percentage of splenic t cells without altering the cd4/cd8 ratio. the passive transfer of either 10(7) mixed splenic lymphocytes, 5 x 10(6) mixed t cells, or 2.5 x 10(6) cd4+ t cells from preexposed animals to naive siblings 24 hr prior to abscess induction resulted in increased abscess formation. transfer of serum, b cells, <  10(7) lymphocytes, cd8+ t cells, or any cell type from naive animals did not change abscess number. the bacterial composition of abscesses changed only in animals receiving either serum or b cells from donors preexposed to b. fragilis,  where an increased number of b. fragilis per abscess was found. the cd4+ t cell response can be altered by transient infections and is critical to subsequent abscess formation, and a concurrent humoral response may play a role in determining an abscess' ultimate bacterial composition.

TI  == nosocomial bacteremia-induced increases in abscess formation correlate with in vitro upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the hypothesis that sublethal exposure to common nosocomial pathogens can alter the host response to a later, distant infectious insult (peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation), and that these changes are related to the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. design: a multiexperiment, randomized, controlled trial. setting: animal research laboratory of a university medical center. subjects: one hundred sixty-five balb/c mice, weighing 20 to 25 g, were used for in vivo experiments and as the source of peritoneal macrophages for in vitro experiments. interventions: nine groups of mice (n = 10 to 18 per group) were twice systemically preexposed to sublethal amounts of live escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, or candida albicans, or to 2.5 or 5.0 micrograms e. coli lipopolysaccharide o26:b6. one week later, mice underwent the induction of mixed e. coli/bacteroides fragilis peritonitis, leading to abscess formation. in parallel experiments in vitro, 10(6) mouse peritoneal macrophages were incubated with similar amounts of nosocomial pathogens or lipopolysaccharide to determine the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. measurements and main results: the three gram-negative bacilli tested significantly upregulated both abscess formation and macrophage procoagulant activity, with a strong linear correlation between abscess formation and procoagulant activity. these effects were not seen with the gram-positive cocci or with c. albicans. pre-exposure of mice to endotoxin alone  did not alter later abscess formation, but did increase macrophage procoagulant activity. conclusions: sublethal exposure to some gram-negative nosocomial pathogens can significantly alter a host's response to a later, distant, infection, even when caused by different bacteria. in the case of peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation, these changes may be mediated by the upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity. the presence of endotoxin alone does not completely explain these phenomena.

AB  == a 4.2-kb plasmid (plv22a) native to bacteroides fragilis lv22 became fused to a transfer-deficient bacteroides spp.-escherichia coli shuttle vector by an inverse transposition event, resulting in a transferrable phenotype. the transfer phenotype was attributable to plv22a, which was also capable of mobilization within e. coli when coresident with the incp beta r751 plasmid. transposon mutagenesis with tn1000 localized the mobilization region to a 1.5-kb dna segment in plv22a. the mobilization region has been sequenced, and five open reading frames have been identified. mutants carrying disruptions in any of the three genes designated mbpa, mbpb, and mbpc and coding for deduced products of 11.3, 30.4, and 17.1 kda, respectively, cannot be mobilized when coresident with r751.  mutations in all three genes can be complemented in the presence of the respective wild-type genes, indicating that the products of mbpa, mbpb, and mbpc  have roles in the mobilization process and function in trans. the deduced 30.4-kda mbpb protein contains a 14-amino-acid conserved motif that is also found in the dna relaxases of a variety of conjugal and mobilizable plasmids and the conjugative transposon tn4399. deletion analysis and complementation experiments  have localized a cis-acting region of plv22a within mbpa.

TI  == bacteroides infections in children.
AB  == from 1974 to 1990, 336 bacteroides isolates were obtained from 312 specimens from 274 patients. they comprised 180 (54%) b. fragilis isolates, 55 (16%) b. theta-iotaomicron, 36 (11%) b. vulgatus, 34 (10%) b. distasonis, 21 (6%) b. ovatus and 10 (3%) b. uniformis. infections in 253 (92%) patients were polymicrobial, but in 21 (8%) children, a bacteroides sp. was isolated in pure culture. most bacteroides isolates were from peritoneal fluid (114), abscesses (110), wound infections (20), blood cultures (10) and from patients with pneumonia (14) or chronic otitis media (8). predisposing conditions were present  in 145 (53%) children; these were previous surgery (46), trauma (28), malignancy  (21), prematurity (19), immunodeficiency (18), steroid therapy (12) foreign body  (10), diabetes (9) and sickle cell disease (7). the micro-organisms isolated most commonly mixed with bacteroides spp. were anaerobic cocci (221), escherichia coli (122), fusobacterium spp. (38) and clostridium spp. (30). all patients received antimicrobial therapy in conjunction with surgical drainage or correction of pathology in 197 (72%) cases. all but 12 (5%) patients recovered. these data illustrate the importance of bacteroides spp. in infections in children.

TI  == role of ca2+ in prostaglandin e2-induced t-lymphocyte proliferative suppression in sepsis.
AB  == prostaglandin e2 (pge2) has been known to modulate immune responses by inhibiting t-cell activation following hemorrhagic and traumatic injury. recently, we documented a sepsis-related depression in concanavalin a (cona)-induced t-cell proliferation and intracellular ca2+ (ca2+i) mobilization. the present study evaluated the potential role of pge2 in the sepsis-related attenuation in ca2+ signaling and proliferation in t cells. sepsis was induced in rats by implanting  into their abdomen fecal pellets containing escherichia coli (150 cfu) and bacteroides fragilis (10(4) cfu). a group of rats implanted with septic pellets were treated with indomethacin at three consecutive time points. levels of pge2 in blood were measured with a radioimmunoassay kit. cona-induced [ca2+]i mobilization in t cells obtained from indomethacin-treated and untreated rats was measured with fura-2 and microfluorometry. we observed a 10-fold increase in pge2 levels in the circulation of septic rats compared with levels in rats implanted with bacterium-free sterilized pellets. the proliferative response and ca2+i mobilization were significantly depressed in t cells obtained from septic rats 48 h after implantations compared with those in rats implanted with sterile pellets. however, treatment of rats with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin prevented the sepsis-related depression in cona-induced t-cell ca2+i mobilization as well as proliferation. further, incubation of t cells from nonimplanted control rats with pge2 resulted in a substantial depression in both t-cell proliferation and ca2+i mobilization. the restoration of t-cell proliferation and ca2+ signaling after indomethacin treatment of septic rats and the depression in  the mitogen responsiveness in t cells previously exposed to pge2 suggest that the pge2 does play a significant role in the modulation of t-cell responses in septic rats and that such pge2-induced suppression in t-cell activation is likely due to an attenuation in ca2+ signaling.

TI  == the role of candida albicans in the pathogenesis of experimental fungal/bacterial peritonitis and abscess formation.
AB  == the recovery of candida albicans along with bacteria from the abdomen in the setting of peritonitis is becoming increasingly common. it is not known whether the interactions between the fungal and bacterial elements of these infections are synergistic, competitive, or neutral. to study this question, we have examined the effects of both the addition of c. albicans to a solely bacterial infection caused by escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis, and the deletion of various components of this system using directed antimicrobial therapy. in a mixed infection, both c. albicans and bacteria contributed to mortality, since only the combination of cefoxitin and amphotericin b improved survival (from 50%  to 90%). the addition of c. albicans to the bacterial inoculum increased the recovery of abscesses, but only to the number seen with fungal infection alone, implying two fairly independent processes. although the number of bacteria recovered from abscesses at 10 days postinfection was unchanged with the addition of fungi, the deletion of the bacterial component of mixed infections led to the  overgrowth of c. albicans. we conclude that this model of mixed c. albicans/e. coli/b. fragilis peritonitis is best characterized as two nonsynergistic, parallel infections with incomplete competition, allowing the survival of all three organisms to eventual abscess formation.

TI  == antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  == in addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. this investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol,  super eba and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli b and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica, fusobacterium  necrophorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. after growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials  were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees c. impregnated discs with the super eba liquid were used as positive controls. the antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials.  impregnated discs with super eba liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. zinc  oxide-eugenol and super eba pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == purification and characterization of ferritin from campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == we purified an iron-containing protein from campylobacter jejuni using ultracentrifugation and ion-exchange chromatography. electron microscopy of this  protein revealed circular particles with a diameter of 11.5 nm and a central core with a diameter of 5.5 nm. the protein was composed of a single peptide of 21 kda and did not serologically cross-react with horse spleen ferritin. the uv-visible  spectrum of the protein showed no absorption peaks in the visible region, indicating that little or no heme is bound. the ratio of fe:phosphate of c. jejuni ferritin was 1.5:1. from these morphological and chemical examinations, we concluded that the c. jejuni purified protein is a ferritin of the same class as  that of helicobacter pylori and bacteroides fragilis and differs from the heme-containing bacterioferritin of escherichia coli. the 30 n-terminal amino acids were sequenced and were found to resemble the sequences of other ferritins  strongly (h. pylori ferritin, 73% identity; b. fragilis ferritin, 50% identity; e. coli gene-165 product, 50% identity), and to a lesser degree, bacterioferritins (e. coli bacterioferritin, 26% identity; azotobacter vinelandii, 26% identity; horse spleen ferritin 30% identity). proteins that cross-reacted with antiserum against the ferritin of c. jejuni were found in other campylobacter species and in h. pylori, but not in vibrio, e. coli, or pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == clinical features and aerobic and anaerobic microbiological characteristics of cellulitis.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the aerobic and anaerobic microbiological characteristics of cellulitis and correlate them with the infection site. design: of 342 specimens, 64 obtained using needle aspiration and 278 using swabs were studied over 10 years. results: bacterial growth was noted in 15 (23%) of the 64  needle aspirates and 259 (93%) of the 278 swab aspirates. the microbial results of the 15 specimens obtained through needle aspiration are separately presented.  aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 138 (53%) of swab samples, anaerobic bacteria only in 69 (27%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 52 (20%). in total, there were 582 isolates, 247 aerobic or facultative and 335 anaerobic bacteria, with an average of 2.2 isolates per specimen. the predominance of certain isolates in different anatomical sites correlated with their distribution in the normal flora adjacent to the infected site. the highest recovery rates of anaerobes was from the neck, trunk, groin, external genitalia,  and leg areas. aerobes outnumbered anaerobes in the arm and hand. the predominant aerobes were staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococci, and escherichia coli. the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp, bacteroides fragilis group, prevotella and porphyromonas sp, and clostridium sp. certain clinical findings correlated with the following organisms: swelling and tenderness with clostridium sp, prevotella sp, s aureus, and group a streptococci; regional adenopathy with b fragilis group; bulbous lesions with enterobacteriaceae; gangrene and necrosis with peptostreptococcus sp, b fragilis group, clostridium sp, and enterobacteriaceae; foul odor with bacteroides sp; and gas in tissues with peptostreptococcus sp, b fragilis group and clostridium sp. certain predisposing  conditions correlated with the following organisms: trauma with clostridium sp; diabetes with bacteroides sp, enterobacteriaceae, and s aureus; and burn with pseudomonas aeruginosa. conclusion: these data highlight the polymicrobial nature of cellulitis.

TI  == gentamycin reduces bacteremia and mortality rates associated with the treatment of experimental peritonitis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator.
AB  == background: recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtpa), administered intraperitoneally, reduces intra-abdominal abscess formation in rats with fecal peritonitis at the costs of increased mortality and early escherichia coli bacteremia. it was determined whether or not mortality and bacteremia could be prevented by gentamycin in these rats. study design: fecal peritonitis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of sterile feces contaminated with 10(8) (experiment 1) or 10(4) (experiment 2) colony forming units (cfu) e. coli and 10(4) cfu bacteroides fragilis. male wistar rats were randomly assigned to receive either methyl hydroxy propyl cellulose (mhpc) gel alone (m) or 0.5 mg/ml  rtpa dissolved in mhpc gel (m-tpa). three hours after inoculation, one-half of the rats in each of these groups received 6 mg/kg gentamycin sulfate (g) intramuscularly (group m-g and m-tpa-g). at one, three, six, 12, and 24 hours after inoculation, blood cultures were taken. at five days after inoculation, intra-abdominal abscess formation was assessed and abscesses were cultured (experiment 2). results: all rats in groups m and m-tpa in experiment 1 developed bacteremia and died within 24 hours. bacteremia occurred significantly earlier in group m-tpa compared with group m (p < 0.05). gentamycin significantly reduced the number of rats with bacteremia, the bacteria concentration in the blood, and  mortality rates. although in experiment 2 none of the rats developed bacteremia,  gentamycin prevented mortality associated with the use of rtpa. the number of abscesses in groups m-tpa and m-tpa-g was significantly lower than in those in groups m and m-g (p < 0.01). gentamycin did not influence the number of abscesses. conclusions: gentamycin reduces bacteremia and mortality rates in rats with fecal peritonitis treated with rtpa intraperitoneally to prevent intra-abdominal abscess formation.

TI  == comparison of the pharmacodynamic activity of cefotaxime plus metronidazole with  cefoxitin and ampicillin plus sulbactam.
AB  == study objective: to compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic activity of three drug regimens: cefotaxime plus metronidazole, cefoxitin, and ampicillin-sulbactam against two organisms frequently isolated in intraabdominal  infection, escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis. design: open-label, three-way crossover study. setting: hartford hospital clinical research center. participants: nine healthy volunteers. interventions: subjects received the following regimens: (1) a single 1-g intravenous dose of cefotaxime plus a single 500-mg oral dose of metronidazole; (2) two intravenous doses of cefoxitin, 2 g each dose given every 6 hours; and (3) two intravenous doses of ampicillin-sulbactam, 3 g each dose given every 6 hours. measurements and main results: serum bactericidal titers and drug concentrations were measured over a 12-hour period. the cefotaxime-metronidazole regimen showed superior activity against e. coli compared with ampicillin-sulbactam and cefoxitin. the mean areas  under the bactericidal activity curve (aubc) for the three regimens were 550.2, 68.7, and 48.9, respectively (p = 0.0001). there was no significant difference in aubc among the three regimens for b. fragilis. serum concentrations of cefotaxime remained above the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for e. coli significantly longer than did concentrations of ampicillin-sulbactam and cefoxitin (p = 0.0002 and p = 0.0023, respectively). serum concentrations of metronidazole were still at 9 times the mic for b. fragilis at the end of the 12-hour dosing interval; for ampicillin-sulbactam and cefoxitin concentrations remained above the mic for one-half and less than one-fourth, respectively, of the dosing interval (p < 0.0001). the ratio of auc:mic was also favorable for metronidazole (212.2) compared with 63.4 for ampicillin-sulbactam and 9.2 for cefoxitin. conclusions: the combination of cefotaxime-metronidazole, even at the  relatively low doses used in this study, provides coverage against gram-negative  and anaerobic pathogens that is at least as effective as that of cefoxitin and ampicillin-sulbactam. in addition, its cost is considerably less expensive than that of the other regimens.

TI  == requirements for strand- and site-specific cleavage within the orit region of tn4399, a mobilizing transposon from bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == replicons that contain tn4399, a conjugal mobilizing transposon isolated from bacteroides fragilis, can be mobilized in the presence of broad-host-range incp plasmids rp4 and r751 in escherichia coli to b. fragilis or e. coli recipients (c. g. murphy and m. h. malamy, j. bacteriol. 175:5814-5823, 1993). to identify the initial dna processing events involved in tn4399-mediated mobilization in e.  coli, plasmid dna from pcgm328 (a puc7 vector that contains the mobilization region of tn4399) was isolated from donor cells following the release of plasmid  dna from the relaxation complex. site- and strand-specific cleavage within the orit region of tn4399 was detected by denaturing gel electrophoresis and southern hybridization analysis of this dna in the presence or absence of incp plasmids. mutations in either moca or mocb, two genes which are encoded by tn4399 and are required for mobilization, significantly decrease the amount of specifically nicked dna detected. these results suggest roles for the moca and mocb gene products in specific processing of tn4399-containing plasmid dna prior to mobilization. by isolation of the nicked strand and primer extension of this template, we mapped the precise 5' end of the single-stranded cleavage reaction.  the nucleotide position of nictn4399 is adjacent to two sets of inverted repeats, a genetic arrangement similar to those of previously characterized orit regions.  two site-directed mutations which remove nictn4399 (orit delta 1 and orit delta 2) cannot be mobilized to recipients when they are present in trans along with functional moca and mocb proteins and an incp mobilizing plasmid; they are cis-dominant loss-of-function mutations.

TI  == biochemical and genetic analyses of a catalase from the anaerobic bacterium bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == a single catalase enzyme was produced by the anaerobic bacterium bacteroides fragilis when cultures at late log phase were shifted to aerobic conditions. in anaerobic conditions, catalase activity was detected in stationary-phase cultures, indicating that not only oxygen exposure but also starvation may affect the production of this antioxidant enzyme. the purified enzyme showed a peroxidatic activity when pyrogallol was used as an electron donor. it is a hemoprotein containing one heme molecule per holomer and has an estimated molecular weight of 124,000 to 130,000. the catalase gene was cloned by screening a b. fragilis library for complementation of catalase activity in an escherichia  coli catalase mutant (kate katg) strain. the cloned gene, designated katb, encoded a catalase enzyme with electrophoretic mobility identical to that of the  purified protein from the b. fragilis parental strain. the nucleotide sequence of katb revealed a 1,461-bp open reading frame for a protein with 486 amino acids and a predicted molecular weight of 55,905. this result was very close to the 60,000 da determined by denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified catalase and indicates that the native enzyme is  composed of two identical subunits. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified catalase obtained by edman degradation confirmed that it is a product of katb. the amino acid sequence of katb showed high similarity to haemophilus influenzae hkte (71.6% identity, 66% nucleotide identity), as well as to gram-positive bacterial and mammalian catalases. no similarities to bacterial catalase-peroxidase-type enzymes were found. the active-site residues, proximal and distal hemebinding ligands, and nadph-binding residues of the bovine liver catalase-type enzyme were highly conserved in b. fragilis katb.

TI  == antibiotic penetration of experimental intra-abdominal abscesses.
AB  == intra-abdominal abscess is seldom adequately treated by systemic antibiotics alone and often requires surgical or computed tomography-guided drainage for resolution. abscess penetration of six currently used antibiotics was examined in a murine intra-abdominal abscess model. ampicillin/sulbactam, cefmetazole, clindamycin, and trospectomycin penetrated intra-abdominal abscesses to a greater degree than cefoxitin and ceftriaxone. abscess pus antibiotic levels were not significantly higher after multiple doses than after a single dose. pus antibiotic levels below the mic90 for bacteroides and e. coli within intra-abdominal abscess were observed for most antibiotics with the doses used in this study. selection of antibiotics with a greater ability to penetrate abscess  may be important in optimally treating patients with abdominal infection.

TI  == biological activity of bacteroides lipopolysaccharide--reappraisal.
AB  == lipopolysaccharide (lps) was extracted from six species of bacteroides by the phenol/water, petroleum/chloroform/ phenol, and triton/magnesium methods. yields  and chemical analysis demonstrated that the products were different. biological activity (endotoxicity) was assessed by the limulus amebocyte lysate (lal) assay, induction of tumor necrosis factor (tnf) from human mononuclear leukocytes, and a lethality model with galactosamine-sensitized mice. results showed that endotoxicity varied greatly depending on the species and the extraction method. lps prepared by the phenol/water method was most endotoxic and that from bacteroides fragilis had the greatest activity. compared with escherichia coli lps, the phenol/water extract of b. fragilis was sevenfold more active in the lal assay and marginally less active (five-to seven-fold) in the bioassay for tnf induction. however, when b. fragilis lps was added to e. coli lps, the induction  of tnf was inhibited. in the mouse model, b. fragilis lps was 5,000-fold less toxic. if the gastrointestinal tract is the source of the endotoxin in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome, then the obligately anaerobic bacteroides species, which outnumber the facultative species such as e. coli by 1,000-fold, should not be overlooked.

AB  == 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (cda) is a new drug for the treatment of hairy cell leukemia and other lymphoproliferative diseases. it is generally administered as  a continuous intravenous infusion during 5-7 days. the oral bioavailability is only 50%. the bioavailability after rectal administration was investigated in two patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. five milligrams per square metre was  given i.v. as a 2-h infusion and 24 h later the same dose was administered rectally in a gel formulation. the mean bioavailability was only 21% due to deglycosylation of cda to 2-chloroadenine (cade). to further elucidate the factors which are important for the rectal availability of cda, the in vitro stability of cda in bacterial cultures was tested. clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli as well as whole feces rapidly deglycosylated cda to cade while  bacteroides fragilis, enterococcus faecalis as well as saliva only degraded cda slowly or not at all. it is concluded that, due to bacterial degradation, rectal  administration of cda has no advantage over oral administration.

TI  == renovascular interaction of epinephrine, dopamine, and intraperitoneal sepsis.
AB  == objective: to determine the effect of intraperitoneal sepsis on the systemic and  renal actions of the continous infusion of epinephrine or dopamine, and during the concurrent administration of both drugs. design: prospective, randomized study. setting: laboratory at a university hospital. subjects: seven conscious, chronically catheterized, adult merino sheep. interventions: epinephrine at 40 micrograms/min or dopamine at 2 micrograms/kg/min, or both drugs concurrently were infused for 4 hrs on separate study days in healthy sheep. this protocol was then repeated following the induction of sepsis after the intraperitoneal injection of 10(11) escherichia coli, 10(12) bacteroides fragilis, and bran. measurements and main results: systemic oxygen delivery (do2) and consumption were measured using thermodilution cardiac output and measured oxygen content. renal blood flow was measured using an electromagnetic flow transducer, and creatinine clearance was calculated as the quotient of renal blood flow and the renal extraction ratio of creatinine. infusion of epinephrine augmented systemic  do2 and mean arterial pressure (map) during both healthy and septic studies. systemic oxygen consumption was only increased during epinephrine infusion in the septic study. during the healthy animal study, renal blood flow was initially decreased during epinephrine infusion, but increased to 36% above baseline (p = .003). however, creatinine clearance remained unchanged. during the experimental  sepsis study, the infusion of epinephrine had less marked effects on renal blood  flow (unchanged from baseline), while an initial reduction (15 mins) in creatinine clearance (p = .04) was not sustained and had returned to baseline by  3 hrs. dopamine alone produced no change in systemic oxygen variables or map during the studies on healthy or septic animals. although dopamine produced renal vasodilation and an increase in renal blood flow in the healthy state, these results were not found during the septic state. in addition, concurrent infusion  of dopamine with epinephrine did not alter the systemic or renal effects of epinephrine during the healthy or septic states. conclusions: these results do not support the routine use of low-dose dopamine, and demonstrate a change in renovascular responses to catecholamines during intraperitoneal sepsis. the infusion of epinephrine at 40 micrograms/min had few deleterious effects on the kidney, and augmented both map and systemic do2. its role as a catecholamine in the management of sepsis may need to be reconsidered.

AB  == b. fragilis and e. coli were labeled with tritiated (3h) thymidine, and 10(10) of each were given separately by gavage in balb/c mice immediately before a 20% burn injury was inflicted. control groups received gavage with 3h-b. fragilis or 3h-e. coli without burn. four hours after burn or gavage was administered, the animals  were killed, and the radionuclide and colony counts were determined in the mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, and spleen. additional groups of mice receiving gavage (b. fragilis or e. coli) and burn were observed for 10 days to study survival. the results showed that 3h-b. fragilis translocated to a greater extent than 3h-e. coli but that fewer b. fragilis than e. coli survived in tissues. survival was 86% for animals challenged with b. fragilis versus 53% for animals challenged with e. coli. it is concluded that in this model b. fragilis translocates extensively after burn injury and that survival is closely related to the destruction of translocated bacteria.

TI  == [nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1991. in this study, identifications and susceptibility  testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and cns showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (dmppc). streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to  many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. though enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (abpc), piperacillin (pipc), imipenem (ipm), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st) compounds, enterococcus faecium was resistant  to almost all antibacterial agents but to st compounds. high susceptibility rates were observed for strains of enterobacter cloacae to ipm, gentamicin (gm) and ofloxacin (oflx) and for strains of proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (lmox), ipm, aztreonam (azt), gm and oflx. serratia marcescens and bacteroides fragilis group  were highly susceptible only to ipm. pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (caz), ipm, amikacin (amk) and tobramycin (tob). pseudomonas cepacia  was relatively susceptible only to caz. ipm showed strong antibacterial activity  to many species except for s. aureus and cns.

TI  == effectiveness of fluconazole in murine candida albicans and bacterial c. albicans peritonitis and abscess formation.
AB  == the role of fluconazole in the treatment of many forms of focal mycoses remains unclear. we studied the effectiveness of three different oral doses of fluconazole in three murine models of candida albicans peritonitis leading to intra-abdominal abscess formation. during monomicrobial candida infection, fluconazole decreased mortality and the number of c. albicans cultured per abscess; prolonged treatment also eliminated escherichia coli translocation. in mixed c. albicans/e. coli/bacteroides fragilis infection, prolonged treatment with higher doses of fluconazole decreased mortality, the number of abscesses formed, and the number c. albicans per abscess. in animals with a similar polymicrobial infection but with concurrent cefoxitin treatment, fluconazole decreased mortality and the number of c. albicans per abscess; in addition, prolonged treatment reduced the number of abscesses. amphotericin b gave similar  results in all three models. these data indicate that the clinical use of fluconazole in peritonitis should be investigated.

TI  == effects of sarafloxacin hydrochloride on human enteric bacteria under simulated human gut conditions.
AB  == the effects of sarafloxacin, a newly developed veterinary fluoroquinolone antimicrobial, on 15 strains of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of human origin were assessed under simulated human gut conditions. an in vitro gut simulation model was designed to mimic the situation of sarafloxacin (free and bound to meat) passing through the human gastrointestinal tract. the survival of bacteria  in the simulation model and any subsequent change in the sensitivity of isolates  to sarafloxacin were measured. the inhibitory level of sarafloxacin for the tested bacteria was strain dependent. it appeared that in broth culture escherichia coli isolates were sensitive to sarafloxacin concentrations 5-fold lower than the concentrations present in the simulated gut model, suggesting that sarafloxacin may be partially unavailable due to absorption to organic matter in  the model. there was no significant observed change in the sarafloxacin sensitivity of the bacterial strains exposed to the compound in the model.

TI  == [escherichia coli, other enterobacteriaceae and additional indicators as markers  of microbiologic quality of food: advantages and limitations].
AB  == the 93/43 european union directive assigns to the food and catering industries the main responsibility for an integrated safety and quality assurance strategy in the food chain. relying on hazard analysis, followed by design and adoption of control of all critical points and practices ("haccp"). hiatus-free compliance with such haccp-based codes of good practices is to be assessed by monitoring, recording results on process performance charts and gauging such data against experimentally established, attainable and maintainable references ranges ("standards"). marker microorganisms are a major analytical tool for validating compliance in the sense of the eu directive. they should be expertly chosen amongst microbes usually present in food so that their, whose presence in quantities exceeding predetermined levels point to a lack of microbiological integrity of a food product. this may encompass (i) the potential presence of taxonomically, physiologically and ecologically related pathogens, markers are called index organisms; or else (ii) a lack of process integrity; in this case, markers are termed indicator organisms. the classical index organism was e. coli, introduced in the 1980's to monitor drinking water supplies. it is still used as  an appropriate marker to assess the bacteriological safety of raw foods. in the 1920's the coli-aerogenes ("coliform") group was adopted as an indicator to validate the adequate processing, i.e. pasteurization of dairy products. since the 1950's the entire enterobacteriaceae taxon is preferred for the latter purpose because it is better defined in determinative sense and includes more organisms of significance. in some food and water supplies, processed for safety, more vigorous or more resistant organisms than the gram-negative rods are reliable supplementary markers. these include enterococcus spp., spores of the clostridium genus, and bacteriophages of e. coli and bacteroides fragilis mimicking the fate of enteric viruses under particular ecological conditions. population surveys conducted by the authors provided ranges for epsilon-factors.  those factors were defined as the proportion between colony forming units (cfu) numbers of index organisms and the pathogenic agent to whose potential occurrence they are expected to point. epsilon factor values obtained for thermotropic enterobacteriaceae in relation to salmonella spp. allow the calculation of the probability that the pathogen has been reliably eliminated by the processing of initially contaminated raw materials, when cfu's of the marker organisms remain below a reference range previously fixed.

TI  == clostridial infection in children.
AB  == a survey of the isolation of clostridium spp. from 1543 specimens sent to anaerobic microbiology laboratories revealed 113 isolates from 107 specimens (7.0% of all specimens) from 96 children. the isolates comprised 43 (38%) unidentified clostridium spp., 37 (33%) c. perfringens, 13 (12%) c. ramosum, five (4%) c. innocuum, six (5%) c. botulinum, three (3%) c. difficile, two (2%) c. butyricum, and one isolate each of c. bifermentans, c. clostridiiforme, c. limosum and c. paraputrificum. most clostridial isolates were from abscesses (38), peritonitis (26), bacteraemia (10), and chronic otitis media (7). predisposing or underlying conditions were present in 31 (32%) cases. these were  immunodeficiency (12), malignancy (9), diabetes (7), trauma (7), presence of a foreign body (6) and previous surgery (6). the clostridia were the only bacterial isolates in 14 (15%) cases; 82 (85%) cases had mixed infection. the species most  commonly isolated with clostridia were anaerobic cocci (57); bacteroides spp. (b. fragilis group) (50), escherichia coli (22), pigmented prevotella or porphyromonas spp. (18) and fusobacterium spp. (10). most bacteroides and escherichia coli isolates with clostridia were from abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections adjacent to the rectal area; most pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas isolates were from oropharyngeal, pulmonary, and head and neck  sites. antimicrobial therapy was given to all patients, in conjunction with surgical drainage in 34 (35%). only two patients died. these data illustrate the  importance of clostridium spp. in paediatric infections.

AB  == lipopolysaccharides (lps) were extracted from seven bacteroides strains by three  different techniques: the phenol-water (pw), phenol-chloroform-petroleum (pcp) and triton-mg2+ methods. the strains selected included two different b. fragilis  strains, one of which was grown in two different media. yields varied between the strains, growth media and extraction technique, but generally the highest yield by weight was from the pcp method and the lowest from the pw method. the pw method was selected for the greatest amounts of carbohydrate and kdo, and the pcp method for the least. phosphorus levels were more uniform among all extraction methods. protein contamination was found in all bacteroides lps extracts, with extremely low levels in pw-lps and the highest levels in material extracted by the pcp and triton-mg2+ techniques. no protein contamination could be detected after proteinase k treatment. after silver staining lps page profiles showed ladder patterns characteristics of smooth lps for b. vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron and the control escherichia coli o18:k- strains, whereas the other bacteroides strains showed mainly rough and low m(r) material only. the pcp method did not select for high m(r) material in the b. fragilis strains; otherwise the lps profiles for all extraction methods were identical. the biological activities of native and sodium salt form lps were investigated on a weight for weight basis and compared to that of e. coli o18:k- pw-lps. amongst the lps from bacteroides strains, those prepared by the pw method were found to have a significantly higher activity in a galactosamine mouse lethality model, in induction of tnf and the limulus amoebocyte lysate (lal) assay, than lps extracted by the pcp or triton-mg2+ methods. lps from bacteroides strains extracted by the pcp method had consistently low activity in all assays. comparing pw-lps from bacteroides strains with that from e. coli o18:k- in the galactosamine mouse model, the e. coli o18:k- lps was c. 5000-fold more active than the most active bacteroides lps. however, in the lal assay native pw-lps from both the b. fragilis strains, and b. caccae had higher activities (up to 30-fold) than e. coli o18:k- lps, with the pw-lps from the other bacteroides spp. being up to 15-fold less active than the e. coli o18:k- pw-lps. in the tnf induction assay, e. coli o18:k- pw-lps was 4-50-fold more active than bacteroides pw-lps.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == growth conditions influence expression of cell surface hydrophobicity of staphylococci and other wound infection pathogens.
AB  == the initial adhesion of microbes to tissue and solid surfaces can be mediated by  hydrophobic interaction. expression of microbial cell surface hydrophobicity (csh) is influenced by growth conditions, and often best expressed after growth under nutrient-poor conditions, or "starvation". in the present study, the csh of 133 strains of enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, group a streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, peptococcus magnus, and of 8 candida albicans strains was measured by the salt aggregation test after growth on hematin agar in a 5% co2 atmosphere, or under anaerobiosis. cells of all but 8 strains expressed pronounced or moderate csh, i.e., they aggregated in  0.01-2 m ammonium sulfate. when the agar surface was covered by human serum (diluted 1:5) to mimic growth conditions in a wound, 94 strains expressed higher  csh, and 44 strains the same csh as after growth without serum. the csh of 12 strains of different species was measured after growth on blood, hematin and pdm  agar, with or without serum, and in an aerobic or a 5% co2 atmosphere. the highest csh was expressed after growth in 5% co2 with serum, and the lowest growth after on blood agar in aerobic atmosphere. identical results were obtained with native and heat-inactivated (56 c, 20 min) serum. the reduced surface tension obtained in 5% co2, as well as yet unidentified serum factors, promotes expression of csh.

TI  == the enterotoxin of bacteroides fragilis is a metalloprotease.
AB  == during the past decade, strains of bacteroides fragilis that produce an enterotoxin have been implicated in diarrheal disease in animals and humans. the  extracellular enterotoxin has been purified and characterized as a single polypeptide (m(r), approximately 20,000). single specific primer-pcr was used to  clone a portion of the b. fragilis enterotoxin gene. the recombinant protein expressed by the cloned gene fragment reacted with monospecific antibodies to b.  fragilis enterotoxin by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblot analysis. the deduced amino acid sequence revealed a signature zinc-binding consensus motif (hexxhxxgxxh/met-turn) characteristic of metalloproteases termed  metzincins. sequence comparisons showed close identity to matrix metalloproteases (e.g., human fibroblast collagenase) within the zinc-binding and met-turn region. purified enterotoxin contained 1 g-atom of zn2+ per molecule and hydrolyzed gelatin, azocoll, actin, tropomyosin, and fibrinogen. the enterotoxin also underwent autodigestion. the n-terminal amino acid sequences of two autodigestion products were identical to the deduced amino acid sequence of the recombinant enterotoxin and revealed cleavage at cys-leu and ser-leu peptide bonds. gelatinase (type iv collagenase) activity comigrated with the toxin when analyzed by gel fractionation and zymography, indicating that protease activity is due to  the enterotoxin and not to a contaminating protease(s). optimal proteolytic activity occurred at 37 degrees c and ph 6.5. primary proteolytic cleavage sites  in actin were identified, revealing cleavage at gly-met and thr-leu peptide bonds. enzymatic activity was inhibited by metal chelators but not by inhibitors  of other classes of proteases. additionally, cytotoxic activity of the enterotoxin on human carcinoma ht-29 cells was inhibited by acetoxymethyl ester edta. the metalloprotease activity of the enterotoxin suggests a possible mechanism for enterotoxicity and may have additional implications in the study of disease caused by b. fragilis.

TI  == molecular cloning of the leub gene from bacteroides fragilis by functional complementation in escherichia coli.
AB  == clones containing the bacteroides fragilis leub-complementing gene were isolated  by screening of a b. fragilis genomic library constructed in escherichia coli. one recombinant clone, designated pot865, with the smallest dna insert (4.5 kb) could complement three independent leub mutations in e. coli and the leub-complementing determinant in pot865 was localized to a region of 1.5-kb dna. the results of southern blot analysis suggested that a single copy of the cloned  gene was present in the b. fragilis genome. the cloned fragment appeared to contain a sequence that could function as promoter in e. coli and direct the synthesis of a 42-kda protein. these results suggest that the cloned segment contains the structural gene for beta-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (leub).

AB  == biological activities of biapenem, imipenem, and meropenem were compared with respect to permeability into gram-negative bacteria, binding to penicillin-binding proteins (pbps), and hydrolysis by beta-lactamases. permeability for the three carbapenems was similar when measured in serratia marcescens s6 producing a carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase. penetration of the carbapenems was comparable with cephaloridine and faster than piperacillin or the extended spectrum cephalosporin cefotaxime. all the carbapenems bound most strongly to pbp 2 of escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and to pbp 1 of staphylococcus aureus. in addition, biapenem showed strong affinity with pbp 1a of e. coli and pbp 1b of p. aeruginosa. selected serine beta-lactamases, including the extended spectrum plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, hydrolyzed these carbapenems at rates < 0.1% that of cephaloridine. metallo-beta-lactamases  hydrolysed the carbapenems at measurable rates, with enzymes from bacteroides fragilis and xanthomonas maltophilia hydrolyzing biapenem at lower vmax values than meropenem or imipenem. in conclusion, all the carbapenems exhibited good rates of penetration, bound strongly to pbps in both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, and were stable to most group 1 and group 2 serine beta-lactamases, but were hydrolyzed by metallo-beta-lactamases.

AB  == biapenem (l-627), a novel injectable carbapenem antibiotic, was studied with regard to its effect on mice inoculated with four types of bacteria and on the intestinal flora of pediatric patients. l-627 was given i.m., 40 mg/kg once daily for 5 consecutive days, to mice inoculated enterically with four types of bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, and bifidobacterium breve). except for a mild decrease in e. coli, there were no major fluctuations in viable bacterial counts in the feces during the treatment.  five children with bacterial infections (3 boys and 2 girls; ages: 1 month to 7 years and 7 months; body weights 4.62-21.8 kg) were given l-627 at 6.0 to 11.7 mg/kg 3 times daily for 7 to 11 days. among aerobes, although enterobacteriaceae  such as e. coli tended to decrease remarkably in all patients, there was no major change in enterococcus. consequently, total aerobe counts did not change significantly in any patient. among anaerobes, bifidobacterium, bacteroides, and  eubacterium, which are the predominant organisms in infants, decreased remarkably in some patients. one of the patients showed a marked decrease in total anaerobe  count associated with a change in fecal characteristics (diarrhea). glucose nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli or fungi did not become predominant organisms in any patient. recovery from these changes in the intestinal flora was noted promptly after terminating l-627 treatment. l-627 was detected in the feces of 4  patients during treatment. the fecal concentration ranged from 0.24 to 2.22 micrograms/g. clostridium difficile was not detected in any patient. although c.  difficile d-1 antigen was observed in 2 patients, it bore no relationship to fecal properties. the results indicated that l-627 had relatively few effects on  the intestinal flora compared to other new beta-lactam antibiotics.

AB  == the activity of gentamicin is known to be decreased in acidic environments, and both the peritoneum during peritonitis and the interior of abscesses have been shown to be acidic and hypoxic. the activity of beta-lactam antibiotics is felt to be relatively less diminished under the same circumstances. we determined that the minimum inhibitory concentration of gentamicin against one pathogenic strain  of escherichia coli increased eight-fold, to 8 mugm/ml, when testing conditions were changed from normoxic and neutral to hypoxic and acidic, whereas the mic of  aztreonam doubled under the same conditions, to 0.25 mugm/ml. in further experiments in a murine model of mixed escherichia coli/bacteroides fragilis intra-abdominal abscesses, we demonstrated that a combination of aztreonam and clindamycin was superior to a combination of gentamicin and clindamycin in terms  of completely preventing abscess formation (33% vs. 0%) and eliminating escherichia coli from abscesses that did form (100% vs. 61%).

AB  == background: the intestinal barrier properties are impaired during inflammation and sepsis, but the mechanisms behind this are unknown and were therefore investigated during experimental sepsis in rats. methods: the different-sized intestinal absorption markers 51cr-labeled ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) and ovalbumin were gavaged to rats made septic by intra-abdominal bacterial implantation and to sham-operated rats. regional tissue permeability was measured in diffusion chambers, and intestinal transit was evaluated by intestinal accumulation of gavaged 51cr-edta. results: in comparison with the sham-operated  rats, septic rats had higher 51cr-edta levels in blood and urine and showed a prolonged intestinal transit. septic rats also had a lower tissue permeability to both markers in the small intestines but higher permeability to ovalbumin in the  colon. rats receiving morphine to decrease intestinal motility showed similar changes, with a decreased intestinal transit and increased marker absorption. conclusions: the results suggest that the increased intestinal absorption during  sepsis was due to regional permeability changes and prolonged intestinal transit.

TI  == effect of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator on intra-abdominal abscess formation in rats with generalized peritonitis.
AB  == background: during generalized peritonitis, intraabdominal fibrin deposition is stimulated whereas fibrinolytic activity is reduced, which predisposes intra-abdominal abscess formation. we investigated the effects of increasing the  intra-abdominal fibrinolytic activity on abscess formation by intra-abdominal administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-pa). potential side effects, such as bacteremia and bleeding, were also assessed. study design:  a rat model of generalized peritonitis, induced by intraperitoneal injection of sterile feces contaminated with 10(4) cfu per ml escherichia coli (e. coli) and 10(4) cfu per ml bacteroides fragilis, was used. results: rats treated with rt-pa dissolved in methyl hydroxy propyl cellulose (mhpc) gel (0.5 mg per ml), had significantly less intra-abdominal abscesses than rats in the control group, treated with either ringer's lactate solution or mhpc gel alone (p < 0.01). other than e. coli, cultures of abscesses revealed species originating from the intestine, demonstrating bacterial translocation. the mortality rate was significantly higher in the rats treated with rt-pa as compared with rats in the  control group (p < 0.01), which was surprising considering the absence of bacteremia. by challenging the rats with a higher dose of e. coli, early bacteremia was observed in the rats treated with rt-pa, not related to increased  mortality rates. intraabdominal use of rt-pa was not associated with an increased incidence of bleeding events. conclusions: recombinant tissue plasminogen activator prevents abscess formation in rats with generalized peritonitis. however, early bacteremia and increased mortality rates are serious drawbacks of  the intra-abdominal use of rt-pa in this rat model.

TI  == establishment of a microbiologically acceptable daily intake of antimicrobial drug residues.
AB  == a model is presented to calculate the microbiologically acceptable daily intake (adim) of antibiotic residues in food products. the adim calculation is based on  mic values for indicator bacteria escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, bifidobacterium spp. and eubacterium spp., established under gut-like conditions  in an in vitro simulation model. the maximum residue level (mrl) for residues in  food products can be derived from the adim. four phases can be distinguished in this gastro-intestinal simulation model, namely: 1. in vitro determination of the mic for each bacterial strain by a standard method. 2. incorporation of the drug  into food (meat, milk) followed by testing of the stability of the antibiotic under gut-like conditions. 3. adjustment of the 'gastric' fluid to the duodenal situation, inoculation with the test bacteria and anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees c for at least 18 h. 4. mic reading confirmed by counting bacteria growing on specific solidified media. in this study the method for calculation of adim and mrl is given for flumequine as model drug. on the basis of mic50 values  for e. coli strains, a mrl for flumequine of 1.0 microgram/g meat or 0.25 microgram/ml milk was calculated. it is suggested that, depending on the antibacterial spectrum of the antibiotic involved, the adim can be determined with selected indicator bacteria, incubated under simulated gastrointestinal conditions.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from intraabdominal infection and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents].
AB  == bacteria isolated from intraabdominal infections during the period from july 1982 to june 1993 were investigated with regard to their classifications according to  a joint research by 9 university hospitals in japan. the following results were obtained. 1. a total of 971 strains were isolated from 684 out of 597 patients with peritonitis, and 287 strains out of 971 were isolated from postoperative peritonitis. 2. the most predominant organism isolated from patients with acute peritonitis was escherichia coli (28%), followed by bacteroides fragilis group (17%), gram-positive anaerobic cocci (16%), enterococcus spp. (9%) and klebsiella spp. (8%). 3. against e. coli, cefmenoxime, cefuzonam, cefozopran, aztreonam and  carumonam showed mic50 less than 0.05 micrograms/ml. against b. fragilis group, erthromycin, clindamycin, imipenem, lincomycin and latamoxef showed mic50 less than 0.78 micrograms/ml. 4. the most predominant organism isolated from patients  with postoperative peritonitis was enterococcus spp. (20%) and followed by pseudomonas spp. (14%), and staphylococcus spp. (13%), e. coli (9%), enterobacter spp. (8%) and klebsiella spp. (8%). we suggest that cefazolin, cefmetazole, flomoxef, cefmenoxime, cefuzonam, and latamoxef are the first choice agents in empiric therapy for the treatment of acute peritonitis.

TI  == cloning and expression of a cloxacillin-hydrolyzing enzyme and a cephalosporinase from aeromonas sobria aer 14m in escherichia coli: requirement for an e. coli chromosomal mutation for efficient expression of the class d enzyme.
AB  == two beta-lactamase genes, asba1 and asbb1, encoding asba1 and asbb1, respectively, have been cloned from aeromonas sobria aer 14m into escherichia coli. asba1 was expressed at low but detectable levels in all e. coli laboratory  cloning strains tested. asbb1 was expressed well in the e. coli cloning strain dh5 alpha. however, no enzyme activity could be detected from the same clone when placed in e. coli mc1061. ampicillin-resistant mutants of e. coli mc1061 were obtained that expressed high levels of enzymatically active asbb1. four independent mutants were examined. all four mutations mapped to one locus, designated blpa (beta-lactamase permissive). the blpa locus was distinct from other known loci that play a role in beta-lactamase expression, i.e., the two loci that affect expression of the bacteroides fragilis metallo-beta-lactamase and the ampc regulatory genes, ampd, ampe, and ampg. sequence analysis of asba1 and asbb1 revealed that asba1 was a class c beta-lactamase most closely related to the pseudomonas aeruginosa chromosomal cephalosporinase and probably represents the common a. sobria cephalosporinase. asbb1 was a class d enzyme most closely related to the oxacillin-hydrolyzing enzyme oxa-1, with 34% amino acid sequence identity. purified asba1 was a typical cephalosporinase with a substrate profile that reflected high rates of hydrolysis of cephaloridine compared with benzylpenicillin. purified asbb1 showed strong penicillinase activity, with hydrolysis rates for carbenicillin and cloxacillin 2 to 2.5 times that for benzylpenicillin. hydrolysis of imipenem was < or = 1% of that for benzylpenicillin. both clavulanic acid and tazobactam strongly inhibited asbb1, while sulbactam inhibited the asbb1 enzyme less effectively. none of the inhibitors worked well against the asba1 enzyme. the chelators edta and 1,10-o-phenanthroline did not affect the activity of either enzyme. a. sobria aer 14m was found to produce both a group 1 cephalosporinase and a novel group 2d cloxacillin-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase that has been designated here oxa-12.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of sy5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of sy5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. sy5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, clostridium spp., and bacteroides fragilis. against providencia spp., proteus spp., and haemophilus influenzae, sy5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. sy5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. enterococcus faecium, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. the bactericidal activities of sy5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the mics for clinical isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. sy5555  was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. however, sy5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by x. maltophilia (l-1) and p. aeruginosa/pms354 beta-lactamases, two bush group 3 beta-lactamases, sy5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from  c. freundii gn7391 and e. cloacae gn7471 strains. these results suggest that sy5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == cloning and expression of the bacteroides fragilis ych46 neuraminidase gene in escherichia coli and bacteroides uniformis.
AB  == a neuraminidase-encoding gene nanh of bacteroides fragilis strain ych46 was cloned into the cosmid vector phc79. the nanh gene was subcloned from the cosmid  and was located within a 2.2-kb xhoi-kpni fragment. southern hybridization experiments demonstrated that the gene was present as a single copy on the bacterial chromosome. neuraminidase activity expressed in the initial escherichia coli clone was approximately 3600-fold lower than that expressed in b. fragilis ych46. however, when nanh was transferred from e. coli to b. uniformis by mobilization of a shuttle plasmid, the transconjugant expressed 1100-fold higher  activity than the e. coli donor did. these results suggest that modes of nanh expression in e. coli and bacteroides are heterologous.

TI  == the features and aetiology of fournier's gangrene.
AB  == this paper reports a clinical study of 20 cases of gangrenous ulcers of the scrotum and/or of the penis (fournier's gangrene) and a review of previous publications. even though found mostly in elderly male patients, the disease spares no age group and can involve the external genitalia in neonates and women  as well. the disease is a necrotising fasciitis of infective origin and always has a portal of entry of the infecting organisms even though it may be so trivial as to be undetected. the commonest portals of entry of infection are periurethral sepsis, groin wound sepsis, anorectal sepsis, prostatic sepsis and trauma. the infecting organisms comprise both aerobic and anaerobic organisms such as escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, proteus mirabilis, enterococci, bacteroides fragilis and anaerobic streptococcus. fournier's gangrene is probably the same disease as necrotizing fasciitis occurring in other parts of the body, but modified by the peculiar anatomy of the genitoperineum.

TI  == in vitro activity of cp-99,219, a novel 7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl) naphthyridone antimicrobial.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cp-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. cp-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin g and erythromycin (mic90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against s. pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). the activity of cp-99,219 against enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, c.  diversus, helicobacter pylori, and k. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with mic90 values to cp-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for cp-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. cp-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x mic against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented mueller-hinton broths. the spectrum and potency observed with cp-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.

TI  == serum bactericidal activity of ceftriaxone plus metronidazole against common intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == the activity of ceftriaxone plus metronidazole against pathogens usually involved in intra-abdominal infections was studied. metronidazole 1 g and ceftriaxone 1 g  (as the sodium salt) were simultaneously administered i.v. over 30 minutes every  24 hours to 12 healthy volunteers for three doses. serum samples were collected at baseline, just before the last dose, and 12, 16, 20, 22, and 24 hours after the start of infusion of the last dose. serum bactericidal titers (sbts) were performed in duplicate for each serum sample from 12 hours on. serum ceftriaxone  and metronidazole concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, and the elimination rate and half-life were calculated for each antimicrobial in each volunteer. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of  each antibiotic for two strains each of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacteroides fragilis were determined by microdilution. eleven volunteers completed the study. ceftriaxone and metronidazole maintained sbts of at least 1:4. serum ceftriaxone concentrations remained above the mics for e. coli, p. mirabilis, and k. pneumoniae, and serum metronidazole concentrations remained above the mic for b. fragilis throughout the study. ceftriaxone combined with metronidazole resulted in intense and prolonged activity against e. coli, p. mirabilis, k. pneumoniae, and b. fragilis.

TI  == gas gangrene following sacral pressure sores.
AB  == we report two cases of gas gangrene developed from sacral pressure sores. the first case was clostridial and the second, non-clostridial gas gangrene. both patients died within two months. the first patient, a 56-year-old woman suffering from palsy of the lower half of the body for 3 weeks, developed a sacral pressure sore. one month later, crepitus by palpation and gas formation in the x-ray film  were detected in the hip and right thigh. a culture of odoriferous pus yielded clostridium limosum in addition to staphylococcus intermedius, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis. blood culture yielded bacteroides fragilis. the patient died 50 days after admission in spite of surgical debridement and aggressive therapy with high doses of antibiotics and hyperbaric oxygen. the second patient, a 70-year-old man suffering from diabetic  nephropathy, arteriosclerosis obliterans of the lower limbs, and cerebral infarction, developed a large decubitus ulcer covering the whole sacral area. crepitus and gas were detected in the soft tissue of the left gluteal region. almost the entire gluteus maximus muscle was necrotic. bacteroides fragilis, methicillin-resistant or -sensitive staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli were isolated from the muscle. bacteroides fragilis was also obtained by blood culture. the patient died on the 72nd day after admission.

TI  == is1139 from streptococcus salivarius: identification and characterization of an insertion sequence-like element related to mobile dna elements from gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == an insertion sequence-like element, is1139, was cloned and sequenced from streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 chromosome. this insertion sequence-like element is 1168 bp long and is delimited by inverted repeats of 29 bp and by a duplicated sequence of 6 bp. this is possesses an open reading frame that codes for a putative transposase of 339 amino acids which has, respectively, 94, 35, 33, and 30% amino-acid identity with the transposases of is1161 from s. salivarius atcc 25975, is4351 from bacteroides fragilis, is30 from escherichia coli, and is1086 from alcaligenes eutrophus. sequence analysis revealed that these transposases may have evolved from a common ancestral gene. southern hybridization of restriction endonuclease-digested genomic dna from 21 strains of oral streptococci, using a probe specific to the transposase-encoding gene (tnpa), revealed that is1139 is found in two strains of s. salivarius, atcc 25975 and atcc 13419, in eight and two copies, respectively.

TI  == in-vitro activity of four new fluoroquinolones.
AB  == the in-vitro activities of four new fluoroquinolones, e-4749, e-4874, e-4884 and  e-4904, were compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 1106 clinical isolates. against majority of enterobacteriaceae, general antibacterial  activities of e-4749 (mic90s 0.06-1 mg/l), e-4874 (mic90s, 0.03-0.25 mg/l) and e-4884 (mic90s 0.01-0.5 mg/l) were comparable or slightly lower than those of ciproloxacin (mic90s 0.01-0.25 mg/l) and sparfloxacin (mic90s 0.01-1 mg/l). the activity of e-4904 (mic90s 0.06-2 mg/l) was lower than those of its analogues. most of the escherichia coli which were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mic > or = 2  mg/l) and serratia spp., were resistant to the new fluoroquinolones. beta-lactamase producing strains of moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible to these compounds (mics < or = 0.008 mg/l). most of pseudomonas aeruginosa, non-aeruginosa pseudomonas spp., xanthomonas maltophilia, and acinetobacter spp.  were resistant to the new quinolones (mic90s 8- > 16 mg/l). on the contrary, these new antimicrobials were active against the majority of the aeromonas spp. (mic90s < or = 0.5 mg/l). e-4749, e-4874, e-4884 and e-4904 remained active (mic90s < or = 0.25 mg/l) against staphylococcus aureus strains susceptible to methicillin. however, its activity was two- to eight-fold lower than that of ciprofloxacin (mic90 0.03 mg/l) and sparfloxacin (mic90 0.06 mg/l). against s. aureus resistant to methicillin or ciprofloxacin, activity of these new compounds and comparators agents, was very low (mic90s 2- > 16 mg/l). most of the strains of enterococcus faecalis were resistant (mic90s > 16 mg/l). the activity of e-4874, e-4904 and sparfloxacin (mic90 1 mg/l for each one) was higher than that  of the rest of the agents tested. e-4874 (mic90 0.25 mg/l) was four-fold more active than the other antibacterials tested (mic90 2 mg/l) against listeria monocytogenes. no new quinolone was active against bacteroides fragilis (mic90s 4-16 mg/l), bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (mic90s 8- > 16 mg/l), and other b. fragilis group (mic90s 16- > 16 mg/l). ciprofloxacin (mic90s > 16 mg/l), and sparfloxacin (mic90s 8-16 mg/l) also were inactive. e-4874 (mic90 4 mg/l) was the most active quinolone tested against b.fragilis.

TI  == the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis. a prospective study using ultrasound-guided transthoracic needle aspiration.
AB  == obstructive pneumonitis, the opacity that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion or external compression, is actually a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucus plugging, and true parenchymal inflammation. in the majority of cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether infection is present or not from the radiographic findings alone. the aim of this study was to evaluate the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis and the influence of this result on the treatment of patients. from march 1992 to february 1993, 26 consecutive patients (20 men and six women) with obstructive pneumonitis were investigated. the obstructive pneumonitis had been caused by malignant tumors in 24 and benign lesions in two. chest ultrasound (us) and us-guided percutaneous transthoracic aspirations were undergone to obtain specimens for microbiologic examination. microorganisms were isolated from seven  of nine febrile patients and two of 17 nonfebrile patients. a total of 16 bacterial strains are detected in obstructive pneumonitis (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, viridant streptococci, bacteroides fragilis, two peptostreptococcus species, mycobacterium tuberculosis, pseudomonas maltophilia, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides thetaiotamomicrons, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides species, veillonella species, aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and escherichia coli). in five cases the  isolates were monobacteriae, and in the remaining four cases, cultures yielded more than one bacteria. the results of aspirate cultures led to changes in the initial antibiotic trial in seven of nine patients, and fever subsided thereafter. pneumothorax occurred in one cases as the sole complication. the pathogen causing obstructive pneumonitis is very heterogeneous, and polymicrobial infection is common.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == antibiotic treatment of anaerobic infections.
AB  == the discovery of effective antimicrobial drugs has substantially improved the therapeutic outlook for patients with anaerobic infections. in addition, the pathophysiology of anaerobic infections has been elucidated by comparative antibiotic trials and the use of antibiotic probes in experimental animal models. facultative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, are responsible for acute peritonitis and sepsis associated with bowel perforation. anaerobes, particularly bacteroides fragilis, play the seminal role in subsequent abscess formation. treatment of only the facultative bacteria, without adequate antibiotic coverage  for anaerobic bacteria, leads to clinical failures with complications of abscess  formation. such therapeutic misadventures have been witnessed in the treatment of mixed infections with cephalosporins and penicillins that lack significant activity against anaerobes. similarly, use of metronidazole or clindamycin as a single agent is associated with failures caused by infection with facultative bacteria. mixed infections involve complex interactions between facultative bacteria and strict anaerobes, many of which possess intrinsic pathogenicity. the best therapeutic results are realized with antimicrobial drugs that are active against both types of microorganisms.

TI  == investigation of the potential role of enterococcus faecalis in the pathophysiology of experimental peritonitis.
AB  == two nonfatal models of peritonitis differing by the duration and the severity of  the disease were studied in rats by implantation of escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis with or without increasing concentrations of enterococcus faecalis. results were evaluated at 3 or 6 days after inoculation. the highest enterococcal concentrations (10(9) cfu/ml) enhanced the severity of the infection, evident by increased emaciation, increased peritoneal counts of e. coli and b. fragilis, and increased frequency of e. coli and b. fragilis bacteremia compared with enterococcus-free animals. six therapeutic regimens (low-dose amoxicillin + low-dose gentamicin, high-dose amoxicillin + high-dose gentamicin, pefloxacin, ornidazole, pefloxacin + ornidazole, imipenem + gentamicin) were tested. all treatments failed to eradicate e. faecalis except the combination pefloxacin + ornidazole, which achieved a significant reduction of local bacterial counts and suppressed bacteremia. enterococcus played an important role in the mechanisms of bacterial synergy in experimental peritonitis. however, eradication of enterococcus did not seem possible by conventional antienterococcal therapy.

TI  == peritoneal cultures and antibiotic therapy in pediatric perforated appendicitis.
AB  == we retrospectively reviewed 70 cases of perforated appendicitis in children to examine the relationship between postoperative antibiotic selection and culture results from the peritoneal cavity. initial antibiotic therapy chosen for the children consisted of a three-drug combination in 54 (77%) patients. peritoneal cultures were performed in 58 (83%) patients. escherichia coli and bacteriodes fragilis were the most common bacterial isolates from the peritoneal culture. only 7 (10%) patients had their antibiotic regimen changed after the culture results were available, of which 2 changes brought drug therapy into compliance with the cultures and 5 changes were inappropriate with respect to the peritoneal cultures. of the remaining 51 patients with culture data available, 39 should have had changes to bring the antibiotic therapy into compliance with the observed culture results. these data indicate that surgeons select antibiotic therapy for perforated appendicitis in children based on assumptions of which organisms should be present in the infection and not on culture data. there appears to be no clinical usefulness to the routine culturing of the peritoneal cavity in children with perforated appendicitis.

TI  == fusobacterial infections in children.
AB  == a total of 243 strains of fusobacteria species was recovered from 226 of 1399 (16%) specimens obtained from 213 children. the strains included 65 (27%) fusobacterium sp., 144 (59%) fusobacterium nucleatum, 25 (10%) fusobacterium necrophorum, five (2%) fusobacterium varium, three (1%) fusobacterium mortiferum, and one (0.4%) fusobacterium gonidiaformans. most fusobacteria species were recovered from patients with abscesses (100), aspiration pneumonia (24), paronychia (15), bites (14), chronic sinusitis (ten), chronic otitis media (nine), and osteomyelitis (eight). predisposing conditions were noted in 32 (15%) of the cases. these included immunodeficiency in nine (4%), steroid therapy in eight (4%), previous surgery in six (3%), diabetes in six (3%) and malignant neoplasms in five (2%). fusobacteria sp. was the only isolate in 16 (8%) instances while mixed infections were encountered in 197 (92%) patients. the organisms most commonly isolated with fusobacteria sp. were anaerobic cocci (155), pigmented prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp. (95), bacteroides fragilis  group (80), escherichia coli (43) and bacteroides sp. (39). most strains of b. fragilis group and e. coli were recovered from intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections proximal to the rectal area. most pigmented prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp. were recovered from oropharyngeal and pulmonary sites and from sites around the head and neck. antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients; surgical drainage was performed in 85 (40%). all patients, except two who died, recovered. these findings illustrate the prevalence of fusobacteria sp. associated with infections in children.

TI  == a new type of glutamine synthetase in cyanobacteria: the protein encoded by the glnn gene supports nitrogen assimilation in synechocystis sp. strain pcc 6803.
AB  == a new glutamine synthetase gene, glnn, which encodes a polypeptide of 724 amino acid residues (m(r), 79,416), has been identified in the unicellular cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. strain pcc 6803; this is the second gene that encodes a glutamine synthetase (gs) in this cyanobacterium. the functionality of  this gene was evidenced by its ability to complement an escherichia coli glna mutant and to support synechocystis growth in a strain whose glna gene was inactivated by insertional mutagenesis. in this mutant (strain sjcr3), as well as in the wild-type strain, the second gs activity was subject to regulation by the  nitrogen source, being strongly enhanced in nitrogen-free medium. transcriptional fusion of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene with the 5'-upstream region of glnn suggested that synthesis of the second synechocystis gs is regulated at the transcriptional level. furthermore, the level of glnn mrna, a transcript of about 2,300 bases, was found to be strongly increased in nitrogen-free medium. the glnn product is similar to the gs subunits of bacteroides fragilis and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, two obligate anaerobic bacteria whose gss are markedly different from other prokaryotic and eukaryotic gss. however, significant similarity is evident in the five regions which are homologous in all of the gss so far described. the new gs gene was also found in  other cyanobacteria but not in n2-fixing filamentous species.

TI  == piperacillin and tazobactam versus clindamycin and gentamicin in the treatment of hospitalized women with pelvic infection. the piperacillin/tazobactam study group.
AB  == objective: to compare the efficacy and safety of a combination of piperacillin and tazobactam with that of clindamycin and gentamicin in the treatment of hospitalized women with infections of the upper genital tract. methods: this was  a randomized open-label trial in hospitalized women with infections of the upper  genital tract. patients were recruited at 12 hospitals in the united states and two hospitals in canada and were randomly assigned to one of two regimens in a 2:1 ratio. one group received piperacillin, 3 g every 6 hours, and tazobactam, 375 mg every 6 hours; the other group received clindamycin, 900 mg every 8 hours, and gentamicin, 2.5-5.0 mg/kg/day in three divided doses. therapy with the assigned regimen was to be administered for a minimum of 3 days. cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained from the site of infection before initiation of therapy. cultures for chlamydia trachomatis were also obtained from patients with endometritis or pelvic inflammatory disease. subjects were evaluated for clinical and bacteriologic response at 24-72 hours and 2-4 weeks after completing therapy. results: two hundred ninety-nine patients were enrolled; 196 were in the piperacillin-tazobactam group and 103 were in the clindamycin-gentamicin group. the most common diagnoses were endometritis (146) and pelvic inflammatory disease (115). the most common microorganisms recovered included: peptostreptococcus sp (99), prevotella sp (87), black pigmented bacteroides (29), b fragilis (11), enterococci (64), group b streptococcus (26),  escherichia coli (31), neisseria gonorrhoeae (49), and c trachomatis (19). a favorable clinical response occurred in 84.7% (166 of 196) of piperacillin-tazobactam patients and 87.3% (90 of 103) of clindamycin-gentamicin  patients. among those evaluable for bacteriologic response, 78% (67 of 86) and 82% (23 of 28), respectively, had a favorable response. diarrhea occurred significantly more frequently in the piperacillin-tazobactam group (9.7 versus 2.9%; p = .04), but the majority of episodes were mild to moderate. none of the adverse experiences in either treatment group were considered life-threatening and drug-related. conclusion: the combination of piperacillin and tazobactam is an effective and well-tolerated antibiotic regimen for the treatment of infections of the upper genital tract in women.

TI  == activity of fleroxacin alone and in combination with clindamycin or metronidazole in experimental intra-abdominal abscesses.
AB  == to assess the potential efficacy of fleroxacin in combination with clindamycin or metronidazole in mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections, we used a rat model of intra-abdominal abscesses in which the inoculum consisted of pooled rat feces mixed with baso4. two hours after bacterial challenge, antimicrobial therapy was  begun intravenously with regimens designed to stimulate human pharmacokinetics. a combination of clindamycin and gentamicin was included as an established treatment regimen. after 8.5 days of therapy, final bacterial counts in abscesses showed that fleroxacin alone or combined with metronidazole or clindamycin effectively eradicated escherichia coli, with bacterial densities of < or = 2.84  +/- 0.1, < or = 2.9 +/- 0.1, and < or = 2.9 +/- 0.1 (mean +/- standard error of the mean) log10 cfu/g, respectively. the addition of either clindamycin or metronidazole to fleroxacin substantially enhanced the effectiveness of the regimens against bacteroides fragilis, with bacterial counts of < or = 3.0 +/- 0.1 or < or = 2.9 +/- 0.1 log10 cfu/g, respectively, versus 9.2 +/- 0.2 log10 cfu/g for fleroxacin alone. the combination of metronidazole and fleroxacin also  resulted in a significantly greater reduction of peptostreptococci and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron than fleroxacin alone (< or = 2.9 +/- 0.1 versus 6.1 +/- 0.9 log10 cfu/g and 3.3 +/- 0.4 versus 8.3 +/- 0.1 log10 cfu/g, respectively). except for those of b. fragilis, counts of other anaerobes were reduced to a greater extent by metronidazole plus fleroxacin than by clindamycin  plus fleroxacin, although differences were not always significant. metronidazole  plus fleroxacin was at least as active a clindamycin plus gentamicin against all  species and was significantly more active against clostridium spp. no regimen effectively eradicated enterococci from the abscesses. these results suggest that the addition of either metronidazole or clindamycin would effectively enhance the spectrum of fleroxacin for treatment of mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections.

TI  == the treatment of irradiated mice with polymicrobial infection caused by bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli.
AB  == the effects on the faecal flora and the efficacies of various antibiotic regimens administered as treatment for a mixed infection caused by bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli in the irradiated host were investigated in a subcutaneous abscess model with c3h/hen mice which had been exposed to 60co. the regimens used included imipenem, ofloxacin, metronidazole and the combination of ofloxacin and  metronidazole. the incidence of mortality associated with each regimen was as follows: 2 of 20 (10%) mice treated with ofloxacin; 16 of 20 (80%) given metronidazole (p < 0.05 compared with ofloxacin); 8 of 20 (40%) given imipenem (p < 0.05 compared with ofloxacin); 5 of 20 (25%) given the combination of ofloxacin and metronidazole (p = ns compared with ofloxacin); and 15 of 20 (75%) controls given a placebo (p < 0.05 compared with ofloxacin). compared with the control group, the mean number of lactose-fermenting facultative anaerobes in the faeces  of irradiated mice decreased significantly during treatment with either ofloxacin or ofloxacin combined with metronidazole; rose significantly from day 6 during treatment with metronidazole and was similar during treatment with imipenem. the  numbers of strict anaerobes fell with all regimens (including the placebo) but, compared with the control group, were significantly higher in the ofloxacin and imipenem groups and significantly lower in the groups which received metronidazole (with or without ofloxacin). imipenem and the combination of ofloxacin and metronidazole led to significant reductions in the numbers of cfu of both e. coli and b. fragilis in the abscesses compared with the placebo; ofloxacin alone caused a reduction in the number of cfu of e. coli only and metronidazole alone caused a reduction in the number of cfu of b. fragilis only.  while the administration of metronidazole had a favourable effect on the b. fragilis component of the localized infection, there was a higher incidence of mortality with this agent, probably because it led to an increase in the number of enterobacteriaceae in the faeces at the expense of a reduction in the number of strict anaerobes. antimicrobial agents such as imipenem or the combination of  a quinolone, such as ofloxacin, and metronidazole may be used successfully to treat localized infections in the irradiated host while avoiding potentially deleterious increases in the number of facultative anaerobes in the bowel.

TI  == diltiazem and superoxide dismutase modulate hepatic acute phase response in gram-negative sepsis.
AB  == this study assessed the hepatic acute phase response and cellular ca2+ regulation in septic animals and in hepatoma cell lines in vitro. sepsis was induced in male sprague-dawley rats by implanting in their abdominal cavities fecal pellets impregnated with live escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis. 8 h after implantations, rats were treated with diltiazem (1.2 mg/kg) or superoxide dismutase (sod) (5 x 10(3) units/kg). after 24 h, plasma acute phase proteins (app) were determined by immunoelectrophoresis, and hepatic app-mrnas by northern blot hybridization. effects of diltiazem, verapamil, or sod on hepatic cells were determined in rat reuber h-35 and human hepg2 hepatoma cells. sepsis induced a significant increase in plasma app and their hepatic mrnas. diltiazem and sod reduced the sepsis-induced elevations in plasma lactate, the febrile response and mortality. app expression in h-35 and hepg2 cells, stimulated by interleukin 1 (il-1), il-6, and dexamethasone, was inhibited by diltiazem or verapamil but not  sod. the results suggest that a heightened hepatic app response in septic animals accompanies systemic/metabolic derangements and a significant animal mortality. because diltiazem was previously shown to prevent sepsis-related disturbances in  hepatic cellular ca2+ regulation, its mediation of decrease in app, systemic/metabolic response, and mortality may be effected through modifications  in cellular ca2+ regulation. the data from hepatoma cells show an attenuation of  the aap can result from direct effects of a calcium blocker. however, whether the blocker primarily modifies cellular ca2+ regulation and secondarily effects app gene expression, or directly effects gene expression remains unknown.

TI  == molecular characterization of an enterobacterial metallo beta-lactamase found in  a clinical isolate of serratia marcescens that shows imipenem resistance.
AB  == a clinical isolate of serratia marcescens (tn9106) produced a metallo beta-lactamase (imp-1) which conferred resistance to imipenem and broad-spectrum  beta-lactams. the blaimp gene providing imipenem resistance was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli hb101. the imp-1 was purified from e. coli hb101 that harbors psmbnu24 carrying blaimp, and its apparent molecular mass was calculated to be about 30 kda by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. kinetic studies of imp-1 against various beta-lactams revealed that this enzyme hydrolyzes not only various broad-spectrum beta-lactams but also carbapenems. however, aztreonam was relatively stable against imp-1. although clavulanate or cloxacillin failed to inhibit imp-1, hg2+, fe2+, or cu2+ blocked the enzyme's activity. moreover, the presence of edta in the reaction buffer resulted in a decrease in the enzyme's activity. carbapenem resistance was not transferred from s. marcescens tn9106 to e. coli csh2 by conjugation. a hybridization study confirmed that blaimp was encoded on the chromosome of s. marcescens tn9106. by nucleotide sequencing analysis, blaimp was found to encode  a protein of 246 amino acid residues and was shown to have considerable homology  to the metallo beta-lactamase genes of bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, and aeromonas hydrophila. the g+c content of blaimp was 39.4%. four consensus amino acid residues, his-95, his-97, cys-176, and his-215, which form putative zinc ligands, were conserved in the deduced amino acid sequence of imp-1. by determination of the amino acid sequence at the n terminus of purified mature imp-1, 18 amino acid residues were found to be processed from the n terminus of the premature enzyme as a signal peptide. these results clearly show that imp-1 is an enterobacterial metallo beta-lactamase, of which the primary structure has  been completely determined, that confers resistance to carbapenems and other broad-spectrum beta-lactams.

TI  == effect of escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide on bacteroides fragilis abscess formation and mortality in mice.
AB  == to study the mechanism of synergism between bacteroides fragilis and escherichia  coli, the effect of sublethal dose of e. coli lipopolysaccharide (lps) (25 micrograms/mouse) was checked on b. fragilis abscess formation. lps was administered prior or after inoculum injection. no significant difference in the  abscess size was observed at necropsy on day 6. however, all the groups receiving lps showed higher incidence of recovery of additional intestinal bacteria (23.5-45.5%) from the abscess pus. when lps was given 4 hr prior to inoculum administration, 83-100% mortality was observed. detailed investigation showed autoclaved cecal contents alone could also cause similar mortality. studies with  stimulation of endogenous cytokines by e. coli lps demonstrated induction of all  of them within 3 hr in the blood stream with tnf-alpha demonstrating peak at 1 hr, il-1 alpha and il-6 at 4 hr and ifn-gamma between 6-9 hr with moderately high levels at 4 hr. this e. coli lps-triggered cytokine cascade possibly gets further stimulated by injection of autoclaved cecal contents containing high concentration of endotoxins (1.6 x 10(5) eu/ml) contributed by dead bacteria and  lead to the mortality of animals.

TI  == sepsis-induced myofibrillar protein catabolism in rat skeletal muscle.
AB  == this study evaluated sepsis-induced changes in myosin heavy chain (mhc) protein breakdown and synthesis in rat soleus muscles. rats were anesthetized and their external jugular veins were cannulated. after 12-16 h, rats were implanted intraabdominally with a sterile fecal pellet, or a pellet containing bacteria (escherichia coli, 150 cfu and bacteroides fragilis 10(4) cfu). thirty hours after implantations, rats were infused with 14c-leu (60 x 10(3) bq/h) through the jugular cannula for 4 h. protein fractional synthetic rate coefficient (fsrc) was determined in muscles of different rat groups. in separate experiments, intact soleus muscles were removed from the three rat groups on days 1 and 2 after implantations, and processed for their wet weight, total protein and mhc contents. no mortality occurred in sterile-implanted rats. approximately 40-45% of all septic-implanted rats died on days 1-3, post-implantation. whereas an approximately 15% (p < 0.01, days 1 or 2) decrease occurred in mhc content in sterile-implanted rats compared to unoperated controls, septic insult resulted in a greater mhc loss (a 27% decrease, p < 0.001). rats' body weight, soleus wet weight and tolat muscle protein changes with sepsis relative to controls were also greater than in the sterile groups. the fsrc value in the septic-implanted rats was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than in non-septic rat muscle. tnf-alpha  administration to the septic animals or their treatment with diltiazem did not have a significant effect on fsrc. overall, these results indicate myosin as a major muscle protein subjected to net catabolism during sepsis, and that the net  catabolic response was related to a more pronounced increased in mhc degradation  than the decrease in mhc synthesis.

TI  == effect of different combinations of antibiotics on experimental septic peritonitis in rabbits.
AB  == this study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of different combinations of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of experimental septic peritonitis. two hundred rabbits, divided into ten groups of 20 rabbits each, were used. septic peritonitis was provoked in two stages: treatment of animals by mechanical lavage or antibiotics was performed during the first stage; blood cultures, isolation and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the peritoneal cavity were performed during the second stage. the parameters assessed were survival and, in the second phase, the formation of peritoneal abscesses. the most significant finding was noted in the first phase, where diffuse peritonitis took  place, with a very high mortality rate due to bacteremia and sepsis. in both blood and pus from the peritoneal cavity cultures in all groups, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis (among the aerobes) and bacteroides fragilis, clostridium sp. and peptostreptococcus sp. (among anaerobes) were the predominant pathogens identified. high mortality rates appeared to be due to the aerobic microbes, particularly escherichia coli, whereas abscess formation was related to the anaerobes, particularly bacteroides  fragilis. all antibiotics tested were effective, whether alone or in combination. metronidazole, however, was the most effective in the reduction of intraabdominal abscesses. the lowest mortality rate was observed in animals injected with piperacillin and a combination of cefoxitin and an aminoglycoside with metronidazole. finally, good peritoneal lavage seemed to be as effective as any combination of antibiotic treatment.

AB  == bacteroides fragilis cs30 is a clinical isolate resistant to high concentrations  of benzylpenicillin and cephaloridine but not to cephamycin or penem antibiotics. beta-lactam resistance is mediated by a chromosomally encoded cephalosporinase produced at a high level. the gene encoding this beta-lactamase was cloned from genomic libraries constructed in escherichia coli and then mated with b. fragilis 638 for identification of ampicillin-resistant (apr) strains. apr transconjugants contained a nitrocefin-reactive protein with the physical and enzymatic properties of the original cs30 isolate. the beta-lactamase gene (cepa) was localized by deletion analysis and subcloned, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. the 903-bp cepa open reading frame encoded a 300-amino-acid precursor protein (predicted molecular mass, 34,070 da). a beta-lactamase-deficient mutant  strain of b. fragilis 638 was constructed by insertional inactivation with the cepa gene of cs30, demonstrating strict functional homology between these chromosomal beta-lactamase genes. an extensive comparison of the cepa protein sequence by alignment with other beta-lactamases revealed the strict conservation of at least four elements common to ambler class a. a further comparison of the cepa protein sequence with protein sequences of beta-lactamases from two other bacteroides species indicated that they constitute their own distinct subgroup of class a beta-lactamases.

TI  == outcome of intra-abdominal infection in pigs depends more on host responses than  on microbiology.
AB  == objective: to assess the effects of mortality of the presence and proliferation of bacteria, and the host's response to infection, in pigs with peritonitis. design: laboratory study. setting: university hospital. material: 71 swedish landrace pigs, 63 with peritonitis and 8 without (controls). interventions: induction of peritonitis by intraperitoneal infusion of equal amounts of escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis (10(9) to 10(11) bacteria/animal); sterile faeces were added in half the experiments. main outcome measures: microbiological events were quantified as the area under the bacterial concentration curve from 0-6 hours. host responses were quantified with a score of 8 physiological variables measured between 4-6 hours after the induction of peritonitis. results: of the 63 infected animals, 37 (59%) died within 6-24 hours and both the physiological response and the bacterial load were significantly higher in those that died. logistic regression analysis with death as the dependent variable showed that the physiology score carried more predictive information than the quantification of bacterial load. conclusion: the quantification of local events within the abdomen is of only limited predictive value compared with the extent of the physiological alterations.

TI  == the effect of cytokines on bactericidal activity of murine neutrophils.
AB  == a range of recombinant cytokines have now been shown to modify aspects of the phenotype and function of human and murine neutrophils. however, few reports describe modification of the bactericidal activity of neutrophils. we therefore examined the recombinant murine cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha, 10-1000 ng ml-1) and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (gm-csf, 10-1000 u ml-1) for their ability to increase the bacterial killing capacity of murine neutrophils. neutrophils from either bone marrow (fresh or cultured), or peritoneal exudates, or abscesses, were pre-incubated with either cytokine for 30-60 min and the killing of proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, or bacteroides  fragilis was examined in the presence or absence of serum over a 90 min period. only for one combination was a small but significantly enhanced level of bacterial killing observed, the phagocytic killing of p. mirabilis by peritoneal  exudate neutrophils in the presence of gm-csf and serum. with this exception there was no enhancement of bacterial killing for the range of combinations of neutrophils and bacterial species tested. in contrast, at the concentrations tested for effect on bactericidal activity, tnf-alpha and gm-csf were able to significantly upregulate cr3 (but not fc gamma rii) expression on mouse neutrophils. these results indicate that upregulation of cr3 as an index of neutrophil activation does not necessarily correlate with increased bactericidal  activity.

AB  == minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for polymyxin b (pl-b),  gentamicin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin against clinically isolated microbial strains collected since november 1992, and the following conclusions were obtained: 1. judging from the mic distribution of pl-b against the studied strains including multi-drug resistant organisms of major strains of family enterobacteriaceae, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa, it appeared that no pl-b resistant strains were detected among those gram-negative organisms within the antimicrobial spectrum of pl-b. 2. mics of pl-b against most strains including methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci were distributed between 100 and 800 micrograms/ml. these results supported reports of other investigators that the eradication of staphylococcus spp. including mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) was possible by the use of pl-b at 1 mg/ml. 3.  mic distribution of pl-b against organisms of the bacteroides fragilis group was  almost the same as the results described above.

TI  == regional and systemic immune responses in a murine model of empyema.
AB  == the extent to which circulating leukocytes reflect functional capacity at the site of infection is unclear despite a century of debate. we conducted experiments designed to clarify those relationships as well as the relationship of pleural and peritoneal responses to infection. empyema was established in inbred cba/j mice by introducing escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis into the thoracic cavity through a limited thoracotomy. walled off abscesses appeared  seven days after the introduction of infection. cell surface expression of murine class ii major histocompatibility antigen was measured in peripheral leukocytes,  thoracic and peritoneal cavity exudate leukocytes and abscess cells for 60 days after the introduction of infection. the peripheral antibody response was determined by measuring immunoglobulin m (igm) and immunoglobulin g (igg) specific for the two organisms. the results demonstrated that, after introduction of infection into the thoracic cavity, mice mounted a specific systemic humoral immune response by producing igm and igg. there was a pronounced concomitant cellular response in thoracic and peritoneal cavity exudate cells. however, there was no evidence of a systemic cellular response in circulating lymphocytes or monocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes measured as a single group. we conclude from these experiments that measurements of peripheral immune parameters may adequately reveal the humoral response to infection, but it does not reflect  the local immune cellular response. furthermore, a special relationship exists between the peritoneal and the thoracic cavities, whereby an inflammatory process in the thoracic cavity leads to a marked activation of inflammatory process in the peritoneal cavity without affecting peripheral circulating cells to the same  extent.

TI  == characterization of a "mobilization cassette" in transposon tn4399 from bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == derivatives of nonconjugal plasmids that carry tn4399, a transposon isolated from bacteroides fragilis, can be mobilized for transfer by the broad-host-range incp  plasmids prk231 or r751 in escherichia coli. to characterize regions of tn4399 involved in mobilization, we have isolated and analyzed subcloned fragments of tn4399 in e. coli, as well as mutations within the element. we have identified a  "mobilization cassette" within a 2.8-kb region of tn4399 which, when cloned into  mobilization-deficient plasmids, allows these plasmids to be mobilized in trans by the incp plasmids prk231 and r751. the 2.8-kb region has been sequenced, and several open reading frames have been identified. mutants defective in two genes, designated moca and mocb, coding for deduced products of 36.4 and 16.4 kda, respectively, cannot be mobilized by either incp plasmid; these mutants can be complemented in the presence of the respective wild-type genes in trans. this suggests that the putative moca and mocb proteins have a role in the mobilization process. the 36.4-kda moca protein contains a 14-amino-acid sequence which is closely related to a highly conserved motif within dna relaxases encoded by a wide variety of conjugal or mobilizable plasmids. subcloning experiments also lead to the localization of an orit region within a 199-bp fragment, internal to  the mobilization cassette.

TI  == quantitative cultures of the mucosal-associated bacteria in the mechanically prepared colon and rectum.
AB  == little is known about the mucosal microflora of the colon and rectum at the time  of elective surgery. our objective was to determine the concentrations of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria associated with the mucosa of the mechanically prepared large bowel. ten patients were studied after a standard polyethylene glycol-electrolyte lavage preparation. no patient had taken antibiotics in the preceding four weeks. sterile wire brushes passed through the colonoscope during  advancement were used to culture the rectal, transverse colon, and cecal mucosa.  total anaerobic, aerobic, gram-positive, and enteric bacterial counts were determined along with specific cultures for bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus, and staphylococcus species. the results showed that there was a significant increase  (p < 0.01) in aerobes, anaerobes, enterics, gram positives, b. fragilis, and e. coli mucosal counts with proximal progression. aerobes showed a steady gradient,  while anaerobes demonstrated an increase from the rectum to the transverse colon  but no change between the transverse colon and cecum. we conclude that, in the prepared bowel, there is an increase in the mucosal bacterial counts in the more  proximal portions of the bowel. the results may serve as a baseline for future studies on the mucosal-associated bacteria of the large intestine.

TI  == comparative efficacy of ceftriaxone in experimental infections involving bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli.
AB  == the in vivo activity of ceftriaxone was examined in an experimentally induced subcutaneous infection involving bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli. mice  were challenged with 1 of 10 strains of b. fragilis or e. coli, or a dual combination of the two species. the efficacy was measured by a reduction in the count of viable organisms when antimicrobial treatment was initiated 1 h after challenge and continued for 5 days. ceftriaxone exhibited impressive activity against e. coli but showed poor in vivo activity versus b. fragilis. the antimicrobial activity of ceftriaxone was influenced by the microbial interaction in our dual-isolate model. pharmacokinetic studies showed that ceftriaxone penetrated into abscesses and achieved peak levels of about 40% of the peak serum levels. however, in abscesses infected with b. fragilis nearly all biological activity of ceftriaxone was lost.

TI  == ex vivo pharmacodynamic study of piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam, compared with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid.
AB  == ten volunteers received piperacillin (4 g), piperacillin (4 g) plus tazobactam (0.5 g) (tazocin), and ticarcillin (3 g) plus clavulanic acid (0.2 g) (timentin)  intravenously over 30 min in a cross-over blinded scheme. blood samples were obtained 0.5 and 3 h after the end of infusion to measure by (high-pressure liquid chromatography) the concentration and bactericidal titers against 70 gram-negative bacilli. serum time-kill curves were done against 35 strains to measure killing rates and area under the time-kill curve. using the measure of serum bactericidal activity, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid and piperacillin-tazobactam were equally effective against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and bacteroides fragilis. piperacillin-tazobactam was superior to ticarcillin-clavulanic acid against piperacillin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae (4 to 16 times) and s. marcescens (2 to 4 times). by using the area under the time-kill curve, piperacillin-tazobactam was equivalent to ticarcillin-clavulanic acid against piperacillin-susceptible strains; piperacillin-tazobactam was significantly more  active than piperacillin against piperacillin-resistant strains and was more active than ticarcillin-clavulanic acid when the sample obtained 3 h after the end of infusion to volunteers was considered. serum piperacillin concentrations (mean +/- standard error of the mean; in mg/liter) were 115 +/- 13 at 0.5 h and 7.4 +/- 1.4 at 3 h after the administration of piperacillin alone and 105.5 +/- 12.6 (0.5 h) and 7.7 +/- 1.6 after the administration of piperacillin-tazobactam. serum tazobactam concentrations (in milligram per liter) were 13.1 +/- 1.4 at 0.5 h and 1.2 +/- 0.2 at 3 h. the piperacillin-tazobactam ratio was 8 +/- 0.3 at 0.5  h and 6.2 +/- 0.5 at 3 h. piperacillin-tazobactam appears promising against beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == distribution of free and liposome-encapsulated cefoxitin in experimental intra-abdominal sepsis in rats.
AB  == the distributions of radiolabelled free cefoxitin (fc) and liposome-encapsulated  cefoxitin (lc) were compared in an animal model of intra-abdominal sepsis. intraperitoneally administered lc was initially retained in the peritoneal cavity with subsequent preferential drug targeting to the liver (14% injected lc) and spleen (6% injected lc) by 3 h post-injection. differing patterns of liposomal drug and lipid retention indicated that drug release from the liposome complex occurred within the peritoneum, liver and spleen. intraperitoneal fc was rapidly  taken up into the systemic circulation, with peak recovery in the blood (9% injected fc) and liver (5% injected fc) at 1 h post-injection. fc was also rapidly eliminated; 7% of the injected drug was recovered in the kidney 1 h post-injection. a negligible amount of fc was recovered in the spleen and very little fc or lc was found in the lungs of treated animals. unlike fc, lc was found to provide a sustained bactericidal drug level (> 40 micrograms ml-1) in the peritoneal fluid for up to 5 h post-injection. lc also achieved significantly higher drug levels, compared with fc, within the liver at 3 and 5 h post-injection. since severe intra-abdominal sepsis is often characterized by the presence of intraphagocytic bacteria in hepatic and splenic reticuloendothelial systems, the enhanced delivery of liposome-encapsulated anti-microbial agents, such as cefoxitin, to the liver and spleen may provide a more effective treatment for the septic condition.

TI  == migration of rat peritoneal cells after intra-abdominal infection with bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli.
AB  == a fibrin clot model for intra-abdominal abscess formation was used to study the migratory properties of peritoneal cells from rats during the early stages of infection. peritoneal cells and fibrin clot remnant were harvested 6 h after implantation of a sterile, singly infected (escherichia coli or bacteroides fragilis) or mixed infected (e. coli and b. fragilis) fibrin clot. histological study of fibrin clots, removed 6 h after implantation, showed a deeper infiltration by host cells of b. fragilis infected clots compared to the others.  this difference in infiltration by peritoneal cells was not due to differences in fibrinolytic activity of the bacterial strains. differential cell counts of the peritoneal cells from rats implanted with sterile, singly and mixed infected fibrin clots showed distribution over subpopulations to be independent of the bacterial content of the infected clots used. in vitro migration assays showed no significant differences in migration by peritoneal cells from rats implanted with clots containing a different bacterial composition. since b. fragilis infected fibrin clots were more deeply infiltrated by host defence cells than the other clots, and only mixed infected clots led to persistent abscesses in this model, we conclude that local conditions within the fibrin matrix rather than intrinsic  cellular capacities of the host cells are important for the process of abscess formation.

AB  == therapy with ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin (alone or in combination  with clindamycin) and therapy with sparfloxacin, clinafloxacin, and temafloxacin  alone were given to mice with subcutaneous abscesses. the abscesses were caused by two bacteroides fragilis isolates, one of which was susceptible and one of which was resistant to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, alone or in combination with escherichia coli. the abscesses were examined 5 days after inoculation. numbers of b. fragilis organisms reached log10 10.2 to 11.8 per abscess, and numbers of e. coli organisms reached log10 10.6 to 11.8 per abscess. all of the quinolones reduced the number of susceptible b. fragilis isolates (log10 3.6 to 6.9) and e. coli isolates (log10 5.7 to 6.8). however, ciprofloxacin and lomefloxacin failed to reduce the number of resistant b. fragilis organisms in single-organism or mixed infections. the addition of clindamycin to either ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, or lomefloxacin reduced the numbers of both susceptible and resistant b. fragilis organisms (log10 3.8 to 7.8). in contrast, sparfloxacin, clinafloxacin, and temafloxacin were effective as single therapy in eradicating b. fragilis resistant to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin. these in vivo data confirm the in vitro activity of these quinolones and suggest that although ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin are occasionally effective as single agents in eradicating mixed infection by susceptible strains of b. fragilis and e. coli, addition of an agent with activity against anaerobic organisms will ensure their efficacy. quinolones  with good efficacy against b. fragilis may be effective as single-agent therapy of mixed infections.

AB  == a clinical isolate of enterobacter cloacae, strain nor-1, exhibited resistance to imipenem and remained susceptible to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. clavulanic acid partially restored the susceptibility of the strain to imipenem. two beta-lactamases with isoelectric points (pi) of 6.9 and > 9.2 were detected in strain e. cloacae nor-1; the higher pi corresponded to ampc cephalosporinase. plasmid dna was not detected in e. cloacae nor-1 and imipenem resistance could not be transferred into escherichia coli jm109. the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase gene was cloned into plasmid pacyc184. one recombinant plasmid, pptn1, harbored a 5.3-kb sau3a fragment from e. cloacae nor-1 expressing the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase. this enzyme (pi 6.9) hydrolyzed ampicillin, cephalothin, and imipenem more rapidly than it did meropenem and aztreonam, but it hydrolyzed extended-spectrum cephalosporins only weakly and did not hydrolyze cefoxitin. hydrolytic activity was partially inhibited by clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam, was nonsusceptible to chelating agents such as edta and 1,10-o-phenanthroline, and was independent of the presence of zncl2. its relative molecular mass was 30,000 da. induction experiments concluded that the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase biosynthesis was inducible by cefoxitin and imipenem. subcloning experiments with hindiii partial digests of pptn1 resulted in a recombinant plasmid, designated pptn2, which contained a 1.3-kb insert from pptn1 and which conferred resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. hybridization studies performed with a 1.2-kb hindiii fragment from pptn2 failed to determine any homology with ampc of e. cloacae, with other known beta-lactamase genes commonly found in members of the family enterobacteriaceae (bla(tem-1)) and bla(shv-3) derivatives), and with previously  described carbapenemase genes such as those from xanthomonas maltophilia, bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis (cfia), and aeromonas hydrophila (cpha). this work describing the biochemical properties of a novel chromosome-encoded beta-lactamase from e. cloacae indicates that this enzyme differs from all the previously described carbapenemases. this is the first reported cloning of a carbapenem-hydrolyzing gene from a member of the family enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == genetic and biochemical analysis of a novel ambler class a beta-lactamase responsible for cefoxitin resistance in bacteroides species.
AB  == a clinical isolate of bacteroides vulgatus was resistant to tetracycline, clindamycin, ampicillin, cephaloridine, cefoxitin, and other beta-lactam antibiotics except imipenem. beta-lactam resistance was mediated by a membrane-associated, clavulanate-sensitive cephalosporinase capable of degrading  cephalosporins and penicillins. cefoxitin also was degraded but at a slow rate. the cefoxitin resistance (fxr) determinant was cloned from b. vulgatus genomic libraries that were prepared in escherichia coli and then mated with bacteroides  fragilis for the identification of fxr strains. analysis of b. fragilis strains with the cloned fxr determinant revealed the presence of a new beta-lactamase protein with the physical and enzymatic properties of the beta-lactamase found in the original b. vulgatus isolate. the beta-lactamase gene (cfxa) was subcloned on a 2.2-kb drai-hindiii fragment, and the nucleotide sequence was determined. these results showed that cfxa encoded a protein of 321 amino acids and 35,375 molecular weight. mutant strains in which the cfxa structural gene was disrupted  by insertional inactivation lost both fxr and beta-lactamase activity. comparison of cfxa with other beta-lactamases showed a relationship with the active-site serine beta-lactamases in the ambler molecular class a, although cfxa had apparently diverged significantly. this was exemplified by the substitution in cfxa at 13 of 25 amino acid residues previously identified as being invariant in  class a beta-lactamases. these results suggest that cfxa may represent a new class a homology group which diverged very early.

TI  == molecular characterization of a fructanase produced by bacteroides fragilis bf-1.
AB  == the bacteroides fragilis bf-1 fructanase-encoding gene (frua) was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli from the recombinant plasmid pbs100. the frua gene  consisted of 1,866 bp encoding a protein of 622 amino acids with a calculated m(r) of 70,286. the apparent m(r) of the fructanase, determined by in vitro cell-free transcription-translation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, was approximately 71,500. an alignment of the amino acid sequences of the b. fragilis bf-1 fructanase and the bacillus subtilis levanase revealed that 45.5% of the amino acids were identical. the frua gene was expressed in e. coli from its own promoter; however, no e. coli promoter-like sequence was evident upstream from the gene. a major e. coli transcription start  point and a single b. fragilis bf-1 transcription start point were located. expression of the frua gene was constitutive in e. coli(pbs100) and b. fragilis bf-1. the ratio of sucrase activity to inulinase activity (s/i ratio) was constant for enzyme preparations from e. coli (pbs100), indicating that both activities were associated with the fructanase. for b. fragilis bf-1, the s/i ratio varied considerably depending on the carbon source used for growth, suggesting that a separate sucrase is produced in addition to the fructanase in b. fragilis bf-1. localization experiments and tnphoa mutagenesis indicated that  the fructanase was exported to the periplasm. sequence analysis of the n-terminal region of the fructanase revealed a putative 30-amino-acid signal peptide. the enzymatic properties of the purified fructanase were investigated. the enzyme was able to hydrolyze sucrose, raffinose, inulin, and levan but not melezitose, indicating that it was a beta-d-fructofuranosidase which was able to hydrolyze beta(2-->6)-linked fructans.

TI  == oral infectivity and bacterial interactions with mononuclear phagocytes.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to clarify the association between the oral infectivity of a bacterial strain and its susceptibility to ingestion by mononuclear phagocytes or ability to survive within them. ten bacterial strains tested--all of known oral infectivity--comprised salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes (three strains), escherichia coli (two strains), proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, and a bacteroides sp. the phagocytic uptake of each strain was measured as the bacteria to phagocyte ratio after mononuclear phagocytes in mouse peritoneal exudate were permitted to ingest bacteria in vivo for 3 min. the three listeria strains were the most susceptible  to phagocytic uptake and the salmonella strain was relatively resistant. the intracellular survival of each strain was studied during a subsequent 2 h in-vitro incubation of the mononuclear phagocytes that had been permitted to ingest bacteria in vivo. the strains with the best intracellular survival were ent. faecalis and two of the three listeria strains. the ability of s. typhimurium to survive intracellularly was intermediate but better than that of the two e. coli strains. oral infectivity was not consistently correlated with susceptibility to ingestion by mononuclear phagocytes or ability to survive within them.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of empyema. a retrospective review in two military hospitals.
AB  == the microbiology and clinical features of empyema were studied retrospectively in 197 patients whose specimens yielded bacterial growth after inoculation for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. three hundred forty-three organisms (216 aerobic  or facultative and 127 anaerobic organisms) were isolated. aerobic bacteria were  isolated in 127 (64 percent) patients, anaerobic bacteria in 25 (13 percent), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 45 (23 percent). the predominant aerobic  or facultative organisms were streptococcus pneumoniae (70 isolates), staphylococcus aureus (58), escherichia coli (17), klebsiella pneumoniae (16), and haemophilus influenzae (12). the predominant anaerobes were pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas species (24), bacteroides fragilis group (22), anaerobic cocci (36), and fusobacterium species (20). beta-lactamase-producing organisms were recovered in 49 (38 percent) of 128 tested specimens. these included all 42 tested s aureus and 15 b fragilis group, 4 of 9 k pneumoniae, 3 of 9 h influenzae, 3 of 8 pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas species, and 2 of 6 e coli. most patients from whom s pneumoniae and h influenzae were recovered had pneumonia, and most patients with s aureus had pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, and lung abscesses. the recovery of anaerobic bacteria was mostly associated with the concomitant diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia, and lung, subdiaphragmatic, dental, and oropharyngeal abscesses. these data highlight the importance of anaerobic bacteria in selected cases of empyema.

TI  == increasing antibiotic dose decreases polymicrobial infection after hemorrhagic shock.
AB  == hemorrhagic shock has been shown to increase the susceptibility to infection despite the administration of conventionally accepted doses of antimicrobial drugs. the efficacy of increasing antibiotic dose in a model of mixed gram-negative infection, both with and without hemorrhagic shock, was examined. shock was induced by bleeding rats to a mean arterial pressure of 45 millimeters  of mercury for 45 minutes followed by resuscitation with shed blood and saline solution. one hour after shock or sham, the rats were inoculated with 1 x 10(8) escherichia coli plus 1 x 10(9) bacteroides fragilis in a fecal suspension subcutaneously. rats were given either no antibiotic (control) or cefoxitin at 30 milligrams per kilogram (standard) or 200 milligrams per kilogram (high) intraperitoneally, 30 minutes before and at six and 12 hours after inoculation. tissue cefoxitin concentrations were measured 30 minutes before and at six and 12 hours after inoculation. tissue cefoxitin concentrations were measured 30 minutes after the initial dose. standard reduced abscess diameter by 58 percent compared  with control in rats that were not shocked, but only by 26 percent after shock (p < 0.05 shock versus sham). high further decreased abscess diameter and weight (4  +/- 1 millimeter and 22 +/- 22 milligrams) after shock compared with standard (9  +/- 1 millimeter and 230 +/- 90 milligrams; both p < 0.05). peak tissue cefoxitin levels were greater than 19 times the minimal inhibitory concentration for each bacteria for high compared with eight times for standard. these data demonstrate  that an increased dose of cefoxitin was superior to a conventional dose in controlling a mixed gram-negative infection after shock and suggest that altering traditional antibiotic use may decrease the incidence of infection after shock and hemorrhage.

TI  == ampicillin and ampicillin-sulbactam dilution tests with mixed cultures of bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli and enterococcus.
AB  == bacterial interactions in mixed infections may compromise antimicrobial therapy.  the in vitro bactericidal activity of ampicillin and ampicillin-sulbactam against aerobic/anaerobic mixed cultures of bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli and enterococcus spp. was studied by means of broth dilution tests. the mbc of ampicillin for enterococcus faecalis 6 was 0.25 mg/l when tested singly; in association with b. fragilis 1, however, the mbc for e. faecalis 6 was 16 mg/l. when tested singly e. coli 9 and b. fragilis 1 were both killed by ampicillin at  a concentration of 4 mg/l in combination with 1 mg/l sulbactam. when both strains were associated, the mbc for b. fragilis 1 rose to > 256 mg/l. results obtained indicate that the behaviour of bacteria as determined in pure cultures is not necessarily identical with the antibiotic susceptibility present in mixed cultures. it was shown that, besides beta-lactamase production by involved bacteria, other factors contribute to the alteration of bacterial susceptibility  in mixed cultures. synergistic and antagonistic effects between associated organisms were observed. for example, it was found that two moderately sensitive  bacterial strains were resistant in mixed culture.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of biapenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic.
AB  == biapenem is a new carbapenem antibiotic with high stability to human renal dehydropeptidase i. its in vitro activity was compared with that of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, piperacillin and gentamicin against a total  of 650 recent clinical isolates. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and all isolates were tested at two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu). biapenem inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus  mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei and yersinia enterocolitica at < or = 2 mg/l and was as active as or two- to four-fold more active than imipenem against all these species, with the exception of serratia marcescens, against which imipenem was two-fold more active. biapenem was two-fold more active than imipenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 4 mg/l) and had activity similar to that of imipenem against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 0.5 mg/l) but was two-fold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90 0.06 mg/l)  and was, like imipenem, inactive against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == enhanced virulence of escherichia coli bearing a site-targeted mutation in the major structural subunit of type 1 fimbriae.
AB  == type 1 fimbriae promote enterobacterial adherence to a variety of mammalian cells and are thought to play an important role in the establishment of various extraintestinal infections. whether or not this adhesin has a role in the pathogenesis of peritoneal escherichia coli infections, such as those initiated by bowel leakage during intraabdominal surgery, is unclear. by using two genetically engineered e. coli strains, each bearing an antibiotic resistance element inserted at a different site within the type 1 fimbria operon, we examined the role of type 1 fimbriation in intraperitoneal infection in rats. a permanently nonfimbriated insertion mutant was compared with an analogously constructed normally fimbriated one. after intraperitoneal inoculation of adult rats, the permanently nonfimbriated mutant produced mortality more rapidly and resulted in a greater number of culturable organisms from both the peritoneum and the blood. moreover, the differences between these two insertion mutants were dramatically enhanced by preinoculation growth conditions favoring fimbrial expression. after growth under these conditions, 10(3) cfu of the fimbriation-proficient strain inoculated intraperitoneally caused no mortality; in sharp contrast, the permanently nonfimbriated insertion mutant resulted in death in 60% of the animals inoculated. notwithstanding evidence that type 1 fimbriae mediate enterobacterial adherence to mammalian oropharyngeal and bladder mucosae, the results presented here demonstrate that type 1 fimbrial expression can lead to diminution of the number of e. coli organisms within the peritoneum.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of aspoxicillin of fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of aspoxicillin (aspc) in terms of minimum inhibitory  concentration (mics) was compared with those of other penicillin antibiotics (pcs) against clinical isolates sent to us from medical institutions throughout japan in 1988, 1990 and 1992 and strains isolated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections. 1. the mic80's of aspc against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp., escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis  group were almost the same as those against these isolates in 1985 to 1986. 2. a  trend for increasing susceptibility to pcs including aspc was observed in the isolates of s. aureus and haemophilus influenzae. this trend in s. aureus was attributed to the appearance of non beta-lactamase producing strains associated with the development of highly resistant strains among the methicillin-resistant  s. aureus (mrsa) as well as to a tendency toward yearly decreasing frequency of mrsa. the trend for the increased susceptibility in h. influenzae was related to  the decrease in the number of beta-lactamase production strains. 3. the frequency of the strains highly resistant to pcs including aspc increased. 4. no pcs-resistant strains were observed among the so-called beta-streptococci, while  among alpha-streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae there was a trend for decreasing frequency of strains with lower susceptibility to pcs or those with resistant to pcs. these strains may be variants which were also resistant to cephems and had penicillin-binding proteins (pbps). meanwhile, a high frequency of highly pcs-resistant strains were noted among enterococcus faecium. in view of the fact that the pcs-resistance of e. faecium is known to be related to pbps, the pattern of the susceptibility of the recent clinical isolates to beta-lactams is considered to be multimodal.

TI  == potentiation of decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase activity by inflammatory stimuli in sepsis.
AB  == the effect of inflammation and chronic sepsis on the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (pdh) in skeletal muscle was investigated in rats. inflammation was induced by the placement of a catheter in the carotid artery. sepsis was induced by repeated (every 48 hr) injections of an inoculum composed of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and bacteroides fragilis organisms into a preformed subcutaneous abscess. hindlimb muscle was sampled 7 or 14 days following the initial injection of the inoculum into the abscess. total phd activity was not altered by any of the conditions examined. there were no differences in the proportion of active pdh complex after 7 days in any of the conditions examined. in contrast, 14 days after the initial bacterial injection,  the concentration of active pdh complex in skeletal muscle was reduced by 50% in  the septic rats. the combination of intravascular catheterization and infection resulted in a further decrease in the concentration of active pdh complex. the decreased concentration of active pdh complex was associated with increased plasma lactate concentrations in septic rats. catheterization exacerbated the rise in plasma lactate in sepsis. in this model of chronic sepsis, the magnitude  of the hyperlactatemia and the inhibition of the pdh complex in skeletal muscle appear dependent upon the length of time of the septic insult and are potentiated by addition of an intravascular focus of inflammation.

TI  == intrapleural streptokinase in experimental empyema.
AB  == intrapleural streptokinase has been used in multiloculated empyemas to enhance pleural space drainage, presumably by causing fibrinolysis of the interlocular septae. we evaluated the efficacy and safety of daily administration of 10,000 u  intrapleural streptokinase or equal volumes of saline to enhance resolution of experimental empyema in the rabbit pleural space. seventy-two hours after intrapleural turpentine, 10(8) colony-forming units each of escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and bacteroides fragilis were injected into the sterile pleural effusion of all animals. immediately after bacterial inoculation, and daily for 3 days, animals received 10,000 u streptokinase or saline intrapleurally. animals that achieved a pleural fluid ph < 7.30 and either glucose < 50 mg/dl or ldh > 500 iu/l were included for data analysis. at day 4 after bacterial inoculation, the streptokinase-treated empyemic rabbits had more  pleural fluid (18.8 +/- 5.1 ml) (mean +/- sem) than did saline-treated control animals (4.8 +/- 1.7 ml) (p = 0.015), fewer interpleural adhesions (8.2 +/- 2.7)  than did saline-treated control animals (25.1 +/- 3.6) (p = 0.002), and comparable amounts of visceral and parietal pleural plaque than did saline-treated control animals (p = ns). no evidence of systemic fibrinolysis was observed at 1 h after intrapleural streptokinase administration. we conclude that intrapleural streptokinase decreases interpleural adhesion numbers but fails to reduce the amount of pleural plaque observed in experimental empyema in rabbits.  the increases in pleural fluid volume observed after streptokinase administration may be due to mechanisms other than fibrinolytic activity.

TI  == cloning and identification of a two-component signal-transducing regulatory system from bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == a dna fragment was cloned from bacteroides fragilis that bestowed low-level tetracycline resistance to escherichia coli strains harbouring the cloned fragment on a multicopy plasmid. the tetracycline resistance determinant was localized to a 4.3kb bg/ii-psti subfragment of the original clone. dna sequence analysis of this fragment revealed that it contained an operon encoding two proteins: one of 519 amino acids, rprx, and a second of 236 amino acids, rpry. protein sequence analysis revealed that the two proteins shared sequence identity with a family of multicomponent signal-transducing regulatory proteins identified from many diverse bacterial genera. rprx shared identity with the first component of the regulatory system, the histidine protein kinase receptor (for example envz, phor, chea, and vira). rpry shared identity with the second member of the regulatory protein pair, the regulatory response protein (for example ompr, phob, chey, and virg). expression of these proteins from a multicopy plasmid vector in  e. coli resulted in a decrease in the level of the outer membrane porin protein ompf and an increase in the level of the outer membrane porin protein ompc. the decrease in ompf levels correlates with, and may be the cause of, the increased tetracycline resistance. regulation of the levels of ompf and ompc is normally controlled by a multicomponent signal-transducing regulatory pair of proteins, envz and ompr. the effect rprx and rpry have on ompf expression is mediated at the level of transcription. thus, rprx and rpry may be interfering with the normal regulation of ompf by ompr and envz.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk037, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  == fk037 is a new parenteral cephalosporin, which offers some advantages over the commercially available parenteral cephalosporins. it demonstrated potent broad-spectrum activity against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, and gram-negative bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa. against clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive bacteria, fk037, like cefpirome, demonstrated more potent activity  than ceftazidime, cefoperazone and ceftizoxime. it is noteworthy that fk037, on the basis of the mic90s, was the most active of all the cephalosporins tested against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). it was similar in activity to cefpirome against methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa). against clinical isolates of aerobic gram-negative bacteria, fk037, like cefpirome, was superior to cefoperazone, similar to ceftazidime and inferior to ceftizoxime in activity. against p. aeruginosa, fk037 was superior to cefoperazone, similar or slightly superior to cefpirome and inferior to ceftazidime in activity. however,  fk037 exhibited significant activity against citrobacter and enterobacter which were highly resistant to ceftazidime, cefoperazone and ceftizoxime. fk037 had an  advantage in that its bactericidal activity against s. aureus, escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa at sub-mics (1/2 or 1/4 the mic) was much stronger than those of cefpirome and ceftazidime. moreover, it exhibited potent bactericidal activity against mssa, mrsa and p. aeruginosa in a pharmacokinetic in vitro model simulating human plasma concentrations after intravenous dosage of 0.125, 1.0 and 1.0 g, respectively. fk037 inhibited essential penicillin-binding proteins (pbps), 1, 2 and 3 of s. aureus with a 50% inhibitory concentration (i50) of 0.58 micrograms/ml or lower. of essential pbps 3, 1a and 1b of e. coli and p. aeruginosa, fk037 inhibited pbp 3 at the lowest i50 (0.03 and 0.04 micrograms/ml, respectively) and pbps 1a and 1b with i50 values of 2.7 micrograms/ml or lower. fk037, like cefpirome, was highly stable to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases except ic cephalosporinase from bacteroides fragilis, and had extremely low affinity for beta-lactamases. therefore, fk037 was more potent than ceftazidime in activity against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria except p. aeruginosa and serratia marcescens. the ability of fk037 to penetrate the outer membrane of e. coli was slightly higher than that of ceftazidime, but slightly lower than that of cefpirome.

TI  == anti-tumor necrosis factor antibody reduces mortality in the presence of antibiotic-induced tumor necrosis factor release.
AB  == the systemic tumor necrosis factor (tnf) response has been extensively studied during infection. in addition, antibiotics that cause cell-wall lysis have been associated with endotoxinemia and, therefore, could trigger tnf release. we studied the effects of pretreatment with cefoxitin and/or anti-tnf antibody on mortality and early (90 minutes) and delayed (6 hours) serum tnf levels in a murine model of mixed escherichia coli/bacteroides fragilis peritonitis. at low and intermediate inocula levels, cefoxitin, but not anti-tnf antibody, prevented  death, and low serum tnf levels were noted in all groups. at the highest inoculum level, mortality was uniform in control, cefoxitin, and anti-tnf antibody groups, and a significant elevation in serum tnf levels was seen only at the 6-hour point in animals receiving cefoxitin. the addition of anti-tnf antibody to cefoxitin at this inoculum level abrogated the 6-hour rise in serum tnf levels and reduced mortality to 40%. these results emphasize that the cytokine response in disease is dependent on both the nature of the insult and other forms of therapeutic interventions.

AB  == peritoneal cells from rats infected intraperitoneally with escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis, alone or in combination were examined in vitro. cells were  harvested 6 h after implantation of fibrin clots infected with e. coli or b. fragilis, separately or containing both species, and assayed for their bactericidal capacities, chemiluminescence and production of cidal metabolites. peritoneal cell populations from rats with implants of any of the infected clots  showed similar distribution of different subpopulations. bactericidal activity of peritoneal cells did not differ with the bacterial species used. chemiluminescence values of peritoneal cells from rats with mono-infected b. fragilis or mixed-infected implanted clots, after stimulation with either particles or chemical stimuli, were significantly higher than those of rats with  mono-infected e. coli or sterile clots. the same tendency was seen with regard to the production of cidal metabolites such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anions although no significant differences were found.

TI  == influence of short-chain fatty acids produced by anaerobic bacteria on procoagulant activity produced by escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis-stimulated leucocytes: possible role in intra-abdominal abscess formation.
AB  == the effect of selected short-chain fatty acids (scfa) produced by anaerobic bacteria on the production in vitro of procoagulant activity (pca) by human mononuclear cells stimulated by either escherichia coli or bacteroides fragilis which are common pathogens in intra-abdominal infections was investigated. in particular, acetic, propionic, succinic, butyric, and isobutyric acids were evaluated. acetic, butyric, and isobutyric acids were able to inhibit significantly the production of pca by bacteria-stimulated mononuclear cells. since the production of pca leads to the deposition of fibrin which is considered critical to the establishment of intra-abdominal abscesses, the inhibitory effect exerted by scfa present in the inflammatory environment might play an important modulating role in the development of abscesses complicating intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of gas gangrene and perineal necrotizing fasciitis. a clinical and experimental study.
AB  == between 1971 and 1987, 32 patients with clostridial gas gangrene were treated in  the department of surgery, university of turku. a presumptive diagnosis of gas gangrene was made on the basis of the clinical appearance of the patient and a predominance of gram positive rods on stain. between 1973 and 1989, 11 patients with perineal necrotizing fasciitis (fournier's gangrene) were treated. the diagnosis was based on fulminating progression of perineal gangrene and on the presence of multiple pathogenic organisms in the primary gram stain or culture. all patients in both series underwent surgical debridement, antibiotic therapy, and intensive care. in addition, the patients were exposed to pure oxygen at 2.5  atmospheres absolute pressure (ata) for 120 minutes. three such treatments were given during the first 24 hours after admission after which the treatment was repeated twice daily. seventeen patients with clostridial gas gangrene had diffusely spreading myonecrosis; 6 died. fifteen patients developed clostridial cellulitis with toxicity; 3 died. thus, the overall mortality in gas gangrene was 28%. all the 9 patients who died had been transferred from other hospitals in finland and were moribund on arrival. the infection in 8 of these patients developed postoperatively. none of the patients with a posttraumatic infection died. each of the patients with fournier's gangrene had had nonspecific symptoms  before the gangrene became evident. the infection originated from the anorectal area in 5 patients, 1 patient had sustained a scrotal trauma and in 5 patients the underlying condition was unknown. one patient died 2 days after admission. six patients required a colostomy. to evaluate the therapeutic value of hyperbaric oxygen (hbo) treatment, two experimental models of clostridial gas gangrene, mono- and multimicrobial, were developed in rats. in the monomicrobial  infection model, 10(7) colony forming units (cfu) of clostridium perfringens were injected intramuscularly into the left hind limb of the rat. the mortality of untreated rats was 100%. the mortality of the rats treated with surgery alone was 38% compared to 13% when surgery was used in combination with hbo (p < 0.01; chi  2 test). in the group treated with hbo and surgery, 94% of the survivors healed completely and were able to walk normally, whereas the corresponding figure in the rats treated with surgery alone was 20% (p < 0.001; chi 2-test). in the multimicrobial gas gangrene model the infection was induced by an intramuscular injection of a mixture containing approximately 10(7) cfu of each of the following bacteria: clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == a reporter gene vector to investigate the regulation of glutamine synthetase in bacteroides fragilis bf1.
AB  == the clostridium acetobutylicum egla gene, encoding a beta-1,4-endoglucanase (eg), was shown to be a useful reporter gene for the study of gene expression in bacteroides fragilis. the egla reporter gene has the advantages that it can be easily identified in both escherichia coli and b. fragilis on agar media containing carboxymethylcellulose, and eg production can be rapidly quantified in liquid medium. since the b. fragilis glutamine synthetase (gs) is inactivated in  permeabilized cells and cell extracts, the egla reporter gene was used to study the regulation of gs production in b. fragilis. gene fusions containing the gs glna promoter region fused to the promoterless egla gene showed that glna expression was regulated by nitrogen in b. fragilis at the transcriptional level. a glna upstream region containing a near-perfect direct repeat sequence was essential for efficient gs expression and for regulation by nitrogen.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacterial interactions in the development of anaerobic bacterial pneumonia.
AB  == the interactions between aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the development of anaerobic bacterial pneumonia were studied by introducing bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli alone or in combination into guinea pigs by tracheal infusion. the lung lesions induced by b. fragilis were mainly located near the pleura, unlike those induced by e. coli, and were accompanied by pneumonia, lung  abscess, and pleuritis. the lung lesions produced by mixed infection with b. fragilis (10(9) cfu) and e. coli (10(7) cfu) were significantly more severe than  those induced by either microbe alone, and the redox potentials at the foci of inflammation were markedly reduced (max: -330 mv). analysis of lung lesions after treatment with aztreonam and clindamycin and neutrophil phagocytic activity suggested that e. coli was primarily responsible for the lung lesions and that b. fragilis promoted the accompanying inflammation, resulting in increased pathogenicity of the mixed infections.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime on fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (caz) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout japan in 1989 and 1991. those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic90 of caz in 1991 were markedly higher against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. also, among other bacteria such as providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to caz were observed in high proportions. however, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of caz on streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella spp, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobic gpc (gram-positive cocci). 2. among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. it appears therefore, that caz failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these  strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. antimicrobial activities of caz on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. however, it was also demonstrated that caz maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. when it is additionally taken into account that caz is one of those limited drugs with activity against p. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that caz still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.

TI  == experimental studies of survival of anaerobic bacteria at 4 degrees c and 22 degrees c in two different transport systems.
AB  == the survival of anaerobic bacteria on swabs in two different transport systems at 4 degrees c and 22 degrees c was evaluated. the transport systems were a charcoal-impregnated cotton swab in modified stuart transport medium (mst), and a viscose swab in modified siff transport medium (btm) (bionor). the following eight clinical strains of anaerobic bacteria were tested for quantitative recovery at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h; fusobacterium necrophorum, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides intermedius, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptococcus magnus, clostridium perfringens, clostridium tetani, and actinomyces  israelii. additionally, a mixture of staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli was tested together with bacteroides fragilis, fusobacterium necrophorum and clostridium perfringens. both transport systems preserved the bacteria, but the btm medium gave a better quantitative recovery of the bacteria than the mst in 29/64 (45%) of the experiments, whereas the opposite was the case in 15/64 (23%)  of the experiments (p < 0.05). there was no significant strain-related difference between the recovery of 10 different b. fragilis strains. there was no major difference in the recovery of the anaerobes in the two systems at 4 degrees c compared to 22 degrees c, except for fusobacterium necrophorum, which survived best at 4 degrees c in the bionor transport system.

TI  == german multicentre study on the in vitro susceptibility of bacteroides species. the german bacteroides study group.
AB  == in 1990 the first german multicentre study on the in vitro susceptibility of bacteroides species was completed. employing a commercially prepared microbroth dilution assay, nine participating institutions evaluated approximately 100 consecutive isolates of bacteroides species from relevant clinical specimens. a total of 911 strains (449 bacteroides fragilis, 201 bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, 79 bacteroides ovatus, 78 bacteroides vulgatus, 77 bacteroides distasonis, 25 bacteroides uniformis, 2 others) were tested. most of the isolates came from surgical patients (72%); other sources included gynaecological patients (9%) and  medical patients (5%). seventy-eight percent of the anaerobes were found in mixed culture together with at least one aerobic organism (escherichia coli 36%, streptococci 15%, or enterococci 13%), while in 22% of the cases, the anaerobes were the only bacteria grown from the specimens. the results showed that many of  the strains were potent beta-lactamase producers (as judged by resistance to amoxicillin). however, all but one of the isolates demonstrated susceptibility in vitro when clavulanic acid was added to amoxicillin or ticarcillin. at the same time, 13% of the organisms were resistant to mezlocillin, 5% to cefoxitin and 4%  to clindamycin. three strains were reported resistant to imipenem and one strain  to metronidazole.

TI  == proliferative activity of bile duct epithelium after bacterial infection in dogs.
AB  == to clarify the relationship between proliferative activity in bile duct epithelia and bacterial infection in the dog, we induced obstructive cholestasis with a bacterial infection in two lobes of the liver. the bile duct branch draining the  left lateral lobes of the liver was cannulated in all mongrel dogs. the dogs were divided into three groups and treated as follows: in group 1 the cannula was clamped after the injection of 10(7) escherichia coli (aerobic bacteria) and 10(7) bacteroides fragilis (anaerobic bacteria) cells; in group 2 the cannula was clamped after the injection of 10(7) e. coli cells; and in group 3 the cannula was clamped without the injection of any bacteria. three months and 9 months later dogs from each group were killed, and their livers were examined. in the group 1 dogs papillary hyperplasia and severe dysplasia were noted in association with chronic cholangitis at 3 months and 9 months, respectively, after operation. in the group 2 dogs periductal fibrosis was severe, but epithelial papillary hyperplasia was less pronounced than in the group 1 dogs at each period. in the group 3 dogs no periductal fibrosis or epithelial papillary hyperplasia was seen  at either 3 or 9 months postoperatively. these findings suggest that papillary hyperplasia and/or severe dysplasia of the bile duct epithelium may be caused by  aerobic and anaerobic bacterial infection of the biliary tract in combination with bile stasis.

AB  == specimens obtained from 67 infants with secondarily infected diaper dermatitis were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. bacteria growth was obtained in 58. aerobic facultative bacteria or candida sp. only were present in 28 patients  (48%), anaerobic bacteria only in 11 (19%), and mixed anaerobic with aerobic, facultative, or yeast flora was present in 19 (33%). ninety-one bacterial or fungal isolates were recovered (1.6 per specimen), 54 (0.9 per specimen) aerobic  or facultative bacteria, 8 (0.1 per specimen) candida sp., and 31 (0.6 per specimen) strict anaerobes. the predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (23 isolates), streptococcus sp. (16), and escherichia coli (6). the predominant anaerobes included bacteroides sp. (12, including 9 bacteroides fragilis group) and peptostreptococcus sp. (11). single bacterial isolates were recovered in 32 (55%) patients, 18 of which were s. aureus. twenty-five beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 22 (51%) of the 43 tested patients. these included 16 s. aureus and 6 b. fragilis group. these data  highlight the importance of anaerobic bacteria in the polymicrobial nature of secondarily infected diaper dermatitis.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of am-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  == am-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and mycoplasma pneumoniae. am-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis; its mics for 90% of strains  tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. the activity of am-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. against xanthomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and campylobacter jejuni, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. at a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, am-1155 inhibited 90% of bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. development of resistance to am-1155 in s. aureus and s. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. in the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, am-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. the efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of am-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. against experimental pneumonia with klebsiella pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. am-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa. these results suggest that am-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.

TI  == nucleotide sequence and deduced functions of a set of cotranscribed genes of streptomyces coelicolor a3(2) including the polyketide synthase for the antibiotic actinorhodin.
AB  == a 5.3-kb region of the streptomyces coelicolor actinorhodin gene cluster, including the genes for polyketide biosynthesis, was sequenced. six identified open reading frames (orf1-6) were related to genetically characterized mutations  of classes acti, vii, iv, and vb by complementation analysis. orf1-6 run divergently from the adjacent actiii gene, which encodes the polyketide synthase  (pks) ketoreductase, and appear to form an operon. the deduced gene products of orf1-3 are similar to fatty acid synthases (fas) of different organisms and pks genes from other polyketide producers. the predicted orf5 gene product is similar to type ii beta-lactamases of bacillus cereus and bacteroides fragilis. the orf6  product does not resemble other known proteins. combining the genetical, biochemical, and similarity data, the potential activities of the products of the six genes can be postulated as: 1) condensing enzyme/acyl transferase (orf1 + orf2); 2) acyl carrier protein (orf3); 3) putative cyclase/dehydrase (orf4); 4) dehydrase (orf5); and 5) "dimerase" (orf6). the data show that the actinorhodin pks consists of discrete monofunctional components, like that of the escherichia  coli (type ii) fas, rather than the multifunctional polypeptides for the macrolide pkss and vertebrate fass (type i).

TI  == ca(2+)-related hepatocellular alterations during intra-abdominal sepsis.
AB  == intra-abdominal sepsis was induced in rats by implanting into their abdominal cavities fecal-agar pellets impregnated with escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis. sham-operated rats received sterile pellets. a group of sterile- and septic-implanted rats was treated intraperitoneally with diltiazem (1.2 mg/kg) 8  h after implantations. septic- and sterile-implanted rat hepatocytes were loaded  with 1) the fluorescent dye indo-1 to quantify hepatocyte basal and vasopressin (100 nm)-elevated cytosolic ca2+ concentration and 2) 45ca to quantify ca2+ flux  and cellular content of exchangeable ca2+. lipid peroxidation was determined by measuring conjugated dienes (cd) and thiobarbiturate-reactive substances (tba-rs) in liver homogenates. in septic-implanted rats, the basal cytosolic [ca2+], cellular exchangeable ca2+, ca2+ flux, cd, and tba-rs were significantly higher than in sterile-implanted rats. although vasopressin caused a significant elevation in cytosolic [ca2+] in septic rat hepatocytes, the magnitude of this elevation was significantly smaller than that found in the sterile group. diltiazem treatment of septic rats significantly decreased basal cytosolic [ca2+], cellular exchangeable ca2+ content, ca2+ flux, cd, and tba-rs. also, vasopressin-induced increase in hepatocyte cytosolic [ca2+] in diltiazem-treated  septic rats was significantly greater than that observed in untreated septic rats. both ca2+ and membrane lipid alterations were attenuated with diltiazem treatment of septic rats. these results suggest that prevention or attenuation of ca2+ channel-mediated ca2+ influx restores both ca2+ homeostasis and membrane lipid alteration.

AB  == antibiotic activities (mics) of ceftriaxone (ctrx) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of  other cephems. 1. when compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated mic90s of ctrx: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. no changes were observed in mic90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and peptostreptococcus spp. 2. the mic90 of ctrx to s. pneumoniae was high because a  large number of benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) was present among this species. the mic80 to bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. other oxime-type cephems also had high mics against the above mentioned bacteria. therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as ctrx against pisp and b. fragilis group. 3. sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), cephamycin-resistant  as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. some of there resistant bacteria  are also ctrx-resistant, and ctrx had insufficient activities against them. 4. with regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with ctrx-resistance from year to year,  the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989  and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. it appears that those strains resistant to cephems including ctrx are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. ctrx, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. furthermore, considering that ctrx is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that ctrx is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.

AB  == the binding of mutagenic pyrolyzates to cell fractions from some gram-negative intestinal bacteria and to thermally treated bacterial cells was investigated. 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5h-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (trp-p-1) and 3-amino-1-methyl-5h-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (trp-p-2) were effectively bound by several of the bacterial cells. the cell wall skeletons of all bacteria effectively bound trp-p-1 and trp-p-2. their cytoplasmic fractions retained trp-p-1 and trp-p-2, but to a lesser extent than the cell wall skeletons. 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (iq) was not found in their cytoplasmic fractions. these cell wall skeletons also bound 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (glu-p-1), 2-amino-5-phenylpyridine (phe-p-1), iq, 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (meiq), and 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (meiqx). the amount of each mutagen bound differed with the type of mutagen and the bacterial strain used. the outer  membrane of escherichia coli ifo 14249 showed binding of about 123.7 micrograms/mg of trp-p-2, and its cytoplasmic membrane bound 57.14 micrograms/mg. trp-p-2 bound to the bacterial cells was extracted with ammonia (5%), methanol, and ethanol but not with water.

TI  == the bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect of trospectomycin.
AB  == trospectomycin sulfate (trospectomycin, trs) is a novel, broad-spectrum, aminocyclitol antibiotic that is being developed clinically for the treatment of  upper respiratory tract infections, bacterial vaginosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and gonorrhea. this study investigated the bactericidal activity (by time-kill kinetics) and the postantibiotic effect (pae) of trs. species-dependent bacteriostatic/bactericidal activity was observed for trs; the antibiotic was bacteriostatic for staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and escherichia coli, and bactericidal for haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, moraxella catarrhalis, and bacteroides fragilis (one of two test strains). when trs was tested at four times its minimum inhibitory concentration  or at a maximum test concentration of 32 micrograms/ml, with a 1-hr exposure period, the following pae values were recorded: s. epidermidis 30032, 1.8 hr, en. faecalis atcc 29212, 1.6 hr, e. coli uc 311, 1.5 hr, e. coli uc 9451, 1.5 hr, h.  influenzae 30063, greater than 4.0 hr, b. fragilis atcc 25285, 5.2 hr, and b. fragilis uc 12199, 6.7 hr. the broad-spectrum pae that was observed for trs is somewhat unique compared with other antibiotics.

TI  == [study of the efficacy and tolerance of imipenem-cilastatin used as monotherapy for the adjuvant treatment to surgery of peritonitis. results of a french multicenter study including 257 patients].
AB  == the antibiotic treatment of peritonitis classically resorts to the association of two and even three molecules. in order to test the efficacy of a single-drug therapy with tienam* imipenem/cilastatin) as an adjunctive treatment associated to surgery for perforation peritonitis, an open, non-comparative study of 257 patients was carried out in 28 departments. imipenem is the first beta-lactam antibiotic of the carbapenem family. this antibiotic seems to be particularly useful for the treatment of mixed polymicrobial infections such as peritoneal infections, owing to its activity spectrum covering gram-positive and gram-negative, aerobic and anaerobic germs, including strands with multiple resistances (enterobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter, enterococcus and bacteroides fragilis). a total of 212 patients were assessed with a treatment averaging 7 days. the five most frequently isolated bacteria were escherichia coli, streptococci, bacteroides, proteus and klebsiella. the healing or improvement rate was 95.3% (202/212). seven cross-infections occurred during of after the treatment. tolerance is good in 96% of all cases. adverse effects were infrequent and mild: the hepatic and hematological alterations never required the interruption of the treatment and they were reversible; the treatment was interrupted in one patient only because of omental tremulation.

TI  == sepsis-induced changes in protein synthesis: differential effects on fast- and slow-twitch muscles.
AB  == sepsis is associated with severe muscle wasting. mechanisms responsible for sepsis-induced alterations in muscle protein metabolism were investigated in vivo and compared with changes induced by nonseptic inflammation. the rate of protein  synthesis in mixed hindlimb muscles was not altered in inflammation but was inhibited 50% in sepsis. this inhibition did not result from a decreased rna content. instead, the translational efficiency was significantly reduced by 50% in skeletal muscle of septic animals compared with control. the effect of sepsis  to lower the rate of protein synthesis was further examined using individual muscles containing different fiber types. both the protein concentration and protein synthetic rate in fast-twitch muscles were reduced by sepsis, whereas neither of these parameters was affected in slow-twitch muscles or heart. the decreased translational efficiency did not result from a change in the rate of peptide-chain elongation. instead, the sepsis-induced inhibition of protein synthesis resulted from a restraint in peptide-chain initiation because sepsis caused a 1.6-fold increase in free ribosomal subunits. overall, sepsis, but not inflammation, caused an inhibition of protein synthesis primarily in muscles composed of fast-twitch fibers. the mechanism involved in the reduced rates of protein synthesis in muscles resulted from an inhibition of peptide-chain initiation, with no change in peptide-chain elongation.

TI  == the mechanisms of preterm labor: common genital tract pathogens do not metabolize arachidonic acid to prostaglandins or to other eicosanoids.
AB  == objective: our aim was to determine the ability of pathogens commonly associated  with genital tract infection and preterm labor to incorporate arachidonic acid and to metabolize it to prostaglandins or to other eicosanoids. study design: four common genital tract pathogens, escherichia coli, streptococcus viridans, bacteroides fragilis, and a group b beta-hemolytic streptococcus, were incubated  with tritium-labeled arachidonic acid for 2 to 48 hours. uptake of arachidonic acid was calculated from uptake of radioactivity into the organisms. tritium-labeled arachidonic acid within the medium was separated from any metabolites by high-performance liquid chromatography to assess metabolism of arachidonic acid within the bacteria. results: although all organisms were able to take up arachidonic acid, analysis of its metabolism with high-performance liquid chromatography demonstrated that none of these organisms will synthesize cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, or epoxygenase products. conclusion: bacterial infection cannot initiate preterm labor by intrinsic biosynthesis and release of  prostaglandins or other eicosanoids by the bacteria themselves.

TI  == genetic and molecular analysis of pip417 and pip419: bacteroides plasmids encoding 5-nitroimidazole resistance.
AB  == this report describes a genetic and molecular analysis of two transferable bacteroides plasmids, pip417 and pip419, which carry genetic determinants conferring low-level resistance to 5-nitroimidazoles. the restriction endonuclease cleavage sites for each plasmid were localized. the nir genetic determinants of pip417 and pip419 plasmids have been cloned into the bacteroides  cloning vector pbi191 (c.j. smith, j. bacteriol. 164, 294-301, 1985) as pvuii and sau3a fragments, respectively. both inserts had different restriction sites and did not cross-hybridize by southern blot analysis. genetic data obtained by cloning into pbi191 clearly show that the pvuii-generated fragments a (rep) and b (mob) of pip417 are involved in plasmid replication and transfer, respectively. although encoding resistance to the same antibiotic, both plasmids appeared different with regard to the 5-nitroimidazole resistance and replication genetic  determinants. however, they share a homology in a region involved, at least in one case, in plasmid transfer. considering the spontaneous high level of resistance to 5-nitroimidazole in escherichia coli, this work, based on direct gene cloning into bacteroides, demonstrates the value of such an approach.

AB  == the pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration of cefotetan were studied after a single injection of 2 g given intravenously for antimicrobial prophylaxis to 16 consecutive patients undergoing colorectal surgery. concentrations in tissue greater than or equal to the mic for 90% of the main pathogens tested were considered adequate. the elimination half-life at beta phase was 4.6 +/- 1.4 h, the total body clearance was 0.75 +/- 0.19 ml/kg/min, and the volume of distribution was 260 +/- 71 ml/kg. at the time of incision (33 +/- 16 min after the injection), cefotetan concentrations were 14.2 +/- 7 micrograms/g in abdominal-wall fat, 16.4 +/- 1 micrograms/g in epiploic fat, and 163 +/- 62 mg/liter in serum. at the time of surgical anastomosis (151 +/- 54 min), cefotetan concentrations were 33.3 +/- 6 micrograms/g in the colonic wall and 73  +/- 34 mg/liter in serum. upon closure of the abdomen (216 +/- 76 min), cefotetan concentrations were 6.3 +/- 3 micrograms/g in abdominal-wall fat, 6.1 +/- 4 micrograms/g in epiploic fat, and 64 +/- 38 mg/liter in serum. cefotetan tissue penetration was 10% into abdominal and epiploic fat and 46% into the colonic wall. levels in tissue were compared with the mic for 90% of the most frequently  encountered pathogenic germs (staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, and escherichia coli). adequate concentrations in tissue were obtained up to anastomosis but not upon closure. the authors therefore recommend the injection of an additional dose of 1 g before closure in order to ensure optimal efficacy throughout the surgical procedure.

AB  == the salmonella typhimurium lt2 sialidase (neuraminidase, ec 3.2.1.18) structural  gene, nanh, has been cloned and sialidase overproduced from multicopy plasmids in escherichia coli. sialidase expression was regulated positively by camp. in contrast, certain tn1000 insertions located upstream of nanh coding sequences reduced sialidase activity. a nanh chromosomal insertion mutation constructed by  marker exchange demonstrated a single sialidase gene copy in s. typhimurium lt2.  the complete nucleotide sequence of nanh, encoding a 41,300 dalton polypeptide, was determined and the derived primary structure was similar to sialidases from clostridium perfringens, clostridium sordellii, bacteroides fragilis, and trypanosoma cruzi. comparative sequence analysis, including codon usage and secondary structure predictions, indicated that the s. typhimurium and clostridial sialidases are homologous, strongly suggestive of an interspecies gene transfer event. at least two primary sequence motifs of the bacterial enzymes were detected in influenza a virus sialidases. the predicted secondary structure of the bacterial enzymes was strikingly similar to viral sialidase. from the population distribution of nanh detected within a collection of salmonellae, it was apparent that s. typhimurium obtained its nanh copy most recently from salmonella arizonae. s. typhimurium lt2 is thus a genetic mosaic that differs from other strains of even the same serotype by nanh plus potentially additional characters linked to nanh. these results have relevance to the evolution and function of sialidases in pathogenic microbes, and to the origin of the sialic acids.

TI  == pathogenesis of hepatic atrophy in canine model of hepatolithiasis.
AB  == the pathogenesis of the hepatic atrophy that accompanies hepatolithiasis was investigated pathomorphologically using a canine model. two groups were evaluated: infected and noninfected. in the infected group, inflammation in glisson's capsule caused by cholangitis involved the portal vein at the region of the large bile duct. at this region, the periportal fibrosis ratio was significantly greater in the infected group than in the noninfected group both at 1 and 3 months. at the regions of the septal and interlobular bile ducts, the caliber ratio of the portal vein in the two experimental groups was less than in  the normal liver both at 1 and 3 months. at both regions, the caliber ratio of the portal vein in the infected group was less than in the noninfected group at 3 months. the rate of atrophy was significantly greater in the infected group than  in the noninfected group at 3 months. these results suggest that disturbance of the portal venous blood flow attributed to cholangitis of the large bile ducts is one of the most important factors leading to hepatic atrophy in hepatolithiasis.

TI  == beta-lactam enhancement of aminoglycoside activity under conditions of reduced ph and oxygen tension that may exist in infected tissues.
AB  == aminoglycoside activity is suppressed under conditions of low ph and oxygen tension that are likely to occur in infected tissues; the suppressive effects of  these conditions are additive. under aerobic conditions, the mic of amikacin for  10 isolates of escherichia coli was 4.8 +/- 0.7 micrograms/ml at ph 7.2 and increased to 40.0 +/- 8.2 micrograms/ml at ph 6.0. under anaerobic conditions, the mic of amikacin for e. coli was 30.0 +/- 1.5 micrograms/ml at ph 7.2 and greater than 50.0 micrograms/ml at ph 6.0. in vitro and in vivo studies of amikacin activity in an acidic and hypoxic milieu containing beta-lactamase demonstrated substantially enhanced bactericidal activity when amikacin and beta-lactams were used together. under conditions of reduced ph and oxygen tension, cefotaxime enhanced [3h]-tobramycin uptake by e. coli 14-fold and [3h]amikacin uptake 7-fold and appeared to overcome the suppressive effect of those conditions on uptake of aminoglycosides by bacteria.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of levofloxacin was compared with those of ofloxacin,  ciprofloxacin, and other antibiotics. in general, levofloxacin was equally active or up to fourfold more active than ofloxacin against all 801 organisms tested. levofloxacin was twofold [corrected] more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae and 2- to 4-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against  staphylococcus aureus, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis. levofloxacin was two- to eightfold more active than ciprofloxacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci and acinetobacter spp., although these improvements in potency may not be clinically relevant. levofloxacin inhibited 90% of streptococci when it was used at concentrations of 1 to 2 micrograms/ml. levofloxacin was two- to fourfold less active than ciprofloxacin against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae, such as escherichia coli; klebsiella pneumoniae; citrobacter, proteus, providencia, salmonella, and yersinia spp.; and pseudomonas aeruginosa. both compounds were equally active against pseudomonas cepacia. the in vitro dna gyrase inhibitory activity of levofloxacin was as potent as that of ciprofloxacin, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.65 micrograms/ml against an e. coli enzyme. in vivo, oral treatment with levofloxacin was as efficacious or more efficacious than that with ciprofloxacin  in systemic as well as pyelonephritis infections in mice. levofloxacin achieved higher concentrations in the serum and tissue of mice than did ciprofloxacin. this study presents some potential advantages of the pure l isomer of ofloxacin over ciprofloxacin and other quinolones.

TI  == heterologous gene expression in bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis and other gastrointestinal tract bacteroides are unusual gram-negative eubacteria in that genes from other gram-negative eubacteria are not expressed when introduced into these organisms. to analyze gene expression in bacteroides, expression vector and promoter probe (detection) vector systems were developed. the essential feature of the expression vector was the incorporation of a bacteroides insertion sequence element, is4351, which possesses promoter activity directed outward from its ends. genes inserted into the multiple cloning site downstream from an is4351 dna fragment were readily expressed in b. fragilis. the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) structural gene from tn9 was tested and conferred chloramphenicol resistance on b. fragilis. both chloramphenicol resistance and cat activity were shown to be dependent on the is4351 promoters. similar results were obtained with the escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase gene (uida) but activity was just 30% of the levels seen with  cat. two tetracycline resistance determinants, tetm from streptococcus agalactiae and tetc from e. coli, also were examined. tetc did not result in detectable tetracycline resistance but the gram-positive tetm gene conferred high-level resistance to tetracycline and minocycline in bacteroides hosts. based on the cat results, promoter probe vectors containing the promoterless cat gene were constructed. these vectors were used to clone random b. fragilis promoters from partial genomic libraries and the recombinants displayed a range of cat activities and chloramphenicol mics in b. fragilis hosts. in addition, known e. coli promoters (ptet, ptac, ptrc, psyn, and p1p2rrnb) were tested for activity in b. fragilis. no chloramphenicol resistance or cat activity was observed in b. fragilis with these promoters.

TI  == platelet-activating factor modulates endotoxin-induced macrophage procoagulant activity by a protein kinase c-dependent mechanism.
AB  == macrophage procoagulant activity is an important mediator of extravascular fibrin deposition at sites of infection and appears to contribute to the pathogenesis of several infectious disease processes. previous studies have shown that the inflammatory mediator platelet-activating factor was able to prime macrophages for induction of procoagulant activity by bacterial lipopolysaccharide. the present studies were designed to examine the mechanism of this priming effect. platelet-activating factor (100 nm) primed macrophages for procoagulant activity  generation in response to endotoxin at concentrations as low as 100 ng/ml and also following exposure to escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, and staphylococcus aureus. the priming effect occurred following a pretreatment with  platelet-activating factor for as short as 1 min, suggesting a rapid activation event. two different doses of the calcium ionophore ionomycin were used to mimic  the peak and sustained effects of platelet-activating factor on cytoplasmic calcium levels (1 microm and 100 nm, respectively). neither dose was able to mimic the priming effect. however, extracellular calcium was necessary for induction of procoagulant activity and the priming effect. by contrast, the protein kinase c agonist phorbol myristate acetate reproduced the priming phenomenon observed for platelet-activating factor. in further support of the concept that protein kinase c activation mediated the effect of platelet-activating factor, the specific protein kinase c inhibitor staurosporine reversed the ability of platelet-activating factor to augment induction of macrophage procoagulant activity by endotoxin. these data suggest mechanisms by which inflammatory mediators within the microenvironment of infection might modulate the host response to bacterial pathogens.

(3) an anaerobic inoculation 5 days after an aerobic inoculation, a) p. asaccharolyticus inoculation 5 days after e.  coli inoculation, b) b. fragilis inoculation 5 days after e. coli inoculation. the developments of several parameters (sialic acid levels, glucose levels, oxidation-reduction potential levels, bacterial counts and wbc counts in the pleural fluid and so on) were measured in each group. there was little difference of the rate of incidence of empyema between each group. empyema was highly induced even by a single anaerobe inoculation. the following tendencies were observed in development of parameters: (1) sialic acid levels and oxidation-reduction potential levels were decreased only in the conditions being  associated by b. fragilis infections. (2) in mixed infections of e. coli and anaerobes, bacterial counts of e. coli increased in number in the late phases of  the infections probably by the influences of anaerobes. the experiments of groups (2) and (3) were designed for demonstrations of biphasic infections between aerobes and anaerobes, but it turned out that quite unexpected results were seen  in these models.

AB  == cefetamet pivoxil is an oral, third-generation cephalosporin whose broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and favorable pharmacokinetic profile make it particularly suitable for the treatment of a wide range of infectious diseases. cefetamet has high in vitro activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria that cause a number of respiratory tract and urinary tract infections. these include penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus spp, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, proteus spp., klebsiella spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae. it is not active against staphylococci, enterococci, pseudomonas spp. or bacteroides fragilis but does inhibit most bile-sensitive (oral) bacteroides spp. animal toxicology studies indicate that neither cefetamet pivoxil nor the active compound cefetamet have significant teratogenic, mutagenic, photogenic or allergenic potential. cefetamet is eliminated unchanged in the urine with a half-life of 2.2 h. volume of distribution approximates the extracellular fluid space (0.3 1/kg), protein binding is minima (22%) and oral bioavailability of cefetamet pivoxil is approximately 50% when taken with food. no significant drug interactions have been noted to date. the efficacy and tolerability of cefetamet pivoxil have been  evaluated in the treatment of gram-positive and gram-negative infections in almost 5,000 patients. in comparative studies, cefetamet pivoxil was at least as  effective, and in many cases clinically superior, to most currently recommended antibiotics for the treatment of urinary tract infections including gonorrhea and complicated infections in high risk patients. efficacy has also been demonstrated in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pneumonia and infections of the ear, nose and throat. clinical trials have shown that a 7 day treatment period with cefetamet pivoxil is as effective as a 10 day course of phenoxymethylpenicillin in the treatment of pharyngotonsillitis. cefetamet pivoxil has been well-tolerated in clinical trials with only 1.2% of patients on  standard doses discontinuing therapy prematurely. the most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) which occur in less than 10% of patients. many current antibiotic treatment regimens involve the administration of three or more daily doses. however, standard doses of cefetamet pivoxil 500 mg twice daily provide unbound plasma concentrations of cefetamet which generally exceed the mic(90) for susceptible organisms throughout the dosing interval and have been demonstrated to be clinically effective. this should result in good compliance with therapy in out-patients. dosing regimens for cefetamet pivoxil should be adjusted in patients with impaired renal function while standard doses  can be given to elderly patients and those with liver disease. standard doses in  children are 10 mg/kg or alternatively, children may receive a dose reduced in proportion to the ratio of their body surface area to that of an adult.

TI  == bacteriology of anal fistulae.
AB  == anal fistulae are said to arise from cryptoglandular infection of the anal glands, which lie within the intersphincteric space. the type and virulence of the micro-organism responsible may determine whether an anal fistula develops. the microbiology of chronic anal fistulae has not been reported previously. twenty-five consecutive anal fistulae were studied prospectively (eight intersphincteric fistulae, 12 trans-sphincteric fistulae, two suprasphincteric fistulae, one extrasphincteric fistula, one superficial fistula, one anovaginal fistula). there were 18 men and seven women, with a median age of 42 (range 22-71) years. patients with crohn's disease or acute anorectal suppuration were excluded. in 18 patients, 0.1 ml granulation tissue from the track of the fistula was obtained and processed within 4 h using standard microbiological techniques.  sixty-nine isolates representing at least 17 species were obtained. the predominant organisms were escherichia coli (22 per cent), enterococcus spp. (16  per cent) and bacteroides fragilis (20 per cent). the majority of the growths were obtained only from enrichment. bacteria from only one patient grew at a dilution of 10(3). granulation tissue from 25 patients was processed for mycobacterial culture, and mycobacterium tuberculosis was grown from one patient. no other mycobacterium was isolated. the chronic inflammation in anal fistulae does not seem to be maintained by either excessive numbers of organisms or organisms of an unusual type.

TI  == increased passage of bovine serum albumin over the respiratory tract after intratracheal instillation during septic shock in rats.
AB  == sepsis may initiate acute respiratory distress syndrome which may be accompanied  by an increased pulmonary epithelial-endothelial permeability. in this study, sepsis was induced by an intraperitoneal implantation of gelatine capsules containing escherichia coli/bacteroides fragilis/adjuvant substance. the importance of bacteria in sepsis-related lung injury was studied in rats given an intraperitoneal injection of e. coli or in rats given the adjuvant substance alone in capsules intraperitoneally. rats with empty capsules were used as controls. the rats were intratracheally instilled with bovine serum albumin (bsa) directly after the capsule implantation or the injection of e. coli, and the passage over the lower respiratory tract was assessed as blood plasma levels of immunoreactive bsa. the plasma bsa levels in the control rats increased continuously up to 24 h after intratracheal instillation. this increase was significantly augmented already 1 h after the septic challenge, i.e. before any clinical symptoms were observed, in both the septic rats and the rats with the e. coli injected intraperitoneally. furthermore, the time required to obtain maximal plasma bsa levels was shorter in septic, adjuvant-exposed and in e. coli-injected rats than in the controls. the plasma levels and the total bsa passage over the lower respiratory tract was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) in the septic and in the e. coli-injected rats than in the adjuvant-exposed and the control rats.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == hyperbaric oxygenation decreases blood flows in normal and septic rats.
AB  == the purpose of the study reported here was to characterize the effects of acute exposure to 100% oxygen at a pressure of 202.6 kpa on hemodynamics and organ blood flow in antibiotic-controlled bacterial sepsis. an abscess containing known numbers and strains of live escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis was established in the peritoneal cavity of rats. sham-operated rats were used as controls. cardiac output, fractional blood flow distribution, and blood flow were calculated from data obtained using the radiolabeled microsphere technique. myocardial and renal blood flows were decreased (20-30%) in both experimental groups during hyperbaric oxygen (hbo) exposure. renal blood flow remained diminished for at least 20 min after rats were removed from the hyperbaric chamber. adrenal gland perfusion in abscess-containing rats was reduced both during and after hbo exposure. skeletal muscle blood flow (quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles) was reduced by one third in both experimental groups 20 min after acute exposure to hbo. the results of this study indicate that changes  in organ perfusion induced by hbo are similar in abscess-containing and normal rats. we conclude that hbo does not alter the regulation of blood flow in antibiotic-controlled sepsis.

TI  == [the influence of cefdinir on the intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  == the influence of cefdinir (cfdn), a new oral cephalosporin, on the intestinal bacterial flora was studied in tetra-contaminated mice and in pediatric patients. cfdn in fine granules was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice contaminated with 4 different species of organism: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve. no remarkable changes were observed in the fecal viable cell counts except that decreases in e. coli counts were observed on the day 3 to 5 after starting administration. the subjects in pediatric study were 7 children with infections,  3 boys and 4 girls, with their ages from 6 months to 12 years 7 months. their body weights ranged from 5.5 to 29.2 kg. cfdn fine granules was administered at each dose of 3.0 mg/kg to 3.7 mg/kg, 3 times a day for 4 to 14 days. during the administration of cfdn, some variations were observed in the pattern of changes in the fecal bacterial flora between subjects. although enterobacteriaceae and total counts of anaerobes were markedly decreased in 2 cases, total counts of aerobes were unchanged in the 2 cases, whereas main aerobes and anaerobes except  enterococci hardly varied in the other cases. there was no case in which glucose  non-fermenting gram-negative rods and fungi became predominant species continually. although clostridium difficile and c. difficile d-1 antigens were detected in 1 and 4 cases, respectively, no relationship was found between the number of c. difficile and the characteristics of the feces. with regard to the drug sensitivities of bacteria isolated from feces before and after administration of cfdn, higher levels of resistance were found in some bacteria such as enterococcus and bacteroides during or after administration than before administration. cfdn was detected in fecal samples from 2 cases during administration with concentrations ranging between 0.99-254 micrograms/g. high value of cfdn was found in a case with low beta-lactamase activity in feces, in which marked decrease of enterobacteriaceae and total counts of anaerobes was observed. the above results suggest that cfdn is considered to be a drug with relatively small influence on the intestinal bacterial flora. but as high concentrations of drugs were detected in feces under some circumstances, our attention will be required. particular care is also required for the occurrence of diarrhea and microbial replacement during continuous, long-term administration of the drug.

TI  == pathogenicity of bacteroides fragilis group in rat intra-abdominal abscesses.
AB  == attempts were made to study the pathogenicity of some strains of bacteroides fragilis group in the rat intra-abdominal abscess model. multiple intraabdominal  abscesses were produced in 50 to 70% of animals when an inoculum containing 10(9) cfu/ml of any of the five species of bacteroides fragilis group was injected. rising homologous antibody titers determined by indirect fluorescent antibody test were observed till the 3rd week when tested last, indirectly confirming the  multiplication of the organisms as also evident by viable count of bacteria in the abscesses. in some cases in addition to inoculated organisms some intestinal  bacteria like escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and streptococcus spp. were also recovered from the abscess pus. studies with the electron microscope showed  presence of capsular polysaccharide only in bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides  thetaiotaomicron. it was doubtful in bacteroides distasonis and absent in bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides vulgatus, suggesting that virulence factor beside the capsular polysaccharide may be playing a role. further studies are required to investigate the virulence factor responsible for the pathogenicity of noncapsulated species.

TI  == [bacterial translocation in crohn disease].
AB  == bacterial translocation is the passage of viable endogenous bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to mesenteric lymph nodes and other internal organs. the aim of this work was to study bacterial translocation in patients operated on for crohn's disease. twenty-eight patients, mean age 29 years, not having received any antibiotics since at least 8 days, presenting with ileal (n = 12), ileo-colonic (n = 14) or colonic (n = 2) crohn's disease were studied. in 25 out  of 28 cases (89%) indication for surgery was strictures inducing an upper small bowel distension in 9 out of 25 patients. mesenteric lymph nodes and liver biopsies, portal blood samples and peritoneum swabs were harvested after laparotomy and before gut opening. bacterial translocation, defined as the presence of intestinal bacteria in at least one of the specimens, was present in  8 out of 28 patients. this was found in lymph nodes draining surgical territories in 7 out of 8 cases. bacterial strains involved in translocation included e. coli (n = 5), enterococcus (n = 3), clostridium perfringens (n = 2), proteus (n = 2),  and bacteroides fragilis (n = 1). the rate of translocation differed neither according to crohn's disease site nor with perforating or non perforating type of the disease. five out of 9 patients operated on for strictures with proximal distension had a translocation. in conclusion, bacterial translocation was identified in 29% of patients operated on for crohn's disease in this series. distension of the intestine proximal to a digestive stricture could favor the occurrence of bacterial translocation in crohn's disease.

TI  == local beneficial effect of coumarin in experimental peritonitis.
AB  == coumarin, a potent immune stimulant and macrophage activator, has been used to treat brucellosis and as an immune suppressor. the effect of coumarin and systemic antibiotics on septicaemia, survival and peritoneal contamination in experimental peritonitis was assessed. four groups of male sprague-dawley rats were inoculated with clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis. group a received saline alone, group b received coumarin alone, group c received antibiotics (clindamycin and cephradine) alone and group d received both coumarin and antibiotics. septicaemia, confirmed by blood culture, occurred in all animals. coumarin did not improve survival whether given alone or in combination with antibiotics. animals given coumarin (groups b and d) had significantly less peritoneal soiling (54%, 0%) (p less than 0.02, p less than 0.001) than their controls (groups a and c: 92%; 29%). while coumarin did not improve resistance to septicaemia it did exert a local beneficial effect.

AB  == we investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antimicrobial agents at hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1989. the susceptibility testing was carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: (+++), (++), (+) and (-). ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, bacteroides fragilis and had rather strong activities against enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and achromobacter xylosoxidans, but was less active to staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and xanthomonas maltophilia. ipm has been found to have activities  superior to those of other antibiotics tested against e. faecalis, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis. no antibiotics tested showed good activities against mrsa except minocycline.

TI  == adjunctive antimicrobials in surgery of soft tissue infections: evaluation of cephalosporins and carbapenems.
AB  == the authors report three trials of b-lactams and carbapenems for soft tissue infections treated on a surgical service: 1) cefmetazole versus cefoperazone, n = 44; 2) cefotetan versus cefoxitin, n = 24; and 3) meropenem versus imipenem, n =  44. a total of 138 hospitalized patients were enrolled with 112 meeting evaluability criteria. four hundred twenty-three isolates were cultured (mean, three/patient) of which 67 per cent were aerobes and 33 per cent anaerobes. cure  rates for each trial were: 1) 93 per cent; 2) 92 per cent; 3) 100 per cent. failures were caused by resistant organisms (streptococcus group d, bacteroides fragilis and pseudomonas) appearing in incompletely drained infection sites. three patients receiving meropenem had adverse effects (headache, nausea) and one receiving cefoxitin (truncal rash). operative drainage and debridement remain the critical elements in therapy. agents with longer half lives allowing twice daily  dosing (cefmetazole and cefotetan) were as effective and less expensive than multiple doses of short-acting agents. the extended spectrum carbapenems are most useful for severe infections or resistant organisms.

TI  == pathogenesis of intraabdominal abscess formation: abscess-potentiating agents and inhibition of complement-dependent opsonization of abscess-inducing bacteria.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli are synergistic in the production of intraabdominal abscesses. however, these bacteria initiate abscess formation only when inoculated with an agent such as autoclaved colonic contents (acc) or bran (a fiber analogue). the mechanism of action of the abscess-potentiating agent was studied. opsonins in normal mouse serum were determined for phagocytic killing by murine neutrophils of b. fragilis and e. coli. opsonization required fixation of  complement by the alternative pathway. acc (0.2 mg/ml) and bran (1.0 mg/ml) inhibited phagocytic killing of proteus mirabilis in the presence of normal but not immune serum. assay of the alternative pathway of complement activation indicated that both bacterial components and abscess-potentiating agents in an abscess-inducing mixture activated complement. these findings suggest that abscess-potentiating agents inhibit opsonization and therefore the subsequent phagocytic killing of bacteria in the nonimmune host.

TI  == conjugal transfer of antibiotic resistance factors in bacteroides fragilis: the btga and btgb genes of plasmid pbftm10 are required for its transfer from bacteroides fragilis and for its mobilization by incp beta plasmid r751 in escherichia coli.
AB  == transferable plasmids play an important role in the dissemination of clindamycin-erythromycin resistance in bacteroides fragilis. we previously described the isolation and properties of pbftm10, a 14.9-kb clnr transfer factor from b. fragilis tmp10. we also reported the isolation of a transfer-deficient deletion derivative of pbftm10 contained in the b. fragilis-escherichia coli shuttle vector pgat400. in the present study we used pgat400 and a similar shuttle vector, pgat550, to characterize and sequence a region of pbftm10 required for its transfer from b. fragilis to b. fragilis or e. coli recipients and for its mobilization by the broad-host-range plasmid r751 from e. coli donors to e. coli recipients. deletion of certain bglii restriction fragments from pbftm10 resulted in partial or complete loss of transfer ability. tn1000 insertions into this same region also resulted in altered transfer properties. we used the sites of tn1000 insertions to determine the dna sequence of the transfer region. two potential open reading frames encoding proteins of 23.2 and 33.8 kda, corresponding to two genes, btga or btgb, were identified in the sequence. tn1000 insertions within btga or btgb or deletion of all or portions of btga or btgb resulted in either a transfer deficiency or greatly reduced transfer from b. fragilis donors and alterations in mobilization by r751 in e. coli. a potential orit sequence showing similarity in organization to the orit regions of the incp  plasmids was also detected. thus, pbftm10 encodes and requires at least two proteins necessary for efficient transfer from b. fragilis. these same functions  are expressed in e. coli and are required for mobilization by r751.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility vs. in vivo efficacy of various antimicrobial agents against the bacteroides fragilis group.
AB  == in vitro susceptibility testing is only one step in the evaluation of the potential efficacy of antimicrobial agents against the bacteroides fragilis group. an assessment of in vivo efficacy, with a consideration of the factors that can best be studied in an infected host, is also an integral part of this process. abscess models in rodents have been used to correlate in vitro activity  with in vivo efficacy against this group of microorganisms. for metronidazole, clindamycin, moxalactam, and cefoxitin, the correlation was strong; for chloramphenicol and carbenicillin, it was not. in vivo studies of mixed infection with the b. fragilis group and escherichia coli showed that cefoxitin and imipenem were effective; in contrast, cefotetan was not effective against resistant strains. only strains susceptible to ceftizoxime in the agar dilution test were also affected by this drug in vivo. the so-called inoculum effect noted with ceftizoxime may explain this finding. in vivo elimination of encapsulated organisms of the b. fragilis group was found to be more difficult than elimination of unencapsulated isolates. the beta-lactamase produced by bacteroides species can protect the enzyme-producing organism as well as its partners in mixed infections from the effects of beta-lactam antibiotics. these data illustrate the complexity and difficulties encountered when in vitro activity is correlated with in vivo efficacy.

AB  == morphologic changes of the intrahepatic bile ducts after induction of bile stasis and bacterial infection of the biliary tract in two lobes of the liver in mongrel dogs were studied to examine the pathophysiology of hepatolithiasis. three groups of dogs were prepared by cannulation of the bile duct branch draining the left lateral lobes of the liver and were treated as follows: in group 1 the cannula was clamped after injection of 10(7) escherichia coli (aerobic bacteria) and 10(7) bacteroides fragilis (anaerobic bacteria) organisms; in group 2 the cannula was clamped after injection of e. coli only; and in group 3 the cannula was clamped without injection of bacteria. three months later the livers of killed dogs were examined. in group 1 epithelial adenomatous hyperplasia was noted in association with chronic cholangitis characterized by moderate to severe periductal fibrosis with a large number of inflammatory cells. in group 2 periductal fibrosis was severe, but epithelial hyperplasia was found to a much lesser degree than in group 1. in group 3 no periductal fibrosis or epithelial adenomatous hyperplasia was demonstrated. these findings suggest that adenomatous hyperplasia of the bile duct epithelium may be caused by bacterial infection of the biliary tract in combination with bile stasis.

AB  == a semi-quantitative bacteriological method was used to study faecal flora in 42 patients with crohn's disease, 37 with ulcerative colitis and 21 healthy controls. faecal homogenates were plated on primary isolation plates by a technique that allowed the growth of various microbial isolates to be assessed on a visual 1(+)-5+ score. this method was first calibrated against a standard quantitative bacteriological technique, which confirmed the reliability and reproducibility of the results obtained by the simpler method. patients with clinically active crohn's disease (22) had significantly higher total aerobe scores than patients with quiescent disease (20) (p less than or equal to 0.006)  or ulcerative colitis (p less than or equal to 0.04) or normal controls (p less than or equal to 0.02). the scores of escherichia coli were parallel to those of  total aerobes. lactobacillus and bifidobacteria scores were significantly reduced in patients with crohn's disease compared to those with ulcerative colitis and controls. the anaerobic flora in both crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis was  indistinguishable from that of controls. bacteroides vulgatus and b. fragilis were the predominant bacteroides in all groups. patients with ulcerative colitis, regardless of disease activity, harboured faecal flora that did not differ from that of normal controls. the abnormal faecal flora in crohn's disease did not correlate with established clinical and laboratory indicators of disease activity.

AB  == sepsis was produced in rats by implanting into their abdominal cavities fecal pellets containing escherichia coli (10(2) colony-forming units [cfu]) and bacteroides fragilis (10(4) cfu). control rats were implanted with sterile pellets. a febrile response and hyperlactacidemia marked the onset of the septic  injury. control and septic rats were killed 24 and 48 hr after implantations, and posterior leg muscles were removed. muscles were homogenized to prepare soluble fractions containing calcium-independent lysosomal (cathepsins b and l) and calcium-dependent cytosolic (calpain) proteases. cathepsin and calpain activities were then assayed using standard procedures. there were no alterations in cathepsins b or l activities during sepsis. calpain activity in septic muscle was significantly higher than that in control muscles. in vitro calpain sensitivity to ca2+ was also higher in septic muscle than in controls. the cysteine protease  inhibitor leupeptin caused a quantitatively greater inhibition of calpain activity in septic than in control muscles. these data indicate that whereas sepsis has no effect on ca(2+)-insensitive lysosomal proteases, it is associated  with an elevation of the ca(2+)-dependent cytosolic protease activity.

TI  == beta-lactamase produced by a highly beta-lactam-resistant strain of bacteroides fragilis: an obstacle to the chemotherapy of experimental mixed infections.
AB  == a strain of bacteroides fragilis, which produces a metallo-beta-lactamase, was inoculated into pouches on the backs of rats together with a beta-lactamase-negative escherichia coli highly sensitive to beta-lactam antibiotics. the mixed infection rat pouch model was treated with either flomoxef (susceptible to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase produced by b. fragilis), or cefmetazole (relatively resistant to hydrolysis). in this model of mixed infection flomoxef showed weak in-vivo activity against e. coli, although showing the same strong activity in a model of single infection with e. coli. on the other hand, cefmetazole showed strong activity against e. coli, even in the model of mixed infection. the concentrations of both drugs in the pouches were decreased in infections with the strain of b. fragilis. there was a greater decrease in the concentration of flomoxef than of cefmetazole. flomoxef was unstable whereas cefmetazole was relatively stable in the pouch exudates that had been infected with b. fragilis. these experimental data suggest that bacteria that produce a metallo-beta-lactamase decrease the in-vivo efficacy of beta-lactam antibiotics against other co-infecting bacteria. thus, it is suggested that it is important in the chemotherapy of mixed bacterial infections  that include these highly resistant beta-lactamase-producing bacteria to use antibiotics that are stable to hydrolysis by these enzymes.

AB  == single 2-g intravenous doses of ceftizoxime (czx) and cefotaxime (ctx) were given over 30 min to 10 adult volunteers in a crossover manner on two separate occasions. concentrations of czx, ctx, and the primary metabolite of ctx, desacetylcefotaxime (dctx), in serum, suction-induced-blister fluid, and urine were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by using an extended least-squares modeling program (mkmodel). czx exhibited a half-life in serum (2.05 h) longer than that of ctx (1.43 h) but comparable to that of dctx (2.02 h). the percentage of penetration in blister fluid, estimated by area under the curve ratios, was significantly higher for czx (164.4%) than for ctx (60.8%). serum bactericidal activity, determined for volunteer samples at 1, 6, 8, and 12 h after patients were dosed,  against clinical isolates of the bacteroides fragilis group, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and morganella morganii were significantly higher for czx than those for ctx against members of the family enterobacteriaceae at all times. serum bactericidal titers against b. fragilis were also higher for czx than for ctx at 1 h postinfusion. neither czx nor ctx exhibited any bactericidal activity at any other time against the b. fragilis group. in conclusion, the serum bactericidal activity of czx was greater and more-prolonged than that of ctx against tested strains in spite of the in vitro synergistic contribution of dctx to ctx, equal serum elimination half-lives of dctx and czx, and similar antibacterial activity and similar instability under microbiological testing for czx and ctx.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
AB  == tazobactam (ytr 830), a new beta-lactamase inhibitor, was evaluated for its effect in combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum, but beta-lactamase sensitive, penicillin, against 14 common bacteria. a total of 1,086 clinical isolates from different clinical specimens were tested for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. their susceptibilities  to piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam in a ratio of 8:1 by the agar dilution method were evaluated. the percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 14.5% to 100% in these tested species. in general, the beta-lactamase producers were more resistant to piperacillin than the beta-lactamase nonproducers with higher minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). for the beta-lactamase producers, tazobactam decreased the mics of piperacillin prominently in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, salmonella species and bacteroides fragilis, with a 4-fold or greater decrease in mic50, mic90 and the geometric mean of mic. for serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mics did not change after adding tazobactam. for other species, there was a moderate decrease in mics. we conclude that tazobactam is an effective beta-lactamase inhibitor for increasing the antimicrobial activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase producing strains of many species of bacteria.

TI  == [beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations for oral administration].
AB  == beta-lactamase inhibitors are compounds which are able to bind many beta-lactamase and to inactivate them irreversibly ("suicide inactivators"). their intrinsic antimicrobial activity is weak. however, in combination with aminopenicillins they exhibit marked synergism both in vitro and in vivo against  many beta-lactamase producing bacterial strains. at the achievable serum and tissue concentrations after oral administration, various aminopenicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations are active against many strains of beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, bacteroides fragilis and staphylococci. at levels achievable in the  urine, they are also active against many strains of escherichia coli, proteus spp. and klebsiella spp. clinically, they have been shown to be effective in the  treatment of various human infections of the urinary tract, airways, skin, soft tissues, ear and sinuses. mild gastrointestinal disturbances are the most commonly encountered side effects. aminopenicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations may be a suitable therapeutic option in treating mild to moderately  severe infections, i.e. in an outpatient setting.

TI  == antiseptic effectiveness with fibroblast preservation.
AB  == the efficacy of topical antiseptic therapy for wounds and skin ulcers has been shown to be at the expense of fibroblast and leukocyte function and, in general,  wound healing. specifically, continued fibroblast function after exposure to antiseptics has been correlated to the concentration of the antiseptic. at concentrations that preserve fibroblast function, 0.005% sodium hypochlorite, 0.001% providone-iodine, 0.0025% acetic acid, and 0.003% hydrogen peroxide were tested for their effectiveness against various clinical isolates. staphylococcus  aureus, escherichia coli, group d enterococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis were exposed to the antiseptics and plated in a standard microbiological fashion. the cultures showed that sodium hypochlorite inhibited the growth of all the bacteria (p less than 0.001), whereas povidone-iodine reduced the colonies of s. aureus and acetic acid inhibited p. aeruginosa. our study suggests that 0.005% sodium hypochlorite can be used as a debriding and topical antibacterial agent for wounds and skin ulcers without inhibiting fibroblast activity essential to normal wound repair.

TI  == intravascular plastic catheters. how they potentiate tumor necrosis factor release and exacerbate complications associated with sepsis.
AB  == we tested the hypothesis that long-term intravascular cannulation exacerbates the harmful effects of an infectious challenge. four groups of rats were initially studied: rats without intravascular catheters or infection (group 1), rats without catheters with a polymicrobial infection (group 2), rats with catheters but no infection (group 3), and rats with catheters and infection (group 4). infected animals had an increased mortality and generated a significantly increased tumor necrosis factor response compared with noninfected animals. animals with catheters and infection generated far less cardiac output than animals from the other three groups. no histologic changes differentiated the four groups. therefore, the presence of a sterile intravascular catheter significantly increases cardiac dysfunction and mortality rates in rats with chronic bacteremia. these results suggest that intravascular plastic catheters potentiate the destructive cascade of events produced by the host in response to  bacteremia.

TI  == [a comparative study of bacteroides fragilis and e. coli related to the pathogenesis of calcium bilirubinate gallstones].
AB  == a comparative study of bacteroides fragilis and e. coli bacterial infection in the biliary tract in relation to the pathogenesis of pigment stone formation was  carried out on the basis of gallstone rabbit's model of anaerobic bacterial infection. one hundred and twenty japanese hybrid big-ear white rabbits were randomly divided into four groups: 14 in control group, 31 in b. fragilis (bf) group, 42 in e. coli group and 33 in the mixed group. in the experimental groups  we successfully made gallstone formation in aerobic, anaerobic and mixed bacterial infections in biliary tracts respectively. on 7, 15 and 30 postoperative days the survival rabbits were sacrificed for investigations. our experiments demonstrated that the incidence and amount of stone formation in the  mixed group were the highest among the experiment groups. the key point to preclude stone formation was to control the bacterial infection in the biliary tract as early as possible. the results suggested that the ability of production  of beta-glucuronidase in bf group was significantly higher than that in e. coli group. the author considered that bf was more important than e. coli in the pathogenesis of calcium bilirubinate gallstone formation.

TI  == bactericidal activity of sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin under anaerobic conditions.
AB  == the kill kinetics of sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin have been investigated under  anaerobic conditions against bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli. the results for e. coli were compared with those obtained under aerobic conditions. it was found that the quinolones were bactericidal under anaerobic conditions. this bactericidal activity is inhibited by the presence of chloramphenicol, a known protein synthesis inhibitor. filamentation was seen with b. fragilis after  2 h exposure to either agent.

TI  == the aeromonas hydrophila cpha gene: molecular heterogeneity among class b metallo-beta-lactamases.
AB  == an aeromonas hydrophila gene, named cpha, coding for a carbapenem-hydrolyzing metallo-beta-lactamase, was cloned in escherichia coli by screening an aeromonas  genomic library for clones able to grow on imipenem-containing medium. from sequencing data, the cloned cpha gene appeared able to code for a polypeptide of  254 amino acids whose sequence includes a potential n-terminal leader sequence for targeting the protein to the periplasmic space. these data were in agreement  with the molecular mass of the original aeromonas enzyme and of the recombinant enzyme produced in e. coli, evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of crude beta-lactamase preparations followed by renaturation treatment for proteins separated in the gel and localization of protein bands showing carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase activity by a modified iodometric technique. the deduced amino acid sequence of the cpha enzyme showed regions of partial homology with both the beta-lactamase ii of bacillus cereus and the cfia  beta-lactamase of bacteroides fragilis. sequence homologies were more pronounced  in the regions encompassing the amino acid residues known in the enzyme of b. cereus to function as ligand-binding residues for the metal cofactor. the cpha enzyme, however, appeared to share a lower degree of similarity with the two other enzymes, which, in turn, seemed more closely related to each other. these results, therefore, suggest the existence of at least two molecular subclasses within molecular class b metallo-beta-lactamases.

TI  == antibacterial activities of amoxicillin alone and in combination with clavulanic  acid correlated with beta-lactamase production.
AB  == amoxicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic, was tested for its effect in combination with clavulanic acid, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, against 9 species of bacteria isolated from clinical specimens. a total of 698 strains of bacteria were tested  for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. their susceptibilities to amoxicillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid were tested by the agar dilution method. the percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 46.6% in proteus mirabilis to 100% in klebsiella pneumoniac. in general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to amoxicillin than beta-lactamase producers. for beta-lactamase producers, clavulanic acid decreased the mics of amoxicillin prominently in strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae and bacteroides fragilis, when combining clavulanic acid with amoxicillin in the ratio of 1:2. their mic50s, mic90s and geometric means of mics all decreased 4 folds or greater. for beta-lactamase non-producing strains, the mics did not show significant differences by adding clavulanic acid in most species we tested, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, n. gonorrhoeae, h. influenzae, proteus vulgaris and e. cloacae.

TI  == autologous fibrin gel: bactericidal properties in contaminated hepatic injury.
AB  == fibrin glue is an effective hemostatic agent in a variety of clinical situations; its utility is limited by potential transmission of viral infection. we studied the bactericidal properties of fibrin gel (fg) in a murine contaminated hepatic injury model and in vitro by agar plate culture method. intra-abdominal abscess formation and adhesion rate were assessed following controlled liver injury in association with abdominal contamination with 10(7) bacteroides fragilis and hepatorrhaphy (h, n = 15) or fg (n = 12). animals treated by hepatorrhaphy had a  significantly greater intra-abdominal abscess rate (15/15 vs. 4/12, p less than 0.05) and adhesion rate (14/15 vs. 6/12, p less than 0.05) than animals treated with fg. fibrin gel is bactericidal to bacteroides fragilis, enterobacter faecium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus but has no effect against klebsiella pneumoniae or pseudomonas aeruginosa; the plasma component appears active. fibrin gel demonstrates significant improvement in adhesion formation and intra-abdominal abscess rate when compared with suture hepatorrhaphy. fibrin gel  appears protective in contaminated hepatic injury.

TI  == early events after intra-abdominal infection with bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli.
AB  == growth of bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli was monitored during early stages of single (mono-) and mixed intra-abdominal infection in a rat fibrin clot model. when b. fragilis and e. coli were together involved in the infection, b. fragilis numbers increased about 6 h after an initial decline. this increase was  not found with b. fragilis mono-infections. the numbers of e. coli increased rapidly in both mono- and mixed infections and stayed high for several days, but  only mixed infection resulted in abscesses that persisted for more than 7 days. macrophages, the main component of the peritoneal cellular defence mechanism, were outnumbered by polymorphonuclear leucocytes during the first 6 h of infection. further characterisation of the macrophage population by means of monoclonal antibodies showed a shift from resident to exudate macrophages as the  result of influx of the latter.

TI  == vaginal bacteroides species are associated with an increased rate of preterm delivery among women in preterm labor.
AB  == the relationship of high concentrations of vaginal microorganisms with an increased rate of preterm delivery (less than or equal to 34 weeks) among women in preterm labor was evaluated. quantitative vaginal cultures were obtained from  211 women in preterm labor between gestational ages of 22 and 34 completed weeks. preterm delivery occurred in 139 (66%). the rate of preterm delivery was determined by cox proportional hazards models. women with greater than 10(7) cfu/ml of vaginal fluid of facultative lactobacilli had a 40% decreased rate of preterm delivery (rate ratio [rr] = 0.6, 95% confidence interval (ci) = 0.4-0.9). an increased rate of preterm delivery occurred among women with bacteroides bivius at concentrations of greater than 10(4) cfu/ml (rr = 2.0, 95% ci = 1.4-2.9) and bacteroides fragilis (rr = 1.7, 95% ci = 1.0-2.8). other microorganisms, including gardernella vaginalis, the genital mycoplasmas, group b streptococci, escherichia coli, and peptostreptococcus species, were not associated with an increased rate of preterm delivery for women in preterm labor.

TI  == escherichia coli chromosomal mutations that permit direct cloning of the bacteroides fragilis metallo-beta-lactamase gene, ccra.
AB  == the class b, metallo-beta-lactamase genes ccra (carbapenem- and cephamycin resistance) from three bacteroides fragilis isolates--qmcn3, qmcn4, and tal3636--were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. cloning of the genes, by  selecting for ampicillin resistance, was facilitated by two classes of escherichia coli chromosomal mutations which resulted in at least a 5-10-fold increase in metallo-beta-lactamase enzymatic activity. the observed increase in enzymatic activity is due to either increased translation of the ccra gene or an  effect on localization or stability of the protein. comparison of the dna sequences of the three ccra genes revealed that their protein-coding sequences shared greater than 97% dna sequence identity. however, the 5' upstream sequence  for the tal3636 ccra gene was unrelated to that of the other two genes.

TI  == differentiation of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides and haemophilus species in gram-stained direct smears.
AB  == the accuracy of examination of the gram-stained direct smear to classify presumptively gram-negative rods into three morphotype groups, that is, (a) enteric bacteria, (b) pseudomonas, and (c) bacteroides or haemophilus, was evaluated. randomly selected clinical strains (4-9) each of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, ps. aeruginosa, b. fragilis, and h. influenzae were used to produce peritonitis or subcutaneous abscesses in mice. a  gram-stained direct smear was prepared from exudate collected from each animal. the direct smears were examined to classify bacteria observed into one of the three morphotype groups. the percent accuracy was 82, 56, and 95, respectively, and 76 overall. the assumption was made that classification was based primarily on differences in length and width of the organisms. to test this hypothesis, we  prepared scanning electron photomicrographs from each specimen of exudate and measured the lengths and widths of bacteria. examination of the gram-stained direct smear was more accurate for classification of enteric bacteria, h. influenzae, or b. fragilis. electron microscopy was more accurate for classification of ps. aeruginosa. the higher length-width radio should be helpful in recognizing ps. aeruginosa in direct smears.

AB  == the bacteria found in the bile and blood of 45 patients (27 men, 18 women; mean age 69 years) suffering from acute cholangitis with gallstones were studied in order to determine the appropriate antibiotic therapy. before any antibiotic was  prescribed, a series of haemocultures was performed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and later gallbladder bile samples were taken during the operation. blood cultures were positive in 55 percent of the cases and bile cultures in 84 percent. the bacteria most frequently encountered in blood were escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and bacteroides fragilis. the frequency of bacteria passage from  bile to blood was studied and clearly showed a predominance of e. coli, klebsiella and anaerobes. enterococci passed into the blood stream only in very special circumstances, such as endoscopic sphincteromy or inadequate antibiotic therapy. to be effective, the antibiotic treatment should cover enterobacteriaceae, anaerobes and, if required, staphylococci. enterococci can be ignored in most cases.

TI  == [influence of cefodizime on intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  == effects of cefodizime (cdzm), a new injectable cephem antibiotic, on the intestinal bacterial flora were studied in tetra-contaminated mice and in pediatric patients. cdzm was intramuscularly administered at a dose of 100 mg/kg  once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice contaminated with 4 different species of organisms: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve. for 3 species except e. faecalis, bacterial populations in feces were markedly reduced after the start of the treatment. subjects in the pediatric study were 5 children with bacterial infections (4 boys and 1 girl) at  ages from 7 months to 9 years 6 months and with their body weights ranging from 7.6 kg to 51.1 kg. cdzm was intravenously administered at a dose of 9.7 mg/kg to  23.0 mg/kg 4 times a day for 5 to 15 days. although some variations in the fecal  bacterial flora were noticed among these subjects during the treatment, populations of main aerobes and anaerobes such as enterobacteriaceae, enterococcus, bacteroides, bifidobacterium and eubacterium decreased markedly in  most cases. glucose non-fermenting gram-negative rods and fungi tended to increase during or after the administration of cdzm, and they were the most predominant species in some cases. although these changes tended to return to predosing states after the cessation of the treatment with cdzm, attention must be paid to possible occurrences of diarrhea, superinfection or bleeding tendency  when treatment with the drug is continued for long periods of time. fecal concentrations of cdzm considered to be closely related to the changes of the intestinal bacterial flora showed pretty high values in all cases.

TI  == the dynamics of intraperitoneal growth and elimination of escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis in porcine faecal peritonitis treated with fosfomycin.
AB  == the kinetics of intraperitoneal killing of proliferating bacteria was studied in  pigs given fosfomycin. eight animals were given intra-abdominal injection of escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis (10(9) cfu of each species) mixed in sterile faces. three hours later, half of the animals received an intravenous dose of 1 g fosfomycin (0.05 g/kg). host defences rapidly decreased the density of e. coli in all animals in the first hour. after 2h, growth of e. coli started  and continued throughout the experiment in pigs not receiving fosfomycin. b. fragilis was slowly eliminated in the first 5 6 h, then numbers increased in all  animals. fosfomycin caused a reduction in e. coli density, by 10(2.19) +/- 0.29 (mean +/- s.e.m.) cfu/ml, or more than 150 times within 1 h, while the concentration of b. fragilis was unaltered. after 10 h the difference in e. coli  density between fosfomycin treated and untreated animals was 10(4.96) cfu/ml (p less than 0.01). fosfomycin eradicated e. coli in faecal peritonitis but not b. fragilis, which is resistant in vitro. there was a prolonged elimination of the drug from peritoneal exudate in pigs infected with bacteria in sterile faeces compared to the elimination in uninfected pigs or pigs infected only with bacteria.

TI  == comparative efficacies of ticarcillin, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin  and cefoxitin against polymicrobial infections in mice caused by escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == a model of localised abscess formation was used to establish mixed infections caused by escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis. the beta-lactamase producing, ticarcillin-resistant strains e. coli e96 and b. fragilis vpi 8708 were used to produce one infection, and in another infection, a beta-lactamase hyperproducing strain e. coli 41548 was combined with a ticarcillin-susceptible strain, b. fragilis b3. treatment, at doses producing clinically achievable concentrations in mouse serum, began 1 h after inoculation, and continued three times daily for four days. bacterial numbers in infected tissue were measured at  intervals. against both infections, ticarcillin was ineffective in preventing bacterial growth and abscess formation in all mice. piperacillin prevented abscess formation in 60% of the mice infected with e. coli e96/b. fragilis vpi 8708, and in 40% of those in the e. coli 41548/b. fragilis b3 group. therapy with ticarcillin/clavulanic acid or cefoxitin reduced the number of both organisms at  the site of infection, and thus prevented abscess formation in 100% treated animals.

TI  == the peritoneal environment during infection. the effect of monomicrobial and polymicrobial bacteria on po2 and ph.
AB  == intraperitoneal (ip) abscesses frequently are composed of aerobes and anaerobes,  and, in experimental models, a particulate adjuvant. the environmental changes effected by these components, either singularly or in combination, have not been  well defined. the ip po2, ph, and recoverable bacteria from the peritoneum of rats were quantified over 6 hours during simple aerobic and anaerobic infections  and during mixed peritonitis with and without a sterile feces-barium sulfate adjuvant (sfa). fourteen groups were studied, receiving intraperitoneally, at time of oxygen probe placement, 1 ml normal saline (control), escherichia coli (ec), bacteroides fragilis (bf), sfa alone, or a mixture of ec and bf, ec and sfa, bf and sfa, or ec, bf, and sfa. control animals exhibited a stable ip po2 and ph during 6 hours. in monomicrobial ec peritonitis, inocula well below the ld50 produced an increased ip po2 and reduced arterial-peritoneal gradient (apg), with a stable ip ph. by 6 hours lethal doses of ec produced a dramatic decline in ip po2, with no change in arterial po2 as well as acidic ip and arterial phs. simple bf peritonitis caused no or minor elevations in ip and arterial po2 with no change in ph. during mixed infections a significant decline in the ip po2 and  ph at 6 hours in those groups infected with both sfa and ec of a moderate, normally sublethal inoculation was observed, while arterial po2 was unchanged and arterial ph was decreased only slightly. concomitantly there was a significant increased number of aerobic bacteria in those groups with sfa as adjuvant compared to similar inocula without sfa. this study demonstrates the complex interactions of bacteria, sterile particulate adjuvant (sfa), and the host peritoneum. it suggests that the combination of sfa and aerobic bacteria alter the peritoneal environment to one permitting anaerobic growth and promoting abscess formation.

TI  == preexposure of the peritoneum to live bacteria increases later mixed intraabdominal abscess formation and delays mortality.
AB  == intraabdominal infections are a major source of morbidity and mortality for the trauma and postoperative patient. transient peritoneal contamination with bacteria after either intentional or unintentional violation of the gut are common. the effect of this intermittent antigen exposure upon later formation of  intraabdominal abscesses is unclear. previous experiments by others have demonstrated that repeated exposure to bacteroides fragilis capsular polysaccharide can induce a t lymphocyte-mediated immunity to subsequent induction of pure b. fragilis abscess formation. in a murine mixed intraabdominal abscess model, preexposure to live escherichia coli, b. fragilis, or both increased the number of later abscesses and in some cases their bacterial composition. further, immunization with e. coli alone increased late mortality without altering overall mortality. these data suggest that the alterations of immune function produced by live, transient bacteria upon subsequent mixed intraabdominal abscess induction result in fundamentally different consequences from those observed after specific polysaccharide antigen exposure and subsequent monomicrobial abscess induction.

TI  == prostaglandin production by amnion and decidual cells in response to bacterial products.
AB  == media from bacterial cultures have been tested for actions on prostaglandin biosynthesis by human amnion and decidual cells. the bacterial species, which are commonly associated with intrauterine infections, were group b streptococcus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, gardnerella vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhea, mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum. overall, low doses of bacterial products were stimulatory of amnion prostaglandin production, whereas high doses were inhibitory. a similar pattern of results was  obtained for effects on decidual prostaglandin production, although stimulatory actions at low doses were less pronounced. in all experiments interleukin 1 beta  consistently induced a stimulation of prostaglandin production that greatly exceeded that caused by any bacterial product. it is possible that the inhibitory action of high doses of bacterial products on prostaglandin biosynthesis may contribute to the poor course of labor experienced by women with chorioamnionitis. furthermore, these data lend credence to the view that the host response to infection (i.e. cytokine secretion) is the major mediator of subsequent preterm labor.

TI  == transient and distant infections alter later intraperitoneal abscess formation.
AB  == transient nosocomial infections, such as line sepsis and pneumonia, are common in today's critical care patient population. although generally well treated, the effect of these transient antigen exposures on the immune system is unclear. we have previously shown that prior intraperitoneal inoculation with live bacteria leads to increased numbers of intraperitoneal abscesses. data presented here demonstrate in a murine model that two immunizations with live escherichia coli,  bacteroides fragilis, or both, administered systemically via intracardiac injection or at a focal distant site in subcutaneous tissue, significantly increased the number of mixed e coli/b fragilis intraperitoneal abscesses when induced 1 week later. further, immunization with e coli, either alone or in combination with b fragilis, increased the total number of anaerobes recovered per mouse. transient or focal sublethal infections can significantly alter an animal's immune response to later infectious insults, particularly the formation  of intraperitoneal abscesses.

TI  == bacterial killing in vitro by abscess-derived neutrophils.
AB  == in the absence of antimicrobial therapy, bacteria such as bacteriodes fragilis, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis may persist within an intra-abdominal abscess in the presence of large numbers of neutrophils which, under optimal conditions in vitro, can readily phagocytose and kill the same bacterial strains. neutrophils taken from abscesses induced by gram-negative bacteria such as those  above contain viable organisms. on incubation in vitro in the presence of serum,  these neutrophils kill the bacteria phagocytosed in the abscess poorly, if at all, yet can readily kill organisms added in vitro. to determine possible mechanisms that might explain this, we examined the bactericidal activity in vitro of neutrophils from a range of abscesses induced by one or two species of bacteria plus an abscess-potentiating agent, bran. the organisms studied were b.  fragilis, e. coli, p. mirabilis and staphylococcus aureus. the killing in vitro of e. coli and p. mirabilis, engulfed within an abscess, was significantly less than that of the same organisms when they were added to the in-vitro assay. in contrast, the killing of s. aureus was similar, whether engulfed in vivo or in vitro. however, s. aureus was less susceptible to phagocytosis and killing in vitro than p. mirabilis or e. coli, and the killing of s. aureus during in-vitro  incubation of neutrophils that had engulfed the organism with in the abscess was  similar to that of the gram-negative bacteria engulfed within the abscess.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == specimens obtained from 736 patients with obstetric and gynecologic infections were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. bacterial growth was present in  714 specimens. these included 53 specimens of infected fallopian tubes, 470 of infected endometrium, 94 of infected amniotic fluid, 57 of aspirates of cul-de-sacs in instances of pelvic inflammatory disease, 14 labial and vaginal abscesses and 26 of bartholyn's cyst abscess. a total of 2,052 isolates (2.9 per  specimen), 1,139 anaerobes (1.6 per specimen) and 913 aerobic or facultative (1.3 per specimen) were recovered. the most commonly isolated anaerobic bacteria was bacteroides species (566 isolates), which included bacteroides bivius (151), bacteroides fragilis group (130), bacteroides melaninogenicus group (110) and bacteroides ureolyticus (47). others included an anaerobic gram-positive cocci (391), clostridium species (48) and fusobacterium species (36). the most frequently recovered aerobic and facultative bacteria were lactobacillus species  (169), escherichia coli (85), neisseria gonorrhoeae (62), staphylococcus aureus (59) and group b streptococcus (55). three hundred and sixty-five (18 per cent) of the isolates recovered from 276 (39 per cent) patients were beta-lactamase producing organisms (blpo); 222 (61 per cent) anaerobes and 143 (39 per cent) aerobes or facultatives. the most common blpo were b. fragilis group, b. bivius,  b. melaninogenicus, b. disiens, enterobacteriaceae and s. aureus. these data illustrate the polymicrobial nature and important role of blpo in obstetric and gynecologic infection.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of intravenous quinolones on the intestinal microflora in  dogs.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of intravenously given quinolones on the intestinal microflora was unknown and therefore studied in dogs with a surgically isolated loop of the jejunum. ciprofloxacin, enoxacin and norfloxacin were actively excreted by the intestinal mucosa and achieved therapeutic levels within the lumen of this isolated jejunal loop. also the total counts of enterococci and escherichia coli decreased in this loop of the jejunum as well as in the stool. all three quinolones, when given intravenously, decreased the total counts of anaerobic bacteria including bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == the effect of antimicrobial therapy on mixed infections with bacteroides species. is eradication of the anaerobes important?
AB  == antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations in order to explore their effect on mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections. subcutaneous abscesses were induced in mice by single and mixed infections of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the infected animals were treated for 5 days with spiramycin, gentamicin or metronidazole alone, or metronidazole combined with spiramycin or gentamicin. animals were killed 5 days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses determined. infection induced by a single species of bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. in infections caused by two species of organisms, however, therapy directed at either the bacteroides sp. (with metronidazole) or the aerobes or facultative anaerobes (with spiramycin or  gentamicin) was effective not only in significantly reducing the numbers of the target organism but also, in 13 of 24 instances, in reducing to a small extent the numbers of the other bacteria. despite this phenomenon, in no instance did therapy with a single agent eliminate the infection and eradicate the untargeted  organism. the combination of spiramycin and metronidazole increased the reduction in numbers of b. melaninogenicus in single-organism infections and of bacteroides sp. in mixed infections with s. aureus and s. pyogenes. these findings support the need to aim treatment at all components of mixed infections.

TI  == the viability of microorganisms in preservation solutions.
AB  == in 1988 the university of wisconsin solution was introduced into clinical transplantation. this solution is unique in that it contains no glucose but rather raffinose, lactobionate, and hydroxyethyl starch. in addition, it contains two antibiotics, penicillin and bactrim. prior studies have shown that other preservation solutions allow the transmission of bacterial contamination from organ donor to recipient. however, there are no data on whether uw solution, with its unique composition and extended preservation times, allows bacterial transmission. we undertook the present study to establish if bacteria remain viable in uw solution at extended preservation times. cultures of both aerobic (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and anaerobic (bacteroides fragilis) bacteria were suspended at 10(5), 10(4), 10(2), and 10(1) org./ml (calibrated from a .5 macfarland turbidity standard) in both eurocollins and uw preservation solutions. samples were then stored in an ice bath to stimulate organ preservation. the organisms were removed and plated on blood and chocolate agar at 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 hr postsuspension. the samples were then incubated at 37 degrees c and read for growth at 24-48 hr after plating. our results showed growth of all organisms except s epi in both preservation solutions, at all dilutions and preservation times. s epi grew in the eurocollins solution at all dilutions and preservation times but did not grow in the uw solution. when the experiment was repeated omitting penicillin from the uw solution, s epi grew at all dilutions and preservation times. these results demonstrate that in spite of the inclusion of two different antibiotics, the majority of the common bacterial contaminants of the organ donor remain viable in uw solution with extended preservation times. it may be possible therefore to omit these antibiotics from the uw solution and obtain similar results. it is also important to note that routine culturing remains an expensive but necessary part of organ procurement and preservation.

TI  == inactivation of metronidazole by enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == the in-vitro inactivation of metronidazole by different clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis was investigated by means of association experiments in which ent. faecalis strains and bacteroides fragilis group strains were cultured  in the same liquid medium. all of the tested ent. faecalis strains (20 isolates)  were able to protect the b. fragilis group strains against the killing effect of  metronidazole at a concentration four or eight times higher than the normal mic.  different strains of streptococcus (14), staphylococcus aureus (10), staph, epidermidis (10) and escherichia coli (8) failed to exhibit the same effect. when ent. faecalis strains were cultured anaerobically for 24 h in the presence of 4 mg metronidazole/l, either alone or together with different b. fragilis group strains, no metronidazole could be detected subsequently in the culture supernatants by hplc. concomitantly an increase of four or five logs in the viable counts of the co-cultured bacteroides strains was observed compared with bacteroides strains cultured alone. sonicated cell extracts of ent. faecalis cultured either aerobically or anaerobically were found to inactivate metronidazole to the same extent, whereas the culture supernatants had no such effect.

TI  == evidence that a novel tetracycline resistance gene found on two bacteroides transposons encodes an nadp-requiring oxidoreductase.
AB  == two transposons, tn4351 and tn4400, which were originally isolated from the obligate anaerobe bacteroides fragilis, carry a tetracycline resistance (tcr) gene that confers resistance only on aerobically grown escherichia coli. this aerobic tcr gene, designated tetx, has been shown previously to act by chemically modifying tetracycline in a reaction that appears to require oxygen. we have now  obtained the dna sequence of tetx and 0.6 kb of its upstream region from tn4400.  analysis of the dna sequence of tetx revealed that this gene encoded a 43.7-kda protein. the deduced amino acid sequence of the amino terminus of the protein had homology with a number of enzymes, all of which had in common a requirement for nad(p). in an earlier study, we had observed that disrupted cells, unlike intact  cells, could not carry out the alteration of tetracycline. we have now shown that if nadph (1 mm) is added to the disrupted cell preparation, alteration of tetracycline occurs. thus, tetx appears to be an nadp-requiring oxidoreductase. tn4400 conferred a fivefold-lower level of tetracycline resistance than tn4351. this finding appears to be due to a lower level of expression of the tetx on tn4400, because the activity of a tetx-lacz fusion from tn4400 was 10-fold lower  than that of the same fusion from tn4351. a comparison of the sequence of the tetx region on tn4351 with that on tn4400 showed that the only difference between the upstream regions of the two transposons was a 4-base change 350 bp upstream of the start of the tetx coding region. the 4-base change difference creates a good consensus -35 region on tn4351 that is not present on tn4400 and could be creating an extra promoter.

TI  == calculated empiric antimicrobial therapy for mixed surgical infections.
AB  == in acute life-threatening surgical infections requiring immediate institution of  antimicrobial therapy before bacteriological results are available, antibiotic treatment must be empiric. for best efficacy a more sophisticated form of empiric therapy is offered, termed calculated antibiotic therapy (cat). calculated antibiotic therapy requires consideration of a) typical bacterial spectrum; b) bacterial pathogenicity and synergism; c) antibacterial concentrations at the site of infection; d) toxicity and adverse effects; e) interaction with immune response; and f) results of properly conducted trials. intraabdominal infections  are used as an example here to assess the efficacy of clinically used cephalosporins and penicillins for determination of calculated antibiotic therapy. cat identifies escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis as the most important pathogens for intraabdominal infections and determines the most effective antibiotics at the tissue breakpoint, which is defined as the minimal concentration maintained for more than 90% of the dosage interval period at the infected tissues. at the tissue breakpoint calculated antibiotic therapy identifies cefotaxime-generation cephalosporins to be fully (100%) active against the most important aerobic pathogen e. coli and metronidazole as fully active against the important obligate anaerobe b. fragilis. calculated antibiotic therapy becomes relatively important, since impeccably controlled clinical therapeutic trials as a foundation for therapy are rarely published.

TI  == effect of daptomycin, metronidazole and mezlocillin combinations on mixed bacterial cultures involving facultative and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activities of different daptomycin concentrations in combination with metronidazole (4 mg/l) or/and mezlocillin (8 mg/l) were investigated on mixed bacterial cultures involving gram-positive facultative cocci. bacteroides fragilis group strains and escherichia coli. when streptococcus faecalis alone or together with e. coli was cultured with b. thetaiotaomicron the colony counts of  the latter were 4 log units higher after incubation in the presence of daptomycin and metronidazole than when it was cultured alone. after the addition of mezlocillin, this effect disappeared and all 3 strains were killed. when the same antibiotic combinations were used in the presence of beta-lactamase producing staphylococcus aureus, the activity of mezlocillin was decreased significantly. the colony counts of the co-cultured b. thetaiotaomicron and e. coli proved to be 2 log and 6 log higher, respectively, than those observed after they were cultured alone. the antimicrobial susceptibilities of the clinical isolates tested here in mixed cultures of up to 3 strains were modified significantly by interactions between the strains and the antibiotics used.

TI  == in-vitro evaluation of ampicillin/brobactam and comparison with other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == the ability of brobactam to inhibit beta-lactamases and the in vitro activity of  ampicillin combined with brobactam was compared with another beta-lactamase inhibitor, clavulanic acid, and other beta-lactam antibiotics. both inhibitors showed good and similar activity against staphylococcal penicillinase and most broad-spectrum beta-lactamases found in the enterobacteriaceae, whether plasmid or chromosomally mediated. both inhibitors were less active against chromosomally mediated cephalosporinases in enterobacteriaceae, but brobactam was 8-50 times more potent than clavulanic acid. the amount and type of beta-lactamase produced  by a particular bacterial strain was reflected in its sensitivity to a combination of ampicillin and brobactam, and correlated well with the sensitivity of extracted beta-lactamase to inhibition by brobactam. the in-vitro activity of  ampicillin/brobactam in a 3:1 ratio was compared to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid (4:1 ratio), amoxycillin, cefaclor and cefuroxime. the two inhibitor combinations were generally of similar activity, but the brobactam combination had superior activity against proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii and  yersinia enterocolitica. the cephalosporins were less effective against the bacteroides fragilis group, prot. vulgaris and m. morganii, but had advantages in the case of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and c. diversus. the mbc of ampicillin/brobactam was similar to the mic. no resistant sub-populations were observed amongst the staphylococcal strains investigated. exposure of bacteria to sub-inhibitory levels of ampicillin/brobactam did not lead generally to the development of resistance.

TI  == endotoxin requirements for alveolar macrophage stimulation.
AB  == acute pulmonary failure or ards in severely injured patients continues to be a significant problem. the most important clinical risk factor identified is sepsis syndrome. sepsis syndrome is the clinical correlate of a malignant systemic inflammatory process and is directed in large part by the tissue-fixed macrophage (m phi), such as the alveolar m phi. the m phi is capable of producing most of the central inflammatory mediators responsible for the pathophysiology seen during sepsis and organ injury. two major mediators are procoagulant activity (pca), leading to diffuse microvascular thrombosis, and tumor necrosis factor (tnf), causing much of the physiologic derangement of sepsis. endotoxins (lps) derived from gram-negative bacterial cell walls are the primary inflammatory stimulus for the tissue-fixed m phi production of inflammatory mediators. it is not completely known how lps interacts with its various cellular targets, but it  is hoped that knowledge of the molecular interactions involved in stimulation of  the m phi by endotoxin will lead to therapies to modulate the response and prevent deleterious processes such as ards. in the present studies, lps from e. coli 0111:b4 was shown in a dose response to stimulate large levels of both pca and tnf in alveolar m phi. lps from bacteroides fragilis and lipid x (the monosaccharide precursor of endotoxin) were unable to cause stimulation of the m  phi in vitro. however, both moieties, b. fragilis lps and lipid x, were able to effectively and specifically compete with e. coli lps and block m phi stimulation.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == suppression of blastogenic transformation of lymphocytes by bacteroides fragilis  in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == bacteroides species and enterobacteriaceae are known to cause synergistic infections. however, the mechanisms behind this synergy are not completely understood. several authors have shown that bacteroides species may inhibit the phagocytosis of enterobacteriaceae by polymorphonuclear leukocytes as well as by  macrophages. with the present study we have addressed the question of whether bacteroides fragilis (bf) is also capable of suppressing specific immune functions. when incubated together with murine lymphocytes, bf significantly inhibited the blastogenic transformation of these cells stimulated by escherichia coli-lipopolysaccharide (lps) or concanavalin a. this effect was dose dependent and was not mediated by prostaglandins. other bacteria such as e. coli or listeria monocytogenes did not show such an extensive suppression, while streptococcus pneumoniae was equally active. bf also inhibited the pokeweed mitogen induced blastogenic transformation of human lymphocytes. moreover, lymphocytes from bf-injected animals obtained 3 to 12 hours after infection proved to be partly refractory for lps-stimulation. finally, bf injections also affected t-cell dependent immunity as judged from the aggravation of an experimental listeriosis in mice.

TI  == plasmid transformation of bacteroides spp. by electroporation.
AB  == transformation of bacteroides spp. with a variety of plasmid dnas was accomplished using electroporation. the standard transformation assay system used to deduce the optimal electroporation parameters employed a 50-to 100-fold concentrated cell suspension of mid-logarithmic phase bacteroides fragilis strain 638 and the 5.4-kb clindamycin resistance (ccr) vector, pbi191. a variety of electroporation buffers were used successfully in transformation experiments but  of these, 1 mm mgcl2 in 10% glycerol was superior. the incorporation of mgcl2 was essential for optimum viability prior to electroporation and for optimum transformation. transformants were routinely obtained using 5-ms pulses over a range of field strengths from 5 to 12.5 kv/cm, with a maximum of greater than 10(6) micrograms-1 dna at 12.5 kv/cm. the number of transformants increased linearly with respect to dna concentration over the range 0.01-2 micrograms tested. recovery of transformants required an expression period of up to 2.5 h following exposure to the electric field. this period, however, was dependent on  the antibiotic resistance marker used for selection of transformants, with a significantly shorter incubation required when chloramphenicol rather than clindamycin was used in the selective medium. the effect of the dna source on transformation was tested using the shuttle vector pfd288. plasmid dna isolated from bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides ovatus, or bacteroides thetaiotaomicron transformed b. fragilis 638 at frequencies 7.5- to 12.5-fold less than those observed for controls with homologous dna. further reductions were seen with escherichia coli purified pfd288, which transformed at 1000-fold lower frequencies. finally, using homologous pfd288 or pbi191 isolated from strain 638, several strains of b. fragilis, b. uniformis, and b. ovatus were transformed successfully without modification of the standard assay system. two strains each  of b. thetaiotaomicron and bacteroides ruminicola were not transformed using the  methods described here.

TI  == cardiac dysfunction in a rat model of chronic bacteremia.
AB  == cardiac function was examined in vivo and in vitro in rats to determine if cardiac dysfunction could be demonstrated in a nonlethal model of infection. bacteremic rats (n = 6) had a subcutaneous polymicrobial abscess produced via repeated inoculations of an encapsulated foreign body with escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, and staphylococcus aureus while control rats (n = 6) had the same subcutaneous, encapsulated foreign body (an inflammatory focus) but were not inoculated with bacteria. cardiovascular function was assessed indirectly in  vivo by measuring the maximal o2 uptake during a progressive exercise test in both groups before and 14 days after the initiation of inoculations. cardiac function was also assessed in vitro in the same rats by measuring stroke volumes  generated at six different preloads with constant heart rate and afterload. bacteremic rats had a significantly different fever curve and leukocytotic response than control rats over the 14 day period. the majority of rats that received inoculations demonstrated bacteremias, while none of the control animals had positive cultures for the inoculated organisms. although in vivo assessment of cardiovascular function showed no evidence of dysfunction, in vitro assessment demonstrated a significant rightward shift of the starling curve in bacteremic rats. these data suggest that lv dysfunction occurs even during nonlethal infections but may be masked in vivo by compensatory mechanisms.

TI  == in vitro activity of ljc10,627, a new carbapenem antibiotic with high stability to dehydropeptidase i.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ljc10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of  imipenem and ceftazidime. ljc10,627 had broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates. the mics of this compound for  90% of members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested (mic90s), including strains resistant to ceftazidime, ranged from 0.1 to 25 micrograms/ml. ljc10,627  inhibited pseudomonas aeruginosa at an mic90 of 3.13 micrograms/ml; it thus was twofold more active than imipenem. this compound inhibited haemophilus, neisseria, and branhamella species at mic90s of 3.13, 0.1, and 0.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. ljc10,627 was two- to fourfold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis at mic90s of 0.1 and 0.39 microgram/ml. however, the compound was found to be twofold more active than imipenem against bacteroides fragilis at an mic90 of 1.56 microgram/ml. ljc10,627 was very stable to various beta-lactamases except for xanthomonas maltophilia oxyiminocephalosporinase type ii. ljc10,627 was minimally hydrolyzed by swine renal dehydropeptidase i; its residual activity was 93.0% after 2 h. killing kinetics of this compound for escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed that bactericidal action occurred at concentrations above the mic (0.05 and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively). ljc10,627 had a high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 2, 4, and 1b(s) of escherichia coli and  pseudomonas aeruginosa and penicillin-binding proteins 1 and 4 of staphylococcus  aureus.

TI  == expression and regulation of a bacteroides fragilis sucrose utilization system cloned in escherichia coli.
AB  == a bacteroides fragilis strain isolated from human feces was the source of chromosomal dna in the construction of plasmid pbs100. the cloned 6-kilobase insert of plasmid pbs100 conferred a sucrose positivity phenotype on transformed  cells of escherichia coli ja221. e. coli ja221(pbs100) cells were able to utilize sucrose as the sole source of carbon because of the presence of sucrase enzyme and sucrose uptake activities. sucrase activity was inducible in b. fragilis but  constitutive in e. coli ja221(pbs100) cells. in sucrose-minimal medium, both b. fragilis and e. coli ja221(pbs100) produced intracellular and extracellular sucrase activities throughout the growth cycle. osmotic shock experiments performed on e. coli ja221(pbs100) indicated that up to 55% of the sucrase activity was localized in the periplasmic space, 30% was in the cytoplasm, and the remaining 15% was in the cell-free extracellular supernatant fluid. b. fragilis and e. coli ja221(pbs100) actively transported sucrose. sucrose uptake was induced by sucrose in b. fragilis, whereas the uptake activity in e. coli ja221(pbs100) was constitutive. e. coli ja221(pbs100) appeared to transport sucrose by a phosphotransferase-independent system. b. fragilis transported sucrose only under strictly anaerobic conditions. no uptake activity was detected under aerobic conditions with or without addition of catalase.

TI  == disparate mechanisms of induction of procoagulant activity by live and inactivated bacteria and viruses.
AB  == this study describes the dose response, time course, and lymphocyte requirements  of procoagulant activity (pca) induction following stimulation of thioglycolate-elicited balb/c peritoneal macrophages with live and inactivated bacteria (bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus) and  murine hepatitis virus type 3 (mhv-3). induction of pca by mhv-3 was significantly more rapid and the maximal pca achieved was significantly greater than by the three bacterial species studied. in relation to induction of pca by bacteria, the pca response was more rapid and of greater magnitude with s. aureus and e. coli than with b. fragilis. mhv-3 induced an augmented pca response at all concentrations of virus studied in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas higher titers of live bacteria (greater than 10(7) cfu/ml) inhibited pca, suggesting the production of an inhibitory factor. significant pca induction was observed when macrophages were incubated with bacteria or virus in the absence of lymphocytes.  at low titers of b. fragilis (10(3) cfu/ml), addition of lymphocytes greatly augmented pca production, whereas at higher titers (10(7) cfu/ml), the addition of lymphocytes only slightly augmented the pca response. in contrast, mhv-3 induction of pca was enhanced by the addition of lymphocytes at all concentrations of virus studied, suggesting a lymphocyte-dependent process. heat-inactivated bacteria were as effective as live bacteria in inducing pca, suggesting that induction of pca by bacteria requires only a bacterial surface component. in contrast, uv-inactivated mhv-3 did not induce pca, suggesting that  viral replication is a necessary step in pca induction. these results suggest that the cellular and metabolic requirements for induction of pca differ among viral and bacterial pathogens and may partly explain their differences in pathogenicity.

TI  == cloning and expression of the bacteroides fragilis tal2480 neuraminidase gene, nanh, in escherichia coli.
AB  == we have cloned the bacteroides fragilis tal2480 neuraminidase (nanase) structural gene, nanh, in escherichia coli. this was accomplished by using the cloning shuttle vector pjst61 and a partial sau3a library of tal2480 chromosomal inserts  created in e. coli. the library was mobilized into the nanase-deficient b. fragilis tm4000 derivative tc2. nanase-producing colonies were enriched by taking advantage of the inability of tc2, but not the wild-type of nanase+ revertant, to grow in vitro in fluid aspirated from the rat granuloma pouch. plasmids pjst61-tcn1 and pjst61-tcn3, containing inserts of 9.1 and 4.5 kilobases (kb), respectively, were found in the tc2 derivatives that grew in the rat pouch medium. in b. fragilis, nanase production from the two plasmids was inducible by  free n-acetylneuraminic acid or sialic acid-containing substrates, just as in the parental tal2480 strain. however, when these plasmids were transferred back to e. coli, nanase activity was barely detectable. a 3.5-kb portion of the insert in pjst61-tcn3 was subcloned in pjst61 to give plasmid pjst61-sc3c; nanase was produced from this plasmid both in e. coli and in b. fragilis. in e. coli, nanase expression was under the control of the vector promoter lambda pr and was therefore completely abolished by the presence of a lambda prophage. in b. fragilis, nanase production was inducible by free n-acetylneuraminic acid or sialic acid-containing substrates. by using deletion analysis and tn1000 mutagenesis, the nanase structural gene and control region that functions in b. fragilis were localized to a 1.5- to 2.0-kb region of the insert. a partial nucleotide sequence of the nanase-deficient tn1000 insertion mutants allowed us to identify the nanh gene and deduce the amino acid sequence of a portion of the  nanase protein. we identified five regions showing great similarity to the asp boxes, -ser-x-asp-x-gly-x-thr-trp-, of other bacterial and viral nanase proteins.

TI  == biological characterization of a new radioactive labeling reagent for bacterial penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  == radiolabeled penicillin g is widely used as the imaging agent in penicillin-binding protein (pbp) assays. the disadvantages of most forms of labeled penicillin g are instability on storage and the long exposure times usually required for autoradiography or fluorography of electrophoretic gels. we  investigated the utility of radioiodinated penicillin v as an alternative reagent. radioiodination of p-(trimethylstannyl)penicillin v with [125i]na, using a modification of the chloramine-t method, is simple, high yielding, and site specific. we demonstrated the general equivalence of commercially obtained [3h]penicillin g and locally synthesized [125i]penicillin v (ipv) in their recognition of bacterial pbps. profiles of pbps in membranes from bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, providencia rettgeri, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium labeled with ipv or [3h]penicillin g were virtually identical. use of ipv as the imaging  agent in competition experiments for determination of the affinities of various beta-lactam antibiotics for the pbps of e. coli yielded results similar to those  obtained in experiments with [3h]penicillin g. dried electrophoretic gels from typical pbp experiments, using ipv at 37.3 ci/mmol and 30 micrograms/ml, exposed  x-ray film in 8 to 24 h. the stability of ipv on storage at 4 degrees c was inversely proportional to specific activity. at 37.3 ci/mmol and 60 micrograms/ml, ipv retained useful activity for at least 60 days at 4 degrees c.  ipv represents a practical and stable reagent for rapid pbp assays.

TI  == sequencing the gene for an imipenem-cefoxitin-hydrolyzing enzyme (cfia) from bacteroides fragilis tal2480 reveals strong similarity between cfia and bacillus  cereus beta-lactamase ii.
AB  == using a newly constructed bacteroides fragilis-escherichia coli cloning shuttle vector, pjst61, we have cloned the cefoxitin (fox)-imipenem (imp) resistance determinant from b. fragilis tal2480. fox-imp resistance in this strain results from the production of a periplasmic, zn2(+)-containing beta-lactamase which hydrolyzes carbapenems and cephamycins and whose activity is resistant to clavulanic acid but sensitive to zn2(+)-binding reagents, including edta. the pjst61 vector permits efficient library construction in e. coli and allows for the transfer of the library to b. fragilis recipients for the screening or selection of specific phenotypes. the library clone containing the fox-imp resistance gene was detected after transfer to b. fragilis tm4000 (fox-imps) selecting for foxr. one of the isolates carrying plasmid pjst241 is resistant to  fox and imp and synthesizes a periplasmic protein with substrate and inhibitor properties identical to those of strain tal2480. on the basis of deletion analysis, tn1000 insertion mutations, and dna sequencing, we have defined the 747-base cfia (fox-imp resistance) gene within the 3.6-kilobase cloned insert in  pjst241. the cfia gene contains an open reading frame that could code for a precursor protein of 249 amino acids and with a molecular mass of 27,260 daltons. a potential signal sequence has been identified at the n terminus of this protein; cleavage within this sequence would result in a protein of 231 amino acids with a molecular mass of 25,249 daltons. the cfia protein shows remarkable  similarities to the exported, zn2(+)-requiring, type ii beta-lactamase blm proteins from bacillus cereus 569/h and 5/b/6. although overall amino acid identity is only 32%, the zn ligand-binding his and cys residues are precisely conserved and the amino acids in the vicinity of these sites show strong similarities (greater than 80%) when the cfia and blm proteins are compared.

TI  == evidence that bacteroides nodosus belongs in subgroup gamma of the class proteobacteria, not in the genus bacteroides: partial sequence analysis of a b. nodosus 16s rrna gene.
AB  == the taxonomic status of the anaerobe bacteroides nodosus has for some time been uncertain. to resolve this uncertainty, the distal portion of a 16s rrna gene from this important ovine pathogen was cloned, mapped, and sequenced. a comparison of the sequence with the sequences of 16s rrna molecules from other bacteria indicated that b. nodosus is more closely related to escherichia coli and other members of the class proteobacteria than to bacteroides fragilis or the bacteroides-flavobacterium-cytophaga phylum. the evidence from the comparison of  sequence signatures suggests that b. nodosus is not a member of the genus bacteroides but that it belongs in subgroup gamma of the class proteobacteria.

TI  == interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha. use in gram-negative infection  after shock.
AB  == shock increases the propensity to develop infection after injury or operation. this study evaluated the effect of cefoxitin, interferon gamma (inf-gamma), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) on the development of a polymicrobial soft-tissue infection. after sham operation or hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation, sprague-dawley rats were inoculated with 1 x 10(8) escherichia coli and 1 x 10(9) bacteroides fragilis in a 5% fecal suspension. animals received either no treatment, cefoxitin, recombinant rat inf-gamma, recombinant human tnf-alpha, or cefoxitin/cytokine combinations. cefoxitin reduced abscess size by 57% in animals without shock but only by 26% after shock. although neither inf-gamma nor tnf-alpha alone had a salutary effect when given with cefoxitin in animals after shock, inf-gamma and tnf-alpha reduced abscess size by 50% and 55%, respectively. these results suggest that inf-gamma and tnf-alpha may be useful to reduce the severity of mixed gram-negative infections after shock with bacterial contamination.

TI  == efficacy of sulbactam in an in vitro model of mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections.
AB  == bacterial interactions in mixed infections may interfere with antimicrobial therapy. the in-vitro efficacy of ampicillin alone, combination sulbactam/ampicillin, and metronidazole was studied. strains of bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecalis, alone and in association,  were tested by means of a broth dilution method. minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc) of ampicillin for b. fragilis 74 in association with e. coli 68 were up to 16-fold higher than for b. fragilis 74 alone (256 compared to 16 mg/l), but only 2-fold higher for sulbactam (5 mg/l)/ampicillin (0.5 and 0.25 g/l). association of b. fragilis 45 and e. faecalis 186 increased ampicillin mbc  of e. faecalis 186 from 2 to 16 mg/l, but the combination sulbactam/ampicillin restored activity of ampicillin. in association with e. faecalis, metronidazole mbcs of b. fragilis increased up to 64-fold. strains of e. faecalis and e. coli were able to destroy 10 mg/l metronidazole within 8 to 20 h. the present experiments demonstrated effectiveness of sulbactam/ampicillin to inhibit beta-lactamases of associated pathogens. destruction of metronidazole by e. faecalis lends additional support to the use of the combination in aerobic/anaerobic infections including e. faecalis.

TI  == amoxicillin-clavulanic acid therapy of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a prospective study of twenty-seven cases in cirrhotic patients.
AB  == spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhosis is a serious complication that demands urgent attention. we report here a prospective study of the treatment of  27 episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in 22 cirrhotic patients with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. the infection of ascitic fluid was diagnosed by  a positive culture plus an ascitic neutrophil count exceeding 75/microliters, or  by an ascitic neutrophil count exceeding 500/microliters. the infection was treated with 1 gm amoxicillin and 0.2 gm clavulanic acid every 6 hr for 14 days.  in 17 cases (63%), bacteria were isolated from the ascitic fluid. all the bacteria isolated were sensitive to amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, whereas in five cases they were resistant to amoxicillin alone (escherichia coli in two cases, klebsiella pneumoniae in two cases and bacteroides fragilis in one case).  cure of the infection was achieved in 23 episodes (85%) after 14 days' treatment; 17 patients (63%) were able to leave the hospital. fourteen of 20 patients (70%)  treated for the first episode of infection died within 1 yr: eight from infection, two from gastrointestinal hemorrhage, one from infection and hemorrhage and three from tumors. one patient who had repeated infections underwent liver transplantation and has not had any infectious complications 1.5  yr after surgery. amoxicillin and clavulanic acid may be an effective first-line  therapy for ascitic fluid infection in cirrhosis. nevertheless, the 1-yr prognosis continues to be grave and the severity of the underlying liver disease  remains the most important determinant for survival.

TI  == structure-activity relationships in lipopolysaccharides of bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == the endotoxic activity of lipopolysaccharide (lps) extracted from the envelope of bacteroides fragilis is low compared with that of lps from escherichia coli, salmonella, and other enterobacteriaceae. thus, pyrogenicity, the ability to prepare for or provoke the local shwartzman reaction, and the ability to induce the production of interleukin 1 are reduced by 100- to 1,000-fold. structural analyses of characterized b. fragilis lps have shown that its lipid a is composed of a beta 1,6-linked d-glucosamine disaccharide that has the following properties: (1) a phosphate group on c1 of the reducing amino sugar, (2) amide- and ester-linked 3-hydroxylated branched and nonbranched long-chain (c15-c17) fatty acids, (3) an average of five fatty acids per glucosamine disaccharide, and (4) the core and o-antigenic saccharide chain linked to c6 of the nonreducing glucosamine residue. although structurally similar to lipid a of e. coli, the lipid a of b. fragilis differs by its lack of the phosphate group on c4 of the nonreducing amino sugar and by the presence of fewer and different fatty acids. these differences explain the low endotoxic activity of b. fragilis lps. the core and o-antigenic chain are linked to lipid a via a phosphorylated 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate (kdo) residue. the saccharide chain is short and is composed of l-rhamnose, d-glucose, and d-galactose, with the o-antigenic specificity determined by a beta 1,6-linked d-galactose oligomer. this o-antigenic specificity was present in 14 of 17 strains of b. fragilis that were  investigated.

AB  == a comparison of single-agent antimicrobial therapy in the treatment of patients with perforated or gangrenous appendicitis and peritonitis was performed in a double-blind, randomized, prospective trial. pathologic documentation of advanced appendicitis and positive intraoperative specimen cultures were required for inclusion in the study. ceftizoxime (2 gm every 12 hours) and cefoxitin (2 gm every six hours) were compared. there were no significant differences between the treatment groups. ninety-seven percent of patients treated with ceftizoxime and 89% of those treated with cefoxitin were cured or improved; there was no mortality in either group. by the use of optimal sampling, transport, and culture techniques, the number and diversity of bacteria recovered from these patients with advanced appendicitis were found to be much larger than previously suspected. peritoneal fluid, abscess contents (if present), and appendiceal tissue (obtained so as to exclude the lumen) were cultured from all patients. an  average number of 3.1 aerobic or facultative bacteria species and 8.5 anaerobic species were isolated from each specimen. twenty-eight different genera and more  than 55 species were encountered, including a previously undescribed fastidious gram-negative anaerobic bacillus. bacteroides fragilis group and escherichia coli were isolated from almost all specimens, and within the b fragilis group, eight species were represented. the recovery of such an unexpectedly large and diverse  flora may be the reason for the therapeutic failures in these patients. we conclude that single-agent antimicrobial therapy in patients with advanced appendicitis and peritonitis is both safe and effective, and, with ceftizoxime, can be accomplished by a twice-daily dosing regimen.

TI  == incidence and significance of intraperitoneal aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == intra-abdominal infections frequently occur after trauma, surgical resections, or intrinsic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. these infections, which can be  generalized or localized in intraperitoneal or extraperitoneal locations as well  as in organs, are often difficult to diagnose and treat. they are usually polymicrobial, involving both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the average number  of bacterial strains recovered is between two and five, with anaerobes dominating. the aerobic microorganisms most commonly recovered are enterobacteriaceae (mainly escherichia coli) and enterococci (mainly enterococcus faecalis). among the anaerobic microorganisms, bacteroides fragilis, anaerobic cocci, and clostridia are usually isolated. adequate surgical drainage and antimicrobial therapy improve the clinical course of intra-abdominal infections and reduce the risk of local complications and septicemia. the choice of antimicrobial agents should be based on the type of infection, the microorganisms most likely to be encountered, and the microbial sensitivity pattern of the clinic. the side-effect profile of the antimicrobial therapy should also be taken into consideration.

TI  == the role of bacterial vaginosis as a cause of amniotic fluid infection, chorioamnionitis and prematurity--a review.
AB  == antepartum bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy has been related to premature delivery, the recovery of microorganisms from amniotic fluid of women in premature labor with intact membranes, to histologic chorioamnionitis and to the  recovery of microorganisms from the placenta or membranes. microorganisms associated with bacterial vaginosis are commonly recovered from the amniotic fluid and chorioamnion of patients who deliver prematurely. in addition, bacterial vaginosis is associated with maternal infectious morbidity during labor and in the postpartum period. very little is known of the pathophysiologic mechanisms by which bacterial vaginosis may cause preterm labor and/or premature  rupture of the membranes. however, it is of interest to speculate on possible mechanisms. the high concentration of potentially pathogenic microorganisms in the vagina and cervix of pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis may increase the possibility of an ascending infection via the cervix, decidua, fetal membranes, maternal placenta, and amniotic fluid. some of the bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis such as bacteroides sp. are particularly virulent. certain bacteria produce enzymes that potentially could affect the fetal membranes or maternal deciduae. bacteroides sp. and group b streptococcus produce proteases. protease enzymes reduce the chorioamniotic membrane strength in vitro. it is even possible that a high concentration of bacteria in the lower genital tract could produce enough proteases to weaken the fetal membrane strength causing premature  rupture of the membranes. bacterial lipases could also produce tissue injury. schwarz et al. demonstrated that lysosomes within fetal membrane cells contain phospholipase a2 in high concentrations. phospholipase a2 is a precursor of prostaglandin synthesis and the destruction of lysosomes within deciduae or chorioamnion cells may induce prostaglandin synthesis resulting in uterine contractions. bejar et al. found a high rate of phospholipase a2 production by bacteroides sp., anaerobic streptococci, fusobacterium sp., and g. vaginalis. benett et al. demonstrated that bacterial products of group b streptococci, viridans streptococci, escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis but not of lactobacillus sp. increase the synthesis of prostaglandins in the membranes. thus, selected bacteria, including some closely related to bacterial vaginosis may play a role in the initiation of uterine contractions by stimulating prostaglandin synthesis. in an alternative mechanism, either the release of prostaglandin in the membrane or uterine contraction could cause microbreaks of the membrane that allow bacterial colonization of the membrane.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == infection models were used to clarify the roles of serum and extravascular concentrations in the in-vivo efficacy observed with azithromycin. in-vivo experiments were designed to give serum concentrations well below the mic and tissue levels generally above the mic at time of challenge and during the course  of infection. the efficacy of azithromycin against a salmonella enteritidis oral  challenge (a tissue-associated infection model) in mice correlated directly with  azithromycin liver levels, but not serum concentrations. the significance of extravascular pharmacokinetics was observed in a comparative study of azithromycin and ciprofloxacin against the salmonella challenge. ciprofloxacin has a greater than 100-fold in-vitro potency advantage over azithromycin against  this organism, but azithromycin (5 mg/kg) produced a greater reduction in cfu than ciprofloxacin (100 mg/kg) at the primary site of infection (liver). in another model, extravascular fluid levels, measured by bioassay of implanted paper discs, were compared with plasma levels in relation to control of a localized staphylococcus aureus infection in rats. extravascular fluid levels of  azithromycin were greater than the mic of the strain used for five days after a 100 mg/kg dose, while erythromycin levels were less than 20% of the mic at 30 h after a 200 mg/kg dose. serum concentrations of both compounds were less than 20% of the mic at the time of challenge. the antibiotic levels at the site of infection correlated with the reduction of staph. aureus cfu (99% with azithromycin compared with controls, p less than 0.01; 0% with erythromycin) recovered from inoculated discs. the significance of extravascular concentrations of azithromycin was further supported in other models of localized infections induced with escherichia coli or a mixture of staph. aureus and bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == radio-immunoassay for formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine. i. development and application to assessment of chemotactic peptide production by enteric bacteria.
AB  == bacterial chemotactic peptides are low molecular weight peptides which stimulate  a wide range of neutrophil functions following binding to specific leucocyte receptors. formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine (fmlp) is the major chemotactic  peptide in escherichia coli culture supernatants. this paper reports the development and validation of a radio-immunoassay (ria) for fmlp and its application to the analysis of formyl peptide production by enteric bacteria in vitro. the assay was moderately sensitive (10 nmol/l fmlp) and highly specific showing cross reactivity with f-met-leu-tyr, f-nle-leu-phe and f-met-met-met sequences (id50 = 200, 100 and 250 nmol/l, respectively) but no significant cross reactivity with non-formylated or other formylated di- and tri-peptides (id50 = 10(5) nmol/l. culture supernatants from five species of enteric bacteria were filtered, concentrated and fractionated by reverse phase high performance liquid  chromatography before ria. all five organisms produced immunoreactive f-met peptides. a major peak of immunoreactivity co-chromatographing with authentic fmlp was found in all supernatants, but additional peaks representing more hydrophobic peptides were found in streptococcus faecalis and bacteroides fragilis cultures. in e. coli culture supernatants, concentration of immunoreactive fmlp increased in a linear fashion during 3 h of log phase growth  reaching 31.2 nmol/l(s.e.m. = 10) with final bacterial concentrations of 3 +/- 0.73 x 10(8)/ml (n = 6). these findings extend earlier work showing production of bioactive formyl oligopeptides by different species of enteric bacteria and suggest that a ria for fmlp will be a useful tool for investigating the production and metabolic fate of such peptides in man.

TI  == splenic abscess: presentation, treatment options, and results.
AB  == pyogenic splenic abscess is a rare condition that tends to occur in patients with predisposing factors. the use of splenectomy or computed tomography-guided percutaneous drainage in 10 patients with splenic abscess is presented. in 8 of 10 cases, the diagnosis was based on abdominal computed tomography scan. seven of 10 patients were treated with splenectomy, and 3 were managed with computed tomography-guided drainage. abscess cultures included escherichia coli, enterobacter, streptococcus viridans, staphylococcus aureus, and bacteroides fragilis. there were two morbidities and one death in the splenectomy group and no complications in those treated with percutaneous drainage. this review suggests a flexible approach in the management of splenic abscess. although splenectomy remains the traditional treatment for bacterial splenic abscess, ct-guided drainage may be appropriate in carefully selected patients.

TI  == effect of the abscess environment on the antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin.
AB  == the present studies were conducted to identify factors in human purulent material that might limit or enhance the activity of ciprofloxacin against bacteria causing suppurative infection. ciprofloxacin, imipenem, and ampicillin were tested with regard to binding or inactivation by pus. the bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin and imipenem were tested against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or staphylococcus aureus in human pus with a  ph of 6.0 incubated at 37 degrees c under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. the effect of single or combination drug therapy with 20 mg/kg of ciprofloxacin, imipenem, or rifampin given every 12 hours was tested against e. coli or p. aeruginosa in polymicrobic murine abscesses that had been produced by subcutaneous injection of either of those organisms mixed with bacteroides fragilis and autoclaved human stool. antibiotic levels and the number of bacteria surviving in pus were quantitated. therapy of subcutaneous abscesses was delayed  72 hours to test drug efficacy against organisms in well-established infections.  levels of ampicillin, imipenem, or ciprofloxacin were reduced from 10 micrograms/ml to 3.1 +/- 4.0, 2.7 +/- 3, or 5.8 +/- 2 micrograms/ml, respectively, after incubation in eight pus specimens for 24 hours at 37 degrees  c. ampicillin levels were reduced to less than 1 microgram/ml in four pus specimens containing beta-lactamase. imipenem levels were undetectable in two specimens and were 0.2 micrograms/ml in one specimen. ciprofloxacin binding to pus supernate or sediment appeared to be explained by its binding to the deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) present in pus. activity of 5 micrograms/ml of ciprofloxacin against four e. coli or k. pneumoniae strains in pus in vitro was greater than that of twofold higher concentrations of imipenem. the bactericidal  activity of ciprofloxacin and imipenem were comparable but substantially reduced  against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa in pus. ciprofloxacin alone or regimens combining ciprofloxacin with rifampin or rifampin plus imipenem reduced the number of e. coli in polymicrobic subcutaneous abscesses but had little effect on p. aeruginosa in polymicrobic abscesses. the anaerobic abscess milieu appeared to inhibit the growth of p. aeruginosa. ciprofloxacin activity in abscess fluid did  not appear to be adversely affected by acid ph, aerobic or anaerobic conditions of incubation, the abscess constituents, or the binding of ciprofloxacin to the dna in pus. ciprofloxacin was bound to dna of bacterial or human origin. binding  by pus was reversible, and binding to dna extracts of pus was blocked by pretreatment of extracts with deoxyribonuclease but not by pretreatment with ribonuclease.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == immune response in patients with intraabdominal infections treated with imipenem. swedish study group.
AB  == in the present investigation the humoral immune response against isolated microorganisms in patients treated with imipenem was studied. sixty-six patients  (34 men and 32 women, 18-86 years of age) with suspicion of intraabdominal infections entered the study. five patients were excluded for various reasons and the remaining 61 patients were treated with imipenem/cilastatin 0.5-1.0 g t.i.d.  for 5-29 days (median nine days). three serum samples were taken from each patient, the first sample at admission, the second between three and seven days after the first dose of imipenem/cilastatin and the third between 14 and 31 days  after the first dose. one third of the patients had a malignant disease and the verified intraabdominal infections were judged to be severe in 23 and moderately  severe in 33 of the patients. fifty-six patients (92%) were cured and five patients (8%) were considered improved after the treatment. the immune response against isolated microorganisms was measured in the three serum samples by indirect immunofluorescence tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. among the aerobic microorganisms isolated escherichia coli (46 strains) staphylococcus  epidermidis (22 strains), streptococcus milleri (15 strains) and enterococcus faecalis (11 strains) dominated and among the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis (39 strains). thirty-two patients had significant immune responses against one or more of the isolated microorganisms. e. coli and b. fragilis gave  rises in antibody titers in 13 and 20 cases respectively, while significant titers against s. epidermidis were noticed in only three cases, against s. milleri in two cases and against e. faecalis in three cases.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == human endothelial cell adhesiveness for neutrophils, induced by escherichia coli  lipopolysaccharide in vitro, is inhibited by bacteroides fragilis lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == recent studies in vitro have demonstrated that lps from gram-negative bacteria are capable of inducing endothelial cells to express a cell surface property that promotes the adherence of neutrophils (polymorphonuclear cells, pmn). we have investigated the effects of lps from bacteroides fragilis, an organism documented to have little toxicity in vivo, on the induction of this property in human endothelial cells. monolayers of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells  (huve) exhibited no increase in adhesiveness for 51cr-radiolabeled pmn after 4 h  of exposure to b. fragilis lps from 1 ng to 10 micrograms/ml. escherichia coli lps elicited a dose-dependent enhancement of huve adhesiveness for pmn over the same concentration range, reaching a maximum of 49.4 +/- 6.6% at 10 micrograms/ml. like e. coli lps, b. fragilis lps converted chromogenic substrate  in the limulus amebocyte lysate assay, and was directly cytotoxic to bovine aortic endothelial cells. both b. fragilis lps activities required doses two-to-three log-fold higher than for e. coli lps. in addition, we found that b.  fragilis lps inhibited the induction of huve adhesiveness for pmn by e. coli lps. this inhibition was also dose-dependent, becoming maximal (greater than 80%) when b. fragilis lps was in 10- to 20-fold excess. tumor necrosis factor and il-1, two monokines which also elicit huve adhesiveness for pmn, were not inhibited by b. fragilis lps, suggesting a mechanism of huve activation by lps which is signal-specific, and which recognizes specificities of lps structure.

TI  == genetic transfer systems in bacteroides: cloning and mapping of the transferable  tetracycline-resistance locus.
AB  == conjugation systems that transfer antibiotic resistance in the absence of detectable plasmids are common in bacteroides, but the mechanism of transfer is poorly understood. we found that linked transfer of tetracycline (tcr) and clindamycin (clr) resistance by bacteroides fragilis strain 1126 is induced by growth in either tc or cl. we cloned the transferable tcr locus as a 13 kb fragment on the shuttle vector pph6 in escherichia coli and showed that this region expresses tcr in bacteroides but not e. coli. the tcr gene was mapped to a 3 kb region and the clr gene was shown not to be present in the 13 kb insert. homologous tcr genes are found in b. fragilis v479 and 1792. using pulsed-field electrophoresis, the transferable tcr gene was shown to be physically associated  with high molecular-weight dna, suggesting that it is located on the chromosome.  a new tcr shuttle vector, pph7 delta 1.1, was constructed to facilitate use of this selective marker in bacteroides genetics.

AB  == tazobactam (ytr-830h), a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor, was compared with clavulanic acid and sulbactam for enhancement of the activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing, piperacillin-resistant clinical isolates. piperacillin mics were determined in media containing a fixed concentration of 2  or 4 micrograms of the inhibitors per ml. the higher concentration was generally  more effective. tazobactam was superior to sulbactam in enhancing the spectrum and potency of piperacillin. although the calvulanic acid combination was more potent, tazobactam was effective for a similar spectrum of resistant gram-negative clinical isolates containing beta-lactamase. mics were reduced to the susceptible range for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp.,  salmonella spp., and shigella spp. combinations with tazobactam and sulbactam, but not clavulanic acid, were effective against morganella spp. some antagonism of the activity of piperacillin was observed with clavulanic acid but not with tazobactam or sulbactam. the inhibitors were similarly effective with piperacillin against beta-lactamase-positive staphylococcus spp. and the bacteroides fragilis group. piperacillin-tazobactam was more effective against a  broader spectrum of gram-negative enteric bacteria than ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid was. combinations with tazobactam or clavulanic acid had a broader spectrum of activity than combinations with sulbactam against bacteria that produce characterized plasmid-mediated enzymes of clinical significance. in  particular, piperacillin with tazobactam or clavulanic acid, but not with sulbactam, inhibited tem-1, tem-2, and shv-1 enzymes. in vitro activity was reflected in vivo. tazobactam and clavulanic acid were superior to sulbactam in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of piperacillin in mice infected with beta-lactamase-positive e. coli, k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus. only combinations with tazobactam and sulbactam were effective against the morganella infection. tazobactam has a good potential for enhancing the clinical efficacy of piperacillin.

AB  == cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefotetan, ceftizoxime, imipenem plus cilastatin, and ampicillin plus sulbactam were compared in the eradication of subcutaneous abscess in mice caused by bacteroides fragilis group organisms and escherichia coli alone or in combination. the abscesses were examined 5 d after inoculation.  b. fragilis group reached log10.1-11.0 organisms per abscess and e. coli log11.6-12.5. imipenem plus cilastatin significantly reduced (in 6.9-10.6 logs) the number of e. coli and all members of b. fragilis group alone or in all combinations. ampicillin plus sulbactam reduced the numbers of all b. fragilis group (in 4.2-7.2 logs) but was less effective against e. coli (reduction of 1.8-4.2 logs). cefoxitin was effective in significantly reducing (in 4.9-6.2 logs) the number of e. coli and all members of b. fragilis group alone or in all  combinations. cefotetan was effective against b. fragilis (reduction of 5.1-6.6 logs) and e. coli alone or in combination but did not reduce the number of bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, and bacteroides ovatus. ceftizoxime was effective against only b. ovatus (reduction of 3.7-5.8) and e. coli (reduction of 6.0-8.1 logs); it did not reduce the number of other organisms. cefamandole was effective against only e. coli and was not effective against any member of the b. fragilis group. these in vivo data confirm the in vitro activity of these antimicrobials.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of the new oral penem alp-201 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the new penem derivative alp-201 against 226 aerobic and 350 anaerobic clinical bacterial isolates was determined using agar dilution techniques. for comparison amoxicillin, cefaclor, ceftazidime, doxycycline, erythromycin, imipenem and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were also tested with aerobic bacteria, and cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole and piperacillin with anaerobic bacteria. alp-201 was found to be highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, propioni-bacterium acnes, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria. pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium difficile were resistant to alp-201. when tested against aerobic bacteria using a high inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of alp-201 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to the inhibitory activity. further investigations are warranted with alp-201, which is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.

TI  == [pharmacokinetics and antimicrobial effect of cefminox in serum and ascitic fluid for experimental purulent peritonitis in mice].
AB  == an appropriate choice of antibiotics plays an important role in the treatment of  purulent peritonitis. we examined the pharmacokinetics and antimicrobial effect of cefminox (cmnx) on experimental purulent peritonitis made by intraperitoneal injection of e. coli and/or b. fragilis in mice from elimination of bacteria in peripheral blood and ascitic fluid. 1) e. coli in blood and ascitic fluid decreased within one or two hrs after intravenous injection of cmnx or latamoxef  (lmox) in a dose of 25 or 100 mg/kg. the bacteria-elimination effect of cmnx was  superior to that of lmox. 2) comparing with the effect of lmox, b. fragilis in ascitic fluid acceleratively decreased in shorter period by the intravenous administration of cmnx. this indicated that peritoneal transfer of cmnx was better than that of lmox. 3) clearance of e. coli and b. fragilis from blood was  accomplished by single dose (25 mg/kg) intravenous administration of cmnx, whereas it was not by the same dose of lmox, resulting in ld50 of cmnx and lmox were 5.0 and 39.3 mg/kg, respectively. thus, we should select some antibiotics which shows good clearance of the causative organisms from blood and ascitic fluid as well as antimicrobial effect as a therapeutics for acute purulent peritonitis caused by e. coli and/or b. fragilis.

TI  == [the influence of cefteram pivoxil on the intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  == the influence of cefteram pivoxil (cftm-pi), a new oral cephalosporin, on the intestinal bacterial flora was studied in tetra-contaminated mice and in pediatric patients. cftm-pi in fine granular form was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice contaminated with 4 different  species of organisms: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve. no remarkable change was observed in the fecal viable cell count except that slight decrease in e. coli count was observed on days 2 to 5 after starting administration. the subjects in pediatric study were 5 children, 3 boys and 2 girls at ages from 6 months to 10 years 4 months, with infections. their body weights ranged from 3.5 to 28.0 kg. cftm-pi in fine granular form was administered at each dose of 3.0 to 3.8 mg/kg, 3 times daily for 5 to 11 days. during the administration of cftm-pi, there were some variations in the change of the fecal bacterial flora noticed between subjects. although enterobacteriaceae tended to decrease and enterococci tended to increase, other main aerobes and anaerobes were almost unchanged in most cases. there was no case in which glucose non-fermenting gram-negative rods and fungi became predominant. in a 10 years 4 months old boy, the fecal concentration of cftm, the active form of cftm-pi, was 72.20 micrograms/g and a remarkable decrease of total anaerobe count was observed. in feces, cftm-pi and cftm were detected in 4 and 2 cases respectively, and their concentrations were 1.50 approximately 89.65 micrograms/g and 2.25 approximately 72.20 micrograms/g, respectively. beta-lactamase activities in feces were positive in all cases. from the above, cftm-pi is considered to be a drug with relatively less influence on the intestinal bacterial flora. but as high concentrations of drugs were detected in feces under some circumstances, we need to pay attention to fecal drug concentrations.

AB  == the in vitro susceptibilities of 1,310 clinical isolates to qa-241, a novel tricyclic quinolone, were evaluated in comparison with susceptibilities to norfloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, and ciprofloxacin. the mics of qa-241 for 90% of staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis isolates, and streptococcal species ranged from 1.56 to 6.25 micrograms/ml, and the activity of qa-241 was similar to those of norfloxacin and enoxacin but two to four times less potent than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. at the concentration of less than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml, qa-241 inhibited 90% of haemophilus influenzae, bordetella pertussis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and gram-negative enteric bacteria except for serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii. qa-241 was moderately active (mic for 90% of strains tested, 6.25 to 12.5 micrograms/ml) against s. marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis. the antibacterial activity of qa-241 was roughly comparable to that of enoxacin but two to four times less potent than that of ofloxacin. in systemic infections in mice with gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods, the efficacy of qa-241 was  generally greater than that of norfloxacin and similar to those of ofloxacin and  ciprofloxacin. in urinary tract infections in mice with escherichia coli or pseudomonas aeruginosa, qa-241 was as active as ofloxacin and more active than norfloxacin but less active than ciprofloxacin. in pulmonary infections in mice with klebsiella pneumoniae, the effectiveness of qa-241 was similar to that of ofloxacin.

TI  == reciprocal synergy between escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis in an intra-abdominal infection model.
AB  == the synergic relationship between escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis was examined in a model of intra-abdominal abscess formation. the addition of b. fragilis to e. coli in the fibrin clot inoculum increased abscess weight and residual numbers of e. coli in the abscess at 7 days. in a reciprocal fashion, e. coli was capable of enhancing b. fragilis persistence in abscesses. neither heat-killed e. coli nor heat-killed b. fragilis was able to mimic the synergic effect of its live counterpart. furthermore, b. fragilis culture filtrate was unable to reproduce the ability of live b. fragilis to act synergically with e. coli. for b. fragilis to act synergically with e. coli, it had to be inoculated locally with e. coli in the peritoneal cavity, indicating that an effect on systemic resistance by b. fragilis was an unlikely mechanism for the production of bacterial synergy. these studies suggest that the synergic relationship between bacteria in polymicrobial infections is a complex one, resulting from intimate interactions between bacteria and the host in the local milieu of the infection.

TI  == superoxide production of peritoneal macrophages in experimental gram-negative sepsis; influence of in vitro and in vivo supplements of zinc.
AB  == although zinc is essential for the optimum function of the immune system, there is some controversy regarding treatment with zinc during acute infections where low serum zinc levels are often recorded. the aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of in vitro and in vivo zinc supplementation on the potentially toxic metabolic activity of peritoneal macrophages during infection.  rats were made septic by implanting a gelatin capsule containing known amounts of e. coli, and bacteroides fragilis into the abdomen. peritoneal macrophages were harvested by peritoneal lavage 72 hours after the induction of sepsis. superoxide release was measured after stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (pma) or serum treated zymosan (stz). macrophages from septic rats released significantly  higher amounts of superoxide compared with macrophages from sham operated controls after stimulation with both pma and stz. following in vitro supplementation, zinc inhibited the superoxide production of macrophages harvested from septic rats after stimulation with both pma and stz. in vivo supplementation with zinc resulted in increased superoxide production from septic macrophages when stimulated with stz, whereas stimulation with pma produced no significant changes. thus, in vitro incubation inhibited the superoxide production of peritoneal macrophages in intraabdominal sepsis, whilst in vivo administration of zinc produced no such effect, and the effect seemed to vary depending on the stimuli used to initiate the respiratory burst.

TI  == enhancement of survival from murine polymicrobial peritonitis with increased abdominal abscess formation.
AB  == muramyl dipeptide (mdp), a purified synthetic immune adjuvant, has been shown to  increase murine intraabdominal abscess formation in a monomicrobial model using bacteroides fragilis. this effect required live bacteria and was abolished by appropriate antibiotics. a polymicrobial model of peritonitis and abdominal abscess formation using streptococcus fecalis, escherichia coli, and b. fragilis  was initially used to determine mortality rates at various concentrations and obtain an appropriate ld50. animals were then pretreated with mdp or its inert buffer and underwent intraperitoneal injection of the appropriate bacterial suspension. mortality and abdominal abscess formation were then assessed at 2 weeks after injection. there was a significant reduction in mortality (p less than 0.03) in mice treated with mdp compared to the controls. in surviving animals, there was also a significant increase in the number of animals forming abscesses (p less than 0.05) following treatment with mdp. this study has shown that nonspecific immune stimulation by mdp provided enhanced protection against a polymicrobial intraperitoneal challenge and paradoxically increased the formation of abdominal abscesses at the same time. this may be regarded as enhancement of the natural history of survival from peritonitis via bacterial containment through intraabdominal abscess formation, a manifestation of beneficial outcome in experimental peritonitis.

TI  == role of anaerobic bacteria in intra-abdominal septic abscesses in mediating septic control of skeletal muscle glucose oxidation and lactic acidemia.
AB  == altered glucose metabolism and lactic acidemia are features of gram-negative polymicrobial abscesses, but the relationship between carbohydrate metabolism and the aerobic or anaerobic organisms is unclear. since reductions in the % active pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (pdha) limits glucose oxidation in sepsis, the effect of a 7-day monoclonal (e. coli or b. fragilis) vs. biclonal (e. coli + b.  fragilis) intra-abdominal abscess (ia) on pdha and lactate concentrations in skeletal muscle (sm) and plasma was studied in rats. a chronic ia was created by  the intraperitoneal introduction of a sterile rat fecal-agar pellet (1.5 ml) inoculated with a known bacterial flora [sterile (s); e. coli 10(6) cfu/ml (ec);  b. fragilis 10(8) cfu/ml (bf); e. coli 10(3) cfu/ml + b. fragilis 10(4) cfu/ml (eclbf); e. coli 10(3) cfu/ml + b. fragilis 10(8) cfu/ml (echbf)]. neither sm pdha nor sm nor plasma lactate were altered from control in animals with either sterile (s) or e. coli (ec) monoclonal ia, but sm pdha was significantly (p less  than 0.001) reduced and sm lactate increased (p less than 0.05) in rats with b. fragilis 10(8)/ml (bf) monoclonal ia. in biclonal ia, the effect of sepsis on sm  pdha depended on the concentration of b. fragilis in the ia fluid (eclbf = 10(4)  cfu/ml vs. echbf = 10(8) cfu/ml) since the e. coli were constant (10(3) cfu/ml).  at the lower b. fragilis ia concentration (eclbf), the sm pdha was not different  from control. however, when the ia b. fragilis concentration was increased to 10(8) cfu/ml (echbf), the sm pdha was significantly (p less than 0.001) decreased relative to control. a decreased muscle pdha was always associated with elevated  sm and plasma lactate concentrations. these results suggest that ia which permit  a threshold of relatively nonlethal (bf = 0% mortality) anaerobic b. fragilis (greater than or equal to 10(8) cfu/ml) to enter the circulation are more important in altering metabolic control of skeletal muscle glucose oxidation and  in producing lactic acidemia than are ia with only aerobic e. coli. however, in biclonal intra-abdominal abscesses, b. fragilis potentiated the early mortality from e. coli (ec = 6% vs. echbf = 37% mortality), suggesting that the metabolic effect of the b. fragilis-induced lactic acidemia is synergistic with the direct  toxic effects of the e. coli.

TI  == characterization of the termini and transposition products of tn4399, a conjugal  mobilizing transposon of bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == we have isolated a 9.6-kilobase conjugal transposon, tn4399 from bacteroides fragilis, that is capable of mobilizing nonconjugal plasmids in cis. here we characterize the ends of the transposon, its target-site requirements, and the products of transposition into the b. fragilis chromosome and two sets of b. fragilis-escherichia coli shuttle vectors. with the exception of an additional cytosine residue in the left end, there are perfect 13-base-pair (bp) inverted repeats at the ends of tn4399. insertion of tn4399 resulted in a 3-bp target-site repeat in 8 out of 12 independent transpositions and showed a high insertion-site specificity. a remarkable feature of tn4399 insertions is the presence of an additional 5 bp located between the right inverted repeat and the target-site repeat. four sequence variations of the 5 bp were found, with absolute conservation at positions 1, 2, and 5. only two of the variations were present in junction fragments of all three copies of tn4399 contained in the chromosome of the original donor strain, b. fragilis tm4.2321. tn4399 appears to represent a new type of conjugal transposon. in contrast to tn916 and tn1545, described in streptococci, tn4399 creates a target-site repeat and contains an additional 5 bp at the right end only, between the transposon and the target sequence. in addition, tn4399 can mobilize plasmids in cis.

TI  == tn4399, a conjugal mobilizing transposon of bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == conjugal transposons play an important role in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance determinants in the streptococci and have been postulated to exist in  bacteroides fragilis. to investigate the presence of conjugal transposons in b. fragilis, we employed a tra- derivative of the transfer factor pbftm10 contained  in the chimeric plasmid pgat400 delta bglii. we attempted to restore transferability to this plasmid from a series of transconjugants generated by crossing b. fragilis tmp230 containing the tet transfer factor with b. fragilis tm4000, a standard recipient. transconjugant tm4.2321 transferred pgat400 delta bglii to escherichia coli hb101 at almost the same frequency as did the tra+ parental plasmid, pgat400. analysis of the transferred plasmids revealed the presence of 9.6 kilobases of additional dna in every case but at different positions in independent isolates. the presence of this dna, designated tn4399, allowed the pgat400 delta bglii derivatives to retransfer from the tm4000 background to b. fragilis or e. coli recipients. dna hybridization studies demonstrated the presence of one copy of tn4399 in tmp230 and three copies at new sites in tm4.2321. tn4399 is a new b. fragilis transposon with unique transfer properties that may play a role in the dissemination of drug resistance genes. it differs from previously described conjugal transposons by its ability to mobilize nonconjugal plasmids in cis.

AB  == ytr 830, now known as tazobactam, is a new penicillanic acid sulfone beta-lactamase inhibitor. the in vitro activity of ytr 830 combined with various  penicillins was determined and compared to that of clavulanate and sulbactam combined with the same agents. combined with ampicillin or amoxicillin, all three inhibitors were active against beta-lactamase producing strains of staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella, citrobacter diversus, and all anaerobes except for bacteroides fragilis homology group ii. ytr 830 was also effective against escherichia coli and indole-positive proteus. the inhibitors had no effect against enterobacter or serratia. overall, the activity of ytr 830  was comparable to that of clavulanate, and superior to that of sulbactam.

TI  == association experiments with aerobic and anaerobic pathogens: a model of in-vitro susceptibility testing in mixed infections. activity of enoxacin, clindamycin, and metronidazole.
AB  == in infections of polymicrobial etiology, it seems mandatory to combine an antibiotic with marginal activity against anaerobes with an anti-anaerobic drug,  e.g. metronidazole or clindamycin. we investigated the effect of associations of  anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic pathogens on mbcs of enoxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and combinations of enoxacin plus clindamycin or metronidazole. single testing, and associations of bacteroides fragilis with escherichia coli or enterococcus faecalis revealed mbcs of 64 mg/l for enoxacin. however, investigating metronidazole, mbcs for b. fragilis increased from 0.5-1 mg/l to 2-4 mg/l in association with e. coli. the combination of enoxacin with metronidazole restored mbcs of 0.5 and 1 mg/l for the b. fragilis strains. b. fragilis associated with e. faecalis showed mbcs of 2 to 64 mg/l for metronidazole, an increase of up to 64-fold. the enoxacin mbcs for e. coli in association with b. fragilis were up to eight-fold higher than for e. coli alone  (2 mg/l compared to 0.25 mg/l). association of e. coli with e. faecalis and b. fragilis showed a low to moderate increase for mbcs of e. coli when enoxacin was  tested alone or in combination with metronidazole or clindamycin. in contrast, mbcs for e. faecalis did not change significantly with any of the associations or combinations tested. it is evident that in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of  associations of pathogens can be modified by interactions between strains, and/or antimicrobials.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == activities and sources of beta-lactamase in sputum from patients with bronchiectasis.
AB  == beta-lactamase activity was measured in secretions from patients with bronchiectasis. of 28 sputum samples, 23 contained measurable amounts of activity; values were significantly higher (p less than 0.01) in purulent samples than in mucoid or mucopurulent samples. beta-lactamase activity was usually present in saliva collected before and between sputum expectorations, although values for sputum were higher than for either group of saliva samples (p less than 0.025 and p less than 0.005, respectively). this difference suggests that at least part of sputum beta-lactamase activity originates in the bronchial tree. detailed microbiological study of a further eight specimens (seven were beta-lactamase positive) led to the isolation of haemophilus influenzae from six, although only two of these isolates were beta-lactamase positive. several other beta-lactamase-producing organisms were also isolated, including staphylococcus aureus (n = 3), escherichia coli (n = 1), proteus spp. (n = 1), and bacteroides spp. (n = 3). size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography of the sputum showed several peaks of beta-lactamase activity which usually coeluted in fractions similar to those of their beta-lactamase-positive isolates. therefore,  sources of sputum beta-lactamases are often bacteria not considered truly pathogenic or not isolated during routine bacteriological assessment. these observations should be considered when embarking on antimicrobial therapy in bronchiectatic patients and suggest that increased dosages of penicillins are indicated.

TI  == the efficacy of oral antimicrobials in reducing aerobic and anaerobic colonic mucosal flora.
AB  == we investigated the impact of intestinal antisepsis on the colonic mucosa-associated flora. four groups of dogs were studied: group a received no bowel preparation, group b received a three-day clear-liquid diet, group c underwent mechanical cleansing of the bowel, and group d had mechanical cleansing followed by oral neomycin and erythromycin. mucosal biopsy specimens were obtained for bacteriologic and scanning electron microscopic (sem) studies. no significant difference in recovery of mucosal bacteria was observed between groups a and b. a significant decrease in recovery of aerobes was observed in group c, and a significant decrease in both aerobes and anaerobes was observed in group d compared with group a; enterobacteriaceae and bacteroides were either eliminated or greatly reduced. the sem analysis of group d revealed a marked decrease in mucosa-associated microflora compared with groups b and c. oral neomycin-erythromycin produced a significant quantitative reduction in the colonic mucosa-associated bacterial population, including the potentially pathogenic escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis group isolates. these mucosa-associated bacteria are a likely source of contamination of the abdominal  cavity and wound at the time of colon surgery.

TI  == [pharmacokinetic and bacteriological studies on sulbactam/ampicillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  == pharmacokinetic and bacteriological studies were carried out on sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc) in the field of pediatrics. the results obtained  are summarized as follows: 1. a total of 248 clinical isolates were employed to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of sbt/abpc against various bacterial species. sbt/abpc showed stronger antibacterial activity against gram-positive organisms than against gram-negative rods. 2. the peak serum level  of abpc was about twice as high as that of sbt, and serum levels of abpc and sbt  declined with time. both drugs showed almost the same trend of changes in concentrations. the half-lives of both drugs were about 1 hour. 3. the urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 52-80% for abpc and 70-73%  for sbt. 4. the effect of sbt/abpc on coagulation system was examined. no case showed changes in pt, aptt, tt and hpt before and after administration of sbt/abpc. platelet aggregation during administration of sbt/abpc was slightly faster than that before administration, suggesting that sbt/abpc had no effect on platelet aggregation. generally speaking, it seemed that sbt/abpc was a safe antibiotic for bleeding. 5. the effect of sbt/abpc on the intestinal bacterial flora in experimental animals was examined. escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve were reduced after administration of sbt/abpc, suggesting that the intestinal bacterial flora was affected by the administration of sbt/abpc more greatly than by the administration of abpc alone. in a similar investigation being made with clinical cases, both aerobes and anaerobes showed great changes. concentrations of the drugs in feces increased with increasing dosage, resulting in greater changes of  the intestinal bacterial flora. thus, the total number of aerobes and anaerobes was reduced. no diarrhea was observed in any subjects examined. from the above results, it appeared that sbt/abpc was a safe and useful antibiotic for various bacterial infections in the field of pediatrics.

TI  == activity of fce 22891 compared with cefuroxime axetil and cefixime in pulmonary and subcutaneous infections in mice.
AB  == the therapeutic activity of fce 22891 was compared with that of two new oral cephalosporins, cefuroxime axetil and cefixime against streptococcus pneumoniae respiratory infection and subcutaneous abscesses induced by mixed aerobes and anaerobes in mice. in experimental pneumonia fce 22891 was the most active antibiotic. in aerobic abscesses fce 22891 proved the most active agent in infections induced by methicillin susceptible and resistant staphylococcus aureus while all three compounds were very active, against str. pyogenes. in abscesses caused by gram-negative bacteria, fce 22891 showed good and constant efficacy. cefixime was the most active drug against the two susceptible strains of escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae and also against resistant esch. coli but was inactive against a strain of ent. cloacae that produced cephalosporinase. cefuroxime axetil was less active than the other two drugs against gram-negative  bacteria with adequate efficacy only against a susceptible strain of ent. cloacae. fce 22891 was more effective than cefixime and cefuroxime axetil in preventing and reducing the size of abscesses induced by bacteroides fragilis 101. we conclude that fce 22891, despite its short half life of 6 min in mice, exerts comparable and sometimes better activity than the two oral cephalosporins  characterized by longer half lives.

AB  == the possibility that beta-lactamase-producing strains of bacteroides fragilis can protect escherichia coli from cefotaxime was studied in an in-vivo model of peritoneal infection in rats. the protective effect of cefotaxime, aztreonam and  gentamicin in peritonitis induced by e. coli alone or combined with b. fragilis was evaluated by analysing mortality at 24 and 48 h after bacterial inoculation and treating the animals with two doses of each antibiotic. comparisons, by drugs, at 24 and 48 h revealed that a statistically significant high mortality rate was obtained at 48 h when mixed infections were treated with cefotaxime, a drug very active in the infection caused by e. coli alone. infections by mixed flora or e. coli alone treated with aztreonam or gentamicin did not show any significant difference in mortality rate analysed at 24 or 48 h. these in-vivo results confirm previous in-vitro studies and suggest that cefotaxime could be inactivated in mixed infections if a beta-lactamase-producing strain, such as b.  fragilis, is involved in a clinical infection.

AB  == we have characterized splanchnic blood flows in a rat model of antibiotic-controlled, intra-abdominal abscess (acia) in normoxic and hyperoxic environments. abscesses (1.5 ml average volume) were established by implanting a  fecal-agar pellet containing known numbers and strains of live escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis into the peritoneal cavity of rats via a midline incision. sham-operated rats (sr) served as controls. cannulas (pe-50) were placed into the left ventricle of both sr and acia rats for injection of tracer microspheres (ms) and into the tail artery for a reference withdrawal site. blood flow measurements were made in conscious unrestrained rats before, during, and after hyperoxic exposure by using ms labelled with either 51cr or 85sr or 141ce.  no change in cardiac output (co), heart rate (hr), or mean arterial pressure (map) was seen between acia and sr groups. the administration of hyperoxia diminished the fractional distribution of co to the liver (portal), stomach, cecum, colon, and pancreas in both groups. the percent co to the liver (arterial), small intestine, and spleen did not change in either group. the blood flow to all splanchnic organs, except liver (arterial), was diminished during hyperoxia in both groups and recovered after hyperoxia. in conclusion, central hemodynamics and splanchnic blood flows are not altered by the presence of a large intra-abdominal abscess controlled by antibiotics. splanchnic blood flows are diminished by hyperoxia.

TI  == a soluble bacteroides by-product impairs phagocytic killing of escherichia coli by neutrophils.
AB  == the effect of bacteroides culture filtrate on killing of escherichia coli by neutrophils was examined as a potential mechanism for e. coli-bacteroides microbial synergy. a low-molecular-weight heat-stable factor present in the 22-h  culture filtrate of bacteroides fragilis 9032 impaired neutrophil killing function. to determine whether short-chain fatty acids present in the filtrate could account for the inhibition, the fatty acid content of the culture filtrate  was determined and sterile medium supplemented with measured concentrations of fatty acids was tested for its effect on neutrophil function. succinic and acetic acids were measured in high concentrations, while lactic, formic, and fumaric acids were present in lower concentrations. reconstituted media mimicked the inhibitory effect of b. fragilis filtrate on neutrophil killing capacity. in further support of the hypothesis that short-chain fatty acids were responsible for the inhibition, the filtrates of other bacteroides strains were found to be inhibitory only after bacterial growth had entered the stationary phase, a period during which fatty acid production is maximized. further studies investigating the mechanism of impaired neutrophil killing showed that b. fragilis 9032 culture filtrate inhibited both phagocytosis of [3h]thymidine-labeled e. coli by neutrophils and the intrinsic microbicidal functions of the neutrophil. impairment of neutrophil superoxide production was mediated via the ability of short-chain fatty acids present in b. fragilis filtrate to reduce neutrophil cytoplasmic ph. these studies suggest that bacteroides strains capable of reaching stationary phase in vivo may contribute to the pathogenesis of mixed infections by direct inhibition of neutrophil function.

TI  == induction of macrophage procoagulant activity by bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == fibrin deposition in the peritoneal cavity during acute peritonitis appears to predispose the host to abscess formation by providing an environment for bacterial proliferation protected from host defenses. the purpose of the present  study was to determine whether the potent abscess-inducing anaerobe bacteroides fragilis could promote fibrin deposition by inducing mononuclear cells to express procoagulant activity (pca). b. fragilis stimulated pca in a dose-dependent fashion, achieving a maximum at 10(7) cfu/ml. heat-killed b. fragilis induced comparable levels of pca, while a nonspecific phagocytic stimulus, latex beads, was not stimulatory. b. fragilis was capable of inducing pca even when phagocytosis was blocked by preexposure of cells to latex beads. the results suggested that phagocytosis was neither necessary nor sufficient for the generation of pca. cell separation studies showed that pca was solely produced by macrophages and that lymphocytes did not augment its production. these studies suggest one potential mechanism by which b. fragilis might initiate abscess formation.

TI  == direct and indirect pathogenicity of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in mixed infections in children.
AB  == the recent emergence of numerous aerobic and anaerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacterial strains has been associated with an increase in the failure rate of penicillins in the therapy of infection caused by these organisms. these include  respiratory tract, skin of soft tissue, female genital tract, intra-abdominal, and other miscellaneous infections. the important aerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) include staphylococcus aureus, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus sp., neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and legionella sp. the anaerobic blpb are all bacteroidiaceae and include bacteroides fragilis group, b. melaninogenicus group, b. oralis, b. oris-buccae, and fusobacterium sp. laboratory, animal, and clinical studies that support the indirect pathogenicity  of these organisms and the distribution of these blpb in various infections are reviewed. blpb may not only have a direct pathogenic role in causing the infection, but also an indirect pathogenic role. the indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin  therapy, but also to protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from that drug. these direct and indirect virulence characteristics of aerobic and anaerobic blpb require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against  all pathogens in mixed infections.

AB  == effects of sultamicillin (sbtpc) fine granules, a new oral beta-lactam antibiotic, on the intestinal bacterial flora were studied in tetra-contaminated  mice and in pediatric patients. sbtpc was administered at a dose of 100 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice contaminated with 4 different species of organisms: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve. in all of the 4 species, bacterial populations in feces were markedly reduced on days 4 to 5 after the start of the treatment. subjects in the pediatric study were 5 children with bacterial infections (4 boys and 1 girl) at ages from 1 year 3 months to 10 years 8 months and with their body weight ranging from 11.8 kg to 35.0 kg. sbtpc fine granule was administered at a  dose of 10 mg/kg 3 to 4 times a day for 4 to 7 days. although there were some variations in the fecal bacterial flora noticed among these subjects during the treatment, populations of main aerobes and anaerobes such as enterobacteriaceae,  enterococcus, bacteroides and bifidobacterium decreased markedly in all cases. these decreases were more pronounced for anaerobes and total numbers of anaerobes were markedly reduced in all cases. glucose non-fermenting gram-negative rods and fungi tended to increase with administration of sbtpc fine granule. although these changes tended to return to pre-dosing state after the cessation of the treatment with sbtpc fine granule, attention must be paid to possible occurrences of diarrhea, superinfection or bleeding tendency when treatment with the drug is  continued for a long period of time. fecal concentrations of both ampicillin and  sulbactam during sbtpc fine granule treatment showed relatively high values except 1 sample with a high beta-lactamase activity in feces. these high concentrations suggest the possibility of biliary excretion of absorbed drugs and the possibility of hydrolysis of sbtpc in the intestine due to high ph. fecal concentrations of the drug also appeared to be closely related to beta-lactamase  activity in feces.

TI  == permeability to beta-lactams in bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis strains tal2480 and tal3636 were used to assess outer membrane permeability to various beta-lactam compounds. these strains were chosen because they possess beta-lactamases capable of hydrolysing all commonly employed beta-lactams except monobactams. the beta-lactamases are located in the periplasmic space and could be released by sonication and osmotic shock. permeability was calculated by the method of zimmerman & rosselet (1977, antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy 12, 368-72). the rank order of permeative ability (from fastest to slowest) was as follows: cephaloridine, imipenem, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, cefoperazone, nitrocefin, cephalothin, and latamoxef. our  results showed that ionic charge, hydrophobicity, and molecular weight influenced beta-lactam drug uptake by b. fragilis. these results are similar to findings for escherichia coli, where increased negative charge and increased molecular weight  are associated with decreased drug uptake. however, unlike e. coli, increased drug hydrophobicity, for a given charge and molecular weight of the drug, was associated with increased uptake by b. fragilis.

AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

TI  == comparative efficacies of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ampicillin-sulbactam against experimental bacteroides fragilis-escherichia coli mixed infections.
AB  == amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was compared with ampicillin-sulbactam in preventing  the development of mixed infections produced in mice by subcutaneous inoculation  of amoxicillin-resistant strains of bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli. at doses designed to produce concentrations in mouse plasma similar to those obtained in humans, both amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ampicillin-sulbactam were effective in preventing an infection caused by b. fragilis vpi 8908 mixed with e. coli e96, both strains being susceptible in vitro to each combination. however, ampicillin-sulbactam failed to arrest the progression of infections involving a more potent beta-lactamase-producing strain, e. coli 41548, even when a comparatively low inoculum was tested. in contrast, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid therapy effectively reduced the bacterial numbers at the site of infection. these data illustrate the need to treat polymicrobial infections with agents effective  against the responsible aerobic as well as anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == the cryptic tetracycline resistance determinant on tn4400 mediates tetracycline degradation as well as tetracycline efflux.
AB  == escherichia coli containing the cryptic tetracycline resistance determinant (class f) from the bacteroides fragilis transposon tn4400 on plasmid pgat400 expressed a detoxification of tetracycline as well as an active efflux of tetracycline. this finding concurs with the report of detoxification for a related tetracycline resistance determinant from b. fragilis on tn4351 (b. s. speer and a. salyers, j. bacteriol. 170:1423-1429, 1987), which specifies a 10-fold-higher resistance than tn4400. inactivation of tetracycline occurred at an initial rate of congruent to 0.7 micrograms of tetracycline per h per 10(8) cells, as determined by biologic assay and chromatographic analysis. the detoxification is a chemical degradation which can occur in the absence of energy-dependent efflux. the products of this degradation were not substrates for active transport into susceptible cells or out of pgat400-containing e. coli. these results indicate that tn4400 mediates two functionally different mechanisms for tetracycline resistance: an active efflux of tetracycline and a degradation of tetracycline.

TI  == the natural history of murine intra-abdominal abscess formation.
AB  == we determined the natural history of experimental abscess formation and had a secondary interest in the effect of muramyl dipeptide. swiss-webster mice were injected intraperitoneally with autoclaved mouse fecal suspension and either bacteroides fragilis (10(8) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml) alone or escherichia coli (10(4) cfu/ml), enterococcus (10(3) cfu/ml), and b fragilis (10(5) cfu/ml) after pretreatment with muramyl dipeptide or saline solution. all deaths occurred within 48 hours of injection and surviving mice, including those bearing abscesses, appeared to be healthy throughout the study. the number of mice with abscesses and the number of abscesses per group were at their maximum at two to four weeks. groups with live bacteria had a substantial reduction in the number of abscesses between eight and 26 weeks, compared with two- and four-week values. manual rupture of palpably large eight-week-old abscesses in 21 mice produced only one death and at autopsy two weeks later, all of the mice showed multiple smaller abscesses. abscess formation appeared to be beneficial and the natural history of such may include spontaneous resolution without mortality.

TI  == pathogenicity of capsulate and non-capsulate members of bacteroides fragilis and  b. melaninogenicus groups in mixed infection with escherichia coli and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the relationships between capsulate and non-capsulate bacteroides fragilis strains and escherichia coli, and between capsulate and non-capsulate strains of  the b. melaninogenicus group and streptococcus pyogenes, were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. selective antimicrobial agents directed against either aerobic or anaerobic bacteria were used alone or in combination to explore the effect of eradication of one component of the mixed infection. single agent therapy effective against both aerobic and anaerobic flora was also employed. single therapy of mixed infection directed at the elimination of only one organism (s. pyogenes, e. coli or bacteroides sp.) caused significant reductions in the numbers of sensitive organisms and also smaller yet significant decreases in the numbers of insensitive organisms. however, the abscesses were not eliminated after such therapy. combination therapy or use of a single agent (cefoxitin) directed against the aerobic and anaerobic components of the infection was more effective. non-capsulate bacteroides spp. became capsulate after passage in mice mixed with either s. pyogenes or e. coli. therapy directed  at the elimination of s. pyogenes and e. coli did not prevent the emergence of capsulate bacteroides spp. these data demonstrate the synergy between all members of the b. fragilis group and e. coli and between the b. melaninogenicus group and s. pyogenes, and reiterate the need to direct antimicrobial therapy at the eradication of the aerobic and anaerobic components of mixed infections.

TI  == prevention of intra-abdominal abscesses by fibrinolysis using recombinant tissue  plasminogen activator.
AB  == we studied whether intraperitoneal fibrinolysis using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (t-pa) could prevent abscess formation in the rat model of  intra-abdominal infection caused by fibrin clots. single-dose administration of t-pa at concentrations greater than 0.005 mg/ml at surgery or delivered by open lavage within 1 h of surgery completely obviated abscess formation induced by bacteroides fragilis-infected clots without altering mortality (approximately 0.6%). with mixed escherichia coli-b. fragilis clots, t-pa increased the mortality rate from the control level of 43.8% to 81.3% but prevented abscesses in survivors. this increased mortality rate was probably due to an acute e. coli  bacteremia. antibiotics plus t-pa prevented both mortality and abscess formation. intraperitoneal fibrinolysis may be a useful adjunct to antibiotics and appropriate surgery in the management of intra-abdominal infection.

TI  == comparison of antibiotic activities by using serum bactericidal activity over time.
AB  == in evaluating antimicrobial agents with similar spectra of activity, it is difficult to determine equivalent dosage regimens. in vitro potency, pharmacokinetic disposition, and other factors determine the usual dosing regimen. knowledge of the serum bactericidal activity over time may assist in defining the potency of comparative antimicrobial agents. cefoxitin and ceftizoxime, cephalosporins with gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic activity, have been promoted as monotherapy in the treatment of intra-abdominal infection.  in a randomized, crossover study, six healthy volunteers received single 30-mg/kg doses of cefoxitin and ceftizoxime. greater serum activity against escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis was observed with ceftizoxime than with cefoxitin.  the results suggest that ceftizoxime can be administered in a lower daily dosage  than cefoxitin. we propose that the present study may serve as a prototype for future studies attempting to assess equivalent dosing regimens for antibiotics with similar spectra of activity.

TI  == the effects of chronic bacteremia on the metabolic response to exercise in the conscious rat.
AB  == cardiac function was indirectly assessed in a rat model of chronic sepsis by measuring maximal oxygen uptake (vo2max) during exercise. a subcutaneous abscess  cavity was created in rats by implanting a gauze sponge in the hindquarter area.  animals with sterile abscesses were compared with rats that had the abscess cavity infected with escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis (gram-negative group) or these two organisms plus staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive/negative  group). vo2max was measured during exercise before and after the abscess cavity was infected. after a carotid artery cannula was placed, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, arterial blood gases, and acid-base status were measured in three groups of rats (sterile abscess, gram-negative, gram-positive/negative) during submaximal and maximal exercise. results demonstrated that the infected rats were febrile and had elevated white blood cell counts and intermittent bacteremia, while rats with sterile abscesses did not. vo2max was similar in all  groups of rats both before and after the abscess cavity was infected. the metabolic and hemodynamic variables measured during submaximal and maximal exercise in the different groups of rats were similar. these results do not support the contention that gram-positive and/or-negative bacteremia produce cardiac dysfunction during early sepsis.

TI  == chronic hyperdynamic sepsis in the rat: i. characterization of the animal model.
AB  == we describe a new rat model of chronic hyperdynamic sepsis. after control values  for weight gain, and food and water intake of each animal were obtained over a 5-day period, male sprague-dawley rats weighing 370-425 g were anesthetized, catheterized to allow chronic cardiac-output measurements, and a sterile subcutaneous cavity was formed over the flank area. the animals were allowed a 3-4 day postoperative recovery period. body weight, food and water intake, and cardiac output were measured daily. frequent blood samples were withdrawn for bacterial cultures and white cell counts (wbc). on the third and, in some cases,  the fourth postoperative day, the subcutaneous cavity was inoculated with 10(9) colony-forming units of escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis. the resulting  sepsis was characterized by loss of body weight in spite of normal food and water intake, increased cardiac output, increased wbc, intermittent bacteremia, decreased muscle mass, and decreased cross-sectional area of skeletal muscle myofibrils. two levels of septic response emerged--moderate and severe. based on  the above-mentioned measurements, it was possible to categorize all long-term septic animals into these two groups. both groups exhibited cardiac-output, body-weight, and wbc data significantly different from sham controls. repeated inoculations of the subcutaneous abscess initiated on the third postoperative day resulted in moderate sepsis with no long-term mortality, severe sepsis with 23% mortality over a 3-week period, or a 100% mortality within 4 days, depending on the virulence of the e. coli organisms used. the new model is ideally suited for  pathophysiologic studies of sustained, hyperdynamic sepsis.

TI  == comparative susceptibility patterns of common clinical isolates to cefoperazone:  1981 to 1987.
AB  == it has been postulated that the widespread use of broad-spectrum cephalosporins might lead to increased bacterial resistance to such agents. to determine if such increased resistance to cefoperazone might be detectable, the susceptibility patterns of common clinical isolates to cefoperazone were examined from the pathology laboratories at baptist medical center, jacksonville, florida, from 1981, prior to approval by the food and drug administration, to the present. gram-negative aerobic and facultative anaerobic organisms, staphylococci, and members of the bacteroides fragilis group were included in the analysis. the data obtained were compared with results of similar published studies nationwide. no significant decrease in susceptibility to cefoperazone was detected for any gram-negative species examined. a steady increase in the percentage of staphylococci (both coagulase positive and especially coagulase negative) resistant to cefoperazone was demonstrable at this institution. this was a direct function of the concomitant rise in the percentages of staphylococci resistant to methicillin observed over the testing interval. anaerobic susceptibility patterns of the members of the b. fragilis group were also relatively constant during this period of time. the concentrations of antibiotic inhibiting 50 percent (mic50) and 90 percent (mic90) of b. fragilis isolates as determined by an agar dilution  technique were 16 micrograms/ml and 64 micrograms/ml, respectively, both in 1981  and in 1987. no change in the national susceptibility patterns of common bacterial isolates to cefoperazone was demonstrable in the five-year period during which the antibiotic has been available for clinical use.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == an improved understanding of the mechanisms of resistance and transfer in bacteroides fragilis has been gained over the past decade. b. fragilis resistance to most penicillins is largely due to production of chromosomal beta-lactamases,  although recent findings indicate these micro-organisms can acquire novel beta-lactamases, which can even inactivate imipenem. several of the beta-lactamases of b. fragilis are transferable. most of our understanding of transferable antimicrobial resistance in bacteroides spp. has been gained through studies of the clindamycin-erythromycin resistance determinant found on pbftm10.  this resistance is encoded on a transposon and is widely distributed among the naturally occurring clindamycin-resistant isolates. recent studies have shown that dna can be transferred from escherichia coli to b. fragilis, from one b. fragilis to another, and from b. fragilis back to e. coli. data from a large survey in the united states indicate that susceptibility patterns of b. fragilis  differ in each of the eight participating centres. overall, piperacillin and cefoxitin have been found to be the most active beta-lactam agents.

AB  == shuttle vectors capable of replication in both escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis have been developed. conjugal transfer of these plasmids from e. coli to b. fragilis is facilitated by inclusion of the origin of transfer of the incp plasmid rk2. the vectors pdk1 and pdk2 provide unique sites for cloning selectable markers in bacteroides. poa10 is a cosmid vector containing the replication region of pcp1 necessary for maintenance in bacteroides. pdk3, pdk4.1, and pdk4.2 contain the bacteroides clindamycin resistance gene allowing selection and maintenance in b. fragilis of plasmids containing inserted dna fragments. pdk3 was used to test the expression in b. fragilis of five foreign tetracycline resistance (tcr) genes. the teta, -b, and -c markers from facultative gram-negative bacteria, as well as a tcr determinant from clostridium perfringens, did not express tcr in b. fragilis. the tetm gene, originally described in streptococci, encoded a small but reproducible increase of tcr in bacteroides. these studies demonstrate the utility of shuttle vectors for introducing cloned genes into bacteroides and underscore the differences in gene  expression in these anaerobes.

AB  == the in vitro activity of a new quinolone, t-3262 [a-60969; dl-7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1-, 4-dihydro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid monohydrate], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, ceftazidime, imipenem, and gentamicin. t-3262 inhibited 90% of isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. it was two to four times more active than ofloxacin and similarly or slightly less active than ciprofloxacin. ninety percent of isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited at 0.5 micrograms/ml. it was 4- to 8-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 8- to 16-fold more active than ofloxacin against pseudomonas cepacia and pseudomonas maltophilia, which were resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. most haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml. the mic for 90% of the staphylococcus aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, was 0.12 micrograms/ml; that for staphylococcus epidermidis was 0.5 micrograms/ml, as was that for enterococcus faecalis. it inhibited 90% of bacteroides fragilis isolates at 2 micrograms/ml, considerably more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. the frequency of spontaneous point mutational resistance was less than 10(-10) for members of the  family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas spp. resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculture. similar to other quinolones, its activity could  be affected by culture conditions. t-3262 showed a postantibiotic suppressive effect on escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus.

TI  == comparison of translocation rates of various indigenous bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the mesenteric lymph node.
AB  == bacterial translocation is defined as the passage of indigenous bacteria from the gastrointestinal (gi) tract through the lamina propria to the mesenteric lymph nodes (mln) and other organs. we compared the relative abilities of various aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, and obligately anaerobic bacteria to translocate from the gi tract to the mln in gnotobiotic mice colonized with single strains of bacteria. indigenous gram-negative enteric bacilli translocated in large numbers to the mln, whereas gram-positive bacteria translocated at intermediate levels and obligately anaerobic bacteria at only very low levels. our results suggest that enteric bacilli such as escherichia coli, proteus, and enterobacter are associated with a higher incidence of bacteremia in debilitated  patients, because these bacteria translocate more efficiently from the gi tract than do other bacteria, especially obligate anaerobes.

TI  == acute experimental suppurative pancreatitis in the rat.
AB  == acute pancreatitis was induced in rats by infusing sodium taurodeoxycholate with  or without escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis into the bile-pancreatic duct. survival did not differ between the 'noninfected bile group' (nib) and the  'infected bile group' (ib). at standardized macroscopic evaluation, pancreatitis  was more severe in the ib group (p less than 0.05). histologic examination on day 7 showed suppuration of pancreatic tissue in 6/7 ib and 3/14 nib rats (p less than 0.05). bacteriologic culture of pancreatic tissue was positive in 6/8 ib and 3/17 nib rats (p less than 0.01). bacterial culture of blood, peritoneal fluid of pulmonary tissue was seldom positive. concordance between microscopically observed suppuration and positive bacterial culture was almost total. recall antigen skin testing indicated anergy in the ib group, while the nib group showed moderately diminished reaction (p less than 0.001). similar increase of s-fibrinogen was found on day 3 in both groups, but complement factor c3 was reduced only in the ib group. this experimental model, with suppurative pancreatitis induced by intraductal infusion of an infected bile salt, may be useful for studies of systemic complications in acute pancreatitis.

TI  == efficacy of amoxycillin/clavulanic acid in experimental bacteroides fragilis/escherichia coli mixed infections.
AB  == the efficacy of amoxycillin/clavulanic acid was compared with those of metronidazole, cefuroxime, metronidazole/ampicillin, metronidazole/gentamicin and metronidazole/cefuroxime, in experimental mixed infections produced in mice by subcutaneous inoculation of amoxycillin-resistant strains of bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli. the combination of metronidazole/ampicillin failed to inhibit the growth of e. coli, and exerted only a transient effect on the numbers of bact. fragilis in the groin abscesses. in contrast, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid prevented the development of the infection, eliminating both organisms. metronidazole and cefuroxime, alone and in combination, were less effective than  amoxycillin/clavulanic acid in inhibiting the growth of the infecting organisms.  these results demonstrate the clinical potential of amoxycillin/clavulanic acid in prophylaxis, or in the therapy of mixed aerobe/anaerobe infections.

TI  == metronidazole and gentamicin prophylaxis in synergistic aerobe-anaerobe infections in mice.
AB  == the efficacy of prophylaxis by intraperitoneal injection of gentamicin, metronidazole or both drugs combined was investigated in a mouse model of mixed infection with escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis. a three dose prophylactic regimen given 12 hourly was studied starting simultaneously with bacterial challenge. serum antibiotic concentrations lay within the human therapeutic ranges. metronidazole alone eliminated b. fragilis from the developing infections, but at higher challenge doses the mice developed abscesses which contained e. coli, and mortality was no different from controls. gentamicin alone eliminated both bacteria and deaths in all infections, but sterile abscesses occurred in two of five animals at the highest challenge dose. mixed metronidazole + gentamicin abolished all effects of the challenge bacteria, aborting all infections for all challenge doses with no formation of sterile abscesses. it is proposed that, in abdominal surgery, although metronidazole or gentamicin may be effective given alone for low levels of contamination, for higher levels (e.g. colonic surgery) both drugs may be required.

TI  == the microbiology of multiple organ failure. the proximal gastrointestinal tract as an occult reservoir of pathogens.
AB  == the microbiology of infection acquired in the intensive care unit (icu) was studied prospectively in 205 consecutive patients admitted to a surgical intensive care unit. a multiple organ failure (mof) score was calculated for each admission. susceptibility to icu-acquired infection increased with increasing mof scores. while escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, and enterococci were the most common isolates from infections present at the time of icu admission, staphylococcus epidermidis, candida, and pseudomonas dominated infections occurring in patients with high mof scores. mortality correlated highly with infection due to s epidermidis or candida and only poorly with infection due to pseudomonas or e coli; significant foci of invasive infection were frequently absent at autopsy. quantitative cultures of proximal gastrointestinal fluid in 16 of these patients showed candida, s epidermidis, and pseudomonas to be the most common isolates, and all but one patient colonized with these organisms had invasive infection with the same organism. the proximal gastrointestinal tract appears to be an important occult reservoir of the predominant pathogens in mof.

TI  == prevention of intra-abdominal abscesses with fibrinolytic agents.
AB  == fibrin deposition during secondary peritonitis predisposes to abscess formation by protecting bacteria from host-defence mechanisms. to test the hypothesis that  local fibrinolytic therapy can prevent the formation of intra-abdominal abscess,  daily injections of the fibrinolytic enzymes trypsin and tissue plasminogen activator (t-pa) were administered intraperitoneally to wistar rats inoculated intraperitoneally with infected fibrin clots. after 5 days, trypsin (1 mg/ml) had significantly (p less than 0.001) reduced abscess formation in animals inoculated with monomicrobial bacteroides fragilis clots (20% versus 87%) or mixed escherichia coli-b. fragilis clots (11% versus 91%). bacteroides fragilis abscesses were also completely prevented with t-pa (0.25 mg/ml). the number of b. fragilis organisms present in residual abscesses in the trypsin-treated group was significantly (p less than 0.05) lower than in the control group (8.2 +/- 0.2, n  = 7 versus 5.7 +/- 1.4, n = 4, log cfu/g abscess). in-vitro studies demonstrated  that trypsin had no bactericidal effect on b. fragilis, suggesting enhanced clearance of bacteria. from these studies it appears that controlled fibrinolysis at operation may be a useful adjunct to surgery and systemic antibiotics in preventing abscess formation postoperatively.

TI  == the spectrum of escherichia coli--bacteroides fragilis pathogenic synergy in an intraabdominal infection model.
AB  == pathogenic synergy between escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis was investigated in an intraabdominal infection model. defined inocula of e. coli and b. fragilis, alone or in combination, were enmeshed within a fibrin clot and surgically implanted into the peritoneal cavity of rats. a spectrum of bacterial  synergy ranging from synergistic abscess formation to synergistic lethality was demonstrated using this model. the type of synergy exhibited was dependent upon the initial e. coli inoculum. when combined with b. fragilis, high inocula of e.  coli (greater than 10(8) cfu/clot) produced synergistic lethality while low inocula (2 x 10(2) to 2 x 10(7) cfu/clot) resulted in synergistic abscess formation. with respect to abscess formation, there was reciprocal synergy between e. coli and b. fragilis. abscesses resulting from mixed inocula were larger and had significantly higher numbers of e. coli and b. fragilis than abscesses initiated by monomicrobial inocula. these studies define a clinically relevant model of bacterial interactions in the setting of intraabdominal infection and suggest that conclusions drawn from experimental models of bacterial synergy should consider the type of model examined, the strains of bacteria studied, and the number of bacteria inoculated.

TI  == role of intestinal anaerobic bacteria in colonization resistance.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to clarify the role of the intestinal anaerobe bacteria in colonization resistance. germfree mice were associated with escherichia coli c25 and either (a) no other species; (b) enterococcus; (c) escherichia coli m14 and proteus mirabilis, or (d) bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides vulgatus. all species colonized the cecum in high numbers, but only enterococcus significantly limited the translocation of escherichia coli c25 to mesenteric lymph nodes. however, the overall translocation rates were similar in  all groups and ranged from 60% to 100%, due to translocation of other intestinal  flora in addition to escherichia coli c25. conventionally reared mice were given  either streptomycin, bacitracin/streptomycin or metronidazole which selectively eliminated facultative gram-negative bacteria, nearly all bacterial species or strictly anaerobic bacteria respectively. only metronidazole significantly increased the rates of translocation of normal intestinal bacteria into mesenteric lymph nodes. cohort groups of mice were then orally inoculated with drug resistant escherichia coli c25, which actively colonized the cecum of all drug treated mice and translocated to the mesenteric lymph nodes of approximately half the streptomycin and metronidazole treated mice and nearly all the bacitracin/streptomycin treated mice. these results indicate that anaerobic bacteria play a pivotal role in limiting the translocation of normal intestinal bacteria, but that other bacterial groups also have a role in preventing the intestinal colonization and translocation of potential pathogens.

TI  == serum and tissue concentrations of cefoxitin and cefotaxime in women undergoing hysterectomy.
AB  == in a comparative study of serum and uterine tissue concentrations of cefoxitin and cefotaxime in patients undergoing hysterectomy, 40 patients were randomised to receive either cefoxitin 2g or cefotaxime 2g by intravenous administration. serum samples were obtained before drug administration, at the ligation of the uterine arteries and at the end of surgery. cefoxitin, cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. the composite serum half-lives (determined by linear regression)  for cefoxitin, cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime were 0.8, 0.7 and 2.1 hours, respectively. although serum concentrations were higher for cefotaxime than for cefoxitin after a 2g dose, the uterine concentrations (at 40 mins) of cefoxitin were higher (51 micrograms/g vs 16 micrograms/g) than those of cefotaxime. after  a 2g dose of cefotaxime the desacetylcefotaxime peak uterine concentration was 8  micrograms/g. both drugs achieved adequate concentrations in serum and uterine tissue to prevent and treat infections caused by common enterobacteriaceae such as escherichia coli, with cefotaxime having a longer apparent duration of activity. however, cefoxitin provided serum and uterine concentrations above the  minimum inhibitory concentration of bacteroides fragilis for a longer period than did cefotaxime.

TI  == a tissue culture model for study of growth promotion and antimicrobial susceptibility in bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == a new model for testing the susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria under in-vivo oxygen pressure is described. bacteroides fragilis was incubated with a monolayer of mouse fibroblasts or with escherichia coli or with both in tissue culture medium exposed to an aerobic atmosphere with 5% co2. b. fragilis started to multiply when the oxygen pressure of the medium was approximately 13 kpa. the resulting growth curves were similar whichever promoter was used. however, the reduction of the medium took place much earlier in the presence of e. coli. this  may explain the excellent effect of metronidazole on b. fragilis in the e. coli combinations and its solely bacteriostatic effect in the plain tissue culture. imipenem exerted a bactericidal effect in all systems and was the most potent agent tested.

AB  == the beta-lactamase inhibitory properties of 6-acetylmethylene penicillanic acid (6-ampa) were investigated and compared with those of other beta-lactamase inhibitors. 6-ampa inhibited the tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, pse-1, pse-2, pse-3, pse-4, oxa-2, oxa-3, and staphylococcus aureus beta-lactamases. it also inhibited the chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases of the richmond-sykes type ia, ic and id type and the type iv klebsiella enzymes. beta-lactamases of branhamella catarrhalis and bacteroides fragilis were inhibited. the 6-ampa i50 values for various enzymes were less than 0.01 microgram/ml tem-1 and pse-4, and 0.01 microgram/ml shv-1, 0.02 microgram/ml s. aureus, 0.04 microgram/ml proteus vulgaris, 0.04 microgram/ml k. oxytoca, 6.8 micrograms/ml p99, and 9.7 micrograms/ml sabath-abraham pseudomonas enzyme. with isolated beta-lactamases 6-ampa was a more potent inhibitor than clavulanate or sulbactam. 6-ampa was an irreversible inhibitor of beta-lactamases. the penetration index for escherichia  coli jt4 was 23 compared to 3 for clavulanate. 6-ampa at 10 micrograms/ml acted synergistically with ampicillin against beta-lactamase containing bacteria, but it was less active than clavulanate and did not act synergistically with ampicillin against enterobacter, citrobacter or pseudomonas. although 6-ampa has  excellent beta-lactamase inhibitory properties with isolated enzymes, it is less  useful with intact organisms.

TI  == changes in expression of bacterial surface antigens induced by antibiotics and their influence on host defenses.
AB  == concomitant with the discovery that a number of antibiotics were able to induce profound morphological changes (increased septation, thickened walls, filamentation) at low concentrations their ability to inhibit bacterial protein/polysaccharide synthesis was determined. in particular toxin and extracellular enzyme biosynthesis could be repressed by the lincosamines, fusidic acid, erythromycin and streptomycin in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. several of these exoproducts act as antigens associated with microbial virulence  and are therefore of importance in pathogenicity. likewise structural components  such as fimbriae in escherichia coli, m protein in streptococcus pyogenes, protein a in staphylococcus aureus and capsule in bacteroides fragilis and haemophilus influenzae were not synthesised when the producer bacteria were grown in low concentrations of antibiotic. these products, through their importance as  impedins of opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis by white blood cells, are important determinants in the host-parasite relationship. by their loss during drug exposure, potentiation of opsonophagocytosis occurred leading to more rapid  killing of the pathogen. the immunogenicity of the antibiotic-damaged bacteria was also changed under these circumstances.

TI  == cryptic tetracycline resistance determinant (class f) from bacteroides fragilis mediates resistance in escherichia coli by actively reducing tetracycline accumulation.
AB  == escherichia coli bearing a cryptic tetracycline resistance determinant from bacteroides fragilis expressed low-level constitutive resistance to tetracycline  under aerobic, but not anaerobic, growth conditions and accumulated less tetracycline aerobically than did isogenic susceptible cells. this decreased uptake was energy dependent and reversible by increased concentrations of tetracycline, suggesting a saturable carrier-mediated active efflux mechanism. decreased uptake was not seen when the cells were grown and assayed anaerobically. other tetracycline resistance determinants (classes a to e) isolated from gram-negative enteric bacteria expressed resistance and generated active efflux of tetracycline under anaerobic as well as aerobic conditions. when the bacteroides determinant was placed in the same cell with any of the class a to e tetracycline resistance determinants, there was an increase in resistance under aerobic conditions of as much as 48% more than was projected by adding the  resistances expressed by the determinants individually. in cells bearing the class a determinant together with the bacteroides determinant, saturation of the  active efflux system required over twofold more exogenous tetracycline than did cells bearing the class a determinant alone. we have designated this new tetracycline resistance determinant class f.

TI  == the role of bacteroides encapsulation in the lethal synergy between escherichia coli and bacteroides species studied in a rat fibrin clot peritonitis model.
AB  == encapsulation in bacteroides species has been thoroughly studied in vivo as a virulence factor in abscess formation. its pathogenic role in lethal infections caused by a mixture of pathogens has been less well investigated. our previous studies using the rat fibrin clot peritonitis model have demonstrated lethal synergy between bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli. in order to determine  the synergistic role of the encapsulation of the bacteroides component in this model, inoculations of e. coli plus one of seven bacteroides strains of differing degrees of encapsulation were assessed for their effect on mortality. both unencapsulated bacteroides strains tested (b. distasonis 1244, b. vulgatus 4300)  produced an early lethal synergistic effect with e. coli while the heavily encapsulated strain, b. thetaiotaomicron 1603 did not do so. the four other bacteroides strains tested were encapsulated and their synergy with e. coli was demonstrated. control gram-positive strains, streptococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus, did not alter mortality when mixed with e. coli in this model. these studies support the concept that virulence factors other than encapsulation are important in the outcome of polymicrobial infections in which bacteroides species play a part.

TI  == effect of bacteroides fragilis cellular components on chemotactic activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes towards escherichia coli.
AB  == chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmnl) in response to cell components  of bacteroides fragilis alone or in combination with escherichia coli was evaluated. e. coli produced much more powerful chemotactic factors than b. fragilis. the culture filtrate (cf), outer membrane (om) preparation, and lipopolysaccharide (lps) of b. fragilis slightly stimulated chemotactic activity  of pmnl. the culture filtrate and om preparation were capable of inhibiting the chemotaxis of pmnl in response to the chemotactic factors of e. coli but lps of b. fragilis was not able to do so. reduction by b. fragilis of pmnl chemotaxis in response to e. coli was not specific for b. fragilis but also occurred in the presence of facultative bacteria. in parallel with chemotaxis, lysozyme release,  but not beta-glucuronidase release, by pmnl was significantly stimulated by e. coli but not by b. fragilis.

TI  == antibacterial effect of imipenem in vitro against important aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from clinical specimens.
AB  == imipenem is a thienamycin antibiotic of the first generation with broad antibacterial activity. it covers all gram-positive organisms (including streptococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (including pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia spp.) as well as bacteroides fragilis and other bacteroides species. in this comparative study the antimicrobic effect against 1020 gram-negative, 927 gram-positive and 352 anaerobic strains from fresh clinical isolates was tested and compared with that of other frequently used antibiotics. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined by means of a serial dilution test with micro standard plates. within the group of gram-negative strains, imipenem was the most active antibiotic with a mic90 of less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l for most isolates. imipenem shows a broad spectrum of activity against gram-negative pathogenic bacteria including escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus spp, enterobacter spp., citrobacter spp. and serratia spp., and also covers resistant strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter spp. and alcaligenes faecalis. imipenem also shows high inhibiting activity against gram-positive strains and anaerobic pathogens.

TI  == transposition of tn4551 in bacteroides fragilis: identification and properties of a new transposon from bacteroides spp.
AB  == tn4551, a clindamycin resistance (ccr) transposon from the r plasmid pbi136, was  cloned onto an escherichia coli-bacteroides shuttle vector which could replicate  normally in e. coli but was maintained unstably in bacteroides fragilis. to aid in cloning and to ensure maintenance of tn4551 in e. coli, a kanamycin resistance determinant (kmr) was inserted in the transposon. the transposon-bearing shuttle  vector pfd197 was transformed into b. fragilis 638, and putative insertions of tn4551::kmr were identified by screening for resistance to clindamycin and plasmid content. southern hybridization analyses were used to verify integration  of the transposon in the b. fragilis chromosome, and the frequency of insertion was estimated at 7.8 x 10(-5) events per generation. in 57% of the isolates tested a second integration event also occurred. this second insertion apparently involved just a single copy of the 1.2-kilobase repeat sequence which flanks the  transposon. in addition, tn4551::kmr appeared to function as a transposon in e. coli. evidence for this was obtained by the isolation of transposon insertions into the bacteriophage p1 genome. finally, the transposon vector, pfd197, could be mobilized to other b. fragilis strains in which transposition was detected. mobilization from the strain 638 background was via a conjugation like process, but occurred in the absence of known conjugative elements or other detectable plasmids. this result suggested the presence of a host-encoded transfer system in this b. fragilis strain.

TI  == [pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of cefuzonam in the field  of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  == to study the transfer of cefuzonam (czon, l-105) into female genital organs, concentrations of the compound in pelvic dead space exudate were measured in cases of radical hysterectomy due to cervical cancer and analyzed by the two-compartment model. when czon 1 g was drip-infused intravenously, the concentration in the cubital vein blood was 46.95 micrograms/ml at 1 hour after the start of infusion. concentrations in the pelvic dead space exudate reached the peak of 11.29 micrograms/ml at 2.44 hours after the start, were higher than 4 micrograms/ml after 8 hours and were higher than 1.7 micrograms/ml after 12 hours. the area under the concentration-time curve in the pelvic dead space exudate was 77.85 micrograms x hr/ml. from these results czon was considered to be effective when administered at 1 g against infections of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and haemophilus influenzae, but increased dose levels seemed necessary  against infections of staphylococcus epidermidis and bacteroides fragilis. in 3 cases of obstetric and gynecological infections the efficacy of czon was good in  2 cases and unknown in the other case.

AB  == the bacteroides fragilis group has been evaluated as a prospective rapid indicator of faecal contamination of water. fluorescent antibody (fa) stained b.  fragilis group bacteria were enumerated microscopically and compared with faecal  coliform or escherichia coli counts as indicators of faecal contamination. environmental samples included surface waters (raw drinking water and known contaminated water). laboratory disinfection experiments with ozone, chlorine and u.v. radiation were also performed. bacteroides fa counts specifically detected recent human faecal contamination in field samples in 2-3 h. samples with a high  content of particulates or debris limited the sensitivity to about 10 fa counts/ml. viable counts showed that the sensitivity to all three disinfection agents was essentially the same for bacteroides and e. coli. fluorescent antibody counts of bacteroides, conversely, were not altered by any of the agents. therefore, the bacteroides fa method is not recommended for routine monitoring but may be useful for cases where extensive human faecal contamination is suspected (e.g. pipeline rupture or pollution of recreational water) and where rapid remedial action must be taken to protect the public health.

TI  == chemical and biological properties of acetyl derivatives of the hydroxylamino reduction products of metronidazole and dimetridazole.
AB  == metronidazole and related 5-nitroimidazoles undergo reduction of their nitro group apparently to produce such reactive species as 5-hydroxylaminoimidazoles. to define the role of these species we have sought ways to prepare them by the catalytic reduction of metronidazole, dimetridazole and flunidazole. although their respective 5-hydroxylaminoimidazoles were too unstable to be isolated directly, their o,n-diacetyl derivatives were isolable. of these, the diacetyl derivative of the hydroxylamine derived from dimetridazole, o,n-diacetyl-1,2-dimethyl-5-hydroxylaminoimidazole (diacdmh), was used for further study. diacdmh was converted to its monoacetyl derivative, n-acetyl-1,2-dimethyl-5-hydroxylaminoimidazole (acdmh), by enzymatic deacylation. both diacdmh and acdmh were examined for bactericidal activity against such strains as bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and escherichia coli strain sr58, which are known to be sensitive to dimetridazole, as well as a variety of other bacteria. no bactericidal activity was detected, even in the presence of deacetylating enzymes. as the 5-hydroxylaminoimidazole itself could not be shown to form in these bacterial incubations, it remains uncertain whether or not the hydroxylamino functionality of a 5-nitroimidazole has bactericidal activity.

TI  == preterm labor: stimulation of arachidonic acid metabolism in human amnion cells by bacterial products.
AB  == there is a strong association between preterm labor and infection. some potentially pathogenic bacteria have phospholipase activity, and it has been suggested that release of phospholipase from these organisms may increase prostaglandin e2 synthesis in amnion cells and hence initiate preterm labor. in this study we established monolayer amnion cell cultures from tissue collected at elective cesarean section at term before labor. cells were prelabeled with tritiated arachidonic acid and then further incubated after addition of 2%, 5%, or 10% (vol/vol) filtered medium in which either group b beta-hemolytic streptococcus, streptococcus viridans, escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, or lactobacillus had been growing. tritiated arachidonic acid and its metabolites released by the amnion cells in these or control incubates were extracted from culture medium and separated by high-performance liquid chromatography. addition  of conditioned medium from each of the organisms with the exception of lactobacillus caused an increase in overall arachidonic acid metabolism. there was an increase in the ratio of cyclooxygenase to lipoxgenase metabolism and in prostaglandin e2 production in particular when compared to controls. the profile  of arachidonic acid metabolism in amnion cells following addition of filtered bacterial medium resembled that obtained from amnion cells cultured following spontaneous labor. we suggest that abnormal bacterial colonization of the genital tract may lead to an increase in arachidonic acid metabolism in amnion cells with an increase in prostaglandin e2 production and the consequent initiation of preterm labor.

TI  == microbiology of the female genital tract.
AB  == patients who contract genital tract infections are predominantly young, are otherwise healthy, and generally respond well to treatment for bacterial infections. these infections are most commonly polymicrobial in etiology, with several noteworthy exceptions. often there is an inciting event such as childbirth, surgical intervention, pregnancy termination or intrauterine contraceptive device insertion. with treatment, prognosis for cure is excellent;  however, sequelae such as recurrent infections, infertility, or ectopic pregnancy can be serious. bacteria encountered in the female genital tract can be divided into aerobic and anaerobic organisms. among the aerobic gram-positive organisms,  several varieties of streptococci such as group b streptococci and enterococci occur frequently. staphylococcus aureus is an infrequent but important pathogen.  among the aerobic gram-negative organisms, the most common is escherichia coli. klebsiella sp. and proteus sp. occur in about 5% of genital tract infections. species that are more resistant to antibiotics, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter sp., occur in approximately 1% or 2% of these cases and are more likely to appear in patients who have previously received antibiotic therapy or who have been hospitalized for some time. among the anaerobic organisms, the most common gram-positive isolates are peptostreptococci and peptococci. clostridia sp. occurs less frequently. among the anaerobic gram-negative organisms, the bacteroides sp. most frequently encountered are bacteroides bivius and bacteroides disiens. bacteroides fragilis is still a common problem but appears to be less predominant. other organisms encountered are chlamydia trachomatis, the genital mycoplasmas, yeasts, protozoa, and viruses.

AB  == to investigate whether the amino reduction product of metronidazole has antibacterial activity, 5-amino-1-beta-hydroxyethyl-2-methylimidazole (amn) was synthesized and tested against bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli strain sr58, both of which are known to be sensitive to metronidazole. neither of these  strains was found to be sensitive either to amn or to the equivalent amine derived from dimetridazole, 5-amino-1,2-dimethylimidazole. both of these amines are relatively stable in the presence of bacteria, making it possible to examine  the bacterial reduction of radiolabeled metronidazole in the presence of amn. this experiment indicated that at least 17% of the metronidazole that disappeared under the reducing conditions of the bacterial medium was converted to amn. we conclude, therefore, that amn forms during the activation of metronidazole by bacterial reduction but is not a bactericidal form of metronidazole.

AB  == steroids undergoing enterohepatic circulation are exposed to bacterial metabolism particularly by obligate anaerobes which account for 99.99% of the fecal flora. the most common transformation is hydrolysis of conjugated steroids. the glucuronidases are synthesized by escherichia coli and bacteroides species. the bacterial catabolism of unconjugated steroids may be considered under several headings: 1. reduction of ring-a due to clostridia species synthesizing specific  enzymes; c. paraputrificum, 3 alpha,5 beta-reductase; c. innocuum, 3 beta,5 beta-reductase; and a new species c.j-1, 3 beta,5 alpha-reductase. 2. reduction of the delta 5 bond by human fecal flora. the specific strain(s) synthesizing the enzyme have not yet been identified. 3. reduction of 17-keto estrogens by the above mentioned ring-a reducing clostridia and by eubacterium lentum. 4. reduction of 17-keto androstenes by bacteroides fragilis. 5. desmolase mediated side chain cleavage at c17-c20 position of 17 alpha-hydroxysteroids by two new species clostridium scindens and eubacterium desmolans isolated from human and cat fecal flora respectively and by clostridium cadavaris isolated from new york  city sewage. 6. and 16 alpha- and 21-dehydroxylase by e. lentum a normal inhabitant of the human gut; it is the only organism known to synthesize 16 alpha- or 21-dehydroxylases. due to the high specificity of the enzymes and the simplicity of extracting the metabolites, biosynthesis of reference compounds and radioimmunoassay reagents is practical and inexpensive. the enzymes can also be used for titration of specific bacterial strains in fecal flora and as markers for bacterial identification in particular for the strains difficult to be defined by regular biochemical reactions.

TI  == [in vitro studies on microbial incorporation of nitrogen from [15n2] urea and [15n]ammonium chloride by human intestinal flora].
AB  == 6 typical bacteria species of the human intestinal flora (e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, streptococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, bifidobacterium sp.) were incubated in a liquid medium for 48 h with [15n2]-urea  and [15n]-ammonium chloride. the rates of [15n]-incorporation were calculated. they depend reproducible on the species examined, on the kind of the offered npn-substance and on the amount of npn-substance in the medium. with [15n2]-urea  the minimal rate of incorporation was 3.8% (e coli) and the maximal one 95.6% (bifidobacterium sp.). with [15n]-ammonium chloride the corresponding figures were 31.0 (proteus vulg.) and 98.0% (bifidobacterium sp.). the findings are discussed with regard to a possible enteral detoxification in uremic patients by  bacterial utilization and elimination of urea and ammonia.

TI  == antibiotic levels in the small intestine.
AB  == it is unknown if parenteral antibiotics commonly used for prophylaxis reach adequate therapeutic levels in the intestinal tissue to inhibit the growth of bacteria, such as escherichia coli and bacteroids fragilis, commonly associated with injury to the gastrointestinal tract. we have designed an experiment using dogs to study this problem. we considered an antibiotic to be effective if a single dose reached increased levels in the intestinal tissue to inhibit the growth of the majority of escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis strains isolated from the gastrointestinal tract. of 14 different antibiotics studied, we conclude that carbenicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, cefbuperazone and cefoxitin as single drugs and timentin (ticarcillin with clavulanic acid) and clindamycin with gentamicin and co-trimoxazole (trimethoprium and sulfamethoxazole) achieved therapeutic levels. azlocillin, cefoperazone, cefmenoxime and minocycline failed to achieve significant concentrations. this experiment using dogs was extremely useful to determine the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics in the small intestine and to predict the efficacy of antibiotics considered for prophylaxis.

TI  == beta-lactamase stability of imipenem.
AB  == the beta-lactamase stability and interactions of imipenem were analysed in comparison with those of cefazolin, cefuroxime, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, mezlocillin, piperacillin and penicillin g for a set of representative beta-lactamases. these enzymes included penicillinases such as those obtained from staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and other enterobacteriaceae (tem-1 and similar enzymes) (group a); cephalosporinases produced by esch. coli (amp c type), serratia liquefaciens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa (group b); and beta-lactamases produced by klebsiella spp., proteus vulgaris and bacteroides fragilis and with a high hydrolytic activity for the newer cephalosporins (group c). enzymes of group a were demonstrated to be highly active against penicillins and also against the early cephalosporins; enzymes of group b showed hydrolytic activity for all other tested compounds, including the newer cephalosporins and cephamycins, but not imipenem, whereas enzymes of group c were highly active against the new cephalosporins but not against cephamycins and imipenem. in conclusion, imipenem  shows a moderate affinity for all these enzymes but no detectable hydrolysis.

TI  == evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin against nosocomial infections and multiresistant pathogens.
AB  == thirty-five patients suffering from soft tissue infections (12), upper utis (6),  bronchopneumonia (6), septicaemia (2), chronic osteomyelitis (2), intra-abdominal abscess (2), liver abscess (1), lung abscess (1), acute cholangitis (1), thoracic empyema (1) and chronic prostatitis (1) were given imipenem/cilastatin for 6-21 days. in 22 patients several aggravating factors coexisted, while infection in 16 patients was polymicrobial. the following pathogens were implicated: pseudomonas  aeruginosa (21), escherichia coli (15), enterobacter cloacae (6), proteus spp. (3), klebsiella pneumoniae(3), citrobacter freundii (1), salmonella enteritidis (1), acinetobacter spp. (4), haemophilus influenzae (2), bacteroides fragilis (1) and peptococcus saccharolyticus (1) with mics to imipenem ranging between 0.5 and 8 mg/l. a successful clinical response was observed in 91.4% of the patients, while pathogens were eradicated in 75.9%, persisted in 24.2% and recurred, in 9.1% of patients, with development of resistance to imipenem in two ps. aeruginosa strains. against 150 multiresistant strains of ps. aeruginosa, 40% of  which were resistant to amikacin, 86.4% and 88.9% were found sensitive to ceftazidime and imipenem respectively. it is concluded that imipenem provides the possibility of treating successfully multiresistant and polymicrobial infections  with a single antimicrobial.

TI  == effects of anti-bacteroides-antibodies on escherichia coli and different bacteroides species in vitro and vivo.
AB  == bacteroides species are known to cause synergistic pathogenicity in mixed infections with enterobacteriaceae. in vitro studies showed that anaerobes may compete with aerobes for opsonisation thus interfering with the phagocytosis and  killing of the latter by leukocytes. the present study investigated the effect of anti-bacteroides-antibodies on in vitro phagocytosis of e. coli and on experimental mixed infections. it was shown that in vitro, b. fragilis suppressed the phagocytosis of e. coli by leukocytes only moderately. the addition of specific antibodies to the phagocytosis mixture could enhance this effect. however, antibodies in the absence of b. fragilis were also active suggesting a nonspecific mechanism such as blockade of fc receptors. prophylactic treatment with the immunoglobulin preparations failed to protect mice from experimental infections with e. coli and bacteroides species.

TI  == induction of an atypical interferon by bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli  in experimental infections and in leukocyte cultures.
AB  == previous reports have shown that bacteroides fragilis may enhance the pathogenicity of coinfecting enterobacteriaceae by interfering with the host's immune response. with the present study, we have investigated the possible role of interferons (ifn) in mediating these effects. mice injected with b. fragilis developed moderate serum levels of ifn that appeared just prior to alterations of the animals' immunity described earlier. the ifn was neutralized by treatment with anti-ifn-alpha/beta-antibodies or hydrochloric acid; hence it displayed the  same "atypical" characteristics as ifn found in patients with immuno-compromising diseases such as aids, systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis. escherichia coli displayed the same induction patterns as b. fragilis, while gram-positive bacteria induced "regular" ifn alpha/beta and gamma. spleen cells,  peritoneal macrophages, or liver leukocytes taken from b. fragilis or e. coli-injected animals 6 h post infection were refractory to ifn induction by e. coli lipopolysaccharide in vitro; cells from mice infected with gram-positive organisms showed normal or enhanced responsiveness.

TI  == use of d-lactic acid measurements in the diagnosis of bacterial infections.
AB  == this study explored the use of d-lactic acid as a marker for bacterial infections. d-lactic was produced by frequently encountered human bacterial pathogens under anaerobic growth conditions; bacteroides fragilis produced the largest amount. orally administered d-lactic acid was absorbed from the intestines of rats and later found in measurable quantities in the blood and urine. eunephric and anephric rats that received d-lactic acid intravenously showed similar quantities of this metabolite in the blood. these quantities are consistent with the distribution of d-lactic acid to total body water. isolated liver and lung tissues from rats did not metabolize or produce d-lactic acid. rats with experimentally induced, sublethal klebsiella peritonitis had d-lactic acidemia of 0.2 mm and 25.6 mm at 0 and 6 hr of infection, respectively. in a normal human, d-lactic acid was detected in the urine and blood after a subcutaneous injection of d-lactic acid, and pharmacokinetics of elimination similar to those of rats were found.

TI  == expression and purification of glutamine synthetase cloned from bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == a glutamine synthetase (gs) gene, glna, from bacteroides fragilis was cloned on a recombinant plasmid pjs139 which enabled escherichia coli glna deletion mutants to utilize (nh4)2so4 as a sole source of nitrogen. dna homology was not detected  between the b. fragilis glna gene and the e. coli glna gene. the cloned b fragilis glna gene was expressed from its own promoter and was subject to nitrogen repression in e. coli, but it was not able to activate histidase activity in an e. coli glna ntrb ntrc deletion mutant containing the klebsiella aerogenes hut operon. the gs produced by pjs139 in e. coli was purified; it had an apparent subunit mr of approximately 75,000, which is larger than that of any  other known bacterial gs. there was very slight antigenic cross-reactivity between antibodies to the purified cloned b. fragilis gs and the gs subunit of wild-type e. coli.

TI  == antibody responses to escherichia coli j5 lipopolysaccharide and to salmonella porin in patients with bacteremia.
AB  == this study was undertaken in order to evaluate whether patients with bacteremia respond with antibodies directed towards two outer membrane components of gram-negative bacteria. the antibody responses to the core of the lipopolysaccharide molecule (lps) of the rough e. coli j5 mutant and to a purified outer membrane protein (porin) from salmonella were studied in bacteremic patients. two or three serum samples were consecutively collected from 77 patients having 82 episodes of bacteremia altogether, of these 50 were caused  by bacteria of the genus enterobacteriaceae. as controls, sera from 82 age and sex matched patients and 100 healthy blood donors were analysed. the antibody titers were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisa). none of the patients with bacteremia responded with an increase in antibody level to the e. coli j5 rough lps. this finding indicates that the core portion of the e. coli j5 lps contains no antigenic epitopes immunologically cross-reactive with gram-negative bacteria causing bacteremia. by contrast, 13 patients showed significant titer increases to the porin preparation derived from salmonella. twelve of these patients had bacteremia caused by gram-negative organisms belonging to enterobacteriaceae. one patient had bacteremia with bacteroides fragilis but also suffered from a severe peritonitis with growth of both e. coli  and klebsiella. it is suggested that the measurement of antibody response to porin may be of value for differential serological diagnosis in patients with bacteremia, to distinguish between enterobacteriaceae and other organisms.

TI  == the relevance of microbiology in the management of anorectal sepsis.
AB  == eighty patients with anorectal sepsis were studied over three years. all abscesses were drained and pus was submitted for culture. if a fistula was found  when the abscess was drained it was laid open otherwise a second examination under anaesthetic was performed within 7-10 days. in no case was sterile pus obtained. gut aerobes, predominantly escherichia coli, were isolated from 49 of 53 (92.5%) of patients with a fistula and 8 of 27 (29.6%) of those without. 'gut-specific bacteroides' predominantly bacteroides fragilis were isolated from  47 of 53 (88.7%) patients with a fistula and 5 of 27 (18.5%) of those without. anaerobes not specific to the gut, predominantly b. asaccharolyticus, b. ureolyticus, peptococci and peptostreptococci, in the absence of those specific to the gut, were isolated from 2 of 53 patients with a fistula (3.8%) and 17 of 27 (63%) of those without. staphylococcus aureus was isolated from only 1 of 53 (1.9%) patients with a fistula but from 8 of 27 (29.6%) of those without. it is concluded that only patients with gut-specific organisms should be submitted to a second examination under anaesthetic and that culture of pus in anorectal sepsis  is an essential part of its management.

AB  == in a study using pigs, we delineated the dynamic character and the interplay of defense mechanisms that operate in the peritoneal cavity and their effectiveness  against escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis. the bacteria were extensively  cleared during the first three hours. the concentration of both organisms in the  peritoneal fluid decreased by up to 300,000-fold, and the final concentration was a function of the inoculum given. clearance efficiency did not differ between a bolus dose and prolonged bacterial administration. peritoneal absorption was a major eliminating mechanism during the first three hours but was limited to bacterial concentrations exceeding approximately 10(9) colony-forming units per milliliter of peritoneal fluid. intraperitoneal elimination started immediately and continued for approximately six hours. thereafter, residual bacteria were not eliminated, even though the defense capacity was intact. prolonged bacterial administration, however, protracted the period for active bacterial destruction.

TI  == sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14c-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
AB  == bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. in order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14c-taurocholate (tc) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. the results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. supernatants from haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14c-tc uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides  fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- sem) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14c-tc uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). the results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == characterization and mapping of regions encoding clindamycin resistance, tetracycline resistance, and a replication function on the bacteroides r plasmid  pcp1.
AB  == the bacteroides drug resistance plasmid pcp1 encodes clindamycin resistance (clr) and a cryptic tetracycline resistance (tcr) determinant that is expressed in escherichia coli cells grown aerobically, but not anaerobically, and is not expressed phenotypically in bacteroides spp. localization of genetic functions on pcp1 was facilitated by the construction of hybrid shuttle plasmids containing portions of pcp1 ligated to pdg5, a pbr322 derivative carrying the rk2 transfer origin. pdp1 delta 4 is a bglii deletion derivative of pcp1 linked to pdg5 and can be maintained in both e. coli and bacteroides fragilis. by using tn5 mutagenesis and subcloning, we localized the clr and tcr regions on the ecori b fragment between the 1.2-kilobase direct repeats of pcp1. the clr and tcr determinants are distinct and appear to be transcribed separately. control of the tcr phenotype is unusual in that expression is constitutive and is enhanced by a  region encompassing the adjacent direct repeat. in addition, a region of pcp1 required for replication in bacteroides spp. has been identified in the neighboring ecori a fragment.

TI  == microbiologic features and treatment of persistent peritonitis in patients in the intensive care unit.
AB  == the charts of 25 patients who died in the intensive care unit of persistent peritonitis after abdominal operations were reviewed to determine the microbial flora and the efficacy of antibiotic treatment. all patients had undergone two or more surgical procedures for abdominal sepsis and 23 had at least three-system organ failure. the most common organisms cultured were: staphylococcus epidermidis, 24 cultures from 16 patients, candida albicans, 19 cultures from 10  patients, pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 cultures from 12 patients, enterobacter, 16  cultures from 8 patients and enterococcus, 14 cultures from 8 patients. the classic isolates, escherichia coli (11 cultures from six patients) and bacteroides fragilis (4 cultures from three patients) were found infrequently. to determine the adequacy of antimicrobial therapy for this "new" flora, we examined the ability of appropriate agents to eradicate the micro-organism upon subsequent culture. candida sp. were eradicated in 54% (6 of 11) of the assessable cases, while enterococcus and s. epidermidis were cleared in only 25% and 28% respectively. the spectrum of intra-abdominal organisms cultured from critically  ill surgical patients in the intensive care unit differs from that seen in those  with acute peritonitis. despite administration of appropriate antimicrobial agents, these organisms tend to persist, probably reflecting impaired host defences with multiple-system organ failure rather than antimicrobial failure.

TI  == effect of sepsis on activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in skeletal muscle and liver.
AB  == the effect of chronic sepsis on the concentration of active pyruvate dehydrogenase complex has been investigated in liver and skeletal muscle of normal, sterile inflammatory, and chronic septic (small and large abscess) animals. hyperdynamic sepsis was induced by the intraperitoneal introduction of a rat fecal-agar pellet of known size and bacterial composition (escherichia coli + bacteroides fragilis). total pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity was not altered in either liver or skeletal muscle in any of the conditions studied. in hepatic tissue, sterile inflammation increased the proportion of active complex 2.5-fold compared with control. the same increase in the concentration of active  complex was observed in animals with a small abscess. when the abscess size was increased (large abscess), the concentration of active complex was decreased relative to sterile inflammatory or small abscess septic animals. in contrast to  liver, sterile inflammation did not alter the proportion of active complex in skeletal muscle. sepsis (either small or large septic abscess) resulted in threefold decrease in the concentration of active complex relative to control or  sterile inflammatory animals. changes in the concentration of active complex did  not appear to be dependent on the atp/adp concentration ratio or tissue pyruvate  levels but were consistent with changes in the acetyl-coenzyme a-to-coenzyme a concentration ratio. the mechanism responsible for altered concentration of active complex may be mediated through changes in the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, secondary to alterations in the effector concentration ratios.

AB  == bacteroides-escherichia coli shuttle vectors containing a nonmobilizable pbr322 derivative and either pbftm10 (pdp1, pcg30) or pb8-51 (peg920) were mobilized by  incp plasmid r751 or prk231 (an ampicillin-sensitive derivative of rk2) between e. coli strains and from e. coli to bacteroides recipients. inci alpha r64 drd-ll transferred these vectors 1,000 times less efficiently than did the incp plasmids. pdp1, pcg30, and peg920 could be mobilized from b. uniformis donors to  both e. coli and bacteroides recipients by a conjugative bacteroides tcr (tcr erl) element which was originally found in a clinical bacteroides fragilis strain (b. fragilis erl). however, the shuttle vector pe5-2, which contains pb8-51 cloned in a restriction site that prevents its mobilization by incp or inci alpha plasmids, also was not mobilized at detectable frequencies from bacteroides donors by the tcr erl element. the mobilization frequencies of pcg30, pdp1, and peg920 by the tcr erl element in b. uniformis donors to e. coli recipients was about the same as those to isogenic b. uniformis recipients. transfer of the shuttle vectors from b. uniformis donors to e. coli occurred at the same frequencies when the matings were done aerobically or anaerobically. growth of the b. uniformis donors in tetracycline (1 microgram/ml) prior to conjugation increased the mobilization frequencies of the vectors to both e. coli and bacteroides recipients 50 to 100 times.

TI  == [clinical trials of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the field of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  == many different infections including urinary tract infections occur in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. furthermore, in most cases, it is practically impossible to clearly identify causative organisms as in cases of pelvic peritonitis and parametritis. in many incidents, causative organisms consist mainly of escherichia coli, and recently, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, etc. have also been identified. because the new antibiotic, imipenem/cilastatin sodium (mk-0787/mk-0791), is very effective against these bacteria, and because of its wide spectrum, we believe it is especially effective against infections of obstetrics and gynecology. the distribution of this antibiotic into various organs and tissues was similar to other drugs, and it reaches a high level in internal genital organs, hence it should be effective for the treatment of obstetric/gynecological infections. its toxicity is low also, and no side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings were observed in our trials. results of our trials are summarized below: of 9 cases of obstetric/gynecological infections, the antibiotic showed excellent effectiveness against 2, good against 6, for the  efficacy ratio of 89%. no side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings were observed.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of the quinolone derivative pefloxacin was compared with that of three other quinolones, five beta-lactam antibiotics and three aminoglycosides against 367 isolates from hospital patients and from out-patients with genitourinary infections. mic90 of pefloxacin and norfloxacin for each strain was the same; that of ciprofloxacin was a little lower. all strains except escherichia coli were resistant to nalidixic acid. pefloxacin was highly active against staphylococcus aureus (39 strains; mic90 1.0 mg/l) and most strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci (56; 4 mg/l), esch. coli (50; 0.25 mg/l), other  enterobacteria (33; 1.0 mg/l) and pseudomonas aeruginosa 6; 0.25 mg/l). with bacteroides spp. (total 78; 64 mg/l), the fragilis group (23) and the fusobacteria (19) were resistant, but the melaninogenicus-oralis group (31; range 0.06- greater than 64 mg/l) and b. ureolyticus (22; 0.125- greater than 64 mg/l)  gave variable results. amongst genitourinary isolates, neisseria gonorrhoeae (15) and haemophilus ducreyi (34) were sensitive (less than 0.06 mg/l) but gardnerella vaginalis (25) and mobiluncus spp. (11) were resistant (32 mg/l). pefloxacin was  more active than ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, latamoxef and piperacillin against s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci and than gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci. no enterobacteria or pseudomonads were resistant to pefloxacin or other quinolones,  whereas some were resistant to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides.

TI  == use of targeted insertional mutagenesis to determine whether chondroitin lyase ii is essential for chondroitin sulfate utilization by bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.
AB  == bacteroides thetaiotaomicron produces two inducible chondroitin lyases (i and ii) when it is grown on chondroitin sulfate. both enzymes have very similar biochemical properties. to determine whether both enzymes are required for growth on chondroitin sulfate, we constructed a bacteroides suicide vector, pe3-1, and used it to create an insertional mutation that interrupts the chondroitin lyase ii gene of bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. pe3-1 contains a 4.4-kilobase cryptic b. eggerthii plasmid (pb8-51), the escherichia coli cloning vector pbr328, and the ecori d fragment from the conjugative b. fragilis plasmid pbf4. a 0.8-kilobase fragment from the center of the b. thetaiotaomicron chondroitin lyase ii gene was inserted in pe3-1 to create peg817. although, peg817 is stably maintained in e. coli and can be mobilized into b. thetaiotaomicron by the incp plasmid r751, peg817 is not maintained as a plasmid in bacteroides spp. when peg817 was mobilized into b. thetaiotaomicron, with selection for a drug marker on peg817, transconjugants were obtained which had peg817 inserted into the chondroitin lyase ii gene. western blot analysis was used to confirm that intact chondroitin  lyase ii is not produced in the mutant. the mutant was able to utilize chondroitin sulfate as a sole source of carbon, although no active chondroitin lyase ii was produced. thus chondroitin lyase i alone appears to be sufficient for growth on chondroitin sulfate. the mutant also had some minor changes in its  outer membrane protein profile. however, there was no evidence that any of the major chondroitin sulfate-associated polypeptides in the outer membrane were affected by the insertion in the chondroitin lyase ii gene.

TI  == properties of the penicillin-binding proteins of four species of the genus bacteroides.
AB  == the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of four species of the genus bacteroides were examined in cell envelope preparations from exponentially growing cultures and intact cells. upon examination by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis, three major high-molecular-weight pbps (molecular weight, 58,000 to 82,000) were resolved, and low-molecular-weight pbps were seen in all strains  except bacteroides fragilis. the sporadic appearance of pbp 4 in b. fragilis (molecular weight, approximately 45,000) was shown not to be influenced by the concentration of free iron available in the medium or by the stage of growth at which the batch culture was harvested. no pbp that was inhibited by an aerobic environment was demonstrated. the affinity of 35 beta-lactam antibiotics for the  pbps from envelope preparations was examined and correlated with the morphological response. most compounds bound initially to pbp 2 and then pbp 1, correlating with a primary response of filamentation and then spheroplasting and  lysis. compounds such as clavulanic acid bound to pbp 3 at concentrations causing round cells. based on the data from this study, it is proposed that the three high-molecular-weight pbps of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and bacteroides ovatus correlate to the three high-molecular-weight pbps of escherichia coli and that the pbps of bacteroides species perform the same enzymic role in cell wall biosynthesis as their counterparts in e. coli. therefore, the components of pbp 1 are involved in cell  elongation, pbp 2 is involved in septum formation, and pbp 3 is involved in maintenance of cell shape (i.e., pbp 2 in bacteroides spp. = pbp 3 in e. coli, and pbp 3 in bacteroides spp. = bpb 2 in e. coli).

TI  == inhibition of macrophage phagocytosis by bacteroides fragilis in vivo and in vitro.
AB  == a number of investigators have provided experimental evidence for synergistic effects in mixed infections with escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis. in vitro studies have suggested that competition for serum opsonins and diminished subsequent phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear leukocytes might explain these effects. in the present study we evaluated the effect of b. fragilis on macrophage phagocytosis. it was shown that peritoneal macrophages from mice injected intravenously 6 to 12 h earlier with 10(8) cfu of encapsulated b. fragilis were markedly suppressed in their phagocytic ability. injections of laboratory-passaged, less-encapsulated b. fragilis, other bacteria, or latex particles were either not suppressive of macrophage phagocytosis or less effective. when peritoneal macrophages were treated in vitro for 24 h with the same challenge organisms prior to assessing their phagocytic capacity, encapsulated b. fragilis also proved significantly more suppressive than challenges with other organisms or latex particles. we conclude that suppression  of macrophage phagocytosis by b. fragilis seems to be an important mechanism contributing to synergistic effects described for mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections.

AB  == the comparative efficacies of ticarcillin and ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid have been determined in the mouse against experimental infections caused by ticarcillin-resistant bacteria. the infections studied comprised an intraperitoneal infection, local tissue infections, pyelonephritis, and pneumonia. both ticarcillin and clavulanic acid penetrated readily to the sites of infection studied and at the doses employed were present at concentrations of  the same order as those obtained in humans after the administration of ticarcillin-clavulanic acid formulations (timentin; beecham). at these concentrations, the ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination caused significant bactericidal effects at the sites of infection against the ticarcillin-resistant  strains of bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus investigated. the efficacy of ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid against the infections resistant to therapy with ticarcillin demonstrated the beta-lactamase-inhibitory activity of clavulanic acid in vivo.

TI  == bacteroides fragilis is a silent pathogen in acute appendicitis.
AB  == the role of bacteroides fragilis in the pathogenesis of acute appendicitis was studied in 135 patients in four patient groups: normal (17); phlegmonous appendicitis (17); gangrenous appendicitis (75); and septic complications of appendicitis (26). aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated from all groups and members of the 'b. fragilis group' were the most common anaerobic isolates. the rate of isolation of b. fragilis was similar from normal and inflamed appendices but was significantly higher from those with septic complications (p less than 0.01). antibodies against b. fragilis were demonstrated in patients of  all groups and occurred with similar frequencies in patients with normal and inflamed appendices but at a significantly higher rate in those with septic complications (p less than 0.01). whereas patients in this latter group showed igm-antibody responses to b. fragilis only, those with acute appendicitis had igm antibodies against a wide range of organisms of the 'b. fragilis group' which suggests that b. fragilis does not play a significant role in acute appendicitis  but may be a major cause of its septic complications.

AB  == polymicrobial infections are frequently found in soft tissue infections of the lower extremities in diabetic patients. the relative susceptibility to and persistence of soft tissue polymicrobial infections of diabetic and nondiabetic mice using bacteria commonly found in clinical foot infections were studied. subcutaneous abscesses were induced in three groups of diabetic and nondiabetic mice using: (1) e. coli and enterococcus, (2) enterococcus and bacteroides fragilis (b. fragilis), and (3) e. coli and b. fragilis. abscesses were removed at 1 and 2 wk for total colony counts. at 1 wk, there was a significantly greater bacterial growth in the abscesses of the diabetic mice compared with the nondiabetic mice only in the group injected with enterococcus and b. fragilis. there were significantly higher colony counts in the diabetic compared with the nondiabetic mice in all three groups at 2 wk after injection of the bacteria. two weeks after injection of inocula containing b. fragilis, both in combination with e. coli or enterococcus, all nondiabetic mice had eradicated b. fragilis from the abscesses, but significant numbers of b. fragilis persisted in the abscesses of the diabetic mice. in the diabetic mice, the presence of enterococci was more synergistic for growth of b. fragilis than was the presence of e. coli. these studies demonstrate that the bacteria of polymicrobial soft tissue infections persist for a longer period of time in the diabetic compared with the nondiabetic host. in addition, b. fragilis has increased pathogenicity in the diabetic compared with the nondiabetic host, particularly in the presence of enterococci.

TI  == variation in the potentiation of beta-lactam antibiotic activity by clavulanic acid and sulbactam against multiply antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

TI  == the efficacy of pefloxacin in comparison to gentamicin in the treatment of experimentally induced peritonitis in rats.
AB  == a reproducible experimental model of intra-abdominal infections in rats has been  devised in order to stimulate intra-abdominal sepsis in patients. pre-operatively, the rats were fed with lean ground beef for two weeks in order to change the intestinal flora to one similar to that of humans. a 1 cm segment of ileum was isolated on its vascular pedicle. the intestine was then divided at  each end of the segment and intestinal continuity was re-established by an end-to-end anastomosis. the segment of ileum was then returned to the abdominal cavity. this experimental model was used to compare the efficacy of pefloxacin alone and in combination with metronidazole with the combination gentamicin and metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections. seventy per cent of the untreated animals died within two days. within three days 40% of the animals  receiving pefloxacin died. animals treated with pefloxacin plus metronidazole or  gentamicin plus metronidazole had a significantly decreased mortality and increased cure rates during the experimental period. only 5% of these animals died. thus the combination of pefloxacin and metronidazole seems to be as successful as gentamicin plus metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == neutrophil activity in abscess-bearing mice: comparative studies with neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood, elicited peritoneal exudates, and abscesses.
AB  == intraabdominal abscesses were induced in mice by intraperitoneal inoculation of bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli plus bran as the abscess-potentiating agent. six- or seven-day-old abscesses were mechanically disaggregated in buffer, and the cells obtained were fractionated on discontinuous percoll density gradients. neutrophil populations of different density, each approximately 90% pure, were isolated. when the abscess-derived neutrophils were subsequently incubated with normal serum in vitro under aerobic conditions, the viability of the gram-negative bacteria that had been phagocytosed within the abscess did not  change significantly. this anergy to intracellular bacteria (on subsequent incubation in vitro under optimal conditions for phagocytic killing) was also found for neutrophils that had been obtained from abscesses induced by a mixture  that included proteus mirabilis plus b. fragilis and from those induced by e. coli plus p. mirabilis. while unable to significantly kill intracellular organisms that had been phagocytosed in vivo, the abscess-derived neutrophils could engulf and kill organisms to which they were exposed in vitro. neutrophils  from abscesses induced by p. mirabilis only plus bran killed that organism introduced in vitro significantly more effectively than the organisms that had been engulfed in vivo. in contrast, neutrophils from abscesses induced by the gram-positive organism staphylococcus aureus plus bran were able to kill their intracellular organisms on subsequent incubation in vitro as effectively as they  could kill added s. aureus. neutrophils isolated from the peripheral blood and from induced peritoneal exudates of abscess-bearing mice were able to phagocytose and kill organisms in vitro with greater efficiency than abscess-derived neutrophils. the mechanism whereby neutrophils from abscesses induced by the gram-positive organism s. aureus can kill the organisms phagocytosed in vivo on subsequent in vitro incubation, in contrast to the relative anergy to their intracellular organisms displayed by neutrophils derived from abscesses induced by combinations of gram-negative bacteria, is not known.

AB  == we inoculated 120 rats with 2 x 10(9) escherichia coli or 2 x 10(9) bacteroides fragilis suspended in normal saline solution or incorporated into fibrin clots. in the control group, all animals died after inoculation with e coli, but none died after the inoculation with b fragilis; both were suspended in normal saline  solution. escherichia coli entrapped in fibrin did not cause mortality but did result in abscess formation in all animals. bacteroides fragilis incorporated into fibrin clots resulted in abscess formation in the majority of animals. treatment with gentamicin sulfate, ampicillin sulfate, and cefoxitin sodium completely abolished the mortality secondary to e coli suspended in normal saline solution but did not influence the rate of abscess formation secondary to e coli  incorporated into fibrin clots. similarly, cefoxitin and clindamycin phosphate did not significantly change abscess formation secondary to b fragilis incorporated into fibrin clots. we conclude that systemic antibiotics are ineffective in the prevention of abscesses secondary to bacteria trapped in fibrin, either because they do not reach bactericidal levels in the fibrin clot,  as in the case of gentamicin, ampicillin, and clindamycin, or, as in the case of  cefoxitin, because of the inoculum effect caused by the high number of bacteria.  fibrinogen or fibrin itself do not afford any protection of bacteria against the  action of antibiotics.

TI  == a bacteroides by-product inhibits human polymorphonuclear leukocyte function.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated that bacteroides fragilis enhanced escherichia coli-induced lethality in the rat fibrin-clot peritonitis model. as a possible mechanism for this phenomenon, it was hypothesized that b fragilis inhibited host defense mechanisms, allowing the e coli to flourish and kill the animal. culture  filtrates of three bacteroides species were tested in vitro for their effect on human polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmn) chemotaxis and random migration. two of these, b fragilis and bacteroides distasonis, impaired pmn migration. the other,  bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, caused variable inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis. the ability of the culture filtrates to inhibit neutrophil function appeared to depend on two factors: (1) adequate growth of the bacteroides culture, permitting production of the leukotoxic factor, and (2) reduction of the culture ph to a level at which the putative toxin could exert its effect. further studies revealed that the factor was heat stable, had a molecular weight less than 500, and that its effect on pmns was only partially reversed by multiple washings. this supports the concept that bacteroides species may contribute to the pathogenicity of mixed infections by producing a factor that inhibits host neutrophil function.

AB  == a mouse model of subcutaneous abscess was used to determine the penetration into  the abscess and the preventive value of ofloxacin (hoe 280). sterile cecal contents were injected subcutaneously combined with three different types of inoculum: bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli and e. coli plus b. fragilis. for penetration studies three doses of 20 mg/kg of ofloxacin were administered intraperitoneally 8 hourly after abscesses had formed. serum levels at 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 min after the last dose showed mean values of: 6.9, 4.7, 3.8, 2.35  and 1.08 mg/l respectively. simultaneously assessed ofloxacin abscess levels were 3.6, 4.1, 2.4, 1.91 and 1.98 mg/kg. in order to evaluate its preventive value, ofloxacin was given intraperitoneally at doses of 20 mg/kg in four regimens. regimen a: one dose immediately before injection of the inoculum; regimen b: one  dose 4 h after the injection of the inoculum; regimen c: one dose immediately before and two doses 8 h and 16 h after injection of the inoculum and regimen d:  one dose 4 h, 12 h and 20 h after injection of the inoculum. the results are expressed as the percentage of the reduction in the number of abscesses formed in the survivors versus the control groups: regimens a) 30 to 70%; b) 0 to 40%; c) 50 to 60%, and d) 10 to 60%. the viable bacterial counts in the abscess contents  were also assessed.

TI  == intestinal bacteria translocate into experimental intra-abdominal abscesses.
AB  == experimental intra-abdominal abscesses were initiated by surgical implantation of a fibrin clot contaminated with either bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, or b fragilis-escherichia coli. seven days after surgery the numbers of bacteroides (per gram) in b fragilis and b thetaiotaomicron abscesses  were typically log10 8.4 +/- 0.5 (n = 6) and log10 6.4 +/- 0.6 (n = 4), respectively; b fragilis-e coli abscesses typically contained log10 8.9 +/- 0.5 b fragilis and log10 7.6 +/- 0.6 e coli (n = 5). of 38 b fragilis abscesses, 14 b fragilis-e coli abscesses, and nine b thetaiotaomicron abscesses, additional intestinal bacteria were recovered from 21 (55%), 13 (93%), and seven (89%) abscesses, respectively. the additional organisms, in decreasing order of frequency, were enterococci, e coli, staphylococci, alpha-streptococci, lactobacilli, and proteus species in numbers ranging from 2.5 log10 to 7.9 log10  per gram of abscess. histologic sections of contaminated abscesses adherent to the intestine, liver, or spleen revealed normal tissue histology and no breakdown of the abscess wall. thus, intestinal bacteria translocated into intra-abdominal  abscesses by a mechanism that did not appear to be surgical soilage.

TI  == resistance factors in anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == resistance transfer factors have been described in both bacteroides and clostridia. the clindamycin (cln) resistance transfer factors from the bacteroides fragilis group of organisms have been best studied, including our own plasmid pbftm10. the clindamycin resistance determinant (cln x) of pbftm10 can be detected in 90% of cln resistant bacteroides isolated from dispersed geographical areas. this determinant can be located in the chromosome and on plasmids. recent  studies from our laboratory have shown that the cln x genes of pbftm 10 are carried on a compound transposon, tn4400. bacteroides plasmids have been cloned in escherichia coli and shuttle vectors have been developed that allow transfers  of dna from e. coli back to b. fragilis, using the broad host range plasmid rk2 to supply essential conjugation functions. we have shown that shuttle vectors containing pbftm 10 can be retransferred from b. fragilis back to e. coli. in addition, a tetracycline transfer element from b. fragilis strain tm230 is able to promote high frequency conjugation between b. fragilis and e. coli. the results of these investigations indicate that bacteroides has efficient mechanisms to exchange genetic material and that genetic exchange can occur between bacteroides and e. coli, which exist in intimate contact in the human colon.

TI  == antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and its mode of action.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae was comparable to norfloxacin and enoxacin, and far exceeded the activity of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid. the activity of ofloxacin was two  to eight times less than that of ciprofloxacin. ofloxacin was more active against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, acinetobacter spp., legionella spp., and bacteroides fragilis, than norfloxacin,  enoxacin, pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid, and the activity of ofloxacin was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. ofloxacin was two to seven times more effective than norfloxacin in systemic infections in mice with s. aureus, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa. ofloxacin strongly inhibited dna supercoiling activity of dna gyrase purified from e. coli kl-16. there is a parallel relationship between antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and  its inhibitory action against dna gyrases from ofloxacin-susceptible and ofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates of e. coli. these results indicate that the high bactericidal action of ofloxacin and the related new quinolone agents can be explained by their potent inhibitory activities against dna gyrase in bacterial cells.

TI  == bacterial clearance and granulocyte response in experimental peritonitis.
AB  == clearance kinetics of escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis from the peritoneal cavity and functional properties of peritoneal and blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmnl) were studied in pigs. the bacteria, approximately 10(10) colony forming units (cfu) of each species, were intraperitoneally injected. blood and peritoneal exudate were sampled regularly during 24 hr for bacterial quantification and pmnl analysis. the peritoneal concentration of both species fell rapidly in the first 3 hr and then stabilized. approximately 10(2) cfu/ml remained after 24 hr. chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and metabolic activation of the peritoneal pmnl showed little change. in some pigs a  second bacterial dose was injected 6 hr after the first dose and gave an identical clearance pattern. exhaustion of the local defence capacity thus was excluded as cause of the impaired bacterial elimination.

TI  == enhancement of growth of aerobic and facultative bacteria in mixed infections with bacteroides species.
AB  == the potential for mutual enhancement of growth of the bacteroides fragilis and b. melaninogenicus groups and the aerobic and facultative organisms commonly isolated with them in mixed infections was evaluated. enhancement was studied by  measuring the relative increase in cfu of the two bacterial components inducing subcutaneous abscesses in mice. of the 42 combinations between three isolates each of the b. fragilis and b. melaninogenicus groups and seven aerobic or facultative organisms, bacteroides spp. were enhanced in only 8 and inhibited in  4. the aerobic and facultative bacteria were enhanced in 31 of the 42 combinations and depressed in 2. the organisms uniformly enhanced by all of the bacteroides spp. were group a streptococci and escherichia coli (all six instances), followed by staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae (five of  six instances), pseudomonas aeruginosa (four instances), group d streptococci (in three instances only by the b. fragilis group), and haemophilus influenzae (one instance). it is apparent that the growth rate of facultative and aerobic bacteria is enhanced much more in mixed infections with bacteroides spp. than that of their anaerobic counterparts.

AB  == the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy ureido cephalosporin, was determined against 726 clinical isolates. ninety percent of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, salmonella, and shigella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin and piperacillin against these species. concentrations of 25 micrograms/ml of cefbuperazone were needed to inhibit serratia marcescens and providencia species, and 50% of enterobacter cloacae had mics greater than 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was less active by 8 to 32-fold than cefotaxime or moxalactam against most enterobacteriaceae. cefbuperazone did not inhibit acinetobacter or pseudomonas species. hemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml  and staphylococci by 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone had activity comparable to cefoxitin and moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis with mic90s of 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was not hydrolyzed by plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases and was an inhibitor of the p99 e. cloacae beta-lactamase with an i50 of 1 microgram/ml. it was a less effective inhibitor of the k. oxytoca k1 and e. coli tem-1 beta-lactamases than was clavulanic acid. cefbuperazone induced beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa and resistant e. cloacae. a permeability barrier in e. cloacae, c. freundii and p. aeruginosa is suggested by the potentiation of  cefbuperazone's activity by edta.

TI  == tn4400, a compound transposon isolated from bacteroides fragilis, functions in escherichia coli.
AB  == transfer factor pbftm10, isolated from the obligate anaerobic bacterium bacteroides fragilis, carries a clindamycin resistance determinant which we have  suggested is part of a transposable element. dna homologous to this determinant is found in many clnr bacteroides isolates, either in the chromosome or on plasmids. we have now established that ccr resides on a transposon, tn4400. in addition to the ccr determinant that functions under anaerobic conditions in b. fragilis, tn4400 also carries a determinant for tetracycline resistance (tcr) which only functions in escherichia coli under aerobic conditions. the presence of tn4400 on pbftm10 does not confer tetracycline resistance on b. fragilis cells containing it. dna from pbftm10 was cloned in e. coli, with pdg5 as the cloning vector, to form pgat500. using a mobilization assay involving pgat500 and an f factor derivative, pox38, we determined that a 5.6-kilobase region of pbftm10 dna was capable of mediating replicon fusion and transposition. most of the mobilization products resulted from inverse transposition reactions, while some were the result of true cointegrate formation. analysis of the cointegrate molecules showed that three were formed by the action of one of the ends of tn4400 (is4400), and one was formed by the action of the whole element (tn4400).  the cointegrate molecule carrying intact copies of tn4400 at the junction of the  two plasmids could resolve to yield an unaltered donor plasmid (pgat500) and a conjugal plasmid containing a copy of tn4400 or a copy of one insertion sequence  element (pox38::tn4400 or pox38::is4400). thus, tn4400 is a compound transposon containing active insertion sequence elements as directly repeated sequences at its ends.

TI  == peri-incisional mezlocillin versus rectal-metronidazole for wound infection prophylaxis.
AB  == one hundred and forty patients who underwent appendicectomy were included in a prospective randomized trial to compare the ability of preoperative rectal metronidazole and peri-incisional mezlocillin to prevent wound infection following appendicectomy. the results show that bactericidal local tissue levels  of mezlocillin were uniformly achieved using the peri-incisional technique. the wound infection rate for the metronidazole group was found to be 15.9% and did not significantly differ from the wound infection rate when mezlocillin was used  (10.4%). peri-incisional mezlocillin therefore appears to be a viable prophylactic technique against wound infection following appendicectomy and may offer a cheaper alternative to intravenous intra-operative metronidazole administration in cases when pre-operative metronidazole suppositories have been  omitted. the peri-incisional mezlocillin technique is also suitable for routine prophylaxis against wound infection following appendicectomy.

TI  == antibacterial activity of ticarcillin in the presence of clavulanate potassium.
AB  == the antibacterial effects produced by ticarcillin disodium plus clavulanate potassium, a combination of the broad-spectrum penicillin ticarcillin, and the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid as the potassium salt, have been measured in vitro and in experimental infection studies. the presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the activity of ticarcillin against a wide range of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. these included ticarcillin-resistant strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, and the anaerobe bacteroides fragilis. in addition, beta-lactamase-producing isolates of  hemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ticarcillin and clavulanate. clavulanic acid did not influence the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible bacteria. the bactericidal effects of the antibiotic combination were measured in an in vitro kinetic model in which the drug concentrations were varied to simulate those measured in humans after intravenous dosing with ticarcillin (3.0 g) and clavulanate potassium (100 mg clavulanic acid). in these tests, ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid had pronounced bactericidal activity against ticarcillin-resistant bacteria. the protection of ticarcillin by clavulanic acid from inactivation by bacterial beta-lactamases in  vivo was demonstrated in experimental infection models in which the efficacy of the ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid combination against infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria was correlated with the presence of effective concentrations of both antibiotic and inhibitor at the site of infection.

TI  == development and use of cloning systems for bacteroides fragilis: cloning of a plasmid-encoded clindamycin resistance determinant.
AB  == chimeric plasmids able to replicate in bacteroides fragilis or in b. fragilis and escherichia coli were constructed and used as molecular cloning vectors. the 2.7-kilobase pair (kb) cryptic bacteroides plasmid pbi143 and the e. coli cloning vector puc19 were the two replicons used for these constructions. selection of the plasmid vectors in b. fragilis was made possible by ligation to a restriction fragment bearing the clindamycin resistance (ccr) determinant from a bacteroides  r plasmid, pbf4;ccr was not expressed in e. coli. the chimeric plasmids ranged from 5.3 to 7.3 kb in size and contained at least 10 unique restriction enzyme recognition sites suitable for cloning. transformation of b. fragilis with the chimeric plasmids was dependent upon the source of the dna; generally 10(5) transformants micrograms-1 of dna were recovered when plasmid purified from b. fragilis was used. when the source of dna was e. coli, there was a 1,000-fold decrease in the number of transformants obtained. two of the shuttle plasmids not containing the pbf4 ccr determinant were used in an analysis of the transposon-like structure encoding ccr in the r plasmid pbi136. this gene encoding ccr was located on a 0.85-kb ecori-haeii fragment and cloned nonselectively in e. coli. recombinants containing the gene inserted in both orientations at the unique clai site within the pbi143 portion of the shuttle plasmids could transform b. fragilis to clindamycin resistance. these results together with previous structural data show that the gene encoding ccr lies directly adjacent to one of the repeated sequences of the pbi136 transposon-like  structure.

AB  == fosfomycin (fom) is a synthetic antibiotic having a unique structural formula and bactericidal mechanism and a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against various bacterial species. it has higher activity in vivo than in vitro. as therapy, fom-na in a daily dose of 4 g (2 g x 2) was given by intravenous drip infusion for 5 to 10 days to 6 cases with infectious diseases (2 cases of acute cholecystitis, 3 cases of acute localized peritonitis due to phlegmonous appendicitis and 1 case of acute diffuse peritonitis due to perforative appendicitis). the clinical response was rated as "excellent" in 1 case, "good" in 4 cases, "fair" in 1 case and "poor" in none. no adverse effects were observed in any of the patients. six clinical isolates were obtained, and these consisted  of 4 strains of escherichia coli and 1 strain each of klebsiella pneumoniae, and  bacteroides fragilis. the mics of fom were from 6.25 to 12.5 micrograms/ml for e. coli, 50 micrograms/ml for k. pneumoniae, and 100 micrograms/ml for b. fragilis.  fom-na was administered to the 6 cases intravenously in a dose of 2 g before surgery, and tissue specimens and body fluid samples were taken during the operation. the fom concentration was determined by bioassay with a proteus sp. (mb 838) as the test organism. the mean fom concentration in bile from the common bile duct was 61.85 +/- 17.13 micrograms/ml (n = 5) at 95 to 108 minutes after fom-na intravenous bolus injection. the mean fom concentration in the gall bladder bile was 80.06 +/- 92.36 micrograms/ml, while that in the gall bladder wall was 146.65 +/- 39.10 micrograms/g. the mean fom concentration in purulent ascites was 58.20 +/- 13.29 micrograms/ml, 36.22 +/- 14.63 micrograms/g in the appendix wall and 12.64 +/- 11.34 micrograms/ml in pus in the appendix. the fom concentrations in the infected tissues and body fluids thus exceeded the mics of  fom for the pathogenic bacteria. therefore, fom-na appears to be a very useful drug when used for chemotherapy of infections encountered in the surgical field.

TI  == multiplicity of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin antibiotic resistance determinants.
AB  == bacteria can resist macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin (mls) antibiotics enzymically by alteration of the target site or detoxification of the antibiotic. n6-dimethylation of adenine in 23 s ribosomal rna confers resistance to m, l, and s b-type (mlsb) antibiotics. investigation, by dna annealing, of the relationship between the genes specifying this resistance mechanism from streptococcus (groups a,b,d, and h, and pneumoniae), staphylococcus aureus, bacillus licheniformis, bacteroides fragilis, lactobacillus casei, and streptomyces erythreus indicated substantial sequence diversity among the mlsb resistance (r) determinants. a minimum of four distinct classes of mlsb r determinants could be defined: classes a and b for the gram-positive cocci (streptococci pmeumococci and staphylococci), class c for b. licheniformis, and class d for bact. fragilis. these data do not support the hypothesis that the r determinants were acquired recently from a single common origin and suggest an easy exchange of genetic information among the gram-positive cocci. the genetic classes do not correlate with differences in phenotypic expression or in regulation (inducibility or constitutivity) of resistance towards mlsb antibiotics. inactivation of the drug confers resistance  to m and/or l and/or s or sa or sb antibiotics and has been detected in strains of streptococcus, staph. aureus, lactobacillus, c. perfringens, streptomyces, and recently in the gram-negative organism escherichia coli. we have cloned and sequenced a dna fragment conferring high level resistance (mic greater than 2 g/l) to erythromycin by hydrolysis of the antibiotic. the distribution of this 'new' character in enterobacteria isolated from human faeces was studied by colony hybridization using an intragenic probe. the gene for the erythromycin esterase was detected in numerous strains of e. coli belonging to various biotypes, in klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter agglomerans, and in one 'coliform'. moreover, our results indicated the existence of at least two classes of genes specifying resistance to erythromycin by inactivation of the antibiotic  in enterobacteria.

AB  == bacteroides uniformis ryc3373 resistant to 64 micrograms of chloramphenicol per ml was isolated from a peritoneal pelvic abscess of a patient not previously treated with this drug. chloramphenicol resistance was transferable at low frequency to a suitable bacteroides fragilis recipient. the acquisition of resistance was linked to the presence of a 39.5-kilobase plasmid (pryc3373), which was subsequently transferred to a secondary recipient. the transfer of cm resistance occurred by a conjugation-like process. donor and transconjugant strains produced chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constitutively. the km for chloramphenicol was 40 microm, and its inactivation by 5-5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) suggested its similarity to the type ii enterobacterial enzymes encoded by different conjugative plasmids and also to a previously described enzyme of b. fragilis f47 and f48. the specific activity and the resistance level in pryc3373-bearing strains were more than 10-fold higher than in the case of the enzyme from b. fragilis strains f47 and f48. the genetic  basis of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase synthesis in bacteroides spp. had not  been previously established.

AB  == the ingestion of escherichia coli by human granulocytes in vitro was reduced in the presence of bacteroides fragilis or staphylococcus aureus. this reduction of  ingestion proved to be mainly attributable to the absence of opsonization of e. coli, which was due to complement consumption by b. fragilis and s. aureus. the intracellular killing of e. coli was decreased in the presence of b. fragilis and s. aureus because of consumption of complement components required for extracellular stimulation of granulocytes to kill intracellular bacteria. decreased intracellular killing of e. coli by granulocytes containing either b. fragilis or s. aureus is due to the limited killing capacity of granulocytes. these interactions between e. coli and b. fragilis or s. aureus found for phagocytosis and intracellular killing were also observed in in vivo studies: in  an experimental thigh lesion infection in mice, e. coli showed stronger proliferation after coinoculation with b. fragilis or with s. aureus than after injection of e. coli alone. these in vitro and in vivo findings indicate that bacterial interactions, not only between aerobic and anaerobic bacteria but also  between two species of aerobic microorganisms, compete for host defense mechanisms (i.e., opsonization, phagocytosis, and intracellular killing).

TI  == role of imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of soft tissue infections.
AB  == imipenem/cilastatin was given to 243 evaluable patients with moderately severe to severe soft tissue infections. cultures prior to therapy yielded staphylococcus aureus (108 isolates), group d and non-group d enterococci (49), group a streptococci (42), other aerobic gram-positive cocci (72), pseudomonas aeruginosa (54), escherichia coli (32), proteus mirabilis (31), enterobacter (21), klebsiella (20), other aerobic gram-negative rods (58), bacteroides fragilis group (16), and other anaerobes (65). overall, 95 percent (230 of 243) of the patients treated had clinical cure (137 of 243) or improvement (93 of 243). of the 506 strains of etiologic bacterial pathogens isolated from these patients and tested against imipenem, 498 (98 percent) were susceptible to the antibiotic. many were resistant to both older and newer penicillins and cephalosporins. serial cultures of infection sites revealed that 426 of 498 (86 percent) of pre-therapy bacterial isolates were eradicated by imipenem/cilastatin therapy. eight of 498 etiologic pathogens (1.6 percent) acquired resistance to imipenem (seven p. aeruginosa and one enterococcus). such resistance acquisition was associated with clinical failure in two patients. imipenem/cilastatin appears to  be a highly effective, relatively safe therapy of soft tissue infections caused by a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes, both  polymicrobial and monomicrobial in nature. imipenem/cilastatin should be considered particularly when infection by the more antibiotic-resistant of these  bacteria is suspected or proved.

TI  == in-vitro and in-vivo activities of a novel cephamycin mt-141 against the bacteroides fragilis group in comparison with six cephem antibiotics.
AB  == mt-141 inhibited 90% of the clinical isolates of bacteroides fragilis at 3.13 mg/l, whereas six reference cephem antibiotics inhibited them at 12.5- greater than 100 mg/l. mt-141 was stable to the bacteroides beta-lactamases, but the stability alone could not explain the potent activity of mt-141 against the other bacteroides spp., which produced only small amounts of beta-lactamase, but were resistant to other cephem antibiotics. mt-141 exhibited a higher killing rate and more potent in-vivo efficacy than the reference cephem antibiotics against bact.  fragilis no. 36 combined with escherichia coli no. 29. in conclusion, the in-vitro and in-vivo anti-bacteroides activities of mt-141 ranked first among those of the cephem antibiotics compared.

TI  == a comparison of the antimicrobial activities of noxythiolin and formaldehyde solutions.
AB  == the availability of a rapid and highly specific polarographic method of analysis  for formaldehyde enabled investigation of the rate of formaldehyde release from noxythiolin solutions and actual concentrations of formaldehyde in solutions during clinical use and storage. the antimicrobial activity of noxythiolin solutions, equivalent pure formaldehyde solutions and n-methylthiourea individually or in combination was examined against standard bacteriological strains and clinical isolates. several interesting observations were made. clinical isolates were found to be relatively susceptible to noxythiolin in contrast to laboratory strains. the growth phase of the organism radically affects activity, early exponential phase cells being susceptible to 1.0% noxythiolin. levels of formaldehyde detected in fresh noxythiolin solutions are extremely low and would not appear to be solely responsible for the antimicrobial activity observed.

AB  == the activity of sch 34343 against 13 strains producing large amounts of characterized beta-lactamases was compared with that of imipenem, latamoxef (moxalactam), aztreonam and other third-generation cephalosporins. sch 34343, like imipenem, was active against all strains, including many resistant to all other beta-lactams. mics of sch 34343 determined for 16 different inocula were rarely increased even at very high inocula. sch 34343 was rapidly bactericidal against escherichia coli tem-2, enterobacter agglomerans (with an induced beta-lactamase) and two strains of bacteroides fragilis with highly active cephalosporinases. like cefoxitin, sch 34343 was only slowly inactivated by concentrated crude penicillinases which inactivated cefotaxime within 1 h. sch 34343 was even more stable to cephalosporinases than was cefoxitin. stability of  the antibiotics to the different beta-lactamases was also determined by pre-incubating them with dilutions of the beta-lactamases before determination of mics against e. coli 25922. very large amounts of all enzymes were required to increase the mics significantly for sch 34343 and imipenem. these results indicate the good stability of sch 34343 to beta-lactamases.

AB  == the competition of the new penem antibiotic, sch 34343, for the penicillin-binding-proteins (pbps) of escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis was studied. sch 34343 caused rounding of cells, and then sphaeroplast formation  and lysis in both organisms. the primary target in both organisms was pbp 2, and  at higher concentrations pbp 1a and 1b (and 1c in bact. fragilis). these targets  were inhibited at well below therapeutically achievable concentrations. the results indicate that in e. coli and bact. fragilis, the bactericidal activity of sch 34343 is related to inhibition of two out of three 'essential' pbps.

AB  == sch 34343 showed a linear dose response (with respect to aucs) in mice following  both intravenous and subcutaneous administration. it was 100% bioavailable following subcutaneous administration. peak serum levels, aucs, beta-phase half-life and recovery of sch 34343 from the urine of mice indicated that it was  similar to cephalothin and cefamandole. in experimental mouse infections, against gram-negative strains, sch 34343 was more active than cephalothin, equal to or more active than cefamandole and cefoxitin, but less active than latamoxef (moxalactam) and cefotaxime following single or multiple dose therapy. it was the most active compound against staphylococcus. sch 34343 was equally active against strains sensitive to beta-lactams and strains producing beta-lactamases. in an anaerobic abscess model in mice, sch 34343 was more active than cefoxitin and clindamycin against bacteroides fragilis. in escherichia coli meningitis in rabbits, it cured rabbits with a single intravenous dose of 50 mg/kg.

AB  == bacteroides fragilis pure-culture abscesses and bact. fragilis-escherichia coli mixed-culture abscesses were initiated subcutaneously in mice and intraperitoneally in rats. within 1 h after injection of sch 34343, the drug was  present in higher concentrations in the abscesses than in the blood of infected animals. after five days of sch 34343 therapy with either 100 or 400 mg/kg administered five times a day to mice with subcutaneous abscesses, the numbers of bact. fragilis in pus decreased approximately three log-fold, reflecting a killing of 99.99% of the viable bact. fragilis, while the numbers of e. coli decreased approximately 0.5 log-fold, reflecting a killing of 50% of the viable e. coli. after five days of therapy with either 50 or 150 mg/kg administered five times a day to rats with intraperitoneal fibrin clot abscesses, the viable bact.  fragilis again decreased three log-fold; the viable e. coli decreased one log-fold in rats given the higher dosages of the drug. sch 34343 is a promising agent for the treatment of anaerobic infections because it can penetrate into anaerobic abscesses and can kill large numbers of bacteria within abscesses.

TI  == sch 34343: in-vitro antibacterial activity and susceptibility to beta-lactamases.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of the penem sch 34343 was assessed in comparison with third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam and imipenem. sch 34343 was active, with mics generally 2 mg/1 or less, against a broad spectrum of organisms amongst which were staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), streptococci  (though enterococci were less susceptible with sch 34343 mics mostly 4-8 mg/1), anaerobes (including the bacteroides fragilis group), haemophilus influenzae and  neisseria gonorrhoeae. it was also active against the enterobacteriaceae though enterobacter cloacae and serratia spp. were somewhat less susceptible than other  members of this group. sch 34343 lacked useful activity against most species of pseudomonas (including ps. aeruginosa) but was active against ps. acidovorans and some isolates of ps. cepacia. sch 34343 showed a high degree of resistance to plasmid-determined and most chromosomally-determined beta-lactamases; however, it was hydrolysed rapidly by enzymes from some isolates of aeromonas hydrophila and  more slowly by enzymes from ps. maltophilia and bact. melaninogenicus subspecies  intermedius. we did not observe any reduction in sensitivity to sch 34343 for most beta-lactamase-producing organisms, including strains of enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii that were resistant to most other beta-lactams.

TI  == in-vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability and inhibitory properties of a new penem antibiotic, sch 34343.
AB  == sch 34343 is a new penem antibiotic. its in-vitro activity was determined against gram-positive and -negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates. sch 34343 inhibited 90% of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp, citrobacter spp. and shigella spp. at less than 1 mg/1. ninety per cent of strains of enterobacter, morganella and providencia spp. were inhibited by less than 4 mg/1. sch 34343 did not inhibit pseudomonas spp., and it had slightly less activity against enterobacteriaceae than did cefotaxime or latamoxef (moxalactam), but it inhibited organisms resistant to cefoxitin, cefoperazone and piperacillin. sch 34343 inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/1, and it inhibited haemolytic streptococci at less than or equal to 0.06 mg/1. sch 34343 inhibited bacteroides fragilis at 0.06 mg/1, including some cefoxitin-resistant isolates. sch 34343 was not hydrolysed by plasmid- or chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases, was an excellent inhibitor of richmond-sykes type ia beta-lactamases, and also inhibited, although less effectively, the common plasmid beta-lactamases. it induced beta-lactamases, but inhibited enterobacter and citrobacter spp. in which it induced beta-lactamase activity.

TI  == effect of aspoxicillin on anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == aspoxicillin (aspc), a semisynthetic penicillin has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activities against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. its in vitro antibacterial activity was less than those of cefoxitin against peptostreptococcus and veillonella, but was significantly high against bacteroides fragilis, one of the most clinically important anaerobe. the therapeutic and/or protective effect of aspc in experimental subcutaneous abscess or experimental intraabdominal mixed infection due to beta-lactamase producing b. fragilis and non-producing escherichia coli were much stronger than those of ticarcillin. in order to account the superiority of aspc in vivo, the effects of  aspc and other beta-lactams on b. fragilis were compared and the results were analyzed in relation to their in vitro bactericidal activities, stability against the beta-lactamase, binding properties with penicillin-binding proteins and pharmacokinetic properties. interestingly, administration of aspc did not increase the bacterial counts of clostridium difficile in caecal contents, but piperacillin, ticalcillin, carbenicillin, ampicillin and cefotaxime increased the counts.

TI  == effects of escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis on peritoneal host defenses.
AB  == escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis are common copathogens in clinical intra-abdominal sepsis, yet it is unclear how they interact synergistically in vivo. we sought to determine whether e. coli and b. fragilis, in combination but  not alone, could exert a detrimental effect on the peritoneal host defenses of translymphatic absorption and bacterial phagocytosis. our data indicated that nonviable e. coli (o18ab:k56/k7:- and o111:b4), klebsiella pneumoniae, b. fragilis, and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron were handled in a similar fashion by both host defenses of the peritoneal cavity. the use of 2 x 10(8) nonviable radiolabeled e. coli as a tracer and either 2 x 10(9) b. fragilis or 2 x 10(9) e. coli (either viable or nonviable) as a competing agent to inhibit host defenses demonstrated that although clearance and phagocytosis could be inhibited, the inhibition occurred to a similar degree with either e. coli or b. fragilis. thus, b. fragilis did not compete to any greater extent than e. coli did for peritoneal clearance or opsonization and phagocytosis in vivo. these data indicate that bacterial synergy probably does not occur on the basis of reduced peritoneal clearance or by a reduction in the opsonization and phagocytosis of either organism by the copathogen. these results provide indirect support for the hypothesis that in bacterial synergy, one organism directly stimulates the growth of the other, perhaps by providing a growth factor.

TI  == evidence that the clindamycin-erythromycin resistance gene of bacteroides plasmid pbf4 is on a transposable element.
AB  == we constructed a shuttle vector, pe5-2, which can replicate in both bacteroides spp. and escherichia coli. pe5-2 contains a cryptic bacteroides plasmid (pb8-51), a 3.8-kilobase (kb) ecori-d fragment from the 41-kb bacteroides fragilis plasmid  pbf4, and rsf1010, an incq e. coli plasmid. pe5-2 was mobilized by r751, an incp  e. coli plasmid, between e. coli strains with a frequency of 5 x 10(-2) to 3.8 x  10(-1) transconjugants per recipient. r751 also mobilized pe5-2 from e. coli donors to bacteroides uniformis 0061rt and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 5482 with a frequency of 0.9 x 10(-6) to 2.5 x 10(-6). the bacteroides transconjugants contained only pe5-2 and were resistant to clindamycin and erythromycin. thus, the gene for clindamycin and erythromycin resistance must be located within the eco ri-d fragment of bf4. a second recombinant plasmid, pss-2, which contained 33 kb of pbf4 (including the ecori-d fragment and contiguous regions) could also be  mobilized by r751 between e. coli strains. in some transconjugants, a 5.5-kb (+/- 0.3 kb) segment of the pbf4 portion of pss2 was inserted into one of several sites on r751. in some other transconjugants this same 5.5-kb segment was integrated into the e. coli chromosome. this segment could transfer a second time onto r751. transfer was reca independent. the transferred segment included the entire ecori-d fragment, and thus the clindamycin-erythromycin resistance determinant, from pbf4.

TI  == intestinal perforation in typhoid fever: a historical and state-of-the-art review.
AB  == the appropriate therapy for intestinal perforation in typhoid fever has been controversial since the late 1880s. around the turn of the century, surgery became the established mode of therapy, with a mortality of 69% based on 166 patients in the english-language medical literature, and continued to be the preferred treatment until the advent of chloramphenicol in 1948. at this time the surgical mortality was approximately 50%. following the recovery of a few patients with perforation treated only with antimicrobial agents (six initially,  then eventually 22), nonsurgical therapy became the accepted mode of treatment. this change was never justified and this review demonstrates this. appropriate therapy is virtually always surgical, usually consisting of simple closure and irrigation. chloramphenicol alone is inadequate antimicrobial therapy in a patient with perforation and must be supplemented by other antimicrobials directed against enteric aerobic gram-negative bacilli and enteric anaerobes.

TI  == mechanisms of microbial synergy in polymicrobial surgical infections.
AB  == surgical infections are almost always polymicrobial, yet the critical importance  of bacterial mixtures in these infections has received relatively little attention. the convincing data on the prevalence of mixed infections in surgery are reviewed. both clinical and experimental evidence indicate that true synergy  between certain aerobes and anaerobes may exist. of the possible mechanisms of synergy, the most important seems to be the ability of anaerobes, their metabolic products, or their capsules to inhibit phagocytosis of aerobes by leukocytes. other mechanisms of importance in special microbial combinations include provision of essential nutrients such as vitamin k, succinate, and various growth factors by one microbe to the other; alteration of local environment, including reduction of the oxygen tension and lowering of redox potential; and the provision of substances toxic to the host that permit species of bacteria to flourish concurrently. further study of these interactions will shed light on the causes and correction of treatment failure.

TI  == dynamics of resistance to cephalosporins.
AB  == bacterial susceptibility to various cephalosporins of nine of the most frequently isolated organisms were analyzed for the five-year period 1980 to 1984. the disk  diffusion susceptibility to cephalosporins of 1,640,031 strains of bacteria isolated from 242 hospitals in the united states were compared. no significant change has occurred in the susceptibility of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, or streptococcus faecalis  for this period; enterobacter aerogenes showed a slight decrease in susceptibility to moxalactam, cephalothin, cefoxitin and cefamandole. slight increases in susceptibility were observed with pseudomonas aeruginosa to cefotaxime and moxalactam and for bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin and cefamandole. staphylococcus aureus showed slight decreases in susceptibility to cefoperazone and ceftizoxime and slight increase to moxalactam.

AB  == the susceptibility of 554 recent clinical isolates and known resistant bacterial  strains to the new monocyclic beta-lactam ro 17-2301 were studied and compared to that to other beta-lactams (including aztreonam and temocillin) and gentamicin. ro 17-2301 had a high degree of activity against the enterobacteriaceae (mic90 less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l) being similar or slightly more active than aztreonam and ceftazidime. strains of acinetobacter spp. (mic90 16 mg/l). haemophilus influenzae strains (including beta-lactamase producers) were more susceptible (mic90 0.5 mg/l) than those of neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic90 4 mg/l);  against these latter two groups of isolates aztreonam was more active (mic90 0.12 mg/l). both aztreonam and ro 17-2301 had little activity against gram-positive cocci with the exception of streptococcus pneumoniae for which the mic90 of ro 17-2301 was 16 mg/l. ro 17-2301 had modest activity against bacteroides fragilis. the mbc of ro 17-2301 was very similar to the mic and the addition of human serum had little effect on the amount of the compound. the mean serum protein binding was 26.3%. a study of the penicillin binding protein affinity of ro 17-2301 in a  strain of escherichia coli showed pbp 3 to be the primary target. the morphological response to exposure to ro 17-2301 was filamentation followed by lysis after prolonged exposure.

TI  == lethal microbial synergism in intra-abdominal infections. escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == the ability of bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli to produce synergistic mortality when mixed into intraperitoneal (ip) fibrin clots was tested in rats. the addition of b fragilis (2 x 10(9) colony-forming units/clot) to e coli (2 x 10(8) colony-forming units/clot) in the clot significantly enhanced both early and late mortality rates when compared to either e coli or b fragilis alone. multiple washings of b fragilis prior to mixing with e coli in the clot delayed the enhancement of lethality from 24 to 48 hours. by seven days, washed b fragilis was as synergistic with e coli as unwashed b fragilis plus e coli. furthermore, unwashed killed b fragilis was as synergistic when mixed with e coli in the fibrin clot as unwashed living b fragilis. however, washed dead b fragilis plus e coli produced no greater mortality than e coli alone. the lethality of an  ip clot containing e coli was significantly increased when b fragilis was mixed with it in the same clot, injected free ip, and or implanted into a separate ip clot. intraperitoneal e coli-fibrin clot lethality was not increased by subcutaneous b fragilis and was only slightly enhanced by intravenous b fragilis  inoculation. the strain of b fragilis used in these studies did not produce fibrinolysins at any concentration. the data support the idea that synergistic mortality between e coli and b fragilis in this model is caused by a heat-stable  surface factor produced by b fragilis, which acts to increase the lethal effects  of e coli.

AB  == the survival and growth of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, as well as a yeast, was studied in intravenous fluids over a 3-day period. solutions were experimentally contaminated with pathogenic strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis and candida albicans. samples of these solutions were tested on each day up to 3 days for determining viable numbers of the organisms by a membrane filtration method. each organism showed a different survival/growth pattern in various infusion fluids. in 5% dextrose, c. albicans multiplied but only 2-3% of the initial viable cells  of e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus were detected after 3 days. in 0.9% sodium chloride, c. albicans and s. aureus showed growth and e. coli remained viable, but p. aeruginosa was not detected after 72 h. in lactated ringer's solution, p. aeruginosa and c. albicans grew but e. coli and s. aureus were not detected after 72 h. in the amino acid solution, c. albicans, s. aureus and e. coli grew but p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis were not detected. results indicate that the pattern of microbial survival and growth may be substantially different  in various intravenous fluids.

TI  == relative antibacterial efficacy of clindamycin and metronidazole against bacteroides fragilis in vitro and in experimentally infected mice.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of clindamycin and metronidazole against bacteroides fragilis was quantitated in vitro by mic determination and colony counting at 24  h and in vivo from the effects on an experimental b. fragilis infection in mice;  this infection was established after co-inoculation of b. fragilis and escherichia coli. in vitro, clindamycin was 8 to 16 times more effective than metronidazole in terms of mic values, and more than 30 times according to colony  counts at 24 h. in vivo clindamycin was almost 8 times less effective than metronidazole according to dose. this was partly due to its less favorable pharmacokinetic properties, but clindamycin was still only 1.6 times more effective than metronidazole according to free plasma concentrations. in vivo neither clindamycin nor metronidazole had any antibacterial effect against e. coli. the discrepancy between the in vivo and in vitro results for b. fragilis is discussed.

TI  == survival and detection of bacteroides spp., prospective indicator bacteria.
AB  == preliminary experiments were performed to assess the use of intestinal bacteroides spp. as indicators of fecal contamination of water. viable counts of  bacteroides fragilis, an anaerobic bacterium, declined more rapidly than those of escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis. however, a fluorescent antiserum prepared against b. fragilis successfully detected high proportions (18 to greater than 50%) of b. fragilis cells suspended for 8 days in aerobic water in dialysis bags at the ambient temperature. these percentages were higher than the  percent viable recoveries of the two indicator bacteria used for comparison. thus, the fluorescent antiserum test for b. fragilis might serve as a useful indicator of fecal contamination of water. an advantage of this approach over coliform analysis is the rapidity at which the test can be performed.

TI  == cefmetazole: a broad spectrum cephem antibiotic effective on methicillin- and cephem-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == antibacterial activity of cefmetazole (cmz) was investigated by the plate dilution method. since cmz is stable to any type of bacterial beta-lactamases, it inhibited growth of escherichia coli carrying r plasmids, klebsiella spp., proteus vulgaris, and bacteroides fragilis at the concentration of less than 0.78 to 25.0 micrograms/ml. the distinct characteristic of cmz is its anti-mrsa (methicillin- and cephem-resistant staphylococcus aureus) activity. exclusively in mrsa, a new fraction of penicillin binding proteins (pbp) with a relative molecular mass of 78 kd apears, and the 78 kd/pbp possesses low binding affinity  to beta-lactam antibiotics. by the competitive binding experiment of beta-lactam  drugs to the pbps of mrsa, it was revealed that cmz and cephaloridine retain binding affinities to the new 78kd/pbp fraction of mrsa.

TI  == efficacy of amoxycillin and benzylpenicillin combined with clavulanic acid against bacteroides fragilis in vitro and in experimentally infected mice.
AB  == because the insensitivity of bacteroides fragilis to penicillins is due to betalactamase formation, the potentiating effect of the betalactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid on the action of amoxycillin and benzylpenicillin against this bacterium was studied in vitro and in an experimental infection in mice. the addition of clavulanic acid to amoxycillin and benzylpenicillin resulted in a marked synergistic effect against b. fragilis, as assessed by both mic determinations and in 4-h growth curves. in the experimental infection, where co-inoculation with escherichia coli was obligatory for the outgrowth of b. fragilis, both penicillins had a dose-dependent effect on both species. however,  the addition of clavulanic acid to amoxycillin and benzylpenicillin did not increase the effect of the penicillins against b. fragilis or against e. coli. because a synergistic effect might have remained undetected in vivo, the experimental conditions were varied, i.e. the drugs were administered in the proliferation phase of b. fragilis, the clavulanic acid to betalactam ratios were varied, and the drugs were given after inoculation of b. fragilis in which betalactamase production has been induced. however, even after variation of the experimental conditions the addition of clavulanic acid to benzylpenicillin did not result in a potentiation of the effect of benzylpenicillin against b. fragilis.

AB  == gelatine capsules containing escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis in a standardized mixture with rat colonic content and barium sulfate were implanted intraabdominally into rats. capsules of 0.75 g gave approximately 50% mortality whereas 0.35 and 1.10 g caused no or 100% mortality, respectively. in subsequent  experiments, using the 0.75 g capsule, all animals became ill with signs of tachypnea, piloerection, low physical activity and hypersecretion of saliva 6-8 h after the implantation. the animals reduced their water and food intake substantially and the body weight decreased. a significant reduction in blood pressure, glucose and leukocyte and platelet counts was found 12 h after challenge. blood cultures obtained at 12, 24, 48 and 60 h all grew e. coli but none b. fragilis. succumbed animals revealed diffuse peritonitis with growth of e. coli and b. fragilis at autopsy, whereas surviving animals showed abscess formation at investigation on day 8 after challenge. it was concluded that the model closely resembled intraabdominal abscess formation with sepsis in man.

TI  == response of a 'susceptible' escherichia coli to metronidazole therapy: an investigation using experimental subcutaneous abscesses.
AB  == earlier experiments under anaerobic conditions in vitro had indicated that gram-negative facultative anaerobes were susceptible to therapeutically attainable concentrations of metronidazole. this prompted us to study the response of one such strain to metronidazole therapy. mice with 3-day-old subcutaneous abscesses induced by 'susceptible' escherichia coli (accompanied by  potentiating agent and obligately anaerobic bacteroides fragilis) were given metronidazole by mouth (250 mg/kg/dose 12 hourly) either as a two- or a four-dose course. this therapy reduced the viable numbers of e. coli/abscess by a mere 0.3  log10 and 0.7 log10, respectively. assays showed that concentrations of metronidazole in abscess-contents compared favourably with those in the earlier in vitro experiments. but measurement of redox potentials in abscesses indicated  that the conditions in these (-191 mv vs. ag/agcl) were not nearly as reduced as  those in experiments in vitro (-650 mv). this, and the known dependence of metronidazole on low redox potentials for expression of its antimicrobial ability, appears to be the explanation for the poor anticoliform effect in the subcutaneous abscess model. full assessment of the clinical implications of these observations must await the availability of data regarding redox potentials in clinical situations.

TI  == plasmid transfer from escherichia coli to bacteroides fragilis: differential expression of antibiotic resistance phenotypes.
AB  == a unique shuttle plasmid, pdp1, has been constructed to mediate gene transfer between escherichia coli and the gram-negative anaerobe bacteroides fragilis. pdp1 contains the pbr322 replicon and the bacteroides clindamycin resistance plasmid pcp1 linked to the transfer origin of the broad host range plasmid rk2. pdp1 can be transferred from e. coli to b. fragilis by the rk2 conjugation system even though rk2 itself is not maintained in the bacteroides recipients. the antibiotic resistance and replication functions of pdp1 have been mapped by deletion analysis, and a 5-kilobase portion of the plasmid has been identified as the essential region for maintenance in bacteroides. comparison of the resistance conferred by pdp1 on e. coli and b. fragilis shows that antibiotic resistance genes are expressed differently in aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. these results  document the feasibility of gene transfer from e. coli to b. fragilis and demonstrate the usefulness of this conjugation system to study genetic structure  and expression in bacteroides.

AB  == penetration of lincomycin (lcm) in choledochal and cholecystic bile as well as in the gallbladder tissue and liver tissue was investigated together with bacteria detectable in the bile in order to evaluate basically usefulness of this antibiotic in the treatment of infections of the hepatocystic duct. intravenous drip infusion of lcm 1.5 g (in 500 ml of 5% glucose solution) over 1.5--2 hours resulted in mean drug concentrations of 33.9 and 10.1 micrograms/ml in serum at 2 and 4 hours post start of infusion respectively; 215.5 micrograms/ml in choledochal bile at 3 hours 15 minutes; 252.7 micrograms/ml in cholecystic bile at 3 hours 36 minutes; 28.1 micrograms/g in gallbladder tissue at 2 hours 55 minutes; and 15.4 micrograms/g in liver tissue at 4 hours. a cross-over study of  lcm and cefazolin (cez) in 2 cases where t-tubes were employed demonstrated evidently higher biliary levels of lcm than cez. bacteriological examination showed that hafnia alvei plus streptococcus faecalis were presented in choledochal bile from just 1 of 4 cases while in cholecystic bile from 9 of 15 cases were detected 22 strains of organisms including klebsiella pneumoniae (7 strains), bacteroides fragilis (5), escherichia coli (2), citrobacter freundii (2) and serratia marcescens (2). a total of 7 strains of anaerobes including b. fragilis was isolated. the above concentrations of lcm in the bile, gallbladder tissue and liver tissue sufficiently covered the mic90 of this antibiotic determined by us in 1980 for major species of anaerobes including clinical isolates of b. fragilis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == tumour enhancement associated with induction of abscesses in mice bearing a transplantable solid tumour.
AB  == a model of intraabdominal sepsis in the tumour-bearing host was established in order to study the interactions between host, tumour and infecting organisms. balb/c mice bearing a transplanted tumour were given an intraperitoneal inoculum  containing bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli and bran as an abscess-potentiating agent. tumour-bearing mice formed abscesses which were not significantly smaller than in controls except late in tumour growth. the bacterial contents of the abscesses were not significantly different to controls. in contrast, mice given an abscess-inducing mixture at or near the time of tumour cell inoculation had tumours which were significantly larger than in controls. the mechanism of tumour enhancement is not known.

TI  == abscess induction in beige (bg/bg) mutant mice.
AB  == humans with chediak-higashi syndrome (chs) and several animal species with similar defects have been reported to have increased susceptibility to infection, including abscess formation, associated with granulocyte abnormalities. these defects were investigated by comparing mice of the sb/le strain, homozygous for the beige mutation, with their heterozygous littermates and with normal balb/c mice with respect to the ability to form intraabdominal abscesses. mice were autopsied 7 days after the intraperitoneal inoculation of a mixture of bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli and an abscess-potentiating agent, bran. although homozygous beige mice formed more numerous abscesses than controls, the  total abscess sizes and bacterial contents were not significantly different. histopathologically, the abscesses resembled those in normal mice. phagocytic killing assays using granulocytes from beige mice of the sb/le and c57bl/6j strains showed no significant differences between homozygous beige mice and controls. within the context of these experiments in which neutrophil function in vivo and in vitro was examined with respect to anaerobic and facultative gram-negative bacteria, it is concluded that beige mice can respond adequately to an infectious bacterial challenge. the increased susceptibility to an infection seen in various species with chs-like disease may relate to virulence factors of  the infecting organisms and defects in host defences documented by others but not manifest in these experiments.

TI  == infection and the use of antibiotics in crohn's disease.
AB  == many patients with crohn's disease present with the complications of infection. hence, antibiotics play an important role in the medical management of acute inflammatory disease, persistent perianal disease and as prophylaxis for surgical operations. the author's group has demonstrated that bacteria colonize the serosa of the bowel in patients with crohn's disease in 27% of cases. furthermore, pathogenic bacteria could be recovered from the lymph nodes in 33% of patients with crohn's disease, compared with only 5% in a controlled population. extraintestinal bacterial colonization was, therefore, present in approximately half of all patients requiring an operation for crohn's disease. the principal bacteria isolated at these sites were escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, proteus sp and diphtheroids. a prospective controlled trial on the use of 1 month's antimicrobial therapy in patients with relapse of crohn's disease revealed that metronidazole was associated with a 57% response rate, compared with a response of only 17% in patients receiving no metronidazole. these interim findings suggest that metronidazole may have a role in the management of acute relapse in patients with crohn's disease.

TI  == production of menaquinones by intestinal anaerobes.
AB  == ninety intestinal organisms (71 isolates from fecal samples of neutropenic patients with cancer or from various sites in patients with intraabdominal infections and 19 control strains) were examined by reverse-phase thin-layer chromatography for their ability to produce menaquinones in vitro. menaquinones were found in all of 24 organisms of the bacteroides fragilis group. two other bacteroides species, bacteroides disiens and bacteroides bivius, also produced menaquinones. a single isolate of bacteroides species lacked menaquinones. these  constituents were found in all of five strains of escherichia coli, all of four strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, five of eight strains of propionibacterium species, two of five strains of eubacterium species, and the one strain each of arachnia propionica and veillonella parvula tested. no menaquinones were detected in organisms of the genera fusobacterium, clostridium, bifidobacterium, lactobacillus, actinomyces, peptococcus, or peptostreptococcus. these findings suggest that e. coli, bacteroides species, and some gram-positive, anaerobic, non-spore-forming bacilli produce menaquinones that may be a source of vitamin k  in patients who are deprived of exogenous vitamin k1.

TI  == comparative cervical microflora shifts after cefoxitin or cefazolin prophylaxis against infection following cesarean section.
AB  == the aerobic and anaerobic cervical microflora was determined before operation and on day 4 after operation in groups of women undergoing a clinical trial of prophylaxis with three doses of cefoxitin, cefazolin, or placebo for infectious complications of nonelective cesarean section. floral shifts occurred post partum, with return of escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis and a decrease in candida colonization. no significant differences in flora existed preoperatively among patients receiving cefoxitin, cefazolin, or placebo, but by  day 4, both antibiotic groups had greater enterococcal colonization. this difference was more marked with cefoxitin than with cefazolin. no difference in e. coli or b. fragilis colonization was noted by day 4 in placebo and antibiotic  groups. resistance developing in isolates in the antibiotic groups was mainly a result of enterococcal colonization. results of this study indicate that a three-dose cephalosporin prophylactic regimen resulted in a significant selection of resistant enterococcal colonization but there was no increase in nosocomial infection in the antibiotic groups compared to the placebo group. there did not appear to be significant differences in either species selection or antibiotic resistance of aerobic or anerobic microflora between the cefoxitin and cefazolin  groups.

TI  == hypoprothrombinemia in febrile, neutropenic patients with cancer: association with antimicrobial suppression of intestinal microflora.
AB  == serial, twice-weekly prothrombin times were determined in 108 febrile, granulocytopenic patients with cancer who were prospectively randomized to receive empiric antimicrobial therapy with moxalactam plus ticarcillin (m/t) or tobramycin plus ticarcillin (t/t). thirty of 54 patients given m/t and 13 of 54 patients given t/t developed prothrombin times that were greater than or equal to 2 sec beyond control values (p less than .001) after a mean of 6.5 days of antimicrobial therapy. serious bleeding episodes were more frequent in the group  given m/t than in that given t/t (10 and two patients, respectively; p less than  or equal to .05). serial quantitative stool cultures revealed that both escherichia coli and bacteroides species were suppressed by greater than or equal to 5 log10 in eight of nine patients given m/t and in three of nine given t/t (p  less than .05, fisher's exact test). a significant reduction of the population of e. coli and bacteroides fragilis, organisms that are major producers of bacterially synthesized menaquinones, was associated with a high incidence of hypoprothrombinemia. these observations support the hypothesis that menaquinones  may play an important physiological role in the maintenance of blood coagulation  during episodic dietary deficiency of phylloquinone.

TI  == the development of a model of subacute lung injury after intra-abdominal infection.
AB  == acute respiratory failure in humans often follows extrathoracic sepsis. the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of repeated episodes of intra-abdominal sepsis over several weeks on the structure and function of rat lung. intermittent peritonitis and a bacteremia of escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis were produced by weekly intra-abdominal implants of gelatin  capsules containing these organisms (3.0 +/- 1.0 x 10(7) and 5.0 +/- 1.0 x 10(7)  colony-forming units/ml, respectively; mean +/- sem). after 4 weeks alveolar walls were thickened and cellular with focal areas of alveolar space consolidation: circulating polymorphonuclear leukocytes were increased (12.2 +/-  1.2 to 19.9 +/- 2.0 x 10(3)/mm3; p less than 0.05), as were plasma levels of 6-keto-pgf1 alpha (0.56 +/- 0.08 to 1.02 +/- 0.18 ng/ml; p less than 0.01). after 8 weeks the capillary bed was dilated and the alveolar walls and ducts appeared less cellular but showed fibrosis: the wbc count had increased to 25.5 +/- 1.0 x  10(3) (p less than 0.01). after 4 or 8 weeks of intermittent sepsis there was no  increase in the pulmonary artery pressure or vascular resistance or any change in arterial oxygen tension, plasma thromboxane beta 2 level, or platelet count. we conclude that repeated bouts of sepsis and bacteremia in the rat cause progressive injury to lung alveoli without evidence of altered blood gas tensions or pulmonary hemodynamics.

AB  == the mechanism of action of a new orally active cephalosporin, fk027, was compared to that of cephalexin and cefaclor to elucidate its excellent antibacterial activity against gram-negative bacteria. fk027 showed very high affinity for the  penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) 3, 1a and 1bs of escherichia coli whereas cephalexin showed fairly high affinity for pbps 1a, 4 and 3. the ability of fk027 to penetrate the outer membranes of e. coli and enterobacter cloacae was less than that of cephalexin and cefaclor. however, fk027 was extremely stable to both plasmid-mediated penicillinases and chromosomal beta-lactamases except the bacteroides fragilis enzyme and its stability was superior to that of cephalexin  and cefaclor. these results indicate that the potent antibacterial activity of fk027 is based on its enhanced affinity for the target enzymes and its high stability to beta-lactamases.

TI  == synergistic effect of bacteroides, clostridium, fusobacterium, anaerobic cocci, and aerobic bacteria on mortality and induction of subcutaneous abscesses in mice.
AB  == the potential for synergy between aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic bacteria was studied by subcutaneous inoculation of mixtures of these organisms into mice  and observation of subsequent mortality and abscess formation. the anaerobic bacteria tested included 12 strains of gram-positive cocci and two strains each of bacteroides species, clostridium species, and fusobacterium species. the facultative and aerobic bacteria included one strain each of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. mortality increased significantly when each aerobic organism was inoculated along with either of the bacteroides species. a similar increase occurred when the anaerobic gram-positive cocci were inoculated along with p. aeruginosa (four of six combinations) or s. aureus (four of six). the rate of abscess induction increased significantly when 10 of the 12 strains of anaerobic  gram-positive cocci were injected along with b. fragilis and when nine of these strains were inoculated along with bacteroides asaccharolyticus . the results demonstrate synergistic potential between bacteroides species and all aerobic bacteria tested, between bacteroides species and most anaerobic gram-positive cocci, and between most anaerobic gram-positive cocci and p. aeruginosa or s. aureus.

TI  == comparative pharmacokinetics of cefotaxime and ceftizoxime and the role of desacetylcefotaxime in the antibacterial activity of cefotaxime.
AB  == a single 15 mg/kg i.v. dose of cefotaxime (ctx) and ceftizoxime (ctz) were given  to six adult volunteers on two separate occasions in a cross-over experiment to determine the pharmacokinetics of each drug and the desacetyl metabolite of cefotaxime, desacetylcefotaxime (des-ctx). from these data, mock serum samples were prepared in human serum to simulate the concentrations of ctx, ctz, and des-ctx at the following times postdose: 5, 10, 30, and 45 min; 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4,  5, 6, 8, and 10 hr. at each of these time periods, serum bacteriostatic and bactericidal assays were performed against selected pathogens (escherichia coli,  serratia marcescens, enterobacter species) with similar susceptibilities to ctx and ctz, but with varying sensitivity to des-ctx, and against one organism (bacteroides fragilis) toward which ctx and des-ctx exhibited synergistic activity. from these studies, it was found that des-ctx can appreciably lengthen  the microbiologic action of ctx when it has a high degree of inherent activity (mic less than or equal to mcg/ml) against the organism, or when it behaves synergistically with ctx toward the bacterium, or both. it is possible that the major advance of ctx and ctz pertains to their ability to kill many organisms at  extremely low concentrations, allowing for monotherapy with low and infrequent dosing, which is very cost-effective in comparison with high and more frequent dosing required by older agents or with antibiotic combinations.

TI  == interaction of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime against pathogenic bacteria. assessment with the serum bactericidal test.
AB  == cefotaxime (ctx), a third-generation cephalosporin with high potency against virtually all enterobacteriaceae as well as many other clinically important facultative and anaerobic bacteria, is metabolized in vivo to desacetylcefotaxime (des-ctx), which also has intrinsic antibacterial activity, albeit less than the  parent compound. to assess the possible additive or synergistic interaction of ctx and its main metabolite, we used a micromethod to measure serum bactericidal  activity in samples containing ctx with and without des-ctx. forty subject samples with 0.8-55.8 micrograms/ml of ctx and 1.1-11.6 micrograms/ml of des-ctx  and matched simulated serum samples with 0.8-57.2 micrograms/ml were tested against clinical strains of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and bacteroides fragilis. both sets of sera were reproducibly bactericidal with titers of less than 2-32 against s. aureus, 16-greater than or equal to 2048 against e. coli, and less than 2-64 against b. fragilis. serum bactericidal titers against b. fragilis were higher in 10 of 23 (43%) subject samples in which concentrations of the desacetyl metabolite exceeded 50% of those of ctx when compared with matched simulated samples containing ctx alone in equivalent concentrations. this effect was not observed with samples tested against s. aureus or e. coli. the ultimate clinical importance of any in vitro interaction between ctx and its desacetyl metabolite, however, can likely only be determined  by controlled clinical trials.

TI  == effect of uv irradiation on macromolecular synthesis and colony formation in bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == irradiation of bacteroides fragilis cells with far-uv light resulted in the immediate, rapid and extensive degradation of dna which continued for 40 to 60 min after irradiation. during the degradation phase, dna synthesis was decreased  but was never totally inhibited. dna degradation after irradiation was inhibited  by chloramphenicol and caffeine. dna synthesis in irradiated cells was reduced by chloramphenicol but resumed after 100 min at the same exponential rate as in irradiated cells without chloramphenicol. irradiated cells continued to synthesize dna for 40 min in the presence of caffeine but after this time dna synthesis was completely inhibited and never recovered. rna and protein synthesis were decreased by uv irradiation and the degree of inhibition was proportional to the uv dose. colony formation was not affected immediately by uv irradiation and  continued for a dose-dependent period before inhibition. there was an inverse relationship between uv dose and inhibition of colony formation which occurred sooner in cells irradiated with lower doses of uv light. the characteristics of dna synthesis in b. fragilis cells after uv irradiation differ from those in wild-type escherichia coli cells, where dna synthesis is stopped immediately by uv irradiation, but resemble those in e. coli reca mutant cells where extensive degradation occurs following uv irradiation.

AB  == acute cholecystitis is initially a chemical inflammation, but regularly complicated by bacterial invasion from the gut. escherichia coli, klebsiella and  streptococcus faecalis dominate among aerobic bacteria, whereas bacteroides fragilis and clostridia are commonly encountered anaerobes. mixed infections are  prevalent. bactibilia occurs in at least 60% of the early stage of acute cholecystitis and is particularly prevalent in the elderly. also, bactibilia is very common in recurrent cholecystitis. a close connection is found between the presence of bactibilia and infectious complications. although antimicrobial treatment does not sterilize the bile of an obstructed gall bladder, most authors favour such treatment in cases of febrile cholecystitis, particularly in the elderly, in order to prevent septic complications. various regimens of preoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis have significantly reduced the infectious  complications, in spite of persistent bactibilia. prophylactic courses should not exceed one or two days, one single preoperative dose is probably adequate. the choice of antimicrobial drugs for prophylaxis varies with local experience and patterns of bacterial resistance. a combination of broad spectred betalactam antibiotics and nitroimidazole would generally seem to provide an appropriate and atoxic coverage.

TI  == trends in the development of beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == in many ways it is ironic that the first description of a beta-lactamase occurred in 1940 with an enzyme isolated from escherichia coli since in recent years there has been a major interest in gram-negative species and the development of agents  to overcome the hydrolytic action of beta-lactamases of gram-negative species. there have been four distinctly different approaches to the development of new beta-lactam antibiotics. these have been the search for inhibitors of beta-lactamases and agents such as clavulanic acid and sulbactam are examples of  compounds which by virtue of kcat function act as suicide inhibitors and make old antibiotics new. there has been the modification of the penicillin and cephem nucleus to increase beta-lactamase stability or failing that to improve the ability of the compounds to pass through the cell wall and increase affinity for  critical beta-lactam receptors, i.e. penicillin-binding proteins. there has been  the development of carbapenem type of agents such as imipenem which would have broad activity including aerobic, anaerobic, gram-positive and gram-negative species. there has been the discovery of the monobactam agents of which aztreonam is an example of a compound with great beta-lactamase stability but with activity limited to gram-negative aerobic species. bacterial resistance has indeed been the major factor that has modified use of beta-lactams and influenced the development of the aforementioned types of drugs. the widespread presence of beta-lactamases in common pathogens such as haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis has made it necessary to have beta-lactamase stable compounds for initial therapy of infection. it is possible to analyze structure-activity relations of beta-lactam compounds to determine changes which  will be most advantageous in light of known and expected resistance patterns. but the increased realization in recent years of the importance of the pharmacokinetics of beta-lactam drugs has made it essential that the development  of new compounds be based on an integration of microbiological and pharmacokinetic parameters. interest in the prevention of resistant flora has also affected the development of new drugs since it is increasingly appreciated that alteration of intestinal flora contributes to selection of drug resistant microorganisms. finally, new toxicities or adverse effects associated with the use of certain new agents has modified the development of certain compounds.

TI  == pathogenic synergy: mixed intra-abdominal infections.
AB  == in this article we review our researches into the pathogenesis of mixed infections. these may conveniently be divided into in vitro and in vivo studies.  in vitro we confirmed that interference with the killing of aerobes by polymorphonuclear leucocytes (pmn's) is a property of the bacteroides strains tested and appears to depend on competition for opsonins i.e. complement factors. further studies are in progress to define which complement factors and which bacterial structures are involved. the influence of b. fragilis on chemotaxis has also been studied. our preliminary data suggest that b. fragilis is itself poorly chemotactic and reduces the chemoattractivity of proteus mirabilis. this observation is surprising when we consider that abscess formation is the hall-mark of b. fragilis infections and needs clarification. in vivo we have developed a skin infection model in mice which is economical and gives reproducible and quantitative results. in this model we have demonstrated pathogenic synergy between escherichia coli and b. fragilis. further studies are  planned to assess the role of complement and bacterial factors in this in vivo synergy.

TI  == hepatic and systemic metabolic responses to aerobic and anaerobic intra-abdominal abscesses in a highly reproducible chronic rat model.
AB  == a single, uniform abscess was formed in 100% of the animals inoculated with a fecal pellet made of sterile rat feces, agar, and a known number and strain of bacteria. the effects of monoclonal escherichia coli abscess (83 rats) were compared to those of sterile abscess (34 rats) and sham operation (35 rats without abscess). bacteroides fragilis was added to the sterile pellet to study the effect of an anaerobic monoclonal abscess (16 rats) or of a biclonal abscess  containing both aerobes and anaerobes (32 rats). after inoculation, a peritonitis stage with leucopenia, hypoglycemia, body weight loss, and slight fever was followed by the abscess stage with leucocytosis and a slight hyperglycemia. mild  hepatic energy charge deficiency and hepatic lactic acidosis were observed in sterile abscess rats, and slightly enhanced energy charge was seen in monoclonal  e. coli abscess rats. the addition of b. fragilis to the sterile pellet, alone or together with e. coli, produced hepatic energy charge deficiency and hepatic lactic acidosis, which were significantly enhanced compared with the monoclonal e. coli abscess rats. the greatest effect was seen in the biclonal e. coli plus b. fragilis abscess, suggesting that anaerobic or combined aerobe and anaerobe abscesses may produce a greater hepatic injury than an aerobic organism abscess alone. this may account for the apparent synergic interaction between aerobic and anaerobic organisms.

AB  == as a basis for the quantitation of the effect of anti-anaerobic drugs in vivo, an experimental thigh infection in mice was developed in which co-inoculation of bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli is obligatory for proliferation of bact. fragilis. the inhibitory effect of metronidazole and tinidazole on the proliferation of bact. fragilis was assessed in this model. both metronidazole and tinidazole showed a significant dose-effect relationship with respect to the  outgrowth of bact. fragilis but not that of e. coli. the effect of both drugs on  bact. fragilis was similar and at all dosage levels a significant correlation was found between the numbers of bact. fragilis and e. coli.

TI  == review of cefonicid, a long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro activity, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects, and clinical efficacy of cefonicid are reviewed. also discussed are formulary considerations and bacterial resistance. cefonicid, an investigational agent near approval, is less  active than other currently available first- and second-generation cephalosporins against gram-positive cocci, particularly staphylococcus. cefonicid and cefamandole have similar activity that is superior to the first-generation cephalosporins against escherichia coli, klebsiella, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., indole-negative proteus spp., and providencia spp. organisms such as serratia marcescens, acinetobacter, pseudomonas, and bacteroides fragilis are resistant to cefonicid. despite a small volume of distribution and high protein binding, cefonicid achieves high tissue concentrations. approximately 90% of an administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, and the elimination half-life is approximately four hours. cefonicid is usually well tolerated. in treating skin infections, cefonicid was usually less effective than cefazolin against staphylococcus aureus. in genitourinary infections, cefonicid 1 g daily (as the sodium salt) in a single dose has shown comparable efficacy to cefamandole or amoxicillin given in multiple daily doses. based on available data, single daily dosing of cefonicid in the therapy of staph. aureus endocarditis is not effective. in studies of patients undergoing hysterectomy, cesarean section, cholecystectomy, and colorectal surgery, cefonicid 1 g given as a single preoperative dose has produced results comparable with those of cefoxitin 1-2 g (as the sodium salt) given preoperatively and for several doses postoperatively. the major clinical uses of cefonicid will probably be as a possible cost-reducing alternative (based on a single daily dose) to currently available first- and second-generation cephalosporins for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and infections caused by enteric organisms. it may also be useful as a possible cost-reducing alternative to cefoxitin for prophylaxis in hysterectomy and biliary tract surgery.

TI  == use of new beta-lactam antibiotics in intraabdominal surgery.
AB  == infections after gastrointestinal surgery may involve both gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. although the broadspectrum cephalosporins are active against most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria,  many of these agents are ineffective against bacteroides fragilis, many clostridia and some strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococci. these bacteria are frequently found in intraabdominal infections. a  major reason for this inefficacy is susceptibility to beta-lactamases. the new beta-lactam antibiotics--cephamycins, third generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, acyl ureidopenicillins and monobactams--are all more or less beta-lactamase stable. the beta-lactamase inhibitors combined with a beta-lactam  antibiotic give a broad antibacterial spectrum. most of these compounds are non-toxic or relatively atoxic and, with the exception of the monobactams, they can be used as a monotherapy in many infections derived from the gastrointestinal tract. antibiotic prophylaxis in colorectal surgery offers a clinical model for the study of the benefit and risks of new beta-lactam antibiotics. most infections are derived from the gastrointestinal endogenous microflora. the study of the impact of different antibiotics on the colonic microflora indicates the risk of bacterial resistance, superinfection, antibiotic associated diarrhoea and pseudomembranous colitis. data obtained from such studies with the new beta-lactam antibiotics are compared to the results from controlled clinical trials with these antibiotics in this review article.

TI  == [chronological variations in blood isolates and their susceptibility to various antibiotics].
AB  == chronological variation in blood isolates obtained from 1968 to 1982 was studied. escherichia coli was the most frequent isolates followed by klebsiella species, glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative rods (excluding pseudomonas aeruginosa), enterobacter-serratia group, and staphylococcus aureus. the isolation of glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative rods, about half of which being achromobacter xylosoxidans, increased greatly in number from 1980. a total of 113 strains of blood isolates was examined for susceptibility to various antibiotics. although there was a significant increase in s. aureus resistant to gm, these strains were susceptible to cephalosporins. in the 9 strains of gm-resistant aerobic gram-negative rods (2 strains of klebsiella, 2 strains of enterobacter, 4 strains of serratia and 1 strain of p. aeruginosa), 3 strains of serratia species were also resistant to amk. two strains of lcm-resistant bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to lmox, but 1 strain was not inhibited by 100 micrograms/ml of  cfx. among the clinical specimens, differences were found in the rate of isolation of resistant strains, particularly in the case of serratia and p. aeruginosa. antibiotic resistant strains were isolated more frequently from urine and the least frequently from sputum. since the frequency of isolation of resistant strains varied according to organism, clinical material and year of isolation, microbiological laboratories should develop their own data base from which clinicians can make rational therapeutic decisions.

TI  == effect of bile acid oxazoline derivatives on microorganisms participating in 7 alpha-hydroxyl epimerization of primary bile acids.
AB  == we tested bile acid oxazoline derivatives of chenodeoxycholic (cdc-ox), 7-ketolithocholic (7-klc-ox), ursodeoxycholic (udc-ox), and deoxycholic (dc-ox) as inhibitors of the 7-epimerization of the primary bile acids cholic acid (ca) and cdc in cultures of four species of bacteria and the human fecal flora. the organisms tested elaborate a 7 alpha- and/or 7 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  (hsdh); they were escherichia coli (7 alpha-hsdh), bacteroides fragilis (7 alpha-hsdh), clostridium absonum (7 alpha- and 7 beta-hsdh) and eubacterium aerofaciens (7 beta-hsdh). none of the oxazolines affected 7 alpha-oh oxidation of ca or cdc by e. coli or the growth of the organism. all the oxazolines (except udc-ox) inhibited the growth of b. fragilis and its 7 alpha-hsdh. in contrast, only dc-ox blocked 7 alpha-oh epimerization of ca by c. absonum. surprisingly, the other three oxazolines enhanced 7 alpha-oh epimerization of ca, but not that  of cdc, which was inhibited (cdc-ox greater than 7-klc-ox much greater than udc-ox). enzymic data suggest that cdc-ox in the presence of ca can induce a greater level of both 7 alpha- and 7 beta-hsdh than ca or cdc-ox alone, cdc-ox being more toxic in the presence of cdc. formation of urso-bile acid from 7-keto  substrates by e. aerofaciens is totally blocked by the oxazolines (except udc-ox). similarly, suppression of urso-bile acid formation from primary bile acids by the human fecal flora was evident with dc-ox greater than 7-klc-ox greater than cdc-ox much greater than udc-ox, the last being ineffective. the inhibitory activity of the oxazolines on the 7-dehydroxylation of primary bile acids by human fecal flora followed the same order.

TI  == mechanism of action of metronidazole on bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == metronidazole (10 micrograms/ml) was rapidly bactericidal when added to log-phase cultures of bacteroides fragilis strain 2624. dna synthesis stopped immediately after addition of metronidazole, whereas synthesis of rna and protein continued at linear rates for at least 60 min. gel electrophoresis of dna extracted from metronidazole-treated cells revealed no nicking or strand breakage in either the  2.9- or 2.0-megadalton plasmid of strain 2624. also, no degradation of chromosomal dna was seen. dna polymerase activity, measured in vitro, was not diminished by prior treatment of the cells with metronidazole. thus, the primary  action of metronidazole is a rapid inhibition of dna replication. the dna remains structurally intact, dna polymerase activity is not directly affected, and cells  retain metabolic activity, synthesizing rna and protein at unaltered rates.

TI  == role of sulfhydryl compounds in the bactericidal effect of metronidazole.
AB  == the bactericidal effect of metronidazole on escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis can be partially reversed by cysteamine under conditions that lead to the formation of an adduct, the thioether, 4-(2-aminoethyl)thio-2-methylimidazole-1-ethanol (4-atme). this adduct, which is  not mutagenic for the ames histidine auxotrophs of salmonella typhimurium, forms  at a rate that is independent of live bacterial cells and, therefore, can not be  shown to relate to the biological effect of cysteamine. when treated with raney nickel, this adduct yields 2-methylimidazole-1-ethanol. to determine whether a structurally related adduct forms with bacterial protein, a culture of b. fragilis was incubated with radiolabelled metronidazole and then treated with 5%  trichloroacetic acid. that the radiolabel in the precipitate did not yield 2-methylimidazole-1-ethanol when treated with raney nickel suggests that binding  of metronidazole to cellular macromolecules does not involve thioether formation.

AB  == cefodizime, an iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin similar to moxalactam and ceftazidime, was less active (minimal inhibitory concentration, 1.6 to 12 micrograms) than cefazolin or cefotaxime against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. it inhibited haemophilus and neisseria spp. at less than 0.5 microgram/ml. it did not inhibit methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci, or listeria spp. and was 8- to 32-fold less active than cefotaxime,  moxalactam, or ceftazidime against escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, providencia spp., and serratia spp. cefotaxime-resistant enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and proteus vulgaris were resistant to cefodizime. cefodizime was less active than cefoxitin or moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis. cefodizime was not hydrolyzed by common plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases, and it inhibited type i beta-lactamases.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin in vitro.
AB  == fosfomycin is a new bactericidal broad-spectrum antibiotic. in this study the minimum inhibiting concentration (mic) was determined for 745 recent clinical isolates. staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, group a and b streptococci streptococcus faecalis and pneumoniae as well as escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens and haemophilus influenzae were very sensitive to  the new drug with essentially all strains inhibited at 64 mg/l or less. klebsiella, enterobacter, indole-positive proteus and pseudomonas-aeruginosa were less sensitive with 96, 42, 66 and 58% inhibited at 64 mg/l of fosfomycin. bacteroides fragilis was resistant.

TI  == pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and metronidazole susceptibility in bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was present and comparable (giving a colour change of 202-673 od units/min/g protein in our assay system) in two clinical strains of bacteroides fragilis exhibiting reduced sensitivity to metronidazole (mic 2-8 mg/l at 48 h) in a resistant strain (ingham's) of bact. fragilis (mic 64/mg/l) and in two sensitive strains of bact. fragilis (mic 0.5 mg/l). pyruvate  dehydrogenase activity was not detected in a capnocytophaga strain (sensitive to  50 micrograms disc of metronidazole), in escherichia coli or in 'bact. fragilis'  strain (britz) am24s (mic greater than 64 mg/l). further testing of am24s strain  indicated that it was not bact. fragilis but a facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rod. pyruvate dehydrogenase activity therefore, is similar in sensitive and resistant strains of bact. fragilis and is unlikely to be related to the mechanism of resistance to metronidazole.

TI  == sequence homology of clindamycin resistance determinants in clinical isolates of  bacteroides spp.
AB  == the sequence homology of clindamycin resistance (clnr) determinants was studied in 16 clnr bacteroides strains. the isolates were surveyed for plasmid content, homology with the clnr determinant of pbftm10, and ability to transfer clnr. the  clnr dna probes used in the southern hybridizations were pbftm10 and a plasmid derivative containing an ecori fragment of pbftm10 cloned into escherichia coli.  a total of 13 of 16 clnr strains also carried tetracycline resistance, and 15 of  16 clnr bacteroides isolates showed homology with the clnr determinant of pbftm10. these data suggest that the previously characterized clnr determinant of pbftm10 is widely distributed in nature and may be found on either a plasmid or the chromosome. the clnr bacteroides fragilis strain which lacked homology with pbftm10 also had different transfer properties; thus, more than one type of clnr  determinant may exist in bacteroides spp.

TI  == increase in immunoglobulin m antibodies against gut bacteria during acute hepatitis a.
AB  == the marked increase in the total serum immunoglobulin m (igm) is a characteristic feature of acute hepatitis a. to study the nature of this igm, we assayed serial  titers of igm antibodies against various antigens during and after acute hepatitis a. the antibodies against blood group antigen remained unchanged throughout the observation period. thus, the production or metabolism of igm was  not nonspecifically altered. the igm antibody against hepatitis a antigen decreased and finally disappeared during convalescence as expected. however, its  time course did not correlate quantitatively with the concentration of the total  serum igm. in contrast, igm antibodies against gut bacteria bacteroides fragilis  and streptococcus faecalis were considerably elevated in all patients at the onset of the disease, and they normalized similarly to the total igm during convalescence. igm antibodies against escherichia coli were elevated only in some of the patients. the data suggest that the amount of igm antibodies against gut bacteria contributes significantly to the increase in the total serum igm in acute hepatitis a.

TI  == intravenous injection of mice with bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli: role of thioglycollate medium in the infectious process.
AB  == mice were intravenously infected with e. coli, b. fragilis, and combinations of both, and the bacterial contents of livers, kidneys, and spleens were monitored from the first up to the 9th day postinfection. if thioglycollate medium was added to otherwise sublethal doses of e. coli, the inoculum was able to induce severe and for some animals lethal infections. b. fragilis was not capable to produce prolonged infections; however, when given together with e. coli and thioglycollate medium, both bacteria were recovered from some animal organs even  on day 9 postinfection. employing this experimental model of a mixed anaerobic/facultative bacterial infection, previous reports attributing animal lethality to e. coli were confirmed, but a synergism between e. coli and b. fragilis could not be demonstrated.

TI  == penicillin-binding proteins in bacteroides fragilis and their affinities for several new cephalosporins.
AB  == the penicillin-binding protein (pbp) composition in two strains of bacteroides fragilis has been investigated using 14c-cefotaxime. this microorganism is unique among the bacteria so far investigated, which show a number of pbps ranging from  5 to 8 in possessing only three pbps. it lacks the pbp with molecular weight (mw) lower than 50,000 daltons, which, at least in escherichia coli, has been demonstrated not to be essential for cell growth and division. the affinities of  several cephalosporins including cefoxitin, latamoxef (moxalactam), cefoperazone  and cefotaxime for the bact. fragilis pbps have been determined by in-vitro competition experiments. the results obtained suggest that further studies with competition experiments performed using intact, growing cells may be useful to ascertain the killing targets of beta-lactam antibiotics in bacteria.

TI  == experimental intraabdominal abscess formation by escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == an improved animal model of intraperitoneal abscess formation was developed in order to study the role of bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli. both microorganisms were found to independently cause abscesses, although bacteroides  fragilis-induced abscesses were invariably minute. the combined inoculation of these microorganisms resulted in the induction of intraabdominal abscesses larger than those formed by bacteroides fragilis or escherichia coli alone. however, the size difference between abscesses produced by escherichia coli alone and by the combination of both organisms was not statistically significant. the animal model defined in this study differed from earlier models in that use of the complex sterile cecal contents can be avoided. this allows for a more precise evaluation  of the contribution of each organism to the pathogenic process of intraabdominal  abscess formation.

AB  == an antibiotic drug of aminoglycoside group, gentamicin (gm) for parenteral use was used to 14 hospitalized patients; 5 with acute or subacute cholecystitis, 6 with acute peritonitis (4 cases were due to acute appendicitis, a case was torsion of right ovarian cyst and a case was cecal crohn's disease), 1 with fistula ani and abscess, and 2 with localized peritonitis after gastrectomy due to gastric ulcer. gm in a dose of 60 mg were administered by intravenous drip infusion for 1 to 2 hours, twice a day for 4 to 12 days. to the cases of biliary  tract infection, gm was treated for preoperative chemotherapy and to the other cases gm was treated for postoperative chemotherapy. clinical response was excellent in 7 cases, good in 6 cases, fair in 1 case and poor in none. no adverse effect was observed. the organisms were isolated in 7 cases, 7 were escherichia coli, 2 were klebsiella pneumoniae and 3 were bacteroides fragilis. the mics for gm were 0.78--1.56 micrograms/ml in 10(8) and 10(6) cells/ml, except b. fragilis. before the operation of above cases, gm in a dose of 60 mg (a case was 40 mg) were administered by intravenous drip infusion for 1 to 2 hours in 7 cases (3 biliary tract infection, 2 acute peritonitis and 2 gastric ulcer) and 7  cases by intramuscularly. the materials of common duct bile, gall bladder bile, gall bladder wall, the appendix and other tissues, ascites and serum samples were taken during the operation. gm concentration was measured by bioassay method with bacillus subtilis atcc 6633 as test organism. gm concentrations in bile and gall  bladder wall after intravenous drip infusion were higher than those after intramuscular administration. in the appendicitis with localized peritonitis, gm  concentration in the appendix wall with catarrhal appendicitis was 0.90 microgram/g after intramuscular administration. in the cases with diffuse peritonitis and catarrhal appendicitis, gm concentrations in appendixes were 1.18 micrograms/g and 1.37 micrograms/g after intravenous drip infusion. therefore, it was supposed that gm could be used safety and usefully by intravenous drip infusion than that by intramuscular administration.

TI  == elimination patterns of escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis from the peritoneal cavity. studies with experimental peritonitis in pigs.
AB  == an animal model for study of bacterial elimination from the peritoneal cavity is  presented. using escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis as infecting agents, two elimination patterns emerged. the patterns were related to the surface properties of the micro-organisms. the concentration of both species was greatly  reduced within 2 to 4 hours after peritoneal contamination with 10(10) cfu. the elimination of b. fragilis was contemporaneous with mobilization of granulocytes  into the peritoneal cavity, and was probably attributable to bactericidal action  of the granulocytes. most of the e. coli inoculum, however, was cleared before the granulocyte mobilization. cell-free peritoneal fluid was found to have a bactericidal effect against a rough strain of e. coli, but not against a smooth strain, as demonstrated in vitro. this effect was inhibited by pretreatment of the peritoneal fluid with edta, egta or heat, which suggested that the alternate  pathway of the complement system was involved. in vivo the rough strain of e. coli was rapidly eliminated, while elimination of the smooth strain followed the  b. fragilis pattern. it is concluded that bacterial surface properties are important in bacterial peritonitis.

TI  == effect of metronidazole on escherichia coli in the presence of bacteroides fragilis: an investigation in mice.
AB  == the observation that, in rats, metronidazole exhibited antimicrobial activity against resistant escherichia coli (when this was accompanied by susceptible bacteroides fragilis) prompted us to attempt to reproduce this phenomenon in another species and under other experimental conditions. in experiment 1, mice injected intraperitoneally with an e. coli/b. fragilis mixture were treated with  metronidazole, 250 mg/kg given by mouth at 0 and 10 h, or left untreated. at 24 h, viable counts of bacteria in blood and peritoneal washings were determined. in experiment 2, mice with 5-day-old subcutaneous abscesses containing e. coli and b. fragilis were also either given metronidazole as above or left untreated. at 24 h, viable counts of bacteria in pus were determined. metronidazole affected neither the frequency with which e. coli persisted at the three sites, nor the viability of e. coli at these sites. this was so despite the fact that, in each of the sites, a significant b. fragilis kill was registered. thus, pending elucidation of the mechanism by which the phenomenon operates, its non-appearance in these experiments cautions against the extrapolation of the original observations beyond the circumstances under which they were first made.

TI  == in vitro stimulation of bacteroides fragilis growth by escherichia coli.
AB  == the interaction between bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli was investigated by following their growth kinetics in an in vitro mixed culture system. in bacto-peptone or in a semisynthetic medium (ssm-m) bacteroides fragilis could initiate growth only when a small number of viable escherichia coli initially coexisted for a short period of time. both bacto-peptone and ssm-m previously spent by escherichia coli also allowed bacteroides fragilis growth to  occur but the supplementation of heat killed escherichia coli cells or viable cell homogenates to fresh media failed to stimulate bacteroides fragilis growth.  the in vitro stimulation of bacteroides fragilis growth by escherichia coli observed in this study may be best explained by the combination of (a) removal of oxygen and other toxic substances and (b) de novo production of bacteroides fragilis growth stimulating factor(s) by coexistent escherichia coli.

AB  == a gram-positive, anaerobic, chain-forming, rod-shaped anaerobe (isolate g20-7) was isolated from normal human feces. this organism was identified by cellular morphology as well as fermentative and biochemical data as eubacterium aerofaciens. when isolate g20-7 was grown in the presence of bacteroides fragilis or escherichia coli (or another 7 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase producer) and chenodeoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid produced. time course curves revealed that 3 alpha-hydroxy-7-keto-5 beta-cholanoic acid produced by b. fragilis or e. coli or introduced into the medium as a pure substance was reduced by g20-7 specifically to ursodeoxycholic acid. the addition of glycine- and taurine-conjugated primary bile acids (chenodeoxycholic and cholic acids) and other bile acids to binary cultures of b. fragilis and g20-7 revealed that (i) both conjugates were hydrolyzed to give free bile acids, (ii) ursocholic acid (3  alpha, 7 beta, 12 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholanoic acid) was produced when conjugated (or free) cholic acid was the substrate, and (iii) the epimerization reaction was at least partially reversible. corroborating these observations, an  nadp-dependent 7 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (reacting specifically with 7  beta-oh-groups) was demonstrated in cell-free preparations of isolate g20-7; production of the enzyme was optimal at between 12 and 18 h of growth. this enzyme, when measured in the oxidative direction, was active with ursodeoxycholic acid, ursocholic acid, and the taurine conjugate of ursodeoxycholic acid (but not with chenodeoxycholic, deoxycholic, or cholic acids) and displayed an optimal ph  range of 9.8 to 10.2

AB  == the role of mycobacteria in the cavitation of large pneumoconiotic masses is well established. in other cases softness is attributed to an ischaemic or aseptic necrosis. five cases are described in which cavitation of the pulmonary masses was caused by anaerobic bacteria, confirmed by the growth of such bacterial in cultures after transtracheal or transpleural puncture. repeated cultures for mycobacteria gave negative results. two cases were acute, having serious complications such as bronchopleural fistula, empyema, and serious respiratory insufficiency. the role of anaerobes in cavitary pneumoconiosis has not been recognised previously, probably because of the special conditions required to culture these bacteria and the infrequent use of transtracheal puncture in the diagnosis of this entity. the prevalence of anaerobes as agents capable of cavitating pneumoconiotic masses remains to be established.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activity of dl-8280, a new oxazine derivative.
AB  == dl-8280, 9-fluoro-3-methyl-10-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-7-oxo-2,3-dihydro-7h- pyrido-(1,2,3-de)1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid, is a new nalidixic acid analog with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-negative and  gram-positive bacteria, including obligate anaerobes. the activity of dl-8280 against enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and clostridium perfringens was roughly comparable to that of norfloxacin and far exceeded that of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid. dl-8280 had greater activity against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., pseudomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter spp., and bacteroides fragilis than did norfloxacin, pipemidic acid, and nalidixic acid. nalidixic acid-resistant enterobacteriaceae, ampicillin-resistant gonococci, and clindamycin-resistant obligate anaerobes were also susceptible to dl-8280. the activity of dl-8280 was  affected very little by inoculum size, and its action was bactericidal at two times the minimal inhibitory concentrations at most. administered orally to mice  experimentally infected with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, or p. aeruginosa, dl-8280 was 2 to 7 times more effective than norfloxacin and 7 to more than 50 times more active than pipemidic acid.

TI  == reciprocal antimicrobial synergism between escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis in the presence of metronidazole.
AB  == we have studied the antimicrobial action of metronidazole against bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli both in pure cultures and in combination. concentrations of metronidazole above the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic)  produced a marked bactericidal effect on b fragilis at six hours. e coli however  showed only a slight and transitory decrease in population when exposed to concentrations of metronidazole close to its mic. kinetic studies of this drug's  effect on mixed cultures of both organisms showed mutual bactericidal synergy between e coli and metronidazole against b fragilis and between b fragilis and metronidazole against e coli. these in vitro findings agree with the results obtained in vivo by other authors.

TI  == [timed bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities of cefmetazole against selected gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == antibacterial activities of cefmetazole, a new preparation of cephamycin antibiotic, were determined against selected clinical strains of escherichia coli (27 strains), klebsiella sp. (27 strains) and bacteroides fragilis (27 strains).  activities were evaluated at bacteriostatic and also bactericidal levels with particular reference to time of exposure of microbes to the drug. the minimal drug concentrations producing minimal reduction of colony-forming units at time intervals of 3, 6 and 24 hours after exposure to the drug--approximations to the  theoretical bacteriostatic concentrations--were designated as 3-h, 6-h and 24-h mrcs, respectively. conventional mic yielding no turbidity after incubation of antibiotic-containing broth for 24 hours was also determined. the minimal concentrations of the drug producing 99.9% killing at time intervals of 3, 6 and  24 hours after exposure to the drug were designated as 3-h, 6-h and 24-h mlcs, respectively. assuming that the apparent mode of action of a drug is bactericidal when the ratio of bactericidal-bacteriostatic concentrations is low (less than or equal to 4) and bacteriostatic when high (greater than or equal to 8), then cefmetazole appeared to be a bactericidal drug to a considerable number of gram-negative strains when the exposure time exceeded a period of 6 hours. the data that the mode of action of this drug is bactericidal with such relatively brief exposure times--indicating rapid decrease of colony-forming units--would suggest cefmetazole is an excellent antibacterial agent and would be a useful drug in treatment of bacterial infections.

TI  == a reassessment of the microbial flora of the female genital tract, with special reference to the occurrence of bacteroides species.
AB  == two hundred and twelve randomly selected vaginal or uterine cervical specimens were investigated for the presence of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria and yeasts.  anaerobes of possible clinical significance, including bacteroidaceae, peptococcaceae and clostridia were isolated from 34% of the specimens and were identified to specific or generic level. among the bacteroidaceae isolated, b. bivius was the most common, followed by other propionate-negative species. members of the bacteroides fragilis group were seldom isolated. of the aerobic or facultatively anaerobic isolates, enterococci and escherichia coli were most often found. the results show that clinically significant anaerobes, especially bacteroides species, are not regular members of the vaginal flora and that the species distribution of anaerobes occurring in the genital tract is significantly different from that of the intestinal tract.

TI  == the history and background of augmentin.
AB  == bacterial resistance to the beta-lactam group of antibiotics is frequently due to the production of beta-lactamase which brings about the inactivation of the antibiotic. clavulanic acid is a naturally occurring inhibitor of beta-lactamase  which is capable of rendering penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant organisms sensitive. the compound is obtained by fermentation from streptomyces clavuligerus. clavulanic acid shows some structural similarity to the penicillins and cephalosporins and functions as a progressive inhibitor of a wide range of beta-lactamases including those found in escherichia coli, klebsiella aerogenes,  proteus species, bacteroides fragilis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae and staphylococcus aureus. clavulanic acid is well absorbed when given by mouth and a formulation with amoxycillin (augmentin; beechams) is now available for clinical use.

AB  == apalcillin, a naphthydridine derivative of ampicillin, was compared with ticarcillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone  against gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial isolates and with cefsulodin and tobramycin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the minimal concentrations of apalcillin at which 50 and 90% of hospital isolates of escherichia coli were inhibited were similar to those of mezlocillin and piperacillin (1.6 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively). apalcillin had minimal inhibitory concentrations similar to those of piperacillin against citrobacter freundii and citrobacter diversus. against klebsiella, apalcillin inhibited 50% of organisms at a concentration of 6.3 micrograms/ml, similar to piperacillin. the activity of apalcillin against enterobacter (e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, and e. agglomerans) was similar to that of mezlocillin and piperacillin and greater than that of ticarcillin. the activity of apalcillin against proteus mirabilis was similar to  that of the other agents, as was its activity against indole-positive proteus and providencia. only 40% of serratia were inhibited at an apalcillin concentration of 25 micrograms/ml. apalcillin was as active as piperacillin but twofold less active than cefoxitin or moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis. it was as active as piperacillin, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against p. aeruginosa (apalcillin inhibited 90% of organisms at a concentration of 25 mg/ml). there was an inoculum effect and a difference in the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration with beta-lactamase strains. apalcillin was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamase but not as well by cephalosporinases.

AB  == the lipopolysaccharides (lps) from bacteroides fragilis are structurally atypical and give weak responses in most tests of endotoxic activity, but the mitogenic activity of lps from b. fragilis has not been tested. we prepared lps from b. fragilis 23745 by three methods and compared their mitogenic activity for murine  spleen cells with that of lps from escherichia coli k235 prepared by similar techniques. lps extracted from b. fragilis with hot phenol-water, with butanol-water, or by detergent separation from the outer membrane were mitogenic  for spleen cells from c57bl/10scn, c57bl/10sccr, and c3h/hej mice. the outer membrane, the outer membrane protein-polysaccharide complex, and the capsular polysaccharide from b. fragilis were also mitogenic for spleen cells from the same murine strains. lps extracted from e. coli k235 with hot phenol-water, butanol-water, or sodium deoxycholate were mitogenic for c57bl/10scn spleen cells, but only the lps extracted with butanol and deoxycholate were stimulatory  for spleen cells from c57bl/10sccr and c3h/hej mice. two types of lps varying in  the 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate-to-carbohydrate ratio were isolated from e. coli k235  with sodium deoxycholate; both endotoxins contained protein which was typical of  lipid a or endotoxin protein. these results indicate that the lps from b. fragilis is a potent mitogen for spleen cells from endotoxin responder and endotoxin nonresponder mice.

AB  == an antibiotic drug of aminoglycoside group, amikacin (amk) for parenteral use was used to 8 hospitalized patients: 4 with acute or subacute cholecystitis and cholangitis, 4 with acute peritonitis (3 cases were due to acute appendicitis and a case was torsion of right ovarian cyst). amk in a dose of 200 mg were administered by intravenous drip infusion for 1 to 2 hours, twice a day for 4 to  9 days. to the cases with biliary tract infection, amk was treated to preoperatively and to the cases with acute peritonitis, amk was treated to the postoperatively. clinical response was excellent in 2 cases, good in 6 cases, fair and poor in none. no adverse effect was observed. the organisms were isolated in 4 cases, 4 were escherichia coli, 1 was klebsiella pneumoniae and 1 was bacteroides fragilis. the mic for amk were 3.13-1.56 micrograms/ml in 10(8) and 10(6) cells/ml, except bacteroides fragilis. before the operation of above cases, amk in a dose of 200 mg were administered by intravenous drip infusion in  2 cases (acute and subacute cholecystitis and cholangitis with cholelithiasis), 5 cases by intramuscularly and 1 case by intravenously (acute appendicitis with localized peritonitis). the materials of a-bile, b-bile, wall of gallbladder, the appendix, ascites and serum samples were taken during the operation. amk concentration was measured by bioassay method with bacillus subtilis atcc 6633 as test organism. amk concentration in b-bile were higher than those in the a-bile.  amk concentrations in wall of gallbladder were much higher than those in a and b-bile. the concentrations after intravenous drip infusion were higher than those after intramuscularly administration. amk changes of inflammation. in a case of gastric ulcer, amk 200 mg by intravenous drip infusion was administrated, the amk concentrations of the tissues at 25 minutes after end of infusion, they were 15.00 micrograms/g in gastric ulcer, 7.20 micrograms/g in normal gastric wall, 9.14 micrograms/g in duodenal wall and 8.12 micrograms/g in the omentum, respectively. serum concentration of amk on this case at 58 minutes was 15.7 micrograms/ml. therefore, it was supposed that amk could be used safety and effective by intravenous drip infusion.

TI  == effects of pure or combined inocula of escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis  on the liver and related metabolism.
AB  == to test for synergy between a facultative and anaerobic bacterium and the role hepatic hypoxia may have in its development, rats were subjected to intravascular infusion of 10(8) escherichia coli, 10(9) bacteroides fragilis, or a combination  of both. acute effects were evaluated by selected 6-hour measurements, including  hepatic po2, and longer range effects by liver cultures and histology in rats surviving 7 days. during the acute period, systemic arterial pressure and po2 in  bacteremic groups did not differ from saline-infused controls. however, hepatic oxygen supply was significantly reduced in e. coli rats and those given the combined bacteria (mean hepatic po2 less than 10 mm. hg versus 20.8 mm. hg in controls). significant increases of plasma lactate and pulse rate were also recorded. by comparison, hepatic po2 was not reduced significantly in the b. fragilis rats, and pulse rate was similar to controls. plasma lactate, however, increases more rapidly than in other groups. survival rates were 100 per cent in  the b. fragilis group, 88 per cent in the e. coli group, and 65 per cent in the combined group. the difference between the latter groups was not significant. hepatic histology was normal in rats of the b. fragilis group at 7 days postchallenge. in survivors of the e. coli and combined inoculum groups, there was evidence of anoxic damage and occasional foci of neutrophilic infiltration. liver cultures were more often positive in rats of the combined inoculum group (p less than 0.05), most often for e. coli, than in the other groups. in summary, although the acute effects of e. coli were not changed appreciably by combination with b. fragilis, the higher rate of e. coli liver infection in survivors suggests that its viability was enhanced. the role of hepatic hypoxia in this remains unclear. it is feasible that hypoxic foci provided temporary protection for b. fragilis, enabling the organisms to affect favorably the survival of e. coli.

TI  == interaction of metronidazole with resistant and susceptible bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == the kinetics of the lethal action of metronidazole and the formation of acetamide have been studied in a strain of bacteroides fragilis which is relatively resistant to metronidazole. as with a susceptible strain of b. fragilis, the data are consistent with a model in which a labile intermediate in metronidazole metabolism interacts either with water to form acetamide or with a bacterium to cause its death. although the relatively resistant strain grows more slowly than  the susceptible one and is killed less rapidly by metronidazole, the resistant strain displays the same relationship between the lethal action of metronidazole  and metronidazole metabolism to acetamide. the relatively resistant strain, like  the susceptible one, has an enhanced lethal response to metronidazole in the presence of a strain of escherichia coli. the results suggest that the proposed labile reactive intermediate of metronidazole forms more slowly in the resistant  strains.

AB  == the effect of primary aliphatic alcohols of varying chain length and degree of unsaturation on bacterial growth was assessed, using strep. mutans bht as the main test organism. unsaturated alcohols, linoleyl and linolenyl, effectively inhibited bacterial growth. of the saturated alcohols, only lauryl and myristyl alcohols inhibited the growth of strep. mutans bht, but at concentrations much higher than those required for the unsaturated alcohols. all gram-positive organisms tested were sensitive to linolenyl alcohol. gram-negative bacteria did  not exhibit the sensitivity. linoleic and linolenic acid were inactive as antibacterial agents at the same concentration as the related alcohol. repeated exposure of strep. mutans bht to linolenyl alcohol produced no change in the sensitivity of the organism to the alcohol. significant amounts of linolenyl alcohol were found in bacteria grown in the presence of this lipid for 24 h but linolenic acid was not detected. thus the primary polyunsaturated aliphatic alcohols, particularly linolenyl alcohol, could be effective antibacterial agents for the prevention of dental caries and periodontal disease.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of cutaneous abscesses in children.
AB  == specimens from 209 cutaneous abscesses in children were cultured for aerobic and  anaerobic microorganisms. of these, nine (4%) were sterile and 51 (24%) yielded pure cultures that were predominantly staphylococcus aureus. the rest of the abscesses yielded growth of two or more aerobic and/or anaerobic organisms. the data were organized according to these anatomic locations: head, neck, trunk, finger, nailbed, hand, leg, buttocks, perirectal, and vulvovaginal areas. aerobic bacteria only were present in 92 specimens (46%), anaerobes only were isolated in 52 (26%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were present in 56 abscesses (28%). a total of 467 isolates (270 anaerobes and 197 aerobes) were recovered, accounting for 2.3 isolates per specimen (1.3 anaerobes and 1.0 aerobes). the presence of more than one anaerobe per abscess was obtained from the vulvo-vaginal, buttocks, perirectal, finger, nailbed, and head areas. aerobes were more prevalent in the neck, hand, leg, and trunk areas. the predominant aerobes recovered were: s aureus (89 isolates), alpha- and nonhemolytic streptococci (29), group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (16), enterobacter (10), and escherichia coli (8). the predominant anaerobes recovered were anaerobic gram-positive cocci (79 isolates), bacteroides sp (116, including 31 b melaninogenicus group and 29 b fragilis group), and fusobacterium sp (39). our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature and predominance of anaerobes in cutaneous abscesses in children in perirectal, head, finger, and nailbed areas.

TI  == therapeutic efficacy of 29 antimicrobial regimens in experimental intraabdominal  sepsis.
AB  == an animal model of colonic perforation was used to examine the efficacy of 29 antimicrobial regimens in the treatment of intraabdominal sepsis. efficacy was judged on mortality during the first 12 days after challenge and on the incidence of intraabdominal abscess noted at necropsy upon completion of the experiment. in general, antimicrobial agents that are active against coliform bacteria prevented early mortality, whereas drugs that are active against bacteroides fragilis were  most effective in reducing the incidence of late abscess formation. exceptions were metronidazole, which produced a significant reduction in early mortality, and chloramphenicol, which caused only a modest reduction in the incidence of abscess. optimal results were obtained with several regimens that showed good in  vitro activity against both coliforms and b. fragilis.

TI  == premature labor. ii. bacterial sources of phospholipase.
AB  == human term labor is thought to be initiated by amniotic and chorionic phospholipase a2, an enzyme that liberates arachidonic acid esters from the phospholipids of these membranes, leading to the synthesis of prostaglandins by the placental membranes. the striking association of premature labor with intrauterine infection or contamination, urinary tract infection, and early neonatal sepsis led us to study the microorganisms present in these infections for phospholipase a2 activity. activity was found in bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus, fusobacterium necrophorum, streptococcus viridans, streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus a and b, escherichia coli, klebsiella, staphylococcus epidermidis, pneumococcus, lactobacillus, and mycoplasma hominis.  bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus, fusobacterium, and s viridans had the highest activities. the specific activities of phospholipase a2 from these organisms were several times higher than that of the membrane phospholipase a2 of the amnion and chorion. we postulate that premature labor may be initiated by microorganisms with phospholipase a2 activity from endocervical and/or intrauterine contamination or infection, producing deacylation of arachidonic acid from amniotic phospholipids with increased concentrations of free arachidonic acid and increased prostaglandin synthesis, which triggers labor.

TI  == stability in escherichia coli of an antibiotic resistance plasmid from bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == a bacteroides fragilis strain resistant to penicillin g, tetracycline, and clindamycin was screened for the presence of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (dna). agarose gel electrophoresis of ethanol-precipitated dna from cleared lysates of this strain revealed two plasmid dna bands. the molecular weights of the plasmids were estimated by their relative mobility in agarose gel and compared with standard plasmids with known molecular weights. the molecular weights were 3.40 +/- 0.20 x 10(6) and 1.95 +/- 0.05 x 10(6) for plasmids pby1 and pby2, respectively. plasmid dna purified by cesium chloride-ethidium bromide gradient centrifugation was used to transform a restriction- and modification-negative strain of escherichia coli. penicillin g- and tetracycline-resistant transformants were screened for the presence of plasmid dna. a plasmid band corresponding to a molecular weight of 1.95 x 10(6) was present in all transformants tested. curing experiments demonstrated that the plasmid, referred  to as pby22 when present in transformants, was responsible for penicillin g and tetracycline resistance. plasmid pby22 was mobilized and transferred to other e.  coli strains by plasmid r1drd-19. stability of pby22 was examined in different e. coli strains and was shown to be stably maintained in both restriction-negative and restriction-positive strains. unexpectedly, pby2 and pby22 were resistant to  digestion by 12 different restriction endonucleases.

TI  == bacteria and gallstones. etiological significance.
AB  == two hundred consecutive gallstone cases have been subjected to bacteriological study employing improved anaerobic culture techniques. in addition to clostridia  species, species of anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis, peptococcus, veillonella, and eubacterium are found to be present, some of which possessed beta-glucuronidase activity. this finding has a certain bearing on the etiology of bile pigment calcium stones. in addition to escherichia coli, bacteroides and  clostridium often found in the biliary tract may contribute to the formation of bile pigment calcium stones by producing beta-glucuronidase and thus deconjugating bilirubin diglucuronide to form free unconjugated bilirubin which in turn combines with calcium, leading to stone formation. in contrast, very low  bacterial incidence was associated with cholesterol stones and so-called black stones--sometimes called pure pigment stones--and thus bacteria play little role, if any, in their formation. therefore, bile pigment calcium stones and so-called  black stones, which are often classified as pigment stones indiscriminately, should be differentiated not only because of their difference in their appearance and composition but also in their etiological background. regardless of the kind  of stones present in the common duct, the incidence of bacteria was found to be increased.

TI  == preventing anaerobic infection in surgery of the colon.
AB  == a randomized prospective study of antibiotic prophylaxis was carried out in patients who underwent elective surgery of the colon. the wound infection rate in 70 patients who received cephradine intravenously in the perioperative period (group 1) was 25%, compared with 8% in 60 patients who received metronidazole and erythromycin base orally before operation (group 2). both bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli were cultured from the majority of wound infections in group 1, but b. fragilis was not found in any group 2 patients. wound contamination indicated by wound class or by culture of the subcutaneous tissue of the wound before closure was the best predictor of subsequent wound infections. these results suggest a dominant role for intestinal anaerobes in the genesis of wound  infections after colonic surgery and show that antibiotics specifically directed  against these organisms can substantially reduce the rate of wound infection.

TI  == antibiotic prophylaxis with cefoxitin in colorectal surgery: effect on the colon  microflora and septic complications--a clinical model for prediction of the benefit and risks in using a new antibiotic in prophylaxis.
AB  == cefoxitin was administered parenterally in doses of 2 g, every six hours for two  days, to 20 patients undergoing colorectal surgery. blood and fecal specimens were obtained for five days for analysis of cefoxitin concentrations. tissue samples from the gut wall were obtained at surgery. the maximum serum concentrations during surgery varied between 25 and 100 microgram/ml, and the cefoxitin concentrations for the fecal samples were 1.5-35 microgram/g and for the tissue samples, 2.0-50 microgram/g. fecal samples for cultivation of aerobic  and anaerobic bacteria were also obtained daily during the first five days, and after 14 day after operation. pronounced changes in the microflora occurred during the investigation period. among the aerobic bacteria, cefoxitin-sensitive  escherichia coli and other enterobacteria decreased markedly while cefoxitin-resistant enterococci, pseudomonas and enterobacter proliferated during the antibiotic prophylaxis period. among the anaerobic bacteria, bacteroides fragilis and other gram-negative bacteria decreased significantly. however, after the antibiotic administration period, all cefoxitin-resistant strains decreased while the suppressed e. coli and b. fragilis strains increased. in one patient, a minor postoperative infection caused by a cefoxitin-resistant strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed.

AB  == cefazolin and gentamicin were administered to mice with polymicrobial infection by escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. changes in the quantities of these bacteria in blood were investigated. bacterial replacement was evident. cefazolin was administered to mice with polymicrobial infection by e. coli and bacteroides fragilis. cefazolin was inactivated by b. fragilis-produced beta-lactamases. it was confirmed that the quantities of both b. fragilis and e.  coli in blood increased. even broad-spectrum antibiotics have different antibacterial activity against various bacteria. the present study suggested that an appropriate administration schedule should be determined to first inhibit the  growth of a highly resistant bacterium in polymicrobial infection. it was also suggested that an antibiotic that can inhibit the growth of a more resistant bacterium should first be administered in polymicrobial infection. in vivo antibacterial activity of broad-spectrum antibiotics should be separately evaluated in mono-microbial infection and polymicrobial infection.

AB  == the antimicrobial capacity of amniotic fluid (af) against b. fragilis, group b streptococci and escherichia coli, the latter as a reference indicator, was investigated in samples from 30 patients. in order to study trimester as well as  individual variations in the antibacterial activity, 10 individual samples from each trimester of pregnancy (af1, af2, af3), were separately tested. with b. fragilis all trimester samples showed initial inhibition lasting for 8 h, the bacteria then regaining growth capacity in all af1, and the majority of af2 and af3 specimens. however, 4 af2 and 3 af3 samples showed continued bacteriostatic activity for up to 24 h. group b streptococci exhibited uninhibited growth in all trimester samples. the growth of e. coli in af1 and af2 was not inhibited, whereas in af3 a temporary arrest was observed at 8 h, this being followed by growth to control levels at 24 h. the findings may explain the frequent isolation of b. fragilis from cases of septic abortions during the first trimester. individual variation in the effectiveness of the antibacterial activity against b. fragilis in af2 and af3 may explain why this microorganism, which is often implicated in severe maternal and neonatal infections, is occasionally recovered  from the mother's endocervix without signs of disease. the inefficacy of af in defence against group b streptococci correlates well with the frequent isolation  of these bacteria from cases of severe congenital infections associated with premature delivery.

TI  == relationship between metronidazole metabolism and bactericidal activity.
AB  == it has been suggested that the microbicidal effect of metronidazole is mediated by an intermediate in nitro group reduction. we have found that the addition of escherichia coli enhances the lethal effect of metronidazole on bacillus fragilis and suggest that this intermediate may form in one bacteria and kill another. because acetamide forms during the reduction of metronidazole, we examined the possibility that the same partially reduced intermediate in metronidazole reduction may be both an intermediate in the formation of acetamide and the ultimate reactive form of metronidazole which is responsible for its bactericidal action. thus, we determined the relationship between bacterial survival and the formation of acetamide when cultures of b. fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and e. coli were incubated anaerobically in the presence of metronidazole. we found that the log of the early bacterial survival was proportional to the formation of acetamide. the rate of loss of metronidazole was not dependent on the concentration of bacteria in the medium, suggesting that any proposed intermediate formed at a rate which was proportional only to the concentration of metronidazole.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of pilonidal cyst abscess in children.
AB  == aspirates of pus from pilonidal abscesses in 25 children were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. a total of 76 isolates (63 anaerobic and 13 aerobic) were recovered from the patients, accounting for 2.52 anaerobes and 0.52 aerobes per specimen. anaerobic organisms were recovered from all the specimens, and in eight cases (32%) they were mixed with aerobic organisms. the predominant anaerobic organisms were bacteroides sp (36 isolates, including ten b fragilis group and ten b melaninogenicus group), gram-positive anaerobic cocci (16). fusobacterium sp (five), and clostridium sp (four). the predominant aerobic organisms were escherichia coli (four) and group d streptococci, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and proteus sp (two of each). we believe this study is the first to demonstrate the mixed anaerobic and aerobic bacteriology of pilonidal cyst abscesses in children.

TI  == comparative studies on the antimicrobial activity of peritoneal and ascitic fluids in human beings.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of peritoneal fluid obtained from 28 women undergoing  laparoscopy was compared with that of ascitic fluid obtained from 11 patients with various pathologic conditions. similar antibacterial activity was found in these two types of fluid. the activity varied from bactericidal to bacteriostatic and was directed mainly against gram-negative bacilli-escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and bacteroides fragilis. candida albicans was inhibited by many of the fluids, but the activity against gram-positive cocci was much less marked. lysozyme was present in the fluids but was not solely responsible for the antimicrobial activity. the results of this study suggest the presence of at least three groups of thermostable antibacterial substances, two of which are bactericidal and one, bacteriostatic. one of the bactericidal factors is complement-dependent.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic urethral flora of healthy females in various physiological  age groups and of females with urinary tract infections.
AB  == we characterized the aerobic and anaerobic urethral flora of healthy females in three physiological age groups (premenarcheal, reproductive, and postmenopausal)  and of females with urinary tract infections. the mean number of species per sample was 6.5, 7.7, and 10.3 for each of the physiological age groups, respectively, and 6.5 for the urinary tract infection group. marked quantitative  changes were seen with age and disease. aerobes accounted for 65.6 and 73.8% of the flora of the premenarcheal and reproductive age groups, respectively, whereas anaerobes were dominant in the postmenopausal age group, accounting for 65.5% of  the flora. aerobic gram-negative rods were not isolated from any of the premenarcheal or reproductive-age subjects. of the 10 postmenopausal subjects, 5  carried aerobic gram-negative rods, but these organisms accounted for only 1% of  the flora. in contrast, they constituted 95% of the urethral flora of the urinary tract infection group. bacteroides melaninogeneicus was commonly isolated and was the dominant isolate in the postmenopausal age group. bacteroides fragilis was recovered from 7 of the 10 postmenopausal subjects, but these organisms constituted only 3% of the total flora. the factors responsible for the changes in urethral flora with age remain to be determined.

TI  == bacteriology of aspiration pneumonia in children.
AB  == aspiration pneumonia in adults has been shown to involve anaerobes about 90% of the time. studies of the bacteriology of aspiration pneumonia in children done in the past have either failed to exclude the oral and upper respiratory tract flora or have not utilized proper anaerobic culture techniques or both. in the present  study. 74 institutionalized children with aspiration pneumonia were studied by percutaneous transtracheal aspiration. their average age was 8 years. fifty-two patients had pneumonitis, 12, necrotizing pneumonia, and 10, lung abscess. only one patient (with lung abscess) had a complicating empyema. there was an average  of five bacteria isolated per specimen--2.8 anaerobes and 2.2 nonanaerobes. the predominant anaerobic isolates were gram-positive cocci, bacteroides melaninogenicus, and fuso-bacteria; there were ten patients who yielded members of the bacteroides fragilis group. the predominant nonanaerobes were alpha-hemolytic streptococci, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. thus, aspiration pneumonia in children, as in adults, commonly involves anaerobic bacteria. when aspiration occurs in a medical institution, nosocomial pathogens which are aerobic or facultative will also often be involved, in both children and adults.

TI  == combined antibacterial activity of amoxicillin with clavulanic acid against ampicillin-resistant strains.
AB  == strains of bacteria resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics have been increasing in  number and are becoming troublesome in clinical medicine. the in vitro antibacterial activity of amoxicillin combined with clavulanic acid was determined on selected ampicillin-resistant clinical isolates. synergistic effects were produced by amoxicillin with clavulanic acid against ampicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and bacteroides fragilis. inhibition of the beta-lactamases produced by the ampicillin-resistant  strains was confirmed, especially against the penicillinases mediated by the r factor and the cephalosporinases produced by p.vulgaris and b. fragilis. the inhibitory effect of clavulanic acid against beta-lactamases was irreversible because of the high affinity of clavulanic acid to the enzymes.

TI  == vaginal microbial flora: practical and theoretic relevance.
AB  == the bacterial flora of the female reproductive tract is a focal point for the study of infectious disease in obstetrics and gynecology, as it is recognized that many pelvic infections involve bacteria resident on the cervical-vaginal epithelium. the vaginal flora contains a large variety of bacterial species, including aerobic and anaerobic organisms, as revealed by modern microbiologic methods. recent studies have indicated that certain organisms commonly involved in pelvic infections, particularly those following genital tract surgery, name escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis, appear to be underrepresented in relationship to the infectious complications they cause. a possible explanation of this phenomenon has been suggested based on the finding that traumatic events  in the reproductive tract, including parturition, surgery, and invasive malignancy, result in increased colonization by organisms commonly involved in pelvic infections. other changes in the flora related to the host's hormonal milieu were identified and are generally less profound than those related to trauma. we have reviewed some of the newer aspects of our understanding of the genital flora, such as quantitation of the vaginal flora, which should continue to improve our understanding of the role of the genital flora in disease states.

TI  == moxalactam (6059-s), a novel 1-oxa-beta-lactam with an expanded antibacterial spectrum: laboratory evaluation.
AB  == moxalactam (6059-s) {7beta-[2-carboxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetamido]-7alpha-methoxy-3-[[(1-methyl-1h-t etrazol-5-yl)thio]-methyl]-1-oxa-1-dethia-3-cephem-4- carboxylic acid disodium salt} is a new semisynthetic 1-oxa-beta-lactam derivative for parenteral use. it  was highly active against a broad range of gram-negative microorganisms, including those resistant to other cephalosporins. moreover, it had widely expanded antibacterial spectra which included haemophilus influenzae, indole-positive proteus, enterobacter, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis. when a large number of clinical isolates of the above-named bacilli were tested by the agar dilution method, using an inoculum size of one loopful of 10(6) or 10(8) organisms or both per ml, the 70%  minimal inhibitory concentrations at the lower inoculum were 0.2, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8,  25, and 0.8 mug/ml, respectively. its activity appeared to be independent of inoculum size and addition of serum. in these organisms, morphological response of the exposed cells revealed that the bacteriolytic effect of 6059-s was initiated by a concentration equivalent to the minimal inhibitory concentration.  6059-s was markedly bactericidal to both beta-lactamase-producing and -nonproducing strains of escherichia coli; this was well reflected by its extraordinary stability to microbial beta-lactamase degradation. administered subcutaneously in mice, 6059-s attained plasma levels and a half-life similar to  those of cefazolin and exhibited potent protective efficacy against systemic infections; it also proved to be significantly more effective than either sulbenicillin or piperacillin against pseudomonas aeruginosa and than either cefazolin or cefmetazole against a variety of other gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == opsonization of four bacteroides species: role of the classical complement pathway and immunoglobulin.
AB  == previous investigators have suggested that opsonization of two bacteroides species is mediated exclusively by the alternative complement pathway and requires immunoglobulins. in this study, the nature of the opsonic factors in nonimmune human serum for four species of bacteroides was investigated by measuring uptake of [(3)h]thymidine-labeled bacteria by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. normal human serum, c2-deficient serum, immunoglobulin-deficient serum, and serum chelated with ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-n,n-tetraacetic acid (egta), mgegta, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) were used as opsonic sources. heat inactivation of each of these sera significantly reduced its opsonic activity for all four bacteroides species, suggesting that serum complement was essential for effective opsonization. all strains were opsonized in the absence of the classical complement pathway; however, kinetics studies revealed that opsonization proceeded at a significantly faster rate when the classical complement pathway was intact. although two strains were opsonized in immunoglobulin-deficient sera, opsonization was less efficient and appeared to occur via the alternative complement pathway. unexpectedly, all strains were well opsonized by the classical complement pathway in 10% serum which had been effectively chelated with egta or edta. the explanation for this finding is unknown; however, it is possible that cell wall cations of bacteroides species may participate in the activation of complement in chelated serum, resulting in effective opsonization. it was also found that bacteroides, when incubated with an escherichia coli strain in normal serum, could compete for opsonins and thereby reduce phagocytosis of e. coli. it is possible that competition for opsonins among bacterial species contributes to the synergistic role these organisms share in mixed floral infections.

TI  == a quantitative model for subcutaneous abscess formation in mice.
AB  == the purpose of this experiment was to develop an experimental model of s.c. encapsulated abscesses in which abscess formation could be assessed by quantitative measurements. inocula were composed of bacterial broth cultures, autoclaved mouse caecal contents or both in combination. these inocula were injected s.c. on the flank in 2 strains of mice. large encapsulated abscesses formed in all recipients by day 4 when the inoculum contained either b. fragilis  or s. aureus combined with caecal contents. bacterial concentrations per ml of pus at day 6 were 10(10.1+/-0.02) for b. fragilis and 10(8.4+/-0.1) for s. aureus. spontaneous external drainage began by 10--15 days, and complete healing  of the lesion occurred by 4--6 weeks. the typical histological pattern consisted  of a collagen capsule surrounding a rim of neutrophils, enclosing a central area  of necrotic cells and fibre from the inoculum. the cross-sectional areas of the capsule, the neutrophil band and the entire abscess were measured in a reproducible manner by planimetry, and abscess volumes were calculated. values for these measurements varied with different inocula and different times after inoculation, but were highly consistent for a specified time and inoculum.

TI  == experimental animal models for anaerobic infections.
AB  == an experimental animal model that stimulates the mixed aerobic-anaerobic microflora of intraabdominal sepsis was used to study antimicrobial efficacy in vivo. treatment of infected rats with chloramphenicol resulted in only a modest reduction in the percentage of animals surviving infection with abscesses at necropsy. this unanticipated observation led to further exploration of the predominant anaerobes associated with the experimental infection. in vitro cultures of bacteroides fragilis, susceptible to chloramphenicol in traditional tests, were capable of reducing chloramphenicol to its aryl amine derivative, which is biologically inactive. in contrast, metronidazole, an antimicrobial agent active against anaerobes, reduced the coli-metronidazole, an antimicrobial  agent active against anaerobes, reduced the coli-form-associated mortality in this animal model. subsequent studies showed that this reduction in mortality is  dependent on the presence of an anaerobe and that the levels of escherichia coli  in mixed continuous culture with b. fragilis are reduced by addition of metronidazole. this reduction following addition of metronidazole was not observed either in a pure culture of e. coli or when clindamycin was added to a mixed culture. in a modification of the previously described model, infective material was placed subcutaneously into wistar rats. studies with this model suggested that the host's response to bacterial challenge is dependent on the site of infection and that organotropism of the implanted bacterial species is an important determinant of infection.

TI  == septicemia in children with cancer.
AB  == because of the persistently high mortality from sepsis in cancer patients, a retrospective study was designed to identify the causative organisms and to determine the factors affecting the outcome of sepsis. a total of 84 episodes of  septicemia in 61 children with cancer were studied. the more frequently isolated  organisms were: staphylococcus aureus (21.4%); escherichia coli (18%); klebsiella (7.1%); pseudomonas (6%); and bacteroides fragilis (6%). other isolates included  proteus, serratia, acinetobacter, hemolytic streptococcus, and bacillus cereus. in 10.7% of septic episodes, mixed bacterial infections were documented. twenty-four (28.6%) resulted in death; in 13 (54%) death occurred within 24 hours after admission. the fatality rate was high in cases associated with absolute polymorphonuclear leukocyte counts of less than 100/cu mm, in neoplastic relapse, and when infection with gram-negative, anaerobic and mixed bacterial flora occurred.

TI  == anaerobic infection of the liver and biliary tract in experimental common duct occlusion.
AB  == the pathogenicity of single anaerobic, single aerobic, and mixed anaerobic and aerobic bacterial inocula was studied in 3 groups of 12 rabbits with biliary tract obstruction. b. fragilis, ss. fragilis and e. coli serotype 01:k1:h7 were used. the investigation was made 7 days after bacterial inoculation and included  bacteriological studies of the liver and bile as well as studies of liver function and morphology of the liver and biliary tract. inoculation of 10(5)--10(6) e. coli did not cause biliary tract infection, liver abscesses or death. inoculation of 10(9) b. fragilis caused biliary tract infection in 83 per  cent and liver abscesses in 17 per cent of the animals inoculated, without any mortality. combined inoculation with b. fragilis and e. coli in reduced doses significantly increased mortality (42 per cent) and frequency of liver abscesses  in surviving animals (86 per cent). all abscesses, however, yielded pure culture  of b. fragilis only. 84 per cent of the animals inoculated with b. fragilis alone or with b. fragilis in combination with e. coli developed biliary tract infection with b. fragilis, the bile yielding from 10(7)--)0(9) b. fragilis per ml, gall bladder bile yielding significantly higher bacterial counts than common duct bile. e. coli was never recovered from bile in surviving animals but from both bile and blood in animals not surviving the experimental period.

TI  == investigation of the immune response to aerobic and anaerobic intestinal bacteria in a patient with crohn's disease.
AB  == the immune response to aerobic and anaerobic intestinal bacteria in a patient with crohn's disease with an intestinal fistula was investigated with various serological techniques. two aerobic bacterial species, e. dispar and p. mirabilis, and four strict anaerobic bacterial species, b. fragilis ss. fragilis, f. varium and two different strains of c. perfringens, were isolated from fistula secretion of the patient. these strains were used as antigens for tube agglutination, passive hemagglutination, indirect immunofluorescence and immune hemolysis assays with serum specimens obtained before and after operation of the  patient. immune responses were demonstrated to the aerobic as well as to the anaerobic bacterial strains isolated from the patient's fistula. in connection with the operation an active immune response was demonstrated to the aerobic and  anaerobic bacterial isolates. antibodies belonging to igg and iga took part in the active immune response while igm was very little involved. antibodies responsible for passive hemagglutination reactions were resistant to treatment with beta-mercaptoethanol. antibodies to aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative rods were shown to have complement fixing activity. the importance of the demonstrated antibodies for the host's defence against normal intestinal microorganisms and the inflammatory reaction as a consequence of chronic antigenic stimulation in the diseased part of the intestine in patients with crohn's disease is discussed.

TI  == mechanism of aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance in anaerobic bacteria: clostridium perfringens and bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == cell-free amino acid incorporation using ribosomes from strains of either clostridium perfringens or bacteroides fragilis was shown to be susceptible to inhibition by streptomycin and gentamicin. ribosomes bound dihydrostreptomycin as effectively as ribosomes from escherichia coli. no inactivation of streptomycin or gentamicin was detected by cell extracts of either anaerobic bacterial species. b. fragilis, grown without added hemin, menadione, and fumarate, and c.  perfringens did not show any time-dependent accumulation of dihydrostreptomycin or gentamicin at concentrations tested. decreased resistance to aminoglycosides and time-dependent uptake of dihydrostreptomycin at 500 mug/ml was observed with  b. fragilis grown with hemin, menadione, and fumarate. with the last additions, cytochrome b was detected by cytochrome spectra of b. fragilis. these results demonstrate that anaerobic bacteria unable to carry out oxygen- or nitrate-dependent electron transport are resistant to streptomycin and gentamicin because of failure to transport aminoglycosides. the induction of fumarate-dependent electron transport in b. fragilis is associated with some aminoglycoside transport that is of poor efficiency relative to bacteria with electron transport to oxygen or nitrate.

TI  == low trimethoprim susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria due to insensitive dihydrofolate reductases.
AB  == all the 28 bacteroides fragilis strains investigated were susceptible to sulfamethoxazole (minimal inhibitory concentration < 16 mug/ml) and resistant to  trimethoprim (tmp; minimal inhibitory concentration > 4 mug/ml). synergism between sulfamethoxazole and tmp was present in all strains at a ratio of 1:1. the few clostridia investigated proved more resistant to both compounds. dihydrofolate reductases from b. fragilis, c. perfringens, and some other anaerobic species were isolated. inhibition profiles with six structurally different inhibitors revealed major differences in all enzymes. for 50% inhibition, the enzyme from b. fragilis and all clostridia required concentrations of tmp which were between several hundredfold and 1,000-fold higher than those required for the enzyme of escherichia coli, whereas the enzyme from propionibacterium acnes only needed a threefold higher concentration. in vitro activities of tmp were seen to correspond to the activity at the enzymatic  level in b. fragilis and p. acnes, but correspond to a much lesser extent to the  activity at the enzymatic level in clostridia, where a poor penetration is assumed to be involved. dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors other than tmp were found to be as active as tmp both at the enzyme and in vitro. in b. fragilis, higher concentrations of exogenous thymidine were required for increasing the minimal inhibitory concentration of tmp than in e. coli and probably also in c. perfringens.

TI  == genetic determinants of microbial resistance to antibiotics.
AB  == emergence of antibiotic resistance is related to the ease of mutation, to the extent of exchange of genetic information in bacteria by conjugation, transformation, and transduction, and to the large-scale use of antimicrobial agents in the biosphere. in addition to the development of resistance through chromosomal mutation and exchange of chromosomal genes among organisms, there is  a more profound enlargement of the gene pool by the dissemination and amplification of plasmids. two examples of the exchange of antibiotic resistance  are analyzed: the transfer of plasmids from bacteroides fragilis to escherichia coli and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae. plasmids encoding antibiotic resistance in b. fragilis were transferred to e. coli by dna-mediated transformation and conjugation. the beta-lactamase in the transformants and transconjugants displayed the same substrate specificity and electrophoretic mobility as the donor strain. the plasmid apparently was integrated rapidly into the chromosome of the recipient strain. multiple antibiotic-resistant strains of s. pneumoniae were analyzed for  plasmids, and none were detected. furthermore, no evidence of linkage between the traits of multiple antibiotic resistance was observed. beta-lactamase was not detected in the penicillin-resistant strains; therefore, it is likely that the resistance in these strains was chromosomal rather than plasmid-mediated. the range of genetic exchange and the use of koch's postulates in determining the genetic mechanism of antibiotic resistance are illustrated and discussed.

TI  == polymorphonuclear neutrophil chemotaxis under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
AB  == the motility of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils was studied in vitro under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. chemotactic factors were generated from plasma  with immune complexes or with whole bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, escherichia  coli, and bacteroides fragilis). chemotaxis induced by chemotactic factors generated from immune complexes was identical under both conditions. however, chemotaxis utilizing chemotactic factors generated from bacteria was markedly depressed under anaerobic conditions. mean random tubemoltility was not significantly different under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. these data indicate that different metabolic pathways may be involved in polymorphonuclear neutrophil movement. some of these pathways require oxygen (chemotaxis in response to factors generated by bacteria in plasma), whereas others do not (random tube migration and chemotaxis in response to factors generated by immune  complexes in plasma). these observations may be important in the induction of inflammatory responses within hypoxic tissues.

TI  == a review. lessons from an animal model of intra-abdominal sepsis.
AB  == intra-abdominal sepsis that involves multiple aerobic and anaerobic bacteria derived from the colonic flora was studied in wistar rats to determine the relative roles of various microbial species. the rats challenged with pooled colonic contents showed a biphasic disease. initially, there was acute peritonitis, escherichia coli bacteremia, and high mortality. in rats that survived this acute peritonitis stage, intra-abdominal abscesses developed, and anaerobic bacteria were the preponderant organisms. subsequent experiments showed that antibiotics directed against coliforms prevented mortality, whereas agents active against anaerobes reduced the incidence of abscesses. challenges with escherichia coli alone produced bacteremia and death, whereas pure cultures of bacteroides fragilis caused intra-abdominal abscesses. these observations suggest that both coliforms and anaerobes are important pathogens in intra-abdominal sepsis, although the different types of microbes appear to play distinctive roles in the sequence of pathological events.

AB  == cutaneous abscesses in the perineal region contain primarily anaerobes commonly found in stool. non-perineal abscesses contain mixed microflora indigenous to the skin. bacteroides fragilis, the only anaerobe resistant to penicillin, is found predominantly in the perineal area. staphylococcus aureus, although the most common aerobe found, is seen less frequently than expected and is almost always resistant to penicillin. escherichia coli and neisseria gonorrhoeae are rarely found. incision and drainage is the primary mode of treatment. fever is rare, though tachycardia is common in patients with normal host defenses. patients with altered host defenses may require initial culture and gram-stained smear to determine appropriate antibiotic therapy. the gram-stained smear reliably indicates sterile and mixed abscesses, as well as those containing pure s aureus. incision and drainage alone is the only therapy required in the usual patient. since in these patients antibiotics are not required, initial culture and gram-stained smear are unnecessary.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of cefamandole against 445 clinical isolates was investigated and compared with the activity of other known cephalosporins (cephalothin, cephaloridine, cephalexin, and cefazolin) and of two penicillins (ampicillin and carbenicillin). cefamandole was the most active antibiotic against isolates of citrobacter, enterobacter, and shigella, and its activity against staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides, and some members of the enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of the other antibiotics tested. the stability of cefamandole with respect to beta-lactamase was investigated and compared with that of cephalothin, cefazolin, and cephalexin. cefamandole was stable with respect to the beta-lactamases of enterobacter and some other members of the enterobacteriaceae. no significant correlation was found between the antibacterial activity and the beta-lactamase stability of cefamandole, except with enterobacter. the synergistic activity of cefamandole combined with gentamicin or amikacin was demonstrated by killing-curve techniques, isobolograms, and susceptibility data. although 12%--46% of the isolates were synergistically inhibited by either combination, antagonism was not observed. no  correlation between the hydrolysis of cefamandole by beta-lactamase and the synergistic activity of cefamandole combined with amikacin was demonstrated.

TI  == differences between cephalothin and newer parenterally absorbed cephalosporins in vitro: a justification for separate disks.
AB  == the activities of cefamandole and cefoxitin in vitro were compared with that of cephalothin against staphylococci and gram-negative bacilli. cephalothin was the  most active agent against staphylococci. cefamandole exhibited the greatest activity against the enterobacteriaceae, with the exceptions of serratia marcescens and indole-positive proteeae, against which cefoxitin was the most active antibiotic. the activity of newer cephalosporins that are resistant to the beta-lactamases of gram-negative bacteria renders untenable the status of cephalothin as the class representative of the cephalosporins for susceptibility  testing.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of metronidazole in anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of metronidazole was investigated in anaerobic bacteria by use of time-viability studies. this antimicrobial agent has a rapid onset of bactericidal activity under proper reducing conditions. the bactericidal rates were not affected by inoculum size or nutritional requirements, nor by inhibition of growth and protein synthesis by chloramphenicol. using supernatant  fractions of actively growing cultures of susceptible organisms, we observed a disappearance of metronidazole and a loss of biological activity, but there was no significant change in preparations from resistant bacteria. the decrease in drug concentration with susceptible cells occurred during the time that its bactericidal action was being exerted. extracts from susceptible organisms rapidly reduced the concentration of metronidazole, confirming previous observations which suggest that the drug acts as a terminal electron acceptor. radioisotope experiments with [14c]metronidazole revealed that the compound was taken up by both resistant and susceptible bacteria, although there was a difference in rate and extent of accumulation. these studies demonstrate that metronidazole's antimicrobial activity against anaerobic bacteria is bactericidal and independent of growth rate, and that it involves the uptake and metabolism of the compound.

AB  == the in vitro activity of piperacillin, a new semisynthetic piperazine penicillin  derivative, was evaluated against 626 clinical isolates and compared with the activity of other beta-lactam antibiotics. at a concentration of 0.1 microgram/ml, piperacillin inhibited all streptococci except enterococci. non-beta-lactamase-producing staphylococci were inhibited by 1.6 microgram or less per ml. both beta-lactamase- and non-beta-lactamase-producing haemophilus were inhibited by 0.1 microgram/ml. piperacillin inhibited non-beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli, salmonella, and shigella at a concentration of 6.3 micrograms/ml, but 20% of strains of these species containing type iii beta-lactamase were not inhibited by 100 micrograms/ml. piperacillin at 25 micrograms/ml, inhibited 83% of citrobacter, 58% of klebsiella, 88% of enterobacter, and 50% of indole-positive proteus, acinetobacter, and providencia. at 25 micrograms/ml, piperacillin inhibited 95% of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 78% of bacteroides fragilis. the minimal inhibitory concentration of piperacillin against pseudomonas was affected by increasing the  inoculum size and by ph. minimum bactericidal concentrations against pseudomonas  and serratia often were eightfold greater than the minimum inhibitory concentrations. piperacillin was equal in activity to ampicillin against enterococci. it was more active than carbenicillin against e. coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, and bacteroides. it was the most active penicillin against pseudomonas and inhibited many strains of pseudomonas for which the mics of carbenicillin were above 200 micrograms/ml. piperacillin was hydrolyzed by many different beta-lactamases. synergistic activity of piperacillin was demonstrated  when it was combined with amikacin, gentamicin, and cefazolin against p. aeruginosa and members of the enterobacteriaceae. no antagonism was observed when piperacillin was combined with aminoglycosides; however, antagonism was observed  rarely against e. coli when piperacillin was combined with cefazolin.

AB  == cefaclor (ccl), a new cephalosporin, was tested in vitro against 602 (271 anaerobic and 331 aerobic) clinical isolates in comparison with cephalothin, cefazolin, cephradine, and cefamandole. sixteen micrograms of ccl per ml inhibited 68% of all aerobes tested and 80% of the 211 enteropathogenic organisms (escherichia coli, salmonella, and shigella) isolated from cases of infantile diarrhoea. ccl inhibited 88% of gram-positive anaerobic cocci and 72% of bacteroides other than b. fragilis at a concentration of 16 mug/ml. b. fragilis and clostridia were resistant to ccl. increased inoculum of e. coli from 10(5) to 10(9) increased the minimal inhibitory concentration of ccl and cefamandole by fourfold against 7 of the 64 strains tested. all seven were beta-lactamase negative. no antimicrobial synergism was noted between ccl and penicillin. the in vitro efficacy of ccl, an oral cephalosporin, against enteropathogenic e. coli, if proven safe, may be tested in vivo against such infections.

TI  == colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == a study of colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was conducted in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice. groups of germfree akr mice were swabbed with five bacterial and a single gastrointestinal yeast species: streptococcus faecalis. lactobacillus brevis. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, bacteroides fragilis var. vulgatus, and torulopsis sp. all species became established in the gut in 8 weeks. later these associated mice were divided and challenged by four graded doses of e. coli or p. aeruginosa. the presence of challenge organism was monitored specifically in the freshly voided fecal specimens of the challenged mice. escherichia coli colonized the gut of each mouse at each level up to 60 days post challenge. pseudomonas aeruginosa was completely eliminated from each mouse at each dose level after 30 days post challenge. evidence suggests that all six species were sufficient to prevent the  colonization of p. aeruginosa and not of e. coli in the gut of the gnotobiotic mice.

TI  == bacterial flora of the small bowel before and after bypass procedure for morbid obesity.
AB  == the contents of the proximal jejunum and distal ileum were cultured quantitatively in eight patients who were undergoing intestinal bypass procedure  for obesity. five jejunal specimens were sterile, and three contained low counts  of a predominantly aerobic flora. ileal contents yielded variable but usually higher counts than in the jejunum, and there were similar numbers of anaerobes and aerobes. in three patients in whom a bypass was established, contents of the  functioning small bowel showed counts of 10(5.0)-10(7.6) colony-forming units/ml. these counts exceeded the counts in the normal terminal ileum, and the flora qualitatively resembled that of feces. four specimens from excluded loops revealed colonization with fecal organisms, and the counts ranged between 10(6.4) and 10(9.7) colony-forming units/ml. in jejunoileal bypass both the functioning small bowel and the excluded loop become colonized with colonic flora, a phenomenon that may contribute to some of the side effects of this procedure.

AB  == approximately 40 to 60% of bacteroides fragilis subsp. fragilis in pus from experimental intra-abdominal abscesses lost their viability within 24 h when stored at refrigeration temperature (4 degrees c) either aerobically or anaerobically. no viability loss of b. fragilis was noted when pus was stored at  25 degrees c. only slight loss of viaability of b. fragilis was observed at 15 degrees c. escherichia coli coexisting in pus with b. fragilis increased several  100fold in 24 h when stored at 25 degrees c, but no significant growth occurred when they were kept at 15 degrees c. approximately 20 to 40% of e. coli lost their viability when such pus was stored at 4 degrees c. we suggest that 15 degrees c may be an alternative temperature for storage of anaerobic specimens in laboratories where some delay in routine processing is unavoidable.

TI  == comparison of killing of bacteria by guinea pig neutrophils and monocytes.
AB  == guinea pig polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn's; harvested from the blood and from peritoneal exudates) and monocytes (harvested from the peritoneal cavity with and without stimulation of an exudate) were compared in their capacities to  kill three pyogenic bacteria. all combinations of phagocytes and bacteria required heat-labile opsonic factors. no significant differences in killing of the three organisms were observed between blood and peritoneal pmn's or between stimulated and unstimulated monocytes. pmn's killed staphylococcus aureus more effectively than monocytes after both 1 and 2 hr of incubation (p less than 0.05). although pmn's appeared to have greater bactericidal activity against escherichia coli than did monocytes, this differences was significant only after  2 hr of incubation (p less than 0.05). the killing of bacteroides fragilis by pmn's and monocytes was identical. these data demonstrate that guinea pig exudates provide suitable models for the study of phagocytosis and killing of bacteria and suggest that the relative bactericidal capacities of phagocytes depend not only on the phagocyte but also on the species of pyogenic bacteria being studied. these observations may have important implications in host defense against serious infections.

TI  == the capsular polysaccharide of bacteroides fragilis as a virulence factor: comparison of the pathogenic potential of encapsulated and unencapsulated strains.
AB  == the pathogenic potentials of encapsulated and unencapsulated strains of bacteroides fragilis were compared by use of a rat model of intraabdominal sepsis. implantation of encapsulated b. fragilis alone resulted in abscesses in most recipients, whereas unencapsulated strains seldom produced this effect unless they were combined with another organism. implants of heat-killed, encapsulated b. fragilis also resulted in abscess formation. subsequent experiments suggested that the abscess-potentiating ability of encapsulated b. fragilis is related to the capsular polysaccharide. implantation of 200 microgram of the purified capsular material alone or in conjuction with unencapsulated strains caused abscess formation in a majority of animals. comparable results were not obtained with capsular polysaccharide from escherichia coli o7:k1(l)"nm  or with heat-killed streptococcus pneumoniae type iii. the capsular polysaccharide of b. fragilis appears to potentiate abscess formation and may represent a virulence factor for this species.

TI  == superoxide dismutase in anaerobic bacteria of clinical significance.
AB  == twenty-two anaerobic bacteria isolated from infected sites and normal fecal flora were assayed for superoxide dismutase (sod). the organisms were also classified according to their oxygen tolerance into aerotolerant, intermediate, and extremely oxygen-sensitive groups. there was a correlation between the enzyme level and the oxygen tolerance, in that the aerotolerant and intermediate organisms had sod, whereas the extremely oxygen-sensitive isolates had low or undetectable enzyme. among the oxygen-tolerant organisms, gram-negative bacteria  had higher levels of sod than gram-positive organisms. oxygen was shown to induce sod production in a strain of bacteriodes fragilis grown in minimal medium under  continuous-culture conditions. enzyme levels in this isolate grown under static conditions were lower in minimal medium than in complex medium, indicating that other components in the complex medium were stimulating the production of sod. our data suggest that the variation in oxygen tolerance of anaerobes is usually related to their level of sod. it is postulated that sod may be a virulence factor that allows pathogenic anaerobes to survive in oxygenated tissues until the proper reduced conditions are established for their growth.

TI  == development of a lysis-filtration blood culture technique.
AB  == a lysed-blood culture system that quickly lyses patients' blood near neutrality and is relatively noninjurious to more delicate pathogens such as haemophilus influenzae and bacteroides fragilis is reported. the lysing solution includes culture medium, 0.004 m sodium carbonate and bicarbonate, 0.04% triton x-100,and  0.6% rhozyme (a mixture of proteases). most of the pathogens tested multiplied in the lysing solution. the lysed blood normally is immediately filtered. the membrane is transferred to culture broth. the greatest advantage realized from this blood culture technique is separation of pathogens from antibiotics, bactericidal antibodies, complement, opsonins, and phagocytic systems. another advantage is the concentration of organisms into a small volume of clear medium for faster growth and visualization of growth. it was observed that both gram-negative and -positive organisms were attracted during filtration to the filter material and were not removed from it by backwashing with buffer. thus, filter membranes with porosities much larger than would nominally be expected to  retain bacteria retained all or part of light and heavy escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus suspensions. advantage may be taken of this phenomenon to use filters with larger pore sizes and avoid filter clogging by poorly lysed specimens. porr lysis may result from addition of too much blood to the lysing solution, blood with elevated numbers of erythrocytes or leukocytes, or blood from some people whose blood is naturally more resistant to lysis.

AB  == thirty-eight adult patients with serious pleuropulmonary, soft-tissue, bone, and  intra-abdominal infections caused by combinations of aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic bacteria were treated with parenterally given clindamycin phosphate and gentamicin sulfate and surgery when appropriate. nine had associated bacteremia.  in 29, infections failed to respond to other therapeutic regimens, which included penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and chloramphenicol. results with clindamycin and gentamicin were excellent and were attributed primarily to the activity of clindamycin against anaerobes, particularly bacteroides fragilis. serum concentrations of clindamycin surpassed by manyfold the minimal inhibitory  concentrations (mics) for anaerobes. serum concentrations of gentamicin did not consistently surpass the mics for enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa,  although those organisms were consistently gentamicinsusceptible by disk diffusion susceptibility tests. persistent colonization with enterobacteriaceae,  p aeruginosa, enterococci, or candida were common, and occasionally they were significant in prolonging the clinical courses of patients with extensive infections.

TI  == cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate levels and activities of adenylate cyclase and cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterase in pseudomonas and bacteroides.
AB  == a modified gilman assay was used to determine the concentrations of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (camp) in rapidly filtered cells and in the culture filtrates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli k-12, and bacteroides fragilis. in p. aeruginosa cultures, levels of camp in the filtrate increased with the culture absorbance (3.5 to 19.8 x 10(-9) m) but did not vary significantly with the carbon source used to support growth. intracellular concentrations (0.8 to 3.2 x 10(-5) m) were substantially higher and did not vary appreciably during growth or with carbon source. sodium camp (5 mm) failed to reverse the catabolite repression of inducible glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase  (ec 1.1.1.49) synthesis caused by the addition of 10 mm succinate. exogenous camp also had no discernible effect on the catabolite repression control of inducible  mannitol dehydrogenase (ec 1.1.1.67). p. aeruginosa was found to contain both soluble camp phosphodiesterase (ec 3.1.4.17) and membrane-associated adenylate cyclase (ec 4.6.1.1) activity, and these were compared to the activities detected in crude extracts of e. coli. b. fragilis crude cell extracts contain neither of  these enzyme activities, and little or no camp was detected in cells or culture filtrates of this anaerobic bacterium.

TI  == prophylactic lincomycin in the prevention of wound infection following appendicectomy: a double blind study.
AB  == the prophylactic use of a single dose of lincomycin in 100 patients undergoing appendicectomy reduced the incidence of postoperative wound infection from 17 to  6 per cent compared with a similar group of control patients. there was no correlation with the histological finding in the appendix, but patients with perforated appendicitis were excluded from the study. bacteriological examination of the appendix area before surgery showed that bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli were the organisms most frequently isolated. the majority of wound infections were due to b. fragilis, either alone or in association with aerobic organisms, but infection due to e. coli and staphylococcus aureus also occurred. systemic antibiotic therapy can successfully reduce the complications following appendicectomy but it is necessary to use a compound with activity against anaerobic organisms.

AB  == the minimal inhibitory concentrations of gentamicin and minocycline alone and in  combination were determined by a broth microdilution method for 100 aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic isolates representative of pathogens recovered from patients with intra-abdominal sepsis. gentamicin inhibited all strains of klebsiella, enterobacter, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in concentrations of 0.4 to  3.1 mug/ml and all strains of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis in concentrations of 0.8 to 12.5 mug/ml. whereas minocycline did not consistently inhibit these organisms in concentrations of 1.6 mug or less/ml, it did act synergistically with gentamicin against 43% of the enterobacteriaceae tested in clinically achievable concentrations; significant synergy was most common with e. coli (60%). minocycline inhibited 62% of bacteroides fragilis, 71% of clostridium, 40% of anaerobic cocci, and 40% of enterococci tested in concentrations of 1.6 mug or less/ml. whereas gentamicin rarely inhibited these organisms in concentrations of 6.2 mug or less/ml, it did act synergistically with minocycline against 20% of b. fragilis, 67% of clostridium, 22% of anaerobic cocci, and 22% of enterococci (which had minimal inhibitory concentrations of minocycline within the range tested) at clinically achievable concentrations. although only four (13%) of the 30 isolates resistant to both gentamicin and minocycline alone were inhibited by clinically achievable concentrations of the combination, the observed synergy, particularly against strains of e. coli, was considered to be of potential clinical usefulness. antagonism between gentamicin  and minocycline was not observed at the concentrations tested.

TI  == susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria with 100-microg carbenicillin disks.
AB  == a total of 245 strains of anaerobic bacteria were examined for their susceptibility to carbenicillin by the disk test method and by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determinations. standard-curve studies with a strain of bacteroides fragilis subsp. fragilis that was minimally susceptible to carbenicillin and escherichia coli (atcc 25922) demonstrated that a disk containing 100 mug of carbenicillin was suitable for testing susceptibility of anaerobes to carbenicillin. thus, the diameter of zones around the 100-mug carbenicillin disks and mic values were determined under the following test conditions: mueller-hinton agar supplemented with sheep blood, vitamin k(1), and  hemin; an incubation temperature of 35 c; and an atmosphere of 80% n(2), 10% h(2), and 10% co(2). the strains were separated into two populations by correlating zone diameters and geometric mean mics. the disk test more clearly separated the resistant and susceptible populations and was more reproducible than the mic test. thus, a statistical analysis based on the distribution of zone diameters of susceptible and resistant strains was used to derive an interpretive scheme for anaerobic bacteria tested with 100-mug carbenicillin disks. the following interpretive scheme is recommended for testing anaerobes with 100-mug disks of carbenicillin: resistant, 8 mm or less; indeterminate, 9 to 12 mm; and susceptible, 13 mm or greater.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial effects of cefoxitin, a semisynthetic cephamycin, cefuroxime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, and cephaloridine were compared. with gram-positive bacteria, marked differences were found only in the effects against streptococcus faecalis, where cephaloridine and cefuroxime were superior to cefoxitin. with gram-negative aerobic bacteria, cefoxitin, which is known to be more resistant to beta-lactamases from gram-negative bacteria than any cephalosporin, was found to be more effective than cefuroxime and cephaloridine against ampicillin-resistant strains of escherichia coli and indole-positive strains of proteus. haemophilus influenzae was found to be more susceptible to cefuroxime than to cefoxitin and cephaloridine. when ampicillin-resistant strains of h. influenzae were tested, markedly higher minimal inhibitory concentration values were obtained with cephaloridine in comparison to those obtained with ampicillin-susceptible strains. these increases in the minimal inhibitory concentration values were not observed with cefoxitin and cefuroxime, probably due to the resistance of these two compounds to beta-lactamases. strains of bacteroides fragilis were found to be much more susceptible to cefoxitin than to  cefuroxime, which in turn was superior to cephaloridine. the results obtained indicate that cefoxitin and cefuroxime both are superior in their antibacterial spectra to the cephalosporins that are now in clinical use.

AB  == pc-904, sodium 6-{d(-)-alpha-(4-hydroxy-1,5-naphthyridine-3-carboxamido) phenylacetamido}-penicillanate, is a novel semisynthetic penicillin derivative that possesses a broad spectrum of in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities. in low concentrations, pc-904 inhibits growth against large proportions of the gram-positive and gram-negative organisms susceptible to carbenicillin and gentamicin. in addition, pc-904 is several times more potent than carbenicillin against organisms such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, shigella, salmonella, neisseria gonorrhoeae,  and bacteroides fragilis. most striking are the inhibitory effects of pc-904 against p. aeruginosa and k. pneumoniae. against these two clinical isolates, pc-904 is, respectively, 35 and 100 times more active than carbenicillin. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of pc-904 against p. aeruginosa are comparable  to those of gentamicin. pc-904 acts bactericidally. the effect of inoculum size on the antibacterial activity is often small and generally comparable to carbenicillin. the rate of binding to serum protein is high (88 to 98%), but the  effect of the addition of serum on the drug's activity is not marked, because such binding is reversible. it is confirmed that pc-904 has a very potent in vivo antibacterial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. against systemic infections with p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. coli in mice, pc-904 is 7 to 10 times, over 8 times, and 2 to 15 times more active than carbenicillin, respectively.

AB  == the relation of intracolonic gaseous tension to fecal microflora was investigated by mass spectrometric measurements of intracolonic o2 and co2 in unanesthetized germfree, conventional, and gnotobiotic rats; ip measurements were obtained in rats whose colons became perforated accidentally; fecal bacterial flora and cecal size were also determined. gnotobiotes were monoassociated with escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus epidermidis, and were diassociated with e. coli plus b. fragilis and with bacillus macerans plus an aerobic diphtheroid.  mean intracolonic po2 in conventional rats (11.1 mmhg) was significantly lower than in germfree rats (12.8 mmhg); mean intracolonic pco2 in conventionals (83.4  mmhg) was greater than in germfree rats (54.6 mmhg). differences of po2 values among all rats were slight. however, intracolonic pco2 values were directly related to co2 production by the normal intestinal flora, and were thus significantly lower in both germfree and gnotobiotic rats. intraperitoneal tensions were independent of the status of rats, and the mean ip po2 and pco2 (38.9 and 49.1 mmhg, respectively) agreed with values in the literature. the enlarged cecum, characteristic of germfree rats, was also present in gnotobiotic  rats. counts of each bacterial species in feces of monoassociated rats were 10(8) to 10(10)/g; counts were progressively smaller in feces of diassociated rats and  conventional rats (10(8) to 10(9)/g and 10(5) to 10(8)/g, respectively). intracolonic gaseous tensions of co2 clearly reflected the presence of a normal flora inconventional rats, and were inversely proportional to cecal size.

AB  == the role of the intestinal flora in the conversion of n-hydroxy-4-acetyl-aminobiphenyl (n-oh-aabp) to 4-acetylaminobiphenyl has been examined. this reaction, which reverses the metabolic activation of the parent carcinogen, can be demonstrated in cultures of some bacteria indigenous to the intestinal microflora. these include cultures of clostridium sp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus productus i, and bacteroides fragilis ss. thetaiotaomicron and ss. vulgatus. in contrast, cultures of lactobacillus plantarum and escherichia coli show little or no capacity for this reaction. the  reduction of n-oh-aabp is also carried out by homogenates of liver, kidney, and brain. on a weight basis, the cecal flora is considerably more active in reducing n-oh-aabp than are homogenates of tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. the cecal flora also has a greater activity for reducing n-oh-aabp than the stomach flora, an observation which may relate to the induction of tumors in the forestomach but not in the cecum of rats fed this compound. the products of the metabolism of n-oh-aabp have been compared in germ-free and conventional animals. glucuronide conjugates of n-oh-aabp are found in the cecal contents and feces only of the germ-free rats, while 4-acetylaminobiphenyl is found in the feces only of conventional rats. these results suggest that the flora, by hydrolyzing glucuronides and reducing n-oh-aabp, may influence the level of metabolities of 4-acetylaminobiphenyl which are critical for carcinogenesis.

AB  == we described two convenient assay methods to estimate bile acid deconjugation and bile acid bioconversion at the 7alpha-oh position by individual microorganisms grown in media containing taurocholic acid. the methods are based on (i) a selective chemical assay for taurine conjugates previously described and (ii) the use of a cell-free preparation of 7alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from escherichia coli to directly quantify 7alpha-oh groups. these non-chromatographic approaches have been applied to the study of three model strains of intestinal organisms, e. coli, bacteroides fragilis, and clostridium perfringens, grown in standard media in the presence of purified tritiated taurocholate. assay results  were confirmed by thin-layer chromatography solvent systems designed to separate  conjugated from unconjugated bile acid and unmodified cholic acid nucleus from 7alpha-oh bioconversion product(s) (primarily 3alpha, 12alpha dihydroxy, 7-keto-cholanoic acid). in addition, 7alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity was demonstrated in cell-free extracts of all three organisms. of the three organisms, only c. perfringens was demonstrated to (i) deconjugate taurocholic acid, (ii) contain 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity, (iii) convert cholic acid into at least five labeled metabolites visible on thin-layer chromatography, and (iv) catalyze significant tritium exchange with water in the  medium.

TI  == factors that may prevent transfer of anti-biotic resistance between gram-negative bacteria in the gut.
AB  == antibiotic-resistance transfer between populations of donor and recipient strains of escherichia coli was completely inhibited in broth by dense suspensions of bacteroides fragilis. comparable amounts of inert bacterial matter (for-molised suspensions of e. coli or b. fragilis), or smaller numbers of viable b. fragilis, streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus albus, neisseria catarrhalis, or solutions of sodium taurocholate or glycocholate were only moderately inhibitory. anaeroboisis had no effect upon plasmid transfer. population densities of enteric organisms in these studies were similar to those found in faeces. the presence of dense cultures of b. fragilis provide a satisfactory explanation for almost total inhibition of conjugation in the human gut. other factors inhibiting conjugation  to a lesser degree may reinforce the effect of b. fragilis in vivo. as well as selecting for resistant organisms, antibiotics may also indirectly increase populations of r factor-bearing organisms in the gut by interfering with the anaerobic flora and so permit an increase in the frequency of conjugation.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of thiamphenicol was compared to that of chloramphenicol against 313 strains of gram-negative bacilli isolated from various clinical specimens. these two antiboitics were equally active against the 106 isolates of haemophilus mic equals 0.1 minus 1.56 mu g/ml) and against 40 strains of bacteroides fragilis (almost all strains being inhibited by 12.5 mug/ml of the two drugs). in contrast, when compared with chloramphenicol, 2-16 times as much of thiamphenicol was required to inhibit enterobacteriacae, making  prediction of the susceptibility of these strains to thiamphenicol on the basis of chloramphenicol testing alone likely to be hazardous. disc diffusion test using 30-mug discs and 12 mm as cut-off point was a reliable technique to determine susceptibility of bacteria either to chloramphenicol or thiamphenicol.  when thiamphenicol discs of greater potency (50 mug) were employed, many strains  exhibited wide zones of inhibition although most of them were resistant by the agar dilution method (mic is greater than 12.5 mug/ml). this practice is not advisable for testing organisms isolated outside of the urinary tract.

TI  == erythrocyte polyagglutination showing properties of both t and tk, probably induced by bacteroides fragilis infection.
AB  == a new type of polyagglutination is described in which the t and tk receptors are  both exposed on the erythrocyte membrane. it is suggested that there may be an association between this type of polyagglutination and infection by bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == experimental intra-abdominal abscesses in rats: quantitative bacteriology of infected animals.
AB  == an animal model simulating intra-abdominal sepsis was produced by implanting large bowel contents into the pelvic region of rats. bacteriological analysis of  infected sites showed quantitative differences according to the stage of disease. during the initial, often lethal, peritonitis stage, escherichia coli (mean concentration, 10(6)/ml), enterococci (10(5)) and bacterioides fragilis (10(6)) were always present. blood cultures obtained during this phase were uniformly positive, with e. coli being the principal isolate. animals that survived this early acute peritonitis stage developed indolent intra-abdominal abscesses. the major isolates in abscess contents were b. fragilis (10(8.7)) and fusobacterium (10(8.6)); e. coli (10(7.8)) and enterococci (10(5.7)) were also present but in lesser concentrations. rank order analysis of these four species in peritoneal exudates and abscess pus showed that the two aerobes outranked the two anaerobes  during the early stage of the disease, whereas the reverse was true in abscesses. these experiments also illustrated that a major simplification of the original fecal inoculum occurred, even though the subsequent infection remained bacteriologically complex.

TI  == effect of preoperative antibiotic regimen on development of infection after intestinal surgery: prospective, randomized, double-blind study.
AB  == a prospective, randomized, double-blind study was performed to compare preoperative antibiotic preparation with neomycin (group 1), neomycin and tetracycline (group 2), and placebo (group 3) in patients undergoing elective intestinal surgery. the 196 patients were approximately equally distributed among the three study groups, which proved similar to each other in terms of age, sex,  diagnosis, site of lesion, and operative procedure. there were significantly (p < 0.01) fewer patients with postoperative wound sepsis in the neomycin-tetracycline group (group 2) than in either of the two other groups. postoperative wound infection rates in groups 1 and 3 were nearly identical. most infections contained both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. eight of nine episodes of septicemia due to bacteroides fragilis occurred in patients in groups 1 and 3.

TI  == studies on the cecal microflora of commercial broiler chickens.
AB  == a study was made of the cecal microflora isolated from broilers (5-week-old) reared under typical commercial husbandry conditions. three hundred and twenty-five bacterial strains (randomly isolated from colonies representing 49 to 81% of the microscopic count) were isolated from cecal digesta of six animals on  a rumen fluid roll tube medium (m98-5). seventy-seven percent of these strains consisted of strict anaerobes: gram-negative, pleomorphic cocci (5.2%), peptostreptococcus (1.5%), gram-positive rods (36.1% as propionibacterium acnes and eubacterium sp.), gram-negative rods (18.6% as bacteroides clostridiiformis,  b. hypermegas and b. fragilis) and sporeforming rods (15.7% as clostridium sp.).  two types of facultatively anaerobic bacteria (gram-positive cocci and escherichia coli) were also isolated and constituted 17.5% of the remaining flora. the distribution of the bacterial groups isolated from six cecal samples varied considerably. data on the growth requirements of anaerobic strains indicated that many could be cultured in a simple medium consisting of an energy  source, minerals, reducing agent, trypticase, and yeast extract (or a vitamin mixture in place of yeast extract). the growth of some of these bacteria was also enhanced by co(2) and rumen fluid. these preliminary data suggest that some of the more numerous anaerobes isolated from the chicken cecum may not require complex nutrients for growth and, in fact, may be nutritionally similar to rumen  anaerobes.

TI  == bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  == human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, eh < -42 mv at ph 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic pmn. anaerobic pmn were able to kill staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus, viridans streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and peptococcus magnus normally. organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic pmn included staphylococcus  aureus (strains wood 46 and 502a), escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and salmonella typhimurium. these findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide  may be important in the killing of some bacteria.

TI  == bacteroidaceae in thromboembolic disease: effects of cell wall components on blood coagulation in vivo and in vitro.
AB  == the effects of bacteroides sp., fusobacterium mortiferum, bacteroides fragilis, and sphaerophorus necrophorus on various parameters of blood coagulation in vivo  and in vitro were determined and compared to the coagulation effects of escherichia coli and salmonella minnesota, wild type and r595. intravenous injection of washed cells, culture filtrate, lipopolysaccharide, or lipid a of the anaerobic gram-negative microorganisms into mice resulted in acceleration of  coagulation. lipopolysaccharide and lipid a of the anaerobic microorganisms had no apparent effect on circulating platelets in mice or rabbits and did not cause  aggregation of human platelets in vitro. washed cells, lipopolysaccharide, and lipid a of bacteroides sp. and f. mortiferum also significantly accelerated the clotting time of recalcified platelet poor normal human plasma and c6-deficient rabbit plasma. lipid a, but not lipopolysaccharide, of e. coli and washed cells of s. minnesota r595 accelerated coagulation by a similar mechanism. these results indicated that bacteroides sp. and f. mortiferum can accelerate blood coagulation in vivo and in vitro by a mechanism which does not involve platelets  or terminal components of complement.

TI  == effect of colon flora and short-chain fatty acids on growth in vitro of pseudomonas aeruginsoa and enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == heat-stable antibacterial activity in the following suspensions was demonstrated  against pseudomonas aeruginosa at ph 6.5, 6.0, and 5.5: (i) pooled colon contents of normal mice; (ii) an anaerobic, 48-h culture of normal mouse feces; and (iii)  anaerobic, 48-h cultures of different bacteria from human colon flora (escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis). the lower the ph of the medium, the greater was the antibacterial activity of these suspensions. the antibacterial activity of five fatty acids (propionic, butyric, isobutyric, acetic, and formic acids) was greater against p. aeruginosa than against three enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p.  mirabilis) at all fatty acid concentrations (0.16 m to 0.005 m) and at the 3 ph values studied (5.5, 6.0, and 6.5). as the ph value increased, the antibacterial  activity decreased. antibacterial activity was greater at higher fatty acid concentrations, and at each ph value it was greatest for the fatty acids having high pk(a) values. lactic acid, with the lowest pk(a), exhibited little or no antibacterial activity. acetic and butyric acids, two of the three predominant volatile fatty acids determined by gas chromatography in the mouse colon contents and in the anaerobic culture of mouse feces, occurred in vivo in concentrations which inhibited growth of p. aeruginosa in vitro at the ph of the mouse cecum. these results suggest that undissociated short-chain fatty acids produced by the  colon flora may be a mechanism of intestinal resistance to colonization by p. aeruginosa.

TI  == experimental shigella infections in laboratory animals. i. antagonism by human normal flora components in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == germfree mice were associated with selected species of human intestinal bacteria  and then challenged with a streptomycin-resistant shigella flexneri strain. antagonism against shigella was most pronounced in mice associated with escherichia coli and least pronounced in mice associated with bacteroides fragilis. a moderate degree of antagonism could be demonstrated in mice associated with either streptococcus faecalis or bifidobacterium adolescentis. shigella persisted in the cecal contents of e. coli-associated mice at very low,  stable levels. shigella populations were reduced to levels below detection in the ceca of mice diassociated with e. coli and bacteroides. upon subsequent administration of streptomycin, bacteroides disappeared from the ceca. the e. coli population was greatly reduced, and shigella reappeared at very high population levels as an apparent recombinant which resembled e. coli biochemically. a streptomycin-resistant e. coli population subsequently emerged and became dominant in the ceca. shigella concomitantly declined to levels below  detection.
