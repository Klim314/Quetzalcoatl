TI  - The effect of hydro alcoholic extract of seven plants on cariogenic bacteria--an  in vitro evaluation.
AB  - AIM: To compare the antibacterial effect of hydro alcoholic extract of Salvia officinalis, Pimpinella anisum, Satureja hortensis, Rhus coriaria, Carum copticum, Mentha longifolia, Achillea millefolium against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Actinomyces viscosus through two in vitro methods. METHODS: In this experimental study, hydro-alcoholic extracts have been prepared from the shoot of Salvia officinalis, Satureja hortensis, Mentha longifolia and Achillea millefolium, the seed of Pimpinella anisum and Carum copticum and the fruit of Rhus coriaria with maceration method. Their antibacterial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Actinomyces viscosus have been evaluated with broth macrodilution and agar diffusion methods. RESULTS: In Broth macrodilution method MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) of Pimpinella anisum, Salvia officinalis, Mentha longifolia, Achillea millefolium, Satureja hortensis, Carum copticum and Rhus coriaria for Streptococcus mutans were respectively 12.5, 6.25, 12.5, 50, 50, 12.5 and 50 mug/ml, for Lactobacillus rhamnosus 12.5, 1.56, 3.12, 12.5, 6.25, 6.25 and 6.25 mug/ml and for Actinomyces viscosus 50, 12.5, 100, 50, 100, 25 and 25 mug/ml. In Agar diffusion method Pimpinella anisum, Salvia officinalis and Rhus coriaria against Streptococcus mutans, Pimpinella anisum, Carum copticum and Rhus coriaria against Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Mentha longifolia, Rhus coriaria and Carum copticum against Actinomyces viscosus had antibacterial effects. CONCLUSION: All seven extracts had growth inhibitory effects on all three bacteria. Salvia officinalis had the greatest inhibitory effect on growth of all three bacteria. All of the extracts except Carum copticum had bactericidal effect in the range of concentration. By agar diffusion method Rhus coriaria had antibacterial effect against all three cariogenic bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial profile of dentine caries and the impact of pH on bacterial population  diversity.
AB  - Dental caries is caused by the release of organic acids from fermentative bacteria, which results in the dissolution of hydroxyapatite matrices of enamel and dentine. While low environmental pH is proposed to cause a shift in the consortium of oral bacteria, favouring the development of caries, the impact of this variable has been overlooked in microbial population studies. This study aimed to detail the zonal composition of the microbiota associated with carious dentine lesions with reference to pH. We used 454 sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene (V3-V4 region) to compare microbial communities in layers ranging in pH from 4.5-7.8 from 25 teeth with advanced dentine caries. Pyrosequencing of the amplicons yielded 449,762 sequences. Nine phyla, 97 genera and 409 species were identified from the quality-filtered, de-noised and chimera-free sequences. Among the microbiota associated with dentinal caries, the most abundant taxa included Lactobacillus sp., Prevotella sp., Atopobium sp., Olsenella sp. and Actinomyces sp. We found a disparity between microbial communities localised at acidic versus neutral pH strata. Acidic conditions were associated with low diversity microbial populations, with Lactobacillus species including L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus and L. crispatus, being prominent. In comparison, the distinctive species of a more diverse flora associated with neutral pH regions of carious lesions included Alloprevotella tanerrae, Leptothrix sp., Sphingomonas sp. and Streptococcus anginosus. While certain bacteria were affected by the pH gradient, we also found that approximately 60% of the taxa associated with caries were present across the investigated pH range, representing a substantial core. We demonstrated that some bacterial species implicated in caries progression show selective clustering with respect to pH gradient, providing a basis for specific therapeutic strategies.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of silver diamine fluoride on multi-species cariogenic biofilm on caries.
AB  - BACKGROUNDS: Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) has clinical success in arresting dentin caries, this study aimed to investigate its mechanism of action. METHODS: Using a computer-controlled artificial mouth, we studied the effect of 38% SDF on cariogenic biofilms and dentin carious lesions. We used five common cariogenic bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Actinomyces naeslundii) to form a cariogenic biofilm that generated carious lesions with a depth of approximately 70 um on human dentin blocks. We applied 38% SDF to the lesions in the test group and water to those in the control group. The blocks were incubated in the artificial mouth for 21 days before evaluation. Microbial kinetics, architecture, viability and distribution were evaluated every 7 days using colony forming unit (CFU), scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The physical properties of the carious lesions were evaluated with microhardness testing, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR). RESULTS: The CFU results revealed fewer colony forming units in the test group compared with the control group (p < 0.01). Scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy showed less bacterial growth in the test group, and confluent cariogenic biofilm in the control group (p < 0.01). The microhardness and weight percentages of calcium and phosphorus in the test group from the outermost 50mum were higher than in the control group (p < 0.05). EDS showed that calcium and phosphous were higher in outer 50 mum in test groups than in the control FTIR revealed less exposed collagen I in the test lesions compared with the control group (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: 38% SDF inhibits multi-species cariogenic biofilm formation on dentin carious lesions and reduces the demineralization process.
TI  - Effects of chlorhexidine, listerine and fluoride listerine mouthrinses on four putative root-caries pathogens in the biofilm.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of chlorhexidine (CHX), Listerine and Fluoride Listerine on putative root-caries pathogens in the biofilm in the artificial mouth model. METHODS: A total of 24 human dentine discs were prepared. A biofilm composed of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Actinomyces naeslundii was cultured on the surfaces of human dentine discs in an artificial-mouth model. Sucrose was supplied by computer-controlled release on a daily basis to simulate the real-life situation. Three treatment reagents, CHX, Listerine and Fluoride Listerine, were supplied at a flow rate of 15 ml/h for 6 min twice a day. The dentine discs with biofilm were removed from the artificial mouth after being cultured for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 days. The bacteria in the biofilm were analysed by plating on BHIS agar and the colony-forming units of each species were counted. RESULTS: The total number of bacteria in the CHX group was significantly lower than in the other three groups (including control). There was no decline in the number of bacteria in the Listerine group. S. mutans was reduced significantly in the CHX group compared with the control group. The number and proportion of A. naeslundii in the CHX group were significantly lower than in the other three groups. The proportion of L. rhamnosus in the CHX group was significantly higher than in the other three groups. CONCLUSION: CHX has the most significant effect on inhibition of the putative root-caries bacteria, with the exception of L. rhamnosus. Both Listerine and a combination of fluoride and Listerine could not effectively reduce the numbers of bacteria in the biofilm. The effects of CHX, Listerine and Fluoride Listerine on root caries prevention need further investigation.
TI  - Effects of compounds found in Nidus Vespae on the growth and cariogenic virulence factors of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Nidus Vespae (honeycomb) is a kind of traditional Chinese medicine that has been  demonstrated to inhibit the growth and acid-production of oral cariogenic bacteria. Subsequent studies showed that the chloroform/methanol (Chl/MeOH) chemical extraction of Nidus Vespae was the most effective inhibitor of growth and acidogenicity of Streptococcus mutans. In this study, we isolated the chemical compounds of the Nidus Vespae Chl/MeOH extraction, tested their antimicrobial activity against six cariogenic bacteria and further evaluated the acid inhibition properties, anti-F-ATPase activity and anti-LDH activity against S. mutans. The isolated flavonoids, quercetin and kaempferol, inhibited the growth of bacteria (S. mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii and Lactobacillus rhamnosus) with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 1 to 4 mg/ml and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) from 4 to 16 mg/ml. In addition, quercetin and kaempferol at sub-MIC levels significantly inhibited acidogenicity and acidurity of S. mutans cells. Treated with the test agents, the F-ATPase activity was reduced by 47.37% with 1mg/ml quercetin and by 49.66% with 0.5mg/ml kaempferol. The results showed that quercetin and kaempferol contained in Chl/MeOH extraction presented remarkably biological activity, suggesting that Nidus Vespae might be useful as a potential preventive and therapeutic agent in dental caries.
TI  - [Establishment and evaluation of the in vitro dynamic biofilm model].
AB  - PURPOSE: To establish a dynamic model which could simulate the ecologic environment of oral cavity and study the cariogenicity of oral biofilm, continuously observe the formation of oral biofilm. METHODS: The fermental vessel and chemostat were designed according to the purpose of the study. Four strains of oral bacteria, namely Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Actinomyces naeslundii, were inoculated in the fermenter. The hydroxyapatite (HA) discs and glass slides were put in the chemostat. The temperature, oxide pressure, pH, dilution rate, circulation rate and substrate of the chemostat were carefully modulated. Distilled water and 25mM sucrose solution were used to test the stability of the system. At the beginning of the model establishment, the anabiosis bacteria were inoculated in fermenter full of fresh artificial saliva with a dilution rate of 10%. After the growth of bacteria in the fermenter was stable, the four-organism bacterial consortium was inoculated in the chemotat for 24 hours together with fresh artificial saliva (v/v=1:9). The organisms in planktonic phase were examined everyday. When the populations of consortium got stable(about 72 hours), the test solution was pulsed in the chemostat every 12 hours for 5 days. The HA discs and glass slides were observed every 24 hours for five times. The data was analyzed using SPSS 10.0 software package. Dunnet t test was used to compare the difference between the two groups at the level of alpha=0.05. RESULTS: The dynamic model was successfully established on oral biofilm study. With the pulse of sucrose solution, the environment in the chemostat simulated the cariogenic environment in nature, and all data namely the bacteria population, the biofilm microstructure changed with solution pulse. CONCLSUIONS: The model established is proved to be stable and the parameters in the model could be successfully controlled. The model fulfills the dynamic observation of formation of biofilm and caries lesion in vitro.
TI  - Effect of various rinsing protocols after use of amine fluoride/stannous fluoride toothpaste on the bacterial composition of dental plaque.
AB  - This clinical study evaluated the effect of different oral hygiene protocols on the bacterial composition of dental plaque. After a 2-week period of using fluoride-free toothpaste, 30 participants followed three 1-week experimental protocols, each followed by 2-week fluoride-free washout periods in a randomized crossover examiner-blind controlled trial. The 1-week experimental protocols comprised the use of AmF/SnF(2) toothpaste twice daily, after which participants either (1) rinsed with tap water, (2) did not rinse but only spat out the toothpaste, or (3) rinsed with an AmF/SnF(2) mouthwash. In the fluoride-free washout periods, the participants brushed their teeth with fluoride-free toothpaste without further instructions. Six hours after the last brushing (+/- rinsing) of each period, buccal plaque samples in the upper molar region were taken. The microbiota composition of the plaque samples was analyzed by checkerboard DNA:DNA hybridization. A statistically significant reduction was found in the total amount of DNA of the 39 major plaque species measured, and in the proportions of some acid-producing bacterial strains after the period having used the AmF/SnF(2) toothpaste + AmF/SnF(2) mouthrinsing. The results indicate that using the AmF/SnF(2) toothpaste and rinse combination could result in plaque of lower cariogenicity.
TI  - Effect of xylitol on an in vitro model of oral biofilm.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to examine whether xylitol, at different concentrations, inhibits the formation of an experimental model of oral biofilm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biofilms of six bacterial species (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Actinomyces viscosus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum) were prepared on hydroxyapatite (HA) discs according to the Zurich Biofilm Model. Xylitol was tested at two concentrations, 1% and 3%. At the end of their designated incubation times, some HA discs were destined for confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and the others were harvested using a sterile surgical instrument. Aliquots of harvested biofilms were diluted and plated onto specific media. After a 48-h anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C, the colony-forming units (CFUs) were counted. RESULTS: CLSM images showed that only a small amount of isolated bacteria was observed on the surface of HA discs. Culture of harvested biofilms showed an inhibition in the growth of different species included in the biofilms. CONCLUSIONS: Xylitol has a clear inhibitory effect on the formation of the experimental biofilms. This study shows that xylitol is not only efficient in inhibiting the acid production of cariogenic bacteria, but also in preventing the formation of a multispecies biofilm; it confirms the relevance of the use of this polyol for the prevention of oral diseases caused by dental plaque.
TI  - Microarray analysis of the microflora of root caries in elderly.
AB  - The present study used a new 16S rRNA-based microarray with probes for over 300 bacterial species to better define the bacterial profiles of healthy root surfaces and root caries (RC) in the elderly. Supragingival plaque was collected from 20 healthy subjects (Controls) and from healthy and carious roots and carious dentin from 21 RC subjects (Patients). Collectively, 179 bacterial species and species groups were detected. A higher bacterial diversity was observed in Controls than in Patients. Lactobacillus casei/paracasei/rhamnosus and Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus were notably associated with most RC samples. Streptococcus mutans was detected more frequently in the infected dentin than in the other samples, but the difference was not significant. Actinomyces was found more frequently in Controls. Thus, species other than Actinomyces and S. mutans may play a role as pathogens of RC. The results from this study were in general agreement with those of our previous study based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
TI  - Anticaries effect of compounds extracted from Galla chinensis in a multispecies biofilm model.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Galla Chinensis is a leaf gall known to have some antibacterial effects. Using an in vitro biofilm model of dental plaque, the present study aimed to evaluate the anticaries effects of Galla Chinensis and its chemical fractions. METHODS: A four-organism bacterial consortium (Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus rhamnosus) was grown on hydroxyapatite (HA) discs, bovine enamel blocks, and glass surfaces in a continuous culture system and exposed to repeated solution pulses. Galla Chinensis extracts, sucrose solutions, and sodium fluoride solutions were pulsed into different flow cells. The pH value of the planktonic phase in each flow cell was recorded and the bacteria colonizing the biofilm on the HA discs were counted. Enamel blocks were observed using a polarized microscope and lesion depth was evaluated. The biofilm morphology was examined with a fluorescence microscope and the images captured were analyzed on an image analysis system. RESULTS: When Galla Chinensis extract, its chemical fraction, or fluoride was added to the sucrose solution, the planktonic phase pH remained higher than that in the sucrose alone. A lower level of colonization on the HA surface was also observed in the groups to which Galla Chinensis and fluoride were added compared with the control sucrose group, and this was reflected in both the total viable count and the biofilm imaging, which showed fewer cariogenic bacteria and a less compact biofilm, respectively. Enamel demineralization in both the fluoride group and the Galla Chinensis group was significantly less than that in the sucrose group. CONCLUSIONS: Galla Chinensis and fluoride may inhibit the cariogenicity of the oral biofilm. Galla Chinensis appears to be a promising source of new agents that may prevent dental caries.
TI  - [Effects of the active compounds of M. officinalis on cariogenic bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of the principal biologically active compounds of M. officinalis on the growth and acid generation of the main cariogenic bacteria. METHODS: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus were chosen as the experimental bacteria. The active compounds (Magnolol and Honokiol) were separated from M. officinalis and then the effects of the two agents on the growth and acid generation of the bacteria were assessed. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of the test strains were determined by MBEC-Device. RESULTS: It was found that the growth of not only plantonic bacteria but also the biofilm were efficiently inhibited by Magnolol and Honokiol. The two agents could also inhibit the acid production of the test strains. CONCLUSION: M. officinalis may be an effective anti-caries agent, and further researches will be necessary to define its usefulness in this aspect.
TI  - Protection offered by root-surface restorative materials against biofilm challenge.
AB  - The prevalence of root-surface caries is increasing. We hypothesized that some restorative materials are protective against cariogenic challenge on root surfaces. Our goal was to study the effects of different restorative materials on root surfaces incubated with an oral biofilm generated in an artificial mouth. A biofilm of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Actinomyces naeslundii was co-cultured for 21 days on 24 glass-ionomer cement, resin-modified glass-ionomer cement, or resin-composite-restored root surfaces. These surfaces were then examined with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron energy-dispersive spectroscopy. Only glass-ionomer restorations showed a significant increase in log calcium-to-phosphorus ratio (P < 0.01), and a significantly lower log amide I-to-hydrogen phosphate ratio on the root surface after incubation in the artificial mouth. Glass-ionomer restoratives conferred a preventive effect on the root surfaces against initial cariogenic challenge with a mixed-species oral biofilm without therapeutic intervention.
TI  - [Study of susceptibility of oral bacteria biofilm to traditional Chinese drug preventing caries].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Using MBEC-Assay to assay minimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of Galla Chinensis and Nidus Vespae to oral bacterial biofilm. To set up traditional Chinese medicine susceptibility pharmacodynamic empirical study methods of oral bacterial biofilm. METHODS: Cariogenic bacteria strains were selected (Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556, Lactobacillus rhamnosus AC 413, Actinomyces naeslundii WVU 627) in this study. Extraction components of Galla Chinensis were GCE (aqueous extract), GCE-B (30% alcohol extract) and extraction components of Nidus Vespae were NVE1 (95% alcohol extract). (1) To observe oral bacterial biofilm formatiom in MBEC-Device at different time. (2) MBEC-HTP-Assay: The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of GCE, GCE-B and NVE1 to oral bacteria strains were determined. RESULTS: Oral bacterial biofilm were readily formed on the lid of MBEC-Device under selected condition (observed by SEM). Oral cariogenic bacteria growing as plankton populations were sensitive to GCE, GCE-B and NVE1. To GCE, GCE-B and NVE1, oral cariogenic bacterial biofilm were 2-16 times less susceptible than growing plankton bacteria. GCE and GCE-B were the most effective medicine against oral cariogenic bacterial biofilm. NVE1 were effective in killing oral-bacterial biofilm at relatively high concentration. CONCLUSION: GCE and GCE-B were effective medicine against oral cariogenic bacterial biofilm. MBEC (minimal biofilm eradication concentration) can provide a relative accurate medicine concentration for clinical test.
TI  - Probiotic properties of vaginal lactic acid bacteria to prevent metritis in cattle.
AB  - AIMS: The isolation of bovine vaginal lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and the screening of their beneficial properties to select those that could be used as probiotics in the prevention of bovine metritis were performed. METHODS AND RESULTS: Out of 76 Lactobacillus sp. and seven Streptococcus sp. strains, a small number showed high- and medium hydrophobicity when the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons method (MATH) was applied. In the agar plate diffusion test, a large number of strains inhibited vaginal bovine Escherichia coli 99/14 and human E. coli. This inhibition was due to acid. Only a few strains inhibited Actinomyces pyogenes 96/393, a pathogen isolated from bovine metritis. This inhibition remained after neutralization. The taxonomic identification of the selected strains was carried out by an amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). Most of the strains were identified as Lactobacillus fermentum, a few as Lactobacillus gasseri and one as Lactobacillus rhamnosus. CONCLUSIONS: Bovine vaginal lactobacilli strains have differential surface properties. The strains selected are capable of inhibiting specific metritis pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our results can be applied for future studies to design a probiotic product to prevent metritis in dairy postpartum cows.
TI  - The ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence.
AB  - Some novel caries detection and excavation devices rely on the ability of bacteria to produce red fluorescing compounds. The aim of this study was to examine the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence. Streptococcus mutans, S. oralis, S. salivarius, S. sobrinus, Lactobacillus fermentans, L. casei, L. rhamnosus, Actinomyces naeslundi, A. israelii, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were inoculated onto Columbia agar with haemin and vitamin K and incubated anaerobically for up to 7 days in the dark. The resulting bacterial colonies were excited using filtered xenon light (405 +/- 20 nm) and digitally photographed through a 530-nm high-pass filter. The red and green portions of the colony fluorescence were analyzed using a computer program and the red/green ratio was calculated. All colonies emitted both red and green fluorescence. The green outweighed the red portion for the following species (in descending order) S. oralis, S. salivarius, S. mutans, F. nucleatum and S. sobrinus. The red portion was higher for the following species (in descending order) P. intermedia, A. naeslundi, A. israelii, L. fermentans, L. rhamnosus and L. casei. With all the bacteria examined, one color portion generally outweighed the other, giving the visual impression of either red or green fluorescence. We conclude that red fluorescence is well suited to detection of the bacteria which cause dentin caries but it is not suitable as an indicator of the presence and activity of the streptococci involved in initial caries.
TI  - [The effect of galla chinensis on the growth of cariogenic bacteria in vitro].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purples of this study was to investigate the role of different components of Galla Chinensis extract on the growth of 6 kinds of cariogenic bacteria, and to find out the most effective components of Galla Chinensis extract. METHODS: Four different components (GCE1, GCE2, GCE3 and GCE4) were separated from Galla Chinensis and there antibacterial activities to Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556, Streptococcus salivarius SS 196, Actinomyces naeslundii WVU 627, Actinomyces viscosus ATCC 19246 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus AC 413 were checked. There effects on the growth curve of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 were also investigated. RESULTS: The most effective part of Galla Chinensis was found to be GCE2 and GCE4, which were found to be a mixture of polyphenol-rich fractions. All of the different components had an inhibitory effect to the growth of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175. CONCLUSION: All of the 4 different components of Galla Chinensis extract could inhibit the growth of the tested bacteria. These results suggest that the antibacterial activity of Galla Chinensis extract is caused by a synergistic effect of monomeric polyphenols, which can easily bind to proteins.
TI  - Biofilm growth of Lactobacillus species is promoted by Actinomyces species and Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The ability of oral bacteria to integrate within a biofilm is pivotal to their survival. A dependence on the amount of biofilm growth by noncoaggregating Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus plantarum on coculture with Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces gerencseriae, Streptococcus mutans and Veillonella parvula was investigated using an artificial-mouth culture system. Biofilm formation by the lactobacilli in mono-culture was poor. In coculture with Actinomyces species the amount of L. rhamnosus increased 7-20 times and L. plantarum 4-7 times compared to its mono-culture biofilm. S. mutans also promoted substantial biofilm growth of lactobacilli but V. parvula had no effect. We conclude that these Actinomyces species promoted growth of key Lactobacillus species in a biofilm, as did S. mutans to a smaller extent, and that the ability of individual bacteria to form mono-culture biofilms is not necessarily an indicator of their survival and pathogenic potential in a complex multispecies biofilm community.
TI  - Suppression of caries-related microorganisms in dentine lesions after short-term  chlorhexidine or antibiotic treatment.
AB  - This study investigated the efficiency of a chlorhexidine varnish and an antibiotic paste in suppressing the cultivable microflora of deep dentine cavities in a stepwise excavation procedure. Subsequent to enamel preparation and removal of the central biomass, infected dentine was sampled from the cavity floor. Ten cavities each were either covered with the 1% chlorhexidine- and 1% thymol-containing varnish Cervitec (CE), the demeclocycline hydrocortisone-containing ointment Ledermix (LE) or received no treatment as control (CO). A compomer composite was used as intermediate restorative. Cavities were reassessed after 6 weeks and again dentine samples were microbiologically investigated for total viable counts, mutans streptococci and lactobacilli. After 6 weeks a significant reduction of the total viable counts was observed in the LE group (p = 0.011) compared to the control, whereas no differences were found in the CE group (p > 0.05). Mutans streptococci were rarely recovered at baseline and after 6 weeks. Compared to the CO group counts of lactobacilli were significantly reduced in the CE and LE groups (p < 0.05). Lactobacillus species were frequently recovered at baseline and after 6 weeks of observation. Lactobacillus rhamnosus was the predominant species in all samples investigated. Application of CE or LE resulted in reduced counts of lactobacilli after a period of 6 weeks. Although none of the materials completely eliminated the viable microorganisms, the use of LE was more effective than CE in reducing the total anaerobic microorganisms associated with carious dentine.
TI  - Selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. METHODS: A gradient plate technique was used to expose Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Neisseria subflava, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations of triclosan. Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 was included as an organism showing the triclosan resistance development trait. MIC values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. RESULTS: N. subflava, Pr. nigrescens Po. gingivalis and E. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (MIC range 0.1-3.9 mg/L), whereas the lactobacillus and S. mutans were less susceptible (MIC range 15.6-20.8 mg/L). Triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (P < 0.01) for the positive control E. coli, although its MICs towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. Minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (MIC) occurred for Pr. nigrescens and in S. sanguis and S. oralis (MBC). Mean changes in susceptibilities (MIC and MBC) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine MBCs for S. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. CONCLUSIONS: These data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for E. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. Other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than FabI that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.
TI  - Susceptibility of oral bacteria to Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil in vitro.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil against 161 isolates of oral bacteria from 15 genera was determined. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) ranged from 0.003 to 2.0% (v/v). MIC90 values were 1.0% (v/v) for Actinomyces spp., Lactobacillus spp., Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis, and 0.1% (v/v) for Prevotella spp. Isolates of Porphyromonas, Prevotella and Veillonella had the lowest MICs and MBCs, and isolates of Streptococcus, Fusobacterium and Lactobacillus had the highest. Time kill studies with Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus rhamnosus showed that treatment with > or = 0.5% tea tree oil caused decreases in viability of >3 log colony forming units/ml after only 30 s, and viable organisms were not detected after 5 min. These studies indicate that a range of oral bacteria are susceptible to tea tree oil, suggesting that tea tree oil may be of use in oral healthcare products and in the maintenance of oral hygiene.
TI  - Effects of a chlorhexidine gluconate-containing mouthwash on the vitality and antimicrobial susceptibility of in vitro oral bacterial ecosystems.
AB  - Oral bacterial microcosms, established using saliva inocula from three individuals, were maintained under a feast-famine regime within constant-depth film fermenters. Steady-state communities were exposed four times daily, postfeeding, to a chlorhexidine (CHX) gluconate-containing mouthwash (CHXM) diluted to 0.06% (wt/vol) antimicrobial content. The microcosms were characterized by heterotrophic plate counts and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). CHXM caused significant decreases in both total anaerobe and total aerobe/facultative anaerobe counts (P < 0.05), together with lesser decreases in gram-negative anaerobes. The degree of streptococcal and actinomycete inhibition varied considerably among individuals. DGGE showed that CHXM exposure caused considerable decreases in microbial diversity, including marked reductions in Prevotella sp. and Selenomonas infelix. Pure-culture studies of 10 oral bacteria (eight genera) showed that Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella dispar, Prevotella nigrescens, and the streptococci were highly susceptible to CHX, while Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Neisseria subflava were the least susceptible. Determination of the MICs of triclosan, CHX, erythromycin, penicillin V, vancomycin, and metronidazole for microcosm isolates, before and after 5 days of CHXM exposure, showed that CHXM exposure altered the distribution of isolates toward those that were less susceptible to CHX (P < 0.05). Changes in susceptibility distributions for the other test agents were not statistically significant. In conclusion, population changes in plaque microcosms following repeated exposure to CHXM represented an inhibition of the most susceptible flora with a clonal expansion of less susceptible species.
TI  - Growth and molecular characterization of dental plaque microcosms.
AB  - AIMS: (i) To compare the effects of feeding protocols upon the composition and stability of dental plaque microcosms formed in constant-depth film fermenters (CDFF). (ii) To evaluate the utility of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and culture methodologies for the investigation of such models. METHODS AND RESULTS: Microcosms were established anaerobically in the CDFFs from freshly collected saliva. These were fed either with artificial saliva alone (famine) or combined with discontinuous feeding (feast-famine). Culture and 16s rDNA sequencing indicated that supplemental feeding gave ca. 2 log increases in Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Prevotella buccae. Feast-famine microcosms were then further characterized by DGGE using primers specific for the V2-V3 region of eubacterial rDNA. These gave single major bands with pure cultures (eight species) and resolved all strains apart from Lact. rhamnosus and Actinomyces naeslundii. Whilst culture with selective media indicated a degree of stability and reproducibility between replicate microcosms, DGGE showed a considerable degree of variability that related to several putatively uncultured bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Feast-famine regimes altered community composition. DGGE analyses identified putatively unculturable species and demonstrated variability between replicate fermenters. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study demonstrates the utility of DGGE for the analysis of dental plaque, especially with respect to unculturable bacteria. Results question the assumptions of reproducibility of plaque microcosms established in non-replicated CDFFs made on the basis of selective media. Feeding regimes, particularly those involving complex nutrients, will dramatically affect population dynamics.
TI  - The predominant microflora of nursing caries lesions.
AB  - The predominant microflora recovered from infected dentine of 52 carious teeth from 14 children with nursing caries was determined using both selective and non-selective media for the isolation of specific genera and acidified media (pH 5.2) to isolate the predominant aciduric microorganisms, and compared with the microflora of sound enamel surfaces in caries-free children. Streptococcus mutans formed a significantly greater proportion of the lesion flora while Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus gordonii formed a significantly greater proportion of the plaque flora from sound tooth surfaces. The proportions of Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces odontolyticus were significantly greater in the plaque samples than in the lesion samples. Actinomyces israelii formed 18.2% of the flora from the lesions, but was not isolated from the plaque samples. The proportions of Candida albicans, Lactobacillus spp. and Veillonella spp. were also significantly greater in the carious dentine than in the plaque samples. The most frequently isolated lactobacilli were Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The predominant aciduric flora was S. oralis, S. mutans and A. israelii and these taxa were also isolated from a similar proportion of the lesions at pH 7.0. Strains of S. mutans, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. rhamnosus isolated from individual carious teeth were genotyped using PCR-based methods. Each species was genotypically heterogeneous and different genotypes were recovered from different carious teeth in the same child. These data indicate that the microflora of lesions in the same child is microbiologically diverse and support a non-specific aetiology for nursing caries in which the physiological characteristics of the infecting flora, not its composition, is the major determinant underlying the disease process.
TI  - Changes in the cultivable flora in deep carious lesions following a stepwise excavation procedure.
AB  - This study examined the cultivable microflora before and after stepwise excavation procedures in deep carious lesions in 9 permanent teeth, categorized according to degrees of proximal surface destruction. The final excavation was performed 4-6 months after the initial treatment, which included peripheral dentine excavation and removal of the central cariogenic biomass and the superficial necrotic dentine. Dentine colour and consistency were assessed by means of standardized scales before the application of a Ca(OH)(2) compound and temporary sealing. Reassessments were performed before and after the final excavation. Microbiological samples of the central demineralized dentine were obtained with a sterile bur before and after the first excavation, as well as before and after the final excavation. After anaerobic cultivation on enriched non-selective tryptic soy agar, 30 colonies from a representative area were identified by standardized biochemical and physiological tests. Before temporary restoration, a yellowish and light brown demineralized soft dentine was typically observed, and gram-positive rods accounted for 70% and lactobacilli for 50% of the total colony-forming units. Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus and Actinomyces naeslundii dominated the lactobacilli and the other gram-positive rods, respectively. Gram-negative rods were the next most frequent isolates, followed by streptococci, each group accounting for about 20% of the colony-forming units in positive samples. Before the final excavation, which did not cause exposure of the pulp in any of the cases, the retained demineralized dentine had changed into a darker and harder tissue, and the total colony-forming units, as well as the frequency and proportions of lactobacilli were substantially reduced. Gram-negative rods also declined, and the flora was dominated by A. naeslundii and various streptococci. In conclusion, the cultivable flora detected following the treatment interval had declined substantially, and the distribution of bacterial species did not represent a typical cariogenic microbiota of deep lesions, confirming the clinical findings of arrested caries progression.
TI  - Development of multi-species consortia biofilms of oral bacteria as an enamel and root caries model system.
AB  - The aim was to establish defined-species consortium plaque biofilms to investigate enamel and root caries in an artificial mouth. Strains of the putative enamel and root caries pathogens, Streptococcus mutans, Strep. sobrinus, Actinomyces naeslundii and Lactobacillus rhamnosus, were screened in batch culture for potential cariogenic properties: a low terminal pH, ability to aggregate, and catabolic diversity. The strains selected were grown as monoculture biofilms and as consortium plaque biofilms in a multiplaque artificial mouth. The biofilms were supplied with a constant flow of a simulated oral fluid and were given periodic sucrose (and in some instances glucose) to simulate meals. All the bacteria except L. rhamnosus formed large, monospecies biofilms with resting pH in the range 5.3-5.8. The consortia biofilms were larger and had a resting pH of 4.9-5.3. The consortia biofilms supplied with 8-hourly carbohydrate comprised mainly 'mutans' streptococci (58, SD 5.5%) and L. rhamnosus (42, SD 5.7%). A. naeslundii characteristically was absent or present in a low percentage (up to 4% colony-forming units). All biofilms demineralized polished bovine enamel and dentine blocks, as assessed by microradiography and enamel-surface microhardness measurement. The consortia also demineralized intact enamel and tooth roots; they were more cariogenic to enamel than any of the monoculture biofilms, as measured by enamel-surface softening, but variation in lesion depth was proportional to biofilm wet weight irrespective of acidogen composition (r = 0.93, p < 0.05). Enamel lesions had a well-mineralized intact surface and a zone of subsurface demineralization, typical of early natural lesions. Dentine and root lesions showed extensive demineralization but lacked a pronounced surface mineralized zone. Substitution of glucose for sucrose had no effect on the cariogenicity of the consortium to bovine enamel or human roots and had no major effect on the plaque composition. Continuously supplied fluoride (19 parts/10(6)) resulted in a substantially reduced enamel surface softening and subsurface demineralization of intact roots. It was concluded that consortia biofilms of selected caries pathogens generate realistic caries lesions in all tooth hard tissues under controlled growth conditions in the artificial mouth. This in vitro caries experimental model may prove useful for the study of interrelations between the plaque biofilm, tooth tissues and the oral environment, and for the development of procedures to modify the course of caries development.
TI  - Insertional inactivation of genes responsible for the D-alanylation of lipoteichoic acid in Streptococcus gordonii DL1 (Challis) affects intrageneric coaggregations.
AB  - Most human oral viridans streptococci participate in intrageneric coaggregations, the cell-to-cell adherence among genetically distinct streptococci. Two genes relevant to these intrageneric coaggregations were identified by transposon Tn916 mutagenesis of Streptococcus gordonii DL1 (Challis). A 626-bp sequence flanking the left end of the transposon was homologous to dltA and dltB of Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 7469 (formerly called Lactobacillus casei). A 60-kb probe based on this flanking sequence was used to identify the homologous DNA in a fosmid library of S. gordonii DL1. This DNA encoded D-alanine-D-alanyl carrier protein ligase that was expressed in Escherichia coli from the fosmid clone. The cloned streptococcal dltA was disrupted by inserting an ermAM cassette, and then it was linearized and transformed into S. gordonii DL1 for allelic replacement. Erythromycin-resistant transformants containing a single insertion in dltA exhibited a loss of D-alanyl esters in lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and a loss of intrageneric coaggregation. This phenotype was correlated with the loss of a 100-kDa surface protein reported previously to be involved in mediating intrageneric coaggregation (C. J. Whittaker, D. L. Clemans, and P. E. Kolenbrander, Infect. Immun. 64:4137-4142, 1996). The mutants retained the parental ability to participate in intergeneric coaggregation with human oral actinomyces, indicating the specificity of the mutation in altering intrageneric coaggregations. The mutants were altered morphologically and exhibited aberrant cell septa in a variety of pleomorphs. The natural DNA transformation frequency was reduced 10-fold in these mutants. Southern analysis of chromosomal DNAs from various streptococcal species with the dltA probe revealed the presence of this gene in most viridans streptococci. Thus, it is hypothesized that D-alanyl LTA may provide binding sites for the putative 100-kDa adhesin and scaffolding for the proper presentation of this adhesin to mediate intrageneric coaggregation.
TI  - Study of root caries in an artificial mouth.
AB  - The object of this project was to develop a laboratory model system to study root and enamel caries. Model plaque biofilms containing consortia of four (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus) or six (S mutans, S sobrinus, S mitis, A naeslundii, L rhamnosus, and Veillonella dispar) species of caries pathogens were developed in a artificial mouth. Caries lesions similar to those found in vivo were produced on enamel and dentine blocks and in intact root tissues by these consortia more effectively than biofilms of the individual species. Fluoride supplied at 5 ppm suppressed enamel caries effectively, less so dentinal lesion formation, but much more so than F incorporated into the mineralised surface of enamel and roots. This is the first direct comparison of the effect on caries of environmental F and tooth mineral F induced by a plaque-like bacterial biofilm.
TI  - Inhibition of purified enolases from oral bacteria by fluoride.
AB  - Enolase activity in strains of oral streptococci previously has been found to be  inhibited by 50% (Ki) by fluoride concentrations ranging from 50 to 300 microM or more in the presence of 0.5 to 1.0 mM inorganic phosphate ions. In this study, enolase was extracted and partly purified by a two-step process from five oral bacterial species and the effect of fluoride on the kinetics of enolase examined. The molecular weight of the putative enolase proteins was 46-48 kDa. The Vmax values ranged from 20 to 323 IU/mg and K(m) for glycerate-2-phosphate from 0.22 to 0.74 mM. Enolase activity was inhibited competitively by fluoride, with Ki values ranging from 16 to 54 microM in the presence of 5 mM inorganic phosphate ions. Ki values for phosphate ranged from 2 to 8 mM. The enolase from Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556 was more sensitive to fluoride (Ki = 16 +/- 2) than was enolase from Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 10575 (Ki = 19 +/- 2) or Streptococcus mutans NCTC 10449 (Ki = 40 +/- 4) and all three streptococcal strains were more sensitive to fluoride than either Actinomyces naeslundii WVU 627 (Ki = 46 +/- 6) or Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 7469 (Ki = 54 +/- 6) enolases. The levels of fluoride found to inhibit the streptococcal enolases in this study are much lower than previously reported and are likely to be present in plaque, especially during acidogenesis, and could exert an anti-glycolytic effect.
TI  - Lipoquinones of some spore-forming rods, lactic-acid bacteria and actinomycetes.
AB  - The respiratory quinones of 73 strains of Gram-positive bacteria including spore-forming rods, lactic-acid bacteria and actinomyctes were examined. Menaquinones with seven isoprenoid units (MK-7) were the main quinone type found in representatives of the genus Bacillus and in Sporolactobacillus inulinus. However, a strain of B. thuringiensis produced MK-8 in addition to MK-7, and strains of B. lentus and B. pantothenticus appeared to produce MK-9 and MK-8, respectively, with no MK-7. In the clostridia and lactic-acid bacteria, no quinones were found, except in Pediococcus cerevisiae NCTC 8066 and Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus ATCC 7469, which contained menaquinones, and Streptococcus faecalis NCTC 775 and HIM 478-1, which contained demethylmenaquinones, in relatively low concentrations. Menaquinones were also found in the actinomycetes (except Actinomyces odontolyticus and Bifidobacterium bifidum which did not produce any quinones) and in Protaminobacter alboflavus ATCC 8458, the so-called Actinobacillus actinoides ATCC 15900 and Noguchia granulosis NCTC 10559.
