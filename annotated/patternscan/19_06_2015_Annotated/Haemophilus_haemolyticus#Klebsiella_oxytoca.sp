TI  == clinical results of a multicenter study with sulbactam/ampicillin for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory and urinary tract infections.
AB  == a total of 124 patients with lower respiratory tract (44) or urinary tract infections (80) were enrolled in an open, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sulbactam/ampicillin, administered at the dosage of  3 g/die by intramuscular route. pretreatment pathogens from patients with lower respiratory tract infections included: streptococcus alpha-haemolyticus in 8 cases, streptococcus beta-haemolyticus in 2 cases, staphylococcus albus in 7 cases, haemophilus influenzae in 7 cases, staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, klebsiella oxytoca in 5 cases, staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 cases, streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 cases, escherichia coli in 2 cases; in one subject  (2.75%), no microorganisms were isolated. in vitro, 36 isolates (84%) were sensitive to sa and 7 (16%) were resistant. at the end of therapy, all the causative pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated. in patients with urinary tract infections, pretreatment pathogens were: e. coli in 40 cases, s. albus in 16 cases, proteus mirabilis in 8 cases, enterobacter agglomerans in 6 cases, proteus vulgaris in 3 cases, streptococcus faecalis in 3  cases, streptococcus liquefaciens in 2 cases, pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 cases.  in vitro, 64 isolates (80%) were sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 (20%) were resistant. at the end of therapy, 63 out of the 64 pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated; in one case the therapy was interrupted due to adverse effect. clinical efficacy: in subjects with lower respiratory tract infections, sulbactam/ampicillin cured 32 patients (72.72%) and ameliorated the clinical status of 8 patients (18.18%); efficacy rate: 90.9%).(abstract truncated at 250 words)
