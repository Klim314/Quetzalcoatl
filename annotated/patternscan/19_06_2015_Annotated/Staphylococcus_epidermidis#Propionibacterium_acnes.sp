TI  == the culturome of the human nose habitats reveals individual bacterial fingerprint patterns.
AB  == the complex anatomy of the human nose might offer distinct microbial niches. microbiota composition may affect nose inflammatory diseases and staphylococcus aureus carriage. considering different nasal cavity locations, microbial colonization was analysed across individuals exhibiting chronic nasal inflammatory diseases (n = 18) and those without local inflammation signs (n = 16). samples were collected systematically during surgery and examined by an extensive culture-based approach and, for a subset, by 16s rrna gene community profiling. cultivation yielded 141 taxa with members of staphylococcus, corynebacterium and propionibacterium as most common isolates comprising the nasal core culturome together with finegoldia magna. staphylococcus aureus was most frequently found in association with staphylococcus epidermidis and propionibacterium acnes, and the posterior vestibules were redefined as s. aureus' principle habitat. culturome analysis revealed host-specific bacterial 'fingerprints' irrespective of host-driven factors or intranasal sites. comparisons between cultivable and molecular fingerprints demonstrated that only  a small fraction of phylotypes (6.2%) was correlated. while the total number of different phylotypes was higher in the molecular dataset, the total number of identifications down to the species level was higher in the culturomic approach.  to determine host-specific microbiomes, the advantages of molecular approaches should be combined with the resolution and reliability of species identification  by culturomic analyses.

TI  == the microbial epidemiology of breast implant infections in a regional referral centre for plastic and reconstructive surgery in the south of france.
AB  == background: breast implant infections are usually caused by staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. gram-negative bacilli are rarely reported to be involved in breast implant infections. methods: thirty-seven cases of microbiologically confirmed breast implant infection managed from january 2008 to june 2012 in the study centre were reviewed, including 10 cases from the study centre itself and 27 cases from private clinics in the region. results: the prevalence of breast implant infection in the study centre was 0.74% of breast implantation, i.e., 3.23% in breast reconstruction for breast cancer and 0.27% in aesthetic breast augmentation (p=0.0002). of the 37 cases, 30% had undergone radiotherapy and 11% had undergone a lymph node dissection. s. aureus was identified in 18 cases, gram-negative bacilli in 10 cases, coagulase-negative staphylococci in eight cases, anaerobic bacteria in eight cases, and streptococci in three cases. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the second most commonly identified pathogen. staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequent coagulase-negative staphylococcus species. in addition to propionibacterium acnes and actinomyces neuii, other facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria have not been reported before, e.g., bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, corynebacterium simulans, dermabacter hominis, finegoldia magna, and peptoniphilus harei. seventy-percent of cases were treated by immediate implant removal. all cases treated only with antibiotics were treated with surgery at the second visit. conclusions: the microbiological epidemiology was noted by an increasing the proportion of gram-negative bacteria  and anaerobic bacteria detected with the advent of maldi-tof ms and molecular identification for diagnosis.

TI  == synthesis and characterization of nanosilver with antibacterial properties using  pinus densiflora young cone extract.
AB  == this study describes an eco-friendly, rapid method for green synthesis of silver  nanoparticles (ag nps) from an aqueous solution of silver nitrate using pinus densiflora for. multicaulis uyeki young cone extract in a single-pot process. color changes, ultraviolet-visible spectra (444.5 nm), x-ray diffraction peaks (2theta=39.68, 46.92, 68.12, and 79.10), and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ft-ir) confirmed the presence of ag nps and phytochemicals. transmission electron microscopy showed that the nanoparticles were mostly oval in shape, with a few triangular-shaped particles. average particle size was 30-80 nm. phytochemicals present in the young pine cone extract were likely responsible for the reduction of ag(+) ions. the synthesized ag nps (40 mug) had a 7 mm larger zone of inhibition against the skin pathogen brevibacterium linens than commercial ag nps, propionibacterium acnes (14 mm), bacillus cereus (9 mm) and staphylococcus epidermidis (10mm).

TI  == viable bacteria associated with red blood cells and plasma in freshly drawn blood donations.
AB  == objectives: infection remains a leading cause of post-transfusion mortality and morbidity. bacterial contamination is, however, detected in less than 0.1% of blood units tested. the aim of the study was to identify viable bacteria in standard blood-pack units, with particular focus on bacteria from the oral cavity, and to determine the distribution of bacteria revealed in plasma and in the red blood cell (rbc)-fraction. design: cross-sectional study. blood were separated into plasma and rbc-suspensions, which were incubated anaerobically or  aerobically for 7 days on trypticase soy blood agar (tsa) or blue lactose plates. for identification colony pcr was performed using primers targeting 16s rdna. setting: blood donors attending capital region blood bank, copenhagen university  hospital, rigshospitalet, hvidovre, denmark, october 29th to december 10th 2013.  participants: 60 donors (>/=50 years old), self-reported medically healthy. results: bacterial growth was observed on plates inoculated with plasma or rbcs from 62% of the blood donations. growth was evident in 21 (35%) of 60 rbc-fractions and in 32 (53%) of 60 plasma-fractions versus 8 of 60 negative controls (p = 0.005 and p = 2.6x10-6, respectively). propionibacterium acnes was  found in 23% of the donations, and staphylococcus epidermidis in 38%. the majority of bacteria identified in the present study were either facultative anaerobic (59.5%) or anaerobic (27.8%) species, which are not likely to be detected during current routine screening. conclusions: viable bacteria are present in blood from donors self-reported as medically healthy, indicating that  conventional test systems employed by blood banks insufficiently detect bacteria  in plasma. further investigation is needed to determine whether routine testing for anaerobic bacteria and testing of rbc-fractions for adherent bacteria should  be recommended.

TI  == matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry and  diagnostic testing for prosthetic joint infection in the clinical microbiology laboratory.
AB  == identification of pathogen(s) associated with prosthetic joint infection (pji) is critical for patient management. historically, many laboratories have not routinely identified organisms such as coagulase-negative staphylococci to the species level. the advent of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of  flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) has enhanced clinical laboratory capacity for accurate species-level identification. the aim of this study was to describe  the species-level identification of microorganisms isolated from periprosthetic tissue and fluid specimens using maldi-tof ms alongside other rapid identification tests in a clinical microbiology laboratory. results of rapid identification of bacteria isolated from periprosthetic joint fluid and/or tissue specimens were correlated with clinical findings at mayo clinic, rochester, minnesota, between may 2012 and may 2013. there were 178 pji and 82 aseptic failure (af) cases analyzed, yielding 770 organisms (median, 3/subject; range, 1-19/subject). maldi-tof ms was employed for the identification of 455 organisms  (59%) in 197 subjects (123 pjis and 74 afs), with 89% identified to the species level using this technique. gram-positive bacteria accounted for 68% and 93% of isolates in pji and af, respectively. however, the profile of species associated  with infection compared to specimen contamination differed. staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus caprae were always associated with infection, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus lugdunensis were equally likely to be a pathogen or a contaminant, whereas the other coagulase-negative staphylococci were more frequently contaminants. most streptococcal and corynebacterium isolates were pathogens. the likelihood that an organism was a pathogen or contaminant differed with the prosthetic joint location, particularly in the case of propionibacterium acnes. maldi-tof ms is a valuable tool for the identification of bacteria isolated from patients with prosthetic joints, providing species-level identification that may inform culture interpretation of pathogens versus contaminants.

TI  == preoperative and intraoperative infection workup in apparently aseptic revision shoulder arthroplasty.
AB  == the possibility of infection should be considered in every revision shoulder arthroplasty even in the absence of clinical symptoms and signs of infection because indolent infection is prevalent. detection of infection in apparently aseptic failed arthroplasties poses a diagnostic challenge as the conventional principles and criteria used for hip and knee arthroplasty are not generally applicable. propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus epidermidis are among the  infectious organisms most commonly identified in such situations. serum inflammatory markers are essential but are often unreliable as they have poor sensitivity in the shoulder. preoperative shoulder joint aspiration culture is an important step but is subject to high false-negative rates. lower cutoff values of synovial fluid analysis are used for detection of periprosthetic infection than for native joint infection as demonstrated in the knee literature. intraoperatively, frozen section should be considered when a diagnosis of infection has not been established even in the presence of clinical suspicion. gram stain is currently not recommended because of its low sensitivity and negative predictive value. intraoperative culture is critical and should be performed whenever there is clinical suspicion of infection. unexpected positive  intraoperative cultures are not uncommon, and 6% to 25% of them appear to represent true infection as demonstrated with positive follow-up cultures or subsequent development of infection. in revision shoulder arthroplasty, determining the presence of infection can be difficult. a standardized approach is needed to determine the best course of treatment in this particular clinical setting.

TI  == synergistic effect of 2% chlorhexidine combined with proteolytic enzymes on biofilm disruption and killing.
AB  == aim: to investigate the dynamics of a disinfection regimen using 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase k in combination with 2% chlorhexidine (with or without ultrasonics) using a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies model biofilm. methodology: nutrient-stressed biofilms (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus  epidermidis, actinomyces radicidentis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecalis omgs 3202) were grown in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth. the treatment groups included 1% trypsin and 2% chlorhexidine (chx), 1% proteinase k and 2% chx (with and without ultrasonics). 2% chx was the positive control and untreated group, and sterile saline (with and without ultrasonics) was the negative control. the biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. results: the trypsin and chx group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective in reducing viable counts and the substratum coverage than those of all other groups (p < 0.05). the viable counts of the proteinase k and chx group used with (4.26 +/- 0.58 log10 cfu ml-1 ) or without ultrasonics (5.05 +/-  1.36 log10 cfu ml-1 ) were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) as compared with the  untreated control (7.67 +/- 0.84 log10 cfu ml-1 ) and saline groups used with (6.57 +/- 0.73 log10 cfu ml-1 ) and without ultrasonics (6.74 +/- 0.10 log10 cfu  ml-1 ). the chx group was less effective in biofilm disruption compared to when used in combination with trypsin and proteinase k. conclusion: the trypsin and chx group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective at reducing bacterial viable counts and disrupting biofilm.

TI  == biogeography and individuality shape function in the human skin metagenome.
AB  == the varied topography of human skin offers a unique opportunity to study how the  body's microenvironments influence the functional and taxonomic composition of microbial communities. phylogenetic marker gene-based studies have identified many bacteria and fungi that colonize distinct skin niches. here metagenomic analyses of diverse body sites in healthy humans demonstrate that local biogeography and strong individuality define the skin microbiome. we developed a  relational analysis of bacterial, fungal and viral communities, which showed not  only site specificity but also individual signatures. we further identified strain-level variation of dominant species as heterogeneous and multiphyletic. reference-free analyses captured the uncharacterized metagenome through the development of a multi-kingdom gene catalogue, which was used to uncover genetic  signatures of species lacking reference genomes. this work is foundational for human disease studies investigating inter-kingdom interactions, metabolic changes and strain tracking, and defines the dual influence of biogeography and individuality on microbial composition and function.

TI  == the in vitro anti-acne activity of two unani drugs.
AB  == background: acne is the most common disorder treated by dermatologists. as many as 80-90% of all adolescents have some type of acne and 30% of them require medical treatment. it is an inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit characterized by the formation of open and closed comedones, papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts. aims: the present study was conducted to investigate the in vitro anti-acne activity of two unani single drugs darchini (cinnamomum zeylanicum bl.) and tukhm khashkhash (papaver somniferum l. seeds). materials and methods: the antibacterial activity of aqueous, ethanolic and hydroalcoholic extracts of both drugs were investigated against two acne causing bacteria, i.e., propionibacterium acne and staphylococcus epidermidis using well diffusion method. results: the result showed that both drugs were active against the two bacteria. against p. acne aqueous and ethanolic extract of darchini and tukhm khashkhash showed the zone of inhibition of 18 +/- 1.02 mm and 18 +/- 1.6 mm and  13 +/- 1.04 mm and 14 +/- 1.8 mm, respectively. against s. epidermidis aqueous, hydroalcoholic and ethanolic extracts of darchini showed 22 +/- 1.7 mm, 22 +/- 1.2 mm and 15 +/- 1.8 mm zone of inhibition respectively. hydroalcoholic and ethanolic extracts of tukhm khashkhash showed 15 +/- 1.09 mm and 13 +/- 1.6 mm zone of inhibition respectively. conclusion: this suggests that c. zeylanicum and p. somniferum have potential against acne causing bacteria and hence they can be  used in topical anti-acne preparations and may address the antibiotic resistance  of the bacteria.

TI  == lipase-mediated lipid removal from propolis extract and its antiradical and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background: propolis contains many antioxidants such as polyphenols and flavonoids. however, propolis-derived lipid components interrupt an efficient isolation of antioxidants from propolis extract. we examined the effectiveness of various lipase treatments for the removal of lipids from propolis extract and evaluated the biological features of the extract. results: lipase of and novozyme 435 treatments did not reduce fatty acid level in propolis extract. however, lipozyme tl im-treated propolis extract showed a significant decrease in fatty acid level, suggesting the removal of lipids. lipozyme rm im also significantly decreased the fatty acid level of the extract, but was accompanied by the reduction of polyphenols and flavonoids, which are antioxidants. in lipozyme tl im treatment, an increase in active flavonoids, such as artepillin c and kaempferide, was observed, with a slight increase of ferric reducing/antioxidant  power (frap) radical-scavenging activity. in addition, antimicrobial activity towards skin health-related bacteria such as staphylococcus epidermidis and propionibacterium acnes was enhanced by lipozyme tl im treatment. conclusion: lipozyme tl im treatment effectively removes lipids from propolis extract and enhances antibacterial activity. therefore, we suggest that lipozyme tl im is a useful lipase for lipid removal of propolis extract.

TI  == fusidic acid in skin infections and infected atopic eczema.
AB  == skin infections represent an important public health issue and cost-driver. additionally, chronic skin lesions are sometimes colonized by gram-negative species. topical therapies are a key component in the management of mild-to-moderate skin infections. in such cases, topical antibiotics may be preferable to systemic treatment, since they maximize the effective doses at the  site of infection while minimizing the systemic side effects of the drugs. however, the prevalence of resistant strains is steadily increasing and cases of  sensitization are not uncommon. as a consequence, the ideal topical antibiotic should be selective (thus, minimizing cross-resistance), have weak sensitization  potential, penetrate the skin efficiently, reach adequate local doses at the site of infection, and finally be available in different formulations matching patients' preferences and needs. fusidic acid (fa) is a selective antibiotic available in several topical formulations. pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies have shown that, contrary to other topical antibiotics such as gentamicin or mupirocin, fa reaches high antimicrobial concentration at deep skin layers after topical application either on intact or damaged epidermis. several randomized controlled trials demonstrated that fa, in its various topical formulations, is very effective in treating skin infections, given its high bactericidal activity against s. aureus (including strains resistant to penicillin, methicillin, ampicillin, cloxacillin), s. epidermidis, streptococcus  pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, corinebatteria, clostridia. additionally, fa presents a low risk of resistance even in methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, a common pathogen implied in the etiology of skin infections and infected atopic eczema. such feature makes fa particularly useful in the management of these medical conditions. finally, possibly due to its large steric effect, fa has proved a very low risk of contact sensitization. overall, data on  fa efficacy, safety, sensitization potential, resistance profile and spectrum selectivity make it a first-choice option in the treatment of primary and secondary skin infection.

TI  == management of deep postoperative shoulder infections: is there a role for open biopsy during staged treatment?
AB  == background: despite the gold standard treatment of 2-stage exchange arthroplasty, reinfection after periprosthetic shoulder infections and periarticular osteomyelitis can be as high as 37%. this study describes a protocol to detect persistent deep shoulder infection before revision arthroplasty. methods: patients who presented with periprosthetic shoulder infections and osteomyelitis  after previous surgery were treated with a standardized protocol of irrigation and debridement (i&d), removal of implants, antibiotic cement spacer placement, and pathogen-directed antibiotic therapy for 6 weeks. after completion of antibiotics and resolution of clinical symptoms, specimens were obtained from an  open biopsy performed in the operating room, followed by revision arthroplasty at a later date if final cultures were without evidence of infection. if evidence of infection persisted, then another course of i&d and antibiotic treatment was performed. american shoulder and elbow surgeon scores were used to evaluate clinical outcomes. results: eighteen patients were included between 2005 and 2012. the most common pathogens isolated were propionibacterium acnes (44%), staphylococcus epidermidis (39%), and s aureus (22%). four patients (22%) had evidence of persistent infection on specimens from open biopsy and required subsequent rounds of i&d before replantation. the infecting pathogen in 75% of patients with persistent infection was p acnes, and 38% of patients with p acnes  infection had recurrence. mean follow-up of 24 months showed no signs of recurrent infection in any patient and an average american shoulder and elbow surgeon score of 71. conclusion: despite prior staged treatment for deep postoperative shoulder infections, specimens obtained from open biopsy before replantation detected a persistent infection rate of 22% in all patients and 38%  in patients with p acnes infection, which may indicate a role for this procedure  in the prevention of recurrent infections.

TI  == enzymatic treatment of specimens before dna extraction directly influences molecular detection of infectious agents.
AB  == introduction: biological samples, pharmaceuticals or food contain proteins, lipids, polymers, ammoniums and macromolecules that alter the detection of infectious agents by dna amplification techniques (pcr). moreover the targeted dna has to be released from the complex cell walls and the compact nucleoprotein  matrixes and cleared from potential inhibitors. the goal of the present work was  to assess the efficiency of enzymatic pretreatments on infectious agents to make  dna available for further extraction and amplification. methods: staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, aspergillus niger and fusarium solani were mixed with an internal control virus and treated with: 1) proteinase k; 2) lyticase and 3) lyticase followed by proteinase k. dnas was manually extracted using the qiamp dna mini kit or the magna pure compact automate. dna extraction yields and the inhibitors were assessed with a phocid herpesvirus. bacterial detection was performed using taqman real-time pcr and yeasts and filamentous fungi with hrm (real-time pcr followed by high-resolution melting analysis). results: viral dna was released, extracted and detected using manual and automatic methods without pre enzymatic treatments. either the manual or the automatic dna extraction systems did not meet the sensitivity expectations if enzymatic treatments were not performed before: lyticase for fungi and proteinase k for bacteria. the addition of lyticase and proteinase k did not improve results. for fungi the detection after lyticase was higher than for proteinase k, for which melting analysis did not allow fungal specification. discussion: columns and magnetic beads allowed collecting dna and separate pcr inhibitors. detection rates cannot be related to dna-avidity of beads or to elution but to the lack of proteolysis.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the anti-bacterial effect of two preparations of platelet  rich plasma compared with cefazolin and whole blood.
AB  == purpose: this study investigates the antibacterial properties of two different platelet-rich plasma (prp) platelet concentration preparations (prplp and prphp)  through a time-kill assay. methods: two different prp preparations - a single spin process yielding lower white blood cells and platelet concentration (prplp)  and one yielding high platelet and white blood cell concentration (prphp) - were  obtained from 2 individuals. prplp, prphp, phosphate buffered saline (pbs), whole blood and cefazolin were added to experimental reaction tubes, each containing a  single bacterial inoculum of staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), staphylococcus epidermidis (s. epi), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) or propionibacterium acnes (p. acnes). two dilutions (1:1,000, and 1:10,000) were plated in duplicate tubes, along with positive (blood and pbs) and negative (cefazolin) controls and assessed at five time points (0, 1, 4, 8 and 24 hours).  results: after centrifugation, platelet count of prplp was 386 +/- 65.5 x 103/?l  and prphp was 867 +/- 234.4 x 103/?l. both prp products showed a significant decrease (p<0.05) in bacterial growth at 8 hours compared to whole blood. conclusion: the application of prplp and prphp showed a significant decrease in bacterial growth after 8 hours for s. aureus, s. epi, mrsa and p. acnes compared  to the whole blood control group. s.epi, mrsa, and p. acnes also showed a significant decrease in bacterial growth after 24 hours. despite differences in platelet concentration and wbc concentration, no difference in antibacterial activity was seen between the two preparations.

TI  == safety of topical vancomycin for pediatric spinal deformity: nontoxic serum levels with supratherapeutic drain levels.
AB  == study design: retrospective cohort analysis. objective: to establish if drain levels exceed the minimum inhibitory concentrations for common pathogens (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, and propionibacterium acnes-2 mug/ml; staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis-4 mug/ml). evaluate the safety of topical vancomycin in pediatric patients undergoing spinal deformity surgery and determine if postoperative serum levels approach toxicity (25 mug/ml). summary of background data: the application of topical vancomycin powder has decreased postoperative wound infections in retrospective analyses in the adult population  with minimal local and systemic risks. the safety and efficacy of vancomycin powder has not been completely evaluated in the pediatric population after deformity surgery. methods: topical vancomycin powder (1 g) was applied during wound closure after instrumented posterior spinal fusion. all patients received intravenous perioperative antibiotics and a subfascial drain was used. serum and  drain vancomycin levels were collected immediately postoperatively and during the first 2 postoperative days (pods). complications were recorded. results: the study population consisted of 25 patients with a mean age of 13.5 years (9.5-17.1 yr) and mean +/- standard deviation body weight of 44.5 +/- 18 kg. underlying diagnoses included: adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (12), neuromuscular scoliosis (10), and kyphosis (3). mean serum vancomycin levels trended downward from 2.5 mug/ml (pod 0) to 1.9 mug/ml (pod 1) to 1.1 mug/ml (pod 2). mean drain levels also trended downward from 403 mug/ml (pod 0) to 251 mug/ml (pod 1) to 115 mug/ml (pod 2). no vancomycin toxicity or deep wound infections were observed. one patient with neuromuscular scoliosis developed a superficial wound dehiscence that was managed with dressing changes. conclusion: topical application of vancomycin powder in pediatric spinal deformity surgery produced local levels well above the minimum inhibitory concentration for common pathogens and serum levels below the toxicity threshold (25 mug/ml). there were no deep wound or antibiotic related complications. level of evidence: 3.

TI  == relationship between the severity of acne vulgaris and antimicrobial resistance of bacteria isolated from acne lesions in a hospital in japan.
AB  == propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus epidermidis are normal skin inhabitants that are frequently isolated from lesions caused by acne, and these micro-organisms are considered to contribute to the inflammation of acne. in the  present study, we examined the antimicrobial susceptibilities and resistance mechanisms of p. acnes and s. epidermidis isolated from patients with acne vulgaris in a university hospital in japan from 2009 to 2010. additionally, we analysed the relationship between the antimicrobial resistance of p. acnes and the severity of acne vulgaris. some p. acnes strains (18.8 %; 13/69) were resistant to clindamycin. all strains had a mutation in the 23s rrna gene, except for one strain that expressed erm(x) encoding a 23s rrna methylase. tetracycline-resistant p. acnes strains were found to represent 4.3 % (3/69) of the strains, and this resistance was caused by a mutation in the 16s rrna gene. furthermore, three strains with reduced susceptibility to nadifloxacin (mic = 16  microg ml(-1)) were detected. when analysing the correlation between the antimicrobial resistance of p. acnes and s. epidermidis, more than 80 % of the patients who carried clindamycin-resistant p. acnes also carried clindamycin-resistant s. epidermidis. however, no epidemic strain that exhibited  antimicrobial resistance was detected in the p. acnes strains when analysed by pfge. therefore, our results suggest that the antimicrobial resistance of p. acnes is closely related to antimicrobial therapy. additionally, those p. acnes strains tended to be frequently found in severe acne patients rather than in mild acne patients. consequently, the data support a relationship between using antimicrobial agents and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == antibacterial activity of plumbagin derivative-rich plumbago indica root extracts and chemical stability.
AB  == the extraction studies and a one-step purification of the crude extract of plumbago indica using silica-gel vacuum chromatography provided a plumbagin derivative-rich p. indica root extract (ppe). the ppe was standardised to contain total plumbagin derivatives not less than 13% w/w. antibacterial activities of the standardised ppe and three naphthoquinones, plumbagin, elliptinone and 3,3'-biplumbagin, against propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were evaluated by using the microdilution assay. the bactericidal activities of the ppe against these bacteria were much stronger than those of elliptinone and 3,3'-biplumbagin and almost equal to those of plumbagin. stability of the ppe was determined under various conditions through a period of  four months. the ppe was stable over a period of four months when stored as a dried powder but only in a well-closed container protected from light under 4 +/- 2 degrees c.

TI  == the microbiome of the middle meatus in healthy adults.
AB  == rhinitis and rhinosinusitis are multifactorial disease processes in which bacteria may play a role either in infection or stimulation of the inflammatory process. rhinosinusitis has been historically studied with culture-based techniques, which have implicated several common pathogens in disease states. more recently, the nih human microbiome project has examined the microbiome at a  number of accessible body sites, and demonstrated differences among healthy and diseased patients. recent dna-based sinus studies have suggested that healthy sinuses are not sterile, as was previously believed, but the normal sinonasal microbiome has yet to be thoroughly examined. middle meatus swab specimens were collected from 28 consecutive patients presenting with no signs or symptoms of rhinosinusitis. bacterial colonization was assessed in these specimens using quantitative pcr and 16s rrna pyrosequencing. all subjects were positive for bacterial colonization of the middle meatus. staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and propionibacterium acnes were the most prevalent and abundant microorganisms detected. rich and diverse bacterial assemblages are  present in the sinonasal cavity in the normal state, including opportunistic pathogens typically found in the nasopharynx. this work helps establish a baseline for understanding how the sinonasal microbiome may impact diseases of the upper airways.

TI  == bacterial skin commensals and their role as host guardians.
AB  == recent years' investigations of the co-evolution and functional integration of the human body and its commensal microbiota have disclosed that the microbiome has a major impact on physiological functions including protection against infections, reaction patterns in the immune system, and disposition for inflammation-mediated diseases. two ubiquitous members of the skin microbiota, the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus epidermidis and propionibacterium acnes, are predominant on human epithelia and in sebaceous follicles, respectively. their successful colonisation is a result of a commensal or even mutualistic lifestyle, favouring traits conferring persistency over aggressive host-damaging properties. some bacterial properties suggest an alliance with the  host to keep transient, potential pathogens at bay, such as the ability of s. epidermidis to produce antimicrobials, or the production of short-chain fatty acids by p. acnes. these features can function together with host-derived components of the innate host defence to establish and maintain the composition of a health-associated skin microbiota. however, depending largely on the host status, the relationship between the human host and s. epidermidis/p. acnes can also have parasitic features. both microorganisms are frequently isolated from opportunistic infections. s. epidermidis is a causative agent of hospital-acquired infections, mostly associated with the use of medical devices.  p. acnes is suspected to be of major importance in the pathogenesis of acne and also in a number of other opportunistic infections. in this review we will present bacterial factors and traits of these two key members of our skin microbiota and discuss how they contribute to mutualistic and parasitic properties. the elucidation of their roles in health-promoting or disease-causing processes could lead to new prophylactic and therapeutic strategies against skin  disorders and other s. epidermidis/p. acnes-associated diseases, and increase our understanding of the delicate interplay of the skin microbiota with the human host.

TI  == staphylococcus epidermidis in the human skin microbiome mediates fermentation to  inhibit the growth of propionibacterium acnes: implications of probiotics in acne vulgaris.
AB  == increasing evidence demonstrates that commensal microorganisms in the human skin  microbiome help fight pathogens and maintain homeostasis of the microbiome. however, it is unclear how these microorganisms maintain biological balance when  one of them overgrows. the overgrowth of propionibacterium acnes (p. acnes), a commensal skin bacterium, has been associated with the progression of acne vulgaris. our results demonstrate that skin microorganisms can mediate fermentation of glycerol, which is naturally produced in skin, to enhance their inhibitory effects on p. acnes growth. the skin microorganisms, most of which have been identified as staphylococcus epidermidis (s. epidermidis), in the microbiome of human fingerprints can ferment glycerol and create inhibition zones to repel a colony of overgrown p. acnes. succinic acid, one of four short-chain fatty acids (scfas) detected in fermented media by nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) analysis, effectively inhibits the growth of p. acnes in vitro and in vivo. both intralesional injection and topical application of succinic acid to p. acnes-induced lesions markedly suppress the p. acnes-induced inflammation in mice. we demonstrate for the first time that bacterial members in the skin microbiome can undergo fermentation to rein in the overgrowth of p. acnes. the concept of bacterial interference between p. acnes and s. epidermidis via fermentation can be applied to develop probiotics against acne vulgaris and other skin diseases. in addition, it will open up an entirely new area of study for the biological function of the skin microbiome in promoting human health.

AB  == aim: to establish a nutrient-stressed multispecies model biofilm and investigate  the dynamics of biofilm killing and disruption by 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase k  with or without ultrasonic activation. methodology: nutrient-stressed biofilms (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, actinomyces radicidentis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecalis omgs 3202) were grown on hydroxyapatite discs and in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth in modified fluid universal medium. the treatment groups included trypsin, proteinase k, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 1% sodium hypochlorite (naocl) (with and without ultrasonics). naocl and chlorhexidine were the positive controls and untreated group, and sterile saline was the negative control. the biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. results: nutrient stress in the multispecies biofilm was apparent as the medium ph became alkaline, glucose was absent, and serum proteins were degraded in the supernatant. the clsm showed the percentage reduction in viable bacteria at the biofilm surface level due to nutrient starvation. on the disc model, trypsin and proteinase k were effective in killing bacteria; their aerobic viable counts were significantly lower (p < 0.01) than the negative control and chlorhexidine. naocl was the most  effective agent (p < 0.001). in the tooth model, when compared to saline, trypsin with ultrasonics caused significant killing both aerobically and anaerobically (p < 0.05). chlorhexidine (1.46 +/- 0.42), trypsin (3.56 +/- 1.18) and proteinase k  (4.2 +/- 1.01) with ultrasonics were significantly effective (p < 0.05) in reducing the substratum coverage as compared to saline with ultrasonics (12% +/-  4.9). conclusion: trypsin with ultrasonic activation has a biofilm killing and disrupting potential.

TI  == the role of the skin barrier in modulating the effects of common skin microbial species on the inflammation, differentiation and proliferation status of epidermal keratinocytes.
AB  == background: skin resident microbial species are often thought of either as pathogenic or commensal. however, little is known about the role of the skin barrier in modulating their potential for causing disease. to investigate this question we measured the effects of three microbial species commonly found on the skin (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, and propionibacterium acnes) on a reconstructed human epidermal model by either applying the bacteria on the model surface (intact barrier) or adding them to the culture medium (simulating barrier breach). results: when added to the medium, all of the tested species induced inflammatory responses and keratinocyte cell death with species-specific potency. p. acnes and s. epidermidis induced specific alterations in the expression of keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation markers, suggesting a barrier reparation response. s. aureus induced complete keratinocyte cell death. on the contrary, topically applied s. epidermidis and p. acnes caused no inflammatory response even when tested at high concentrations, while topical s. aureus induced a weak reaction. none of the tested species were  able to alter the expression of keratinocyte differentiation or expression markers, when applied topically. conclusions: we show that the skin barrier prevents the effects of common skin bacteria on epidermal keratinocyte inflammation, differentiation and proliferation and highlight the importance of skin barrier in defending against the pathogenic effects of common skin bacteria.

TI  == a small peptide with therapeutic potential for inflammatory acne vulgaris.
AB  == a designed peptide named lz1 with 15 amino acid residues containing strong antimicrobial activity against bacteria pathogens of acne vulgaris including propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis and s. aureus. especially, it exerted strong anti-p. acnes ability. the minimal inhibitory concentration against three strains of p. acnes was only 0.6 microg/ml, which is 4 times lower  than that of clindamycin. in experimental mice skin colonization model, lz1 significantly reduced the number of p. acnes colonized on the ear, p. acnes-induced ear swelling, and inflammatory cell infiltration. it ameliorated inflammation induced by p. acnes by inhibiting the secretion of inflammatory factors including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin (il)-1beta. lz1 showed little cytotoxicity on human keratinocyte and hemolytic activity on human blood red cells. furthermore, lz1 was very stable in human plasma. combined with its potential bactericidal and anti-inflammatory properties, simple structure and high stability, lz1 might be an ideal candidate  for the treatment of acne.

TI  == identification of household bacterial community and analysis of species shared with human microbiome.
AB  == microbial populations in indoor environments, where we live and eat, are important for public health. various bacterial species reside in the kitchen, and refrigerators, the major means of food storage within kitchens, can be a direct source of food borne illness. therefore, the monitoring of microbiota in the refrigerator is important for food safety. we investigated and compared bacterial communities that reside in the vegetable compartment of the refrigerator and on the seat of the toilet, which is recognized as highly colonized by microorganisms, in ten houses using high-throughput sequencing. proteobacteria, firmicutes, actinobacteria, and bacteroidetes were predominant in refrigerator and toilet samples. however, proteobacteria was more abundant in the refrigerator, and firmicutes was more abundant in the toilet. these household bacterial communities were compared with those of human skin and gut to identify  potential sources of household bacteria. bacterial communities from refrigerators and toilets shared more species in common with human skin than gut. opportunistic pathogens, including propionibacterium acnes, bacteroides vulgatus, and staphylococcus epidermidis, were identified as species shared with human skin and gut microbiota. this approach can provide a general background of the household microbiota and a potential method of source-tracking for public health purposes.

TI  == the oral cavity is not a primary source for implantable pacemaker or cardioverter defibrillator infections.
AB  == background: to test the hypothesis that the oral cavity is a potential source for implantable pacemaker and cardioverter defibrillators infections, the bacterial diversity on explanted rhythm heart management devices was investigated and compared to the oral microbiome. methods: a metagenomic approach was used to analyze the bacterial diversity on the surfaces of non-infected and infected pacemakers. the dna from surfaces swaps of 24 non-infected and 23 infected pacemaker were isolated and subjected to bacterial-specific dna amplification, single strand conformation polymorphism- (sscp) and sequencing analysis. species-specific primer sets were used to analyze for any correlation between bacterial diversity on pacemakers and in the oral cavity. results: dna of bacterial origin was detected in 21 cases on infected pacemakers and assigned to  the bacterial phylotypes staphylococcus epidermidis, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus schleiferi and stapyhlococcus. in 17 cases  bacterial dna was found on pacemakers with no clinical signs of infections. on the basis of the obtained sequence data, the phylotypes propionibacterium acnes,  staphylococcus and an uncultured bacterium were identified. propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus epidermidis were the only bacteria detected in pacemeaker (n = 25) and oral samples (n = 11). conclusions: the frequency of the  coincidental detection of bacteria on infected devices and in the oral cavity is  low and the detected bacteria are highly abundant colonizers of non-oral human niches.the transmission of oral bacteria to the lead or device of implantable pacemaker or cardioverter defibrillators is unlikely relevant for the pathogenesis of pacemaker or cardioverter defibrillators infections.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of southern african medicinal plants with dermatological relevance: from an ethnopharmacological screening approach, to combination studies and the isolation of a bioactive compound.
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: ethnobotanical reports on more than 100 southern  african medicinal plants with dermatological relevance have been highlighted, yet there is still limited scientific data to support claims for their antimicrobial  effectiveness against skin pathogens. guided by ethnobotanical data, this paper explores the antimicrobial efficacies of southern african medicinal plants used to treat skin ailments. aim of the study: to investigate the antimicrobial properties of southern african medicinal plants against dermatologically relevant pathogens. the study also aimed at providing a scientific rationale for the traditional use of plant combinations to treat skin diseases and the isolation of the bio-active compound from the most active species, aristea ecklonii (iridaceae). materials and methods: organic and aqueous extracts (132) were prepared from 47 plant species and screened for antimicrobial properties against  dermatologically relevant pathogens using the micro-titre plate dilution method.  four different plant combinations were investigated for interactive properties and the sum of the fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) calculated. isobolograms were used to further investigate the antimicrobial interactive properties of pentanisia prunelloides combined with elephantorrhiza elephantina at varied ratios. a bioactivity-guided fractionation process was adopted to fractionate the organic leaf extract of aristea ecklonii. results: plants demonstrating notable broad-spectrum activities (mic values </=1.00mg/ml) against the tested pathogens included extracts from aristea ecklonii, chenopodium ambrosioides, diospyros mespiliformis, elephantorrhiza elephantina, eucalyptus camaldulensis, gunnera perpensa, harpephyllum caffrum, hypericum perforatum, melianthus comosus, terminalia sericea and warburgia salutaris. the organic extract of elephantorrhiza elephantina, a plant reportedly used to treat acne vulgaris, demonstrated noteworthy antimicrobial activity (mic value of 0.05mg/ml) against propionibacterium acnes. similarly, diospyros mespiliformis reported for  its traditional use to treat ringworm, also displayed noteworthy antimicrobial activity against trichophyton mentagrophytes (mic 0.10mg/ml) and microsporum canis (mic 0.50mg/ml). the aqueous root extracts of pentanisia prunelloides combined (1:1) with elephantorrhiza elephantina displayed synergistic interactions (fic values 0.31-0.38) against staphylococcus aureus, gentamycin-methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and candida albicans. fractionation of aristea ecklonii resulted in the isolation of the known bio-active compound, plumbagin, displaying noteworthy  antimicrobial activity (mic range between 2.00mug/ml and 16.00mug/ml). conclusion: most of the plant extracts demonstrated pathogen specific antimicrobial effects with a few exhibiting broad-spectrum activities. positive antimicrobial effects noted for plants such as elephantorrhiza elephantina and diospyros mespiliformis used for acne vulgaris and ringworm infections, respectively, give some validation to their reported traditiona l uses. synergistic interactions noted for pentanisia prunelloides combined with elephantorrhiza elephantina validate an enhanced antimicrobial effect when used in combination. noteworthy antimicrobial activities (mic range between 2.00mug/ml and 16.00mug/ml) were observed for plumbagin isolated from aristea ecklonii.

TI  == dandruff is associated with disequilibrium in the proportion of the major bacterial and fungal populations colonizing the scalp.
AB  == the bacterial and fungal communities associated with dandruff were investigated using culture-independent methodologies in the french subjects. the major bacterial and fungal species inhabiting the scalp subject's were identified by cloning and sequencing of the conserved ribosomal unit regions (16s for bacterial and 28s-its for fungal) and were further quantified by quantitative pcr. the two  main bacterial species found on the scalp surface were propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus epidermidis, while malassezia restricta was the main fungal inhabitant. dandruff was correlated with a higher incidence of m. restricta and s. epidermidis and a lower incidence of p. acnes compared to the control population (p<0.05). these results suggested for the first time using molecular methods, that dandruff is linked to the balance between bacteria and fungi of the host scalp surface.

TI  == sterility testing of apheresis hematopoietic progenitor cell products using an automated blood culture system.
AB  == background: aabb standards require monitoring of hematopoietic progenitor cell (hpc) products for microbial contamination. to date, there is no automated blood  culture system cleared by the food and drug administration for this application.  our objective was to validate the versatrek system (trek diagnostic systems) for  sterility testing of apheresis hpc products. study design and methods: four aerobic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, and bacillus cereus), five anaerobic bacteria (fusobacterium necrophorum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella loescheii, and propionibacterium acnes), and one fungus (candida albicans) were spiked into  apheresis hpc products at concentrations of 10, 10(2) , 10(3) , and 10(4) colony-forming units (cfus)/ml. aerobic and anaerobic bottles were incubated until positive or for up to 5 days. dna was simultaneously extracted for polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. results: all aerobic bacteria grew in both bottles at all concentrations tested within 24 hours, and the time to positivity (ttp) was significantly shorter with  aerobic bottles. c. albicans grew in the aerobic media at all concentrations within 30 hours. anaerobes grew in the anaerobic bottle at all concentrations within 5 days. no bacteria were detected by using 16s rrna gene amplification at  10(4) cfus/ml. conclusion: compared to culture, 16s rrna gene amplification of hpcs does not improve sensitivity or turnaround time for hpc sterility testing. the versatrek system is a reliable tool for detecting microbial contamination of  apheresis hpc products with a limit of detection of less than or equal to 10 cfus/ml. inclusion of both the aerobic and the anaerobic culture bottles achieves the shortest ttp for all species tested.

AB  == background: the etiology of long-lasting adverse reactions to gel fillers used in cosmetic surgery is not known. bacterial infection and immunological reaction to  the product have been suggested. methods: we performed a case-control study, with 77 biopsies and 30 cytology specimens originating from 59 patients with adverse reactions to polyacrylamide gel, and 54 biopsies and 2 cytology specimens from 28 control subjects with no adverse reactions. samples from 5 patients and 4 controls could not be investigated for presence of bacteria owing to limited material. samples from the remaining 54 patients and 24 controls were systematically examined for the presence of bacteria by culture, 16s rrna gene sequencing, gram stain, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. results: bacteria, mostly normal skin bacteria such as staphylococcus epidermidis and propionibacterium acnes, were identified in bacteriologically investigated samples from 53 of 54 patients (98%), and in none of the 24 controls (0%). the bacteria were lying in small clusters, which in symptomatic lesions were detected up to 5 years postinjection. conclusions: commensal bacteria of low virulence are capable of producing long-term infection in the presence of polyacrylamide filler in cosmetic surgery, possibly due to a biofilm mode of growth. adequate skin preparation and use of sterile technique in these procedures are mandatory, but antibiotic prophylaxis prior to injection of nondegradable gels like polyacrylamide should be explored as well.

(extracted by 80% ethanol) and sauropus androgynus (linn.) merr. (extracted by distilled water) were found to have significant levels of antioxidant activities measured by dpph scavenging (ic5o at 4.92+/-0.01 and 4.71+/-0.01 mg ml-1, respectively) and frap antioxidant assays (74.38+/-0.25 and  74.00+/-0.04 mmol feso4 g-' of dry weight of vegetable, respectively) and also total phenolic compounds (10.96+/-0.02 and 10.34+/-0.01 mg gallic acid eq g-1 of  dry weight of vegetable). for fruits, the extracts derived from terminalia chebula retz. when using distilled water and 80% ethanol as solvents were shown to have significantly high levels of dpph scavenging (ic50 at 3.73+/-0.01 and 3.81+/-0.01 mg ml-1, respectively), frap antioxidant activities (80.85+/-0.10 and 65.93+/-0.11 mmol feso4 g-1of dry weight of fruit, respectively) and total phenolic compounds (13.10+/-0.06 and 10.66+/-0.02 mg gallic acid eq g-1 of dry weight of fruit, respectively). the antibacterial assays showed that moringa oleifera lam., limnophila aromatica (lamk.) merr., terminalia chebula retz. and phyllanthus emblica linn. that were extracted using 80% ethanol as solvent were found to have antibacterial activities against staphylococcus aureus, straphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes and propionibacterium acnes.  the results in this study may be useful for future application of edible plants that are native to thailand to be used as cosmetic or therapqutic products.

TI  == time series community genomics analysis reveals rapid shifts in bacterial species, strains, and phage during infant gut colonization.
AB  == the gastrointestinal microbiome undergoes shifts in species and strain abundances, yet dynamics involving closely related microorganisms remain largely  unknown because most methods cannot resolve them. we developed new metagenomic methods and utilized them to track species and strain level variations in microbial communities in 11 fecal samples collected from a premature infant during the first month of life. ninety six percent of the sequencing reads were assembled into scaffolds of >500 bp in length that could be assigned to organisms at the strain level. six essentially complete ( approximately 99%) and two near-complete genomes were assembled for bacteria that comprised as little as 1%  of the community, as well as nine partial genomes of bacteria representing as little as 0.05%. in addition, three viral genomes were assembled and assigned to  their hosts. the relative abundance of three staphylococcus epidermidis strains,  as well as three phages that infect them, changed dramatically over time. genes possibly related to these shifts include those for resistance to antibiotics, heavy metals, and phage. at the species level, we observed the decline of an early-colonizing propionibacterium acnes strain similar to sk137 and the proliferation of novel propionibacterium and peptoniphilus species late in colonization. the propionibacterium species differed in their ability to metabolize carbon compounds such as inositol and sialic acid, indicating that shifts in species composition likely impact the metabolic potential of the community. these results highlight the benefit of reconstructing complete genomes from metagenomic data and demonstrate methods for achieving this goal.

AB  == background: peritonitis is the leading cause of morbidity for peritoneal dialysis (pd) patients, and microbial biofilms have previously been identified on catheters from infected patients. however, few studies of catheters from patients without clinical signs of infection have been undertaken. the aim of the present  study was to investigate the extent to which bacteria are present on catheters from pd patients with no symptoms of infection. methods: microbiologic culturing  under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and confocal laser scanning microscopy were used to determine the distribution of bacteria on pd catheters from 15 patients without clinical signs of infection and on catheters from 2 infected patients. the 16s rrna gene sequencing technique was used to identify cultured bacteria. results: bacteria were detected on 12 of the 15 catheters from patients without signs of infection and on the 2 catheters from infected patients. single-species and mixed-microbial communities containing up to 5 species were present on both the inside and the outside along the whole length of the colonized catheters. the bacterial species most commonly found were the skin commensals staphylococcus epidermidis and propionibacterium acnes, followed by s. warneri and s. lugdunensis. the strains of these micro-organisms, particularly those of s. epidermidis, varied in phenotype with respect to their tolerance of the major classes of antibiotics. conclusions: bacteria were common on catheters  from patients without symptoms of infection. up to 4 different bacterial species  were found in close association and may represent a risk factor for the future development of peritonitis in patients hosting such micro-organisms.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of microbial strains isolated from korean acne patients.
AB  == over several decades, topical and systemic antibiotics have been the mainstay of  treatment for acne vulgaris. the widespread and long-term use of antibiotics in the treatment of acne has resulted in the spread of resistant bacterial strains and treatment failure. we aimed to examine the bacteriology of acne vulgaris and  to evaluate its susceptibility to the antibiotics widely used for acne in korea.  we examined the species of bacteria aerobically and anaerobically isolated from 100 korean acne patients. among the bacteria isolated, staphylococcus epidermidis (36 patients) was the most common, followed by propionibacterium acnes (30 patients). eleven strains of p. acnes (36.7%) and 25 strains of s. epidermidis (69.4%) were resistant to one or other of the antibiotics tested. a higher proportion of p. acnes isolates were resistant to clindamycin (30%) and erythromycin (26.7%), than to any other antibiotics tested (p = 0.0003). some s.  epidermidis isolates were resistant to tetracycline and doxycycline in addition to clindamycin and erythromycin. in the previous studies, few strains of p. acnes were found to be resistant to any of the antibiotics, but this study shows that antibiotic-resistant strains have been increasing in korea acne patients.

TI  == cardiovascular implantable electronic device endocarditis treated with daptomycin with or without transvenous removal.
AB  == background and methods: nine patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic  device (cied) endocarditis were treated with daptomycin after the failure of previous treatment. the blood and cied lead cultures of 1 patient were negative.  in the other 8 patients, we observed 6 monomicrobic infections and 2 polymicrobic infections. overall, 10 strains were isolated in these patients: 4 methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, 2 methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 1 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus hominis, and 1 propionibacterium acnes. the cied was removed transvenously in 7 patients. two patients were too sick for the removal of their  cied, and were cured with 6 mg/kg of daptomycin for 60 and 110 days, respectively, without adverse events. results: one patient died 4 days after the  removal of his cied because of a complicated abdominal aortic aneurysm. the other 8 patients were cured, with a mean follow-up of 17 +/- 8 months. the removed leads were negative, after daptomycin therapy, in 4 cases out of 7. the mean ratio between peak daptomycin concentration and minimal inhibitory concentration  (mic) of the causative strains was 38.3 +/- 18.5. for patients whose data were available, the ratio between peak daptomycin concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) was 13.2 +/- 3.2. conclusion: daptomycin monotherapy may be a useful therapeutic tool in difficult-to-treat cied endocarditis, resulting in a high rate of cures and sterilized leads removed. the ratio between peak daptomycin concentration and mic or mbc may be useful as predictive tool for treatment success.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus reuteri on the proliferation of propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  == while it is generally accepted that propionibacterium acnes is involved in the development of acne, other bacteria including staphylococcus epidermidis have also been isolated from the acne lesion. the interaction between lactobacillus reuteri, a probiotic bacterium, and acnegenic bacteria is unclear. this study examined the effects of l. reuteri on the proliferation of p. acnes and s. epidermidis. human-derived l. reuteri strains (kctc 3594 and kctc 3678) and rat-derived l. reuteri kctc 3679 were used. all strains exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the growth of p. acnes and s. epidermidis. the proliferation of p. acnes was decreased by 2-log scales after incubation with l.  reuteri for 24 h. in addition, the proliferation of s. epidermidis was decreased  by 3-log scales after incubation with l. reuteri for 24 h, whereas the growth of  l. reuteri was unaffected by p. acnes or s. epidermidis. among the l. reuteri strains examined, l. reuteri kctc 3679 had the strongest inhibitory effect on the growth of p. acnes and s. epidermidis, followed by l. reuteri kctc 3594 and l. reuteri kctc 3678. interestingly, reuterin, an antimicrobial factor, was produced only by l. reuteri kctc 3594. the most pronounced the antibacterial activities of l. reuteri were attributed to the production of organic acids. overall, these results suggest that l. reuteri may be a useful probiotic agent to control the growth of bacteria involved in acne inflammation and prevent acne.

TI  == the temporal dynamics of bacterial communities across human anterior nares.
AB  == the anterior nares (nostrils), are an important niche for bacterial colonization  by both commensals and opportunistic pathogens. here the temporal dynamics and variation of the global nasal bacterial community across 25 healthy volunteers was evaluated over 15 months. overall, there was a global seasonal shift in bacterial community structure. such a temporal shift was also strongly evident in the abundances of species such as propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus epidermidis. however, such species dynamics over time was also inter-individual-dependent, and both individuals with highly stable communities and those with highly flexible communities could be defined. even though the bacterial community of individual volunteers was thus generally variable over time and permanent carriage of a given species was seldomly observed, various species previously defined as constituting the core bacterial community could be  identified as persistent in a subset of the volunteers suggesting that these same species also constitute to a 'temporal' core community.

TI  == efficiency of diversion of the first aliquot of blood and prestorage leukoreduction for preventing bacterial contamination in red blood cell concentrates assessed using a rapid polymerase chain reaction-based bacterial detection system.
AB  == objectives: sepsis caused by the bacterial contamination of blood products is a major infection risk associated with blood transfusion. diversion of the initial  25 ml of blood and prestorage leukoreduction were implemented in japan in 2007 for all donated blood products. we assessed the efficacy of these new collection  procedures in preventing bacterial contamination of red blood cell (rbc) concentrates. methods: broad-range 16s ribosomal rna polymerase chain reaction was used to determine bacterial contamination in segment samples of rbcs before and after implementation of the new collection procedures. to evaluate whether these new procedures reduced bacterial contamination, we compared bacterial contamination rates of blood samples from diversion pouches with those of segment samples from the same donor's rbcs. results: the rate of bacterial contamination  of rbcs before implementation of the new collection procedures was 1.27%. most of the isolated bacteria were staphylococcus epidermidis or propionibacterium acnes. after implementation, this rate was significantly reduced to 0.10%. of the 233 whole blood samples obtained from the mie red cross blood center, 1.72% of blood  samples from diversion pouches were contaminated, but no bacterial contamination  was detected in segment samples from the same donor's rbcs after prestorage leukoreduction. conclusions: the new collection procedure significantly reduced bacterial contamination of rbc concentrates.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties of seaweed extracts against acne inducing bacteria, propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == this study was conducted to evaluate the antimicrobial activities of common seaweeds from the coast of south korea against the etiologic agents of acne vulgaris. fifty-seven species of seaweed were screened for potential antimicrobial activity. methanol extracts of 13 species (22.8%) showed inhibitory effects against propionibacterium acnes. the aqueous extracts of only two species (3.5%) showed antimicrobial activity. when tested with the agar disk diffusion method, ecklonia cava, e. kurome, ishige sinicola, and symphyocladia latiuscula had the strongest inhibitory effects. however, these four seaweed extracts showed no antibacterial activity against staphylococcus epidermidis at 5 mg disk-1. the  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of e. cava and e. kurome were both  0.31 mg ml-1 and the mic values of l. sinicola and s. latiuscula were 0.26 and 0.21 mg ml-1, respectively. among whole plants of e. cava and e. kurome, extracts of the pinnate blade had the highest inhibitory activity on bacterial growth. in  cytotoxicity assays, methanol extracts of e. cava, e. kurome, and i. sinicola showed no effect on cell viability at concentrations of 200 microg ml-1. however, the methanol extracts of s. latiuscula reduced cell viability rates to 50% at the same concentration. additionally, methanol extracts of e. cava, e. kurome, and i. sinicola potently inhibited the in vitro production of nitric oxide. these results suggest that the methanol extracts from these three species may be useful in the development of therapeutic agents for acne vulgaris. further investigations to determine the bioactive compound are in progress.

TI  == the breast: a clean-contaminated surgical site.
AB  == background: capsular contracture is one of the most common complications associated with breast implants. while the cause of this process has not yet been elucidated, subclinical infection is a likely culprit. objectives: the authors assess the hypothesis that a probable source of contamination is endogenous breast bacteria, likely originating in the ducts themselves and most concentrated near the nipple. methods: twenty-five healthy patients presenting for routine reduction mammaplasty were recruited as study participants. tissue samples were taken intraoperatively from the periareolar, inframammary, and axillary regions of each sampled breast. specimens were then processed in the microbiology laboratory, and quantitative bacterial counts were obtained. results: of the 50 breasts sampled, 19 yielded positive culture results, for a rate of 38%. there was a significant difference in the positive culture rate among all three sites,  with increasing quantitative bacterial counts in the axillary, inframammary, and  periareolar regions, respectively. the most commonly-identified organisms in this study included various species of staphylococcus and propionibacterium acnes, with s. epidermidis being the most common. conclusions: the breast harbors significant endogenous bacteria that can become the source of spontaneous or postoperative infection. positive intraoperative cultures with high quantitative  counts suggest that breast tissue harbors more bacteria than normal skin flora. routine perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis may be suboptimal for the prevention of foreign body seeding in this setting. furthermore, bacterial concentrations are highest in areas with the most ductal tissue, namely the periareolar region.  these findings may be helpful when considering which incision site to select for  augmentation mammaplasty.

TI  == cathelicidin-bf, a snake cathelicidin-derived antimicrobial peptide, could be an  excellent therapeutic agent for acne vulgaris.
AB  == cathelicidins are a family of antimicrobial peptides acting as multifunctional effector molecules in innate immunity. cathelicidin-bf has been purified from the snake venoms of bungarus fasciatus and it is the first identified cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide in reptiles. in this study, cathelicidin-bf was found exerting strong antibacterial activities against propionibacterium acnes. its minimal inhibitory concentration against two strains of p. acnes was 4.7 microg/ml. cathelicidin-bf also effectively killed other microorganisms including staphylococcus epidermidis, which was possible pathogen for acne vulgaris. cathelicidin-bf significantly inhibited pro-inflammatory factors secretion in human monocytic cells and p. acnes-induced o2.- production of human hacat keratinocyte cells. observed by scanning electron microscopy, the surfaces of the treated pathogens underwent obvious morphological changes compared with the untreated controls, suggesting that this antimicrobial peptide exerts its action  by disrupting membranes of microorganisms. the efficacy of cathelicidin-bf gel topical administering was evaluated in experimental mice skin colonization model. in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of cathelicidin-bf were confirmed by relieving  p. acnes-induced mice ear swelling and granulomatous inflammation. the anti-inflammatory effects combined with potent antimicrobial activities and o2.-  production inhibition activities of cathelicidin-bf indicate its potential as a novel therapeutic option for acne vulgaris.

AB  == infection after shoulder surgery is rare but potentially devastating. normal skin flora, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and propionibacterium acnes, are the most commonly isolated pathogens. perioperative  measures to prevent infection are of paramount importance, and clinical acumen is necessary for diagnosis. superficial infections may be managed with local wound measures and antibiotics; deep infections require surgical debridement in combination with antibiotic treatment. treating physicians must make difficult decisions regarding antibiotic duration and the elimination of the offending organisms by resection arthroplasty, direct implant exchange, or staged revision  arthroplasty. eradication of a deep infection is usually successful, but the course of treatment is often protracted, and tissue destruction and scar may adversely affect functional outcome.

TI  == impact of monocytic cells on recovery of uncultivable bacteria from atherosclerotic lesions.
AB  == objective: epidemiological evidence suggests that infections may contribute to atherogenesis. however, with the exception of chlamydophila pneumoniae, cultivable bacteria have not been recovered from atherosclerotic lesions. therefore, we aimed at developing an approach to recover uncultivable bacteria from atherectomy tissues. methods: we cultured homogenates from atherectomy specimens from seven nonseptic patients undergoing surgery for arterial obstruction either alone or together with thp-1 monocyte-like cells. we performed 16s rdna analysis, biochemical tests, random amplification of polymorphic dna pcr analysis, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) and immunohistofluorescence to identify the cultivated bacteria. wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to determine whether thp-1 treatment yielded a higher number of isolates than did the untreated controls. results: we recovered more bacteria from cocultures of atherectomy specimens with thp-1 cells than atherectomy specimens cultured alone. on average, tissue homogenates incubated with thp-1 cells versus control yielded 124 vs. 22 colony-forming units, a median of 140 vs. 7, respectively (p = 0.02). we recovered 872 isolates of limited number of species, including propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus infantis and the fastidious anaerobe porphyromonas gingivalis, and  confirmed its presence in tissue using double immunofluorescence imaging. qpcr demonstrated the presence of >/=3.5 x 10(3) p. gingivalis genomes per gram of atheromatous tissue. conclusions: these results indicate that viable previously uncultivable bacterial species are present within atheromas. our results suggest  revisiting the hypothesis that infections may have a causative role in atherosclerotic inflammation and have implications for research regarding novel diagnostics and treatments for cardiovascular disease.

TI  == detection of microbial contaminants in mammalian cell cultures using a new fluorescence-based staining method.
AB  == aims: microbial contamination of cell culture production processes is a current concern for biopharmaceutical industries. traditional testing methods require several days to detect contamination and may advantageously be replaced by a rapid detection method. we developed a new method combining membrane filtration to microcolonies fluorescence staining method (mfsm) and compared it to epifluorescence microscopy. methods and results: both methods were used to detect bacteria in cho cells cultures. the epifluorescence microscopy showed to be limited by filterability, media interference and nonrobustness issues, whereas mfsm enabled consistent detection of bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis  and propionibacterium acnes after, respectively, 8, 9 and 48 h of incubation. thanks to the nondestructive feature of the mfsm, stained membranes could be reincubated on culture media to yield visible colonies used for identification. conclusions: the new method described in this study showed its ability to detect  microbial contaminants in cell culture samples with time-to-results from 2-5 times shorter than the traditional testing method. significance and impact of the study: the mfsm can be used as monitoring tool for cell cultures to significantly shorten detection times of microbial contamination, while preserving the ability  to identify the contaminants and their viability.

AB  == the predominant cultivable microbiota from 20 refractory endodontic lesions (9 with abscesses and 11 without abscesses) were determined, and propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus epidermidis were among the most predominant organisms. the number of species identified from lesions with abscesses (14.1 +/- 2.6) was significantly greater (p < 0.001) than the number from lesions without abscesses  (7.4 +/- 5.9). comparison of perioral isolates using repetitive extragenic palindromic pcr of the same species from the same subjects demonstrated that the  endodontic and skin populations were significantly different. the p. acnes isolates were typed on the basis of reca gene sequence comparison, and only three types (types i, ii, and iii) were identified among 125 isolates examined. however, we found that type i (type ia and ib) isolates were primarily isolated from the skin, while types ii and iii were significantly more likely to be isolated from the endodontic lesions (p < 10(-10)). we found that the robustness  of the reca phylotypes was not strong by comparing the partial gene sequences of  six putative virulence determinants, pamce, pap60, pa-25957, pa-5541, pa-21293, and pa-4687. the resulting neighbor-joining trees were incongruent, and significant (phi test; p = 2.2 x 10(-7)) evidence of recombination was demonstrated, with significant phylogenetic heterogeneity being apparent within the clusters. p. acnes and s. epidermidis isolated from refractory endodontic infections, with or without periapical abscesses, are likely to be nosocomial infections.

TI  == infected rathke cleft cysts: distinguishing factors and factors predicting recurrence.
AB  == background: rathke cleft cysts (rccs) are benign sellar lesions that are generally asymptomatic but sometimes warrant transsphenoidal drainage. small case reports have described infected rccs, but this phenomenon remains uncharacterized. objective: we reviewed rccs over 23 years at our institution to  determine factors predicting infection and recurrence. methods: we retrospectively reviewed the magnetic resonance images, laboratory results, microbiology, and pathology of 176 rcc patients (1985-2008) who underwent initial operation at our institution (n = 170) or at another institution followed by recurrence managed at our institution (n = 6). results: there were 3 rcc categories: cysts cultured intraoperatively during initial surgery (n = 21), cysts not cultured during initial surgery but cultured during subsequent surgery  (n = 9), and cysts that were never cultured (n = 146). cultured cysts were larger (1.6 vs 1.2 cm; p = .002) and had more frequent pituitary dysfunction (76% vs 30%; p < .001) than noncultured cysts. restricted diffusion was also more common  in cultured cysts (50% vs 0%; p = .02). of cysts cultured at initial or subsequent surgery, 48% and 44%, respectively, had positive cultures (n = 14) and were treated with antibiotics. the most common organisms were staphylococcus epidermidis (64%) and propionibacterium acnes (57%). kaplan-meier recurrence rates were 13% (culture positive/antibiotic treated), 31% (culture negative/not antibiotic treated), and 9% (noncultured) (p = .002, cultured vs noncultured; p = .002, culture negative/not antibiotic treated vs non-cultured; p = .5 culture positive/antibiotic treated vs noncultured). conclusion: suspected rcc infection, regardless of culture results, is a strong predictor of recurrence and may warrant antibiotic treatment. with antibiotic treatment, the recurrence rate of infected rcc approaches that of noninfected cysts. the higher recurrence rates reported in other series may reflect underrecognition of occult infection.

TI  == the human nasal microbiota and staphylococcus aureus carriage.
AB  == background: colonization of humans with staphylococcus aureus is a critical prerequisite of subsequent clinical infection of the skin, blood, lung, heart and other deep tissues. s. aureus persistently or intermittently colonizes the nares  of approximately 50% of healthy adults, whereas approximately 50% of the general  population is rarely or never colonized by this pathogen. because microbial consortia within the nasal cavity may be an important determinant of s. aureus colonization we determined the composition and dynamics of the nasal microbiota and correlated specific microorganisms with s. aureus colonization. methodology/principal findings: nasal specimens were collected longitudinally from five healthy adults and a cross-section of hospitalized patients (26 s. aureus carriers and 16 non-carriers). culture-independent analysis of 16s rrna sequences revealed that the nasal microbiota of healthy subjects consists primarily of members of the phylum actinobacteria (e.g., propionibacterium spp. and corynebacterium spp.), with proportionally less representation of other phyla, including firmicutes (e.g., staphylococcus spp.) and proteobacteria (e.g.  enterobacter spp). in contrast, inpatient nasal microbiotas were enriched in s. aureus or staphylococcus epidermidis and diminished in several actinobacterial groups, most notably propionibacterium acnes. moreover, within the inpatient population s. aureus colonization was negatively correlated with the abundances of several microbial groups, including s. epidermidis (p = 0.004). conclusions/significance: the nares environment is colonized by a temporally stable microbiota that is distinct from other regions of the integument. negative association between s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and other groups suggests microbial competition during colonization of the nares, a finding that could be exploited to limit s. aureus colonization.

TI  == heart valve allograft decontamination with antibiotics: impact of the temperature of incubation on efficacy.
AB  == heart valve allografts are typically processed at 4 degrees c in north america, including the step of antibiotic decontamination. in our own experience with heart valve banking, we often observe persistent positive cultures following decontamination at wet ice temperature. we hypothesized that warmer temperatures  of incubation might increase the efficacy of the decontamination procedure. in a  first series of experiments, 12 different bacterial species were grown overnight, frozen in standardized aliquots and used directly to inoculate antibiotic cocktail aliquots at 10(5) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. the antibiotic cocktail contains vancomycin (50 mug/ml), gentamicin (80 mug/ml) and cefoxitin (240 mug/ml) in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium. inoculated aliquots were incubated at 4, 22 and 37 degrees c and cfus were determined at regular intervals up to 24  h post-inoculation. in a second set of experiments, 10 heart valves were spiked with 5000 cfu/ml and incubated with antibiotics at 4 and 37 degrees c for 24 h. the final rinse solutions of these heart valves were filtered and tested for bacterial growth. after 24 h of incubation, cfus of all 12 bacterial species were reduced by a factor of only one to two logs at 4 degrees c whereas log reductions of 3.7 and 5.0 or higher were obtained at 22 and 37 degrees c, respectively. most microorganisms, including staphylococcus epidermidis, lactococcus lactis lactis and propionibacterium acnes survived well the 24-h antibiotic treatment at 4 degrees c (< 1 log reduction). all 10 heart valves that were spiked with microorganisms had positive final rinse solutions after antibiotic soaking at 4 degrees c, whereas 8 out of 10 cultures were negative when antibiotic decontamination was done at 37 degrees c. these experiments show that a wet ice temperature greatly reduces the efficacy of the allograft decontamination process as microorganisms survived well to a 24-h 4 degrees c antibiotic treatment. this  could explain the high rate of positive post-processing cultures obtained with our routine tissue decontamination procedure. increasing the decontamination temperature from 4 to 37 degrees c may significantly reduce the incidence of post-disinfection bacterial contamination of heart valves.

TI  == inhibitory effects of fortunella japonica var. margarita and citrus sunki essential oils on nitric oxide production and skin pathogens.
AB  == a number of essential oils from citrus peels are claimed to have biological activities. citrus peel, called 'jin-pi', is used in traditional medicine for digestion, severe cold, and fever. however, the antibacterial activities against  skin pathogens and anti-inflammatory effects of the essential oils of citrus sunki (jingyul) and fortunella japonica var. margarita (gumgyul) have not yet been described. therefore, in this study, the essential oils of the citrus species c. sunki (cse) and f. japonica var. margarita (fje), both native to the island of jeju, korea, were examined for their anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities against skin pathogens. four human skin pathogenic microorganisms, staphylococcus epidermidis ccarm 3709, propionibacterium acnes ccarm 0081, malassezia furfur kccm 12679, and candida albicans kccm 11282, were studied. cse and fje exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against most of the  pathogenic bacteria and yeast strains that were tested. interestingly, cse and fje even showed antimicrobial activity against antibiotic-resistant s. epidermidis ccarm 3710, s. epidermidis ccarm 3711, p. acnes ccarm9009, and p. acnes ccarm9010 strains. in addition, cse and fje reduced the lipopolysaccharide  (lps)-induced secretion of nitric oxide (no) in raw 264.7 cells, indicating that  they have anti-inflammatory effects. we also analysed the chemical composition of the oils by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) and identified several major components, including dl-limonene (68.18%) and beta-myrcene (4.36%) for cse, and dl-limonene (61.58%) and carvone (6.36%) for fje. taken together, these  findings indicate that cse and fje have great potential to be used in human skin  health applications.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of silver-processed catheters for neurosurgery.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of silver-processed catheters for use in neurosurgery using clinically predictive tests. methods: the antimicrobial activity of a commercially available silver-processed external ventricular drain catheter was evaluated against staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), escherichia coli and propionibacterium acnes. non-impregnated catheters were used as controls. two assays were performed: (i) testing the ability of the catheter to kill 100% of the attached bacteria (tk100); and (ii) in vitro challenge to determine the ability to prevent colonization under flow conditions. high and low inocula (10(4) and 10(7) cfu/ml) were used. silver-processed and control catheters were examined by scanning electron microscopy and focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy; electron back-scatter and energy-dispersive x-ray analyses were used to investigate the distribution of silver within the processed catheter. results: the silver-processed catheters were not able to kill any of the bacteria tested in the tk100 assay at high inoculum. at low inoculum s. epidermidis was eradicated and some activity was seen against e. coli but without complete eradication. mrsa was also not eradicated even at low inoculum. the in vitro challenge test showed no prevention of colonization for any of the strains. silver particles were shown to be >500 nm in size. conclusions: the commercial silver-impregnated catheter was not able to eradicate mrsa or e. coli and while it showed activity against s. epidermidis in one assay it was unable to prevent colonization in vitro under in-flow conditions. this is consistent with clinical  studies on silver-processed catheters.

TI  == sterilization of platelet concentrates at production scale by irradiation with short-wave ultraviolet light.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (pcs) is recognized  as a serious threat to transfusion safety. we developed a simple method for sterilization of pcs with short-wave ultraviolet light (uvc). the effects of treatment on the sterility of contaminated pcs and in vitro platelet (plt) variables were evaluated. study design and methods: plasma-reduced pcs were prepared from pools of five buffy coats. irradiation with uvc (wavelength, 254 nm) under vigorous agitation was from both sides of the irradiation bags. kinetics of the inactivation of bacillus cereus, propionibacterium acnes, and staphylococcus epidermidis were determined. pcs spiked with approximately 10 to 100 colony-forming units (cfus)/ml of 10 bacteria species (n = 12/species) were irradiated with uvc doses between 0.25 and 0.4 j/cm(2) and tested for sterility by a commercially available bacterial detection system (bact/alert, biomerieux) after storage at 22 degrees c for 3 or 6 days. the influence of a dose of 0.3 j/cm(2) on plt variables was investigated on days 1, 4, and 6 after irradiation.  results: at 0.3 j/cm(2) all bacteria species tested were inactivated by more than 4 log. at this dose the influence of uvc on in vitro plt variables was marginal;  the storage stability for up to 6 days after treatment was maintained. pcs spiked with approximately 10 to 100 cfus/ml were reproducibly sterilized in the dose range tested. in individual experiments with the spore former b. cereus, pcs were, however, unsterile after treatment. conclusion: irradiation at uvc doses not detrimental to in vitro plt variables sterilizes pcs contaminated with a wide range of different bacteria species.

TI  == screening of platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination: spectrum of bacteria detected, proportion of transfused units, and clinical follow-up.
AB  == screening of platelet concentrates (pcs) for bacterial contamination with cultivation methods is carried out as a routine procedure in some countries. the  aim is to prevent the transfusion of contaminated pcs. the german evaluation of regular monitoring study group conducted a prospective multicenter study on 52,243 pcs to investigate the prevalence of bacteria (bact/alert, biomerieux). this study describes the detected bacterial spectrum, the proportion of pcs with  a positive test result that had been transfused, and the results of the clinical  follow-up. one hundred thirteen (67%) of 169 potentially or confirmed positive units had already been transfused at the time of the first positive signal. the transfusion of units contaminated by staphylococcus aureus, serratia marcescens,  and 73% of the units contaminated with staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis, or staphylococcus saccharolyticus was prevented. in contrast, 85% of units with propionibacterium acnes were transfused. a clonal relationship of the  isolates from the pooled pcs and from the associated red blood cell concentrates  was found in all investigated cases. the follow-up revealed six febrile reactions to culture-positive pcs not classified as transfusion reaction (trs) by treating  physicians. this demonstrates the importance of hemovigilance. serious septic reactions due to klebsiella pneumoniae in two units of one apheresis pc that had  tested false-negative were reported; one had a fatal outcome. culture systems reduce the risk of transfusion of contaminated pcs but cannot guarantee sterility. physicians must be aware of bacterial contamination of pcs as a potential cause of trs and must report all adverse events.

TI  == sonication is superior to scraping for retrieval of bacteria in biofilm on titanium and steel surfaces in vitro.
AB  == background and purpose: low-virulence implant infections are characterized by bacterial colonization of the implant with subsequent biofilm formation. in these cases, soft tissue biopsies often prove to be culture negative. consequently, detachment of the causative adherent bacteria is crucial for correct microbiological diagnosis. using an in vitro model, we compared 4 methods of biofilm sampling from metal surfaces. methods: discs of titanium and steel were incubated in the presence of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and propionibacterium acnes in mueller hinton broth. non-adherent bacteria were removed by repeated rinsing of the discs. 10 parallels of each disc were subjected to 1 of 4 methods for bacterial recovery: (a) sonication of the discs, (b) scraping of the discs using surgical blades followed by streaking of the blades onto agar plates, (c) scraping of the discs followed by vortex mixing of the surgical blades, and (d) scraping of the discs followed by sonication of the surgical blades. quantitative bacterial cultures were performed for each sampling method. results: with the exception of s. epidermidis on steel, sonication efficiently and reliably dislodged biofilm bacteria. the scraping methods employed did not detach bacteria embedded in biofilm. interpretation: scraping of metal surfaces is not an adequate method for sampling of biofilm bacteria in vitro.

TI  == antimicrobial property of lauric acid against propionibacterium acnes: its therapeutic potential for inflammatory acne vulgaris.
AB  == the strong bactericidal properties of lauric acid (c12:0), a middle chain-free fatty acid commonly found in natural products, have been shown in a number of studies. however, it has not been demonstrated whether lauric acid can be used for acne treatment as a natural antibiotic against propionibacterium acnes (p. acnes), which promotes follicular inflammation (inflammatory acne). this study evaluated the antimicrobial property of lauric acid against p. acnes both in vitro and in vivo. incubation of the skin bacteria p. acnes, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), and staphylococcus epidermidis (s. epidermidis) with lauric acid yielded minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values against the bacterial  growth over 15 times lower than those of benzoyl peroxide (bpo). the lower mic values of lauric acid indicate stronger antimicrobial properties than that of bpo. the detected values of half maximal effective concentration (ec(50)) of lauric acid on p. acnes, s. aureus, and s. epidermidis growth indicate that p. acnes is the most sensitive to lauric acid among these bacteria. in addition, lauric acid did not induce cytotoxicity to human sebocytes. notably, both intradermal injection and epicutaneous application of lauric acid effectively decreased the number of p. acnes colonized with mouse ears, thereby relieving p.  acnes-induced ear swelling and granulomatous inflammation. the obtained data highlight the potential of using lauric acid as an alternative treatment for antibiotic therapy of acne vulgaris.

AB  == background: recent studies suggest an association between sciatica and propionibacterium acnes. "modic type i changes" in the vertebrae are closely associated with sciatica and lower back pain, and recent studies have questioned  the ability of conventional magnetic resonance imaging (mri) to differentiate between degenerative modic type i changes and vertebral abnormalities caused by infection. purpose: to test whether bacteria could be cultured from biopsies of modic type i changes. material and methods: twenty-four consecutive patients with modic type i changes in lumbar vertebrae had a biopsy taken from the affected vertebra by a strict aseptic procedure. the biopsy was split into two specimens,  which were inoculated into thioglycolate agar tubes in the surgical theatre and transported to the microbiology laboratory. in the laboratory, one specimen was streaked onto plates and analyzed for anaerobic and aerobic culture. the other tube was left unopened and incubated directly. plates and tubes were incubated for 2 weeks and observed for visible growth. results: none of the biopsies yielded growth of anaerobic bacteria. in one patient, both biopsies yielded growth of staphylococcus epidermidis, and in another patient coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated from one biopsy. both patients received oral antibiotics without convincing effect on symptoms. conclusion: our results showed no evidence of bacteria in vertebrae with modic type i changes. the isolation of  staphylococci from two patients probably represented contamination.

AB  == little is known about the number, type, or antibiotic resistance profiles, of air-borne microbes present in hospital settings yet such information is important in designing effective measures to reduce cross-infection. in this study settle plates were used to identify and quantify the air-borne microbes present in a dental clinic. all isolates were identified to species level using partial 16s ribosomal rna gene sequencing and their susceptibility to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, gentamicin, penicillin, tetracycline or vancomycin was performed. the mean numbers of viable bacteria detected for each sampling occasion during periods of clinical activity and in the absence of such activity  were 21.9 x 10(2 )cfu/m2/h and 2.3 x 10(2 )cfu/m2/h respectively. one hundred ninety-three distinct colony morphotypes, comprising 73 species, were isolated during the study and 48% of these were resistant to at least one antibiotic. the  mean numbers of different morphotypes detected per sampling occasion were 14.3 and 5 during periods of clinical activity and inactivity respectively. propionibacterium acnes, micrococcus luteus and staphylococcus epidermidis were frequently isolated regardless of whether any clinical activities were taking place. these findings highlight the importance of preventing surfaces from becoming reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and thereby contributing to  cross-infection in the dental clinic.

TI  == acne is not associated with yet-uncultured bacteria.
AB  == current clinical and microbiological information on acne fails to demonstrate a clear association between particular species, including propionibacterium acnes,  and disease, and the disease continues to be a considerable problem. to test if acne is associated with hitherto uncultured bacteria residing in diseased skin follicles, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of approximately 5,700 amplified  and cloned 16s rrna genes were used to determine the microbial diversity in follicles from acne patients and healthy individuals and from the superficial skin of acne patients. follicles from healthy skin were exclusively colonized by  p. acnes, whereas the follicular microbiota of acne patients included, in addition, staphylococcus epidermidis and minor proportions of other species. in comparison, samples from superficial skin showed a complex microbiota represented by 12 to 16 bacterial species. the findings of the study exclude the possibility  that acne is associated with yet-uncultured bacteria and shows that healthy skin  follicles constitute a remarkably exclusive habitat allowing colonization only by p. acnes.

TI  == monitoring the physiologic stress response: a novel biophysical approach for the  rapid detection of bacteria in platelet concentrate.
AB  == background: currently approved culture-based methods for the bacterial testing of platelet concentrates (pcs) require an extended period of time to obtain results. a new approach based on the monitoring of the bacterial response to physiologic stress is presented. because the stress response is independent of the growth rate, decisive results can be obtained in near real time. study design and methods: pcs were spiked with gram-positive staphylococcus epidermidis and propionibacterium acnes and gram-negative escherichia coli organisms commonly implicated in posttransfusion septic reactions. all suspensions were treated with triton x-100 at concentrations that caused human cell lysis while acting as a stressor for bacterial cells. normalized impedance response (nir) profiles of these suspensions were recorded using the biosense technologies differential impedance sensing platform specifically designed to monitor subtle changes in the dielectric properties of biologic suspensions. further development of the approach included measurement of nirs for spiked pcs treated with nonlysing chemical stressors. results: nir profiles for bacteria conventionally growing under optimal conditions were characterized by an overall increase in the nir values. in contrast, the corresponding responses from chemically stressed bacteria revealed immediate and continuous decreases in value-enabling bacterial  detection in less than 30 minutes. conclusion: these pilot experiments demonstrated that monitoring of the bacterial stress response is a fast and effective way to detect bacteria in pcs. in addition, special culture conditions  are not required for detecting anaerobes and fastidious species.

TI  == preoperative disinfection of the conjunctival sac with antibiotics and iodine compounds: a prospective randomized multicenter study.
AB  == purpose: to compare disinfection by povidone-iodine (pi) solution with that by polyvinyl alcohol-iodine (pai) solution in preoperative eyewash and to assess the optimal duration of the preoperative application of 0.5% levofloxacin (lvfx) ophthalmic solution. methods: two-hundred-seventy-two elderly cataract patients who had undergone phacoemulsification aspiration with intraocular lens insertion  at 12 clinical facilities in japan were randomized into three groups: 3-day, 1-day, and 1-h preoperative application of 0.5% lvfx ophthalmic solution. each lvfx group was further divided into two subgroups; the patients in one subgroup were treated with diluted pi eyewash, and those in the second subgroup with diluted pai eyewash, immediately before the surgery. thus, a total of six groups  were studied. conjunctival scrapings were collected four times: before lvfx application, after lvfx application, after the eyewash with iodine compounds, and after the surgery. samples of the aqueous humor were collected immediately after  the surgery. all samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically. results: the 3-day application of lvfx had a significantly higher disinfection rate than the 1-day or 1-h applications (p<0.05). the disinfection rate of pi was 78.0%, and that of pai was 79.4%; pai was not inferior to pi as a preoperative disinfectant. however, new isolates, mainly propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected after lvfx application and even after use of the eyewash with iodine compounds. conclusion: three-day administration of lvfx ophthalmic solution and use of an eyewash with diluted iodine compounds is effective for preoperative disinfection. however, complete elimination of bacteria from the conjunctival sac is difficult.

TI  == antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects of jeju medicinal plants against acne-inducing bacteria.
AB  == propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus epidermidis are pus-forming bacteria that trigger inflammation in acne. the present study was conducted to evaluate the antimicrobial activities of jeju medicinal plants against these etiologic agents of acne vulgaris. ethanol extracts of jeju plants were tested for antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and broth dilution methods. the results from the disc diffusion assays revealed that four medicinal plants, mollugo pentaphylla, angelica anomala, matteuccia orientalis, and orixa japonica  inhibited the growth of both pathogens. among these, a. anomala had strong inhibitory effects. its mic values were 15.6 microg/ml and 125 microg/ml against  p. acnes and s. epidermidis, respectively. the cytotoxic effects of the four extracts were determined by colorimetric mtt assays using two animal cell lines:  human dermal fibroblasts and hacat cells. although the m. orientalis root extract had moderate cytotoxicity in hacat cells at 200 microg/ml, most extracts exhibited low cytotoxicity at 200 microg/ml in both cell lines. in addition, the  extracts reduced the p. acnes-induced secretion of interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) in thp-1 cells, an indication of their anti-inflammatory effects. based on these results, we suggest that m. pentaphylla, a. anomala, m. orientalis, and o. japonica are attractive acne-mitigating candidates for topical application.

TI  == infection associated with hematoma formation after shoulder arthroplasty.
AB  == hematoma formation requiring operative treatment after shoulder arthroplasty may  be associated with higher patient morbidity. we therefore determined whether there was an association of hematoma formation requiring operative treatment with deep infection after shoulder arthroplasty. between 1978 and 2006, we performed 4147 shoulder arthroplasties in 3643 patients. of these, 12 shoulders (0.3%) underwent reoperation for hematoma formation. the mean time interval from arthroplasty to surgery for the hematoma was 7 days (range, 0.5-31 days). among nine cases in which cultures were taken, six had positive cultures; the organisms included propionibacterium acnes in three, staphylococcus epidermidis in one, streptococcus species in one, and staphylococcus epidermidis with peptostreptococcus in one. the minimum followup was 12 months (mean, 68 months; range, 12 to 294 months). two of the 12 patients eventually underwent resection arthroplasty for deep infection. the neer score was excellent in one, satisfactory in six, and unsatisfactory in five patients. the data suggest hematoma formation after shoulder arthroplasty is often accompanied by positive intraoperative cultures. the surgeon should be aware of the high rate of unsatisfactory results associated with this complication as well as the possibility of developing a deep infection requiring additional surgery. level of evidence: level iv, prognostic study. see guidelines for authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

TI  == treatment of primary isolated shoulder sepsis in the adult patient.
AB  == isolated shoulder sepsis is an uncommon clinical problem with little information  in the literature on causative organisms and potential sequelae. we examined the  organisms involved, surgical treatments, antibiotic treatments rendered, and complications in these cases. we retrospectively reviewed the records of 19 adult patients (19 shoulders) who underwent operative treatment of isolated shoulder sepsis from 1996 to 2005. patient age, gender, laboratory studies, previous treatment, surgical procedures, surgical findings, cultured organism, antibiotic  treatment, and complications were reviewed. the organisms included methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (five), streptococcus b beta hemolytic (five), staphylococcus epidermidis (three), negative cultures (two), streptococcus viridans (one), escherichia coli (one), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (one), and propionibacterium acnes (one). we treated patients with intravenous antibiotics an average of 4.2 weeks (range, 3-8 weeks). one patient underwent humeral head resection with an antibiotic spacer. another patient died  during hospitalization. open or arthroscopic debridement in conjunction with appropriate antibiotics appears effective in eradicating infection in most adults who present with shoulder sepsis. functional outcome is poor in those patients with irreparable rotator cuff tears and/or cartilage loss. level of evidence: level iv, therapeutic study. see the guidelines for authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

TI  == chemical composition and biological activities of essential oils extracted from korean endemic citrus species.
AB  == the aim of this study was to analyze the chemical composition of 14 kinds of citrus oils and to test their biological activities. citrus essential oils were obtained by steam distillation from immature fruits collected from jeju island and were analyzed using gas chromatograph (gc)- flame ionization detectors (fid)  and gc-ms. limonene (55.4% to 91.7%), myrcene (2.1% to 32.1%), alpha-pinene (0.6% to 1.6%) and linalool (0.4% to 6.9%) were the major components in most citrus species. to evaluate in vitro antibacterial activity, all essential oils were tested against propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus epidermidis. nine out of fourteen citrus oils exhibited antibacterial activity against p. acnes, but not against s. epidermidis. the effects of the citrus oils on dpph radical scavenging, superoxide radical anion scavenging, nitric oxide radical, and cytotoxicity were also assessed. three essential citrus oils, joadeung, dongjunggyul, and bujiwha, exhibited potent inhibitory effects on nitric oxide production. two essential oils, dongjunggyul and joadeung, showed potent free radical scavenging activities in the dpph assay. for future applications in cosmetic products, we also performed mtt assays in a human dermal fibroblast cell line. the majority of the essential oils showed no cytotoxicity. the results indicate that citrus essential oils can be useful natural agents for cosmetic application.

TI  == microbial colonization of an in vitro model of a tissue engineered human skin equivalent--a novel approach.
AB  == this was a preliminary investigation to define the conditions of colonization of  a human skin equivalent (se) model with cutaneous microorganisms. ses of 24 mm diameter were constructed with a dermal matrix of fibrin containing fibroblasts and a stratified epidermis. microbial colonization of the ses was carried out in  a dry environment, comparable to 'in vivo' skin, using a blotting technique to remove inoculation fluid. the microbial communities were sampled by scrub washing and viable cells enumerated on selective growth medium. staphylococcus epidermidis, propionibacterium acnes and malassezia furfur (human skin commensals) and staphylococcus aureus (transient pathogen) were colonized at inoculum densities of 10(2)-10(6) cfu se(-1) on the surface of replicate ses. growth of all species was supported for upto 72-120 h, with recovery densities of between 10(4)-10(9) cfu se(-1). a novel, real-time growth monitoring method was also developed, using s. aureus containing a lux cassette. light output increased from 20 to 95 h, and colonization increased from 10(2) to 10(8) cfu se(-1), as confirmed by conventional recovery. thus, the se model has potential to investigate interactions between resident and transient microbial communities with themselves and their habitat, and for testing treatments to control pathogen colonization of human skin.

TI  == microcalorimetry: a novel method for detection of microbial contamination in platelet products.
AB  == background: measuring heat from replicating microorganisms in culture may be a rapid, accurate, and simple screening method for platelets (plts). microcalorimetry for detection of microorganisms in in vitro contaminated plt products was evaluated. study design and methods: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguinis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and candida albicans were inoculated in single-donor apheresis plts to achieve target concentrations of 10(5), 10(3), 10, or 1 colony-forming units (cfu) per ml of plts. contaminated plts in growth medium were incubated at 37 degrees c for 5 days in a calorimeter. positivity was defined as heat flow of at least 10 microw above the lowest value of the power-time curve. results: with microcalorimetry, inocula of 10 cfus per ml plts  could be detected with the following detection times: s. epidermidis (31.65 hr),  s. aureus (24.24 hr), s. sanguinis (7.82 hr), e. coli (7.53 hr), p. acnes (73.57  hr), and c. albicans (43.77 hr). the detection time was less than 4 hr at 10(5) cfus per ml plts for s. aureus, s. sanguinis, and e. coli. noncontaminated plts remained negative. the total heat ranged from 2.8 (s. sanguinis) to 8.3 j (e. coli). the shape of the power-time curve was species-specific and independent from the initial concentration of microorganisms. conclusion: the detection limit of microcalorimetry was 1 to 10 cfus per ml plts. microcalorimetry is a promising novel method for detection of contaminated plts. applying this method to all plt  products could reduce the frequency of transfusion-related sepsis and prolong the shelf life of plts.

TI  == prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  == background: this study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (plt)  components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. study design and methods: twenty-one double-dose plts were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml). after split, each plt unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 cfus. one unit was photochemically treated (pct; 150 micromol/l amotosalen and 3 j/cm(2) ultraviolet a). the other unit was untreated. all units were stored and sampled on days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the bact/alert system (biomerieux). plts were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. results: in all pct plts, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. in untreated plts, staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. growth of 1 to 10 cfus per unit staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 cfus per unit of klebsiella pneumoniae, and  1 to 1000 cfus per unit propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. low levels of streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 cfus/unit), escherichia coli (1-100 cfus/unit), and clostridium  perfringens (1-100 cfus/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. conclusions: for the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated plts may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. in contrast, bacterial  inactivation by pct could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of plts contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.

AB  == background: the germs group initiated a prospective multicenter study to assess prevalence and nature of bacterial contamination of pooled buffy-coat platelet concentrates (ppcs) and apheresis platelet concentrates (apcs) by routine screening with a bacterial culture system. study design and methods: in nine centers overall, 52,243 platelet (plt) concentrates (15,198 apcs, 37,045 ppcs) were analyzed by aerobic and anaerobic cultures (bact/alert, biomerieux). results: in 135 plt concentrates (pcs; 0.26%), bacteria could be identified in the first culture (0.4% for apcs vs. 0.2% for ppcs; p < 0.001). in 37 (0.07%) of  these pc units, the same bacteria strain could be identified in a second culture  from the sample bag and/or the pc unit. the rate of confirmed-positive units did  not differ significantly between apc (0.09%; 1/1169) and ppc units (0.06%; 1/1544). bacteria from skin flora (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis) were the most prevalent contaminants. median times to first positive culture from start of incubation were 0.7 and 3.7 days in aerobic and anaerobic cultures for confirmed-positive units. with a "negative-to-date" issue strategy,  most pc units (55%) had already been issued by time of the first positive culture. conclusion: the rate of confirmed bacterial contamination of pc units was low. nevertheless, clinicians must be aware of this risk. the risk of bacterial contamination does not warrant universal preference of apcs. it must be questioned whether routine bacterial screening by a culture method can sufficiently prevent contaminated products from being transfused due to the delay until a positive signal in the culture system and due to false-negative results.

TI  == biofilm formation by propionibacterium acnes on biomaterials in vitro and in vivo: impact on diagnosis and treatment.
AB  == propionibacterium acnes is found increasingly as a cause of delayed infection, usually involving implanted biomaterials. despite susceptibility to common antibiotics, such infections are very difficult to treat and usually require surgical removal of the device. three clinical isolates of p. acnes were assessed for ability to adhere to titanium, surgical steel and silicone, with and without  a plasma conditioning film. after adherence, the biomaterials were then incubated for a further 6 days and examined for biofilm development. all three isolates adhered to all three biomaterials similarly. importantly, we were able to demonstrate biofilm formation, including production of exopolymer similar in appearance to the polysaccharide intercellular adhesin of staphylococcus epidermidis. a case summary also demonstrated failure to eradicate p. acnes infection in a hydrocephalus shunt after prolonged treatment. the removed shunt showed obvious biofilm formation, initially obscured by exopolymer when viewed by environmental scanning electron microscopy. biofilm development by p. acnes explains the difficulties encountered in clinical management of such infections.

TI  == bacteraemia in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa undergoing carbon dioxide laser surgery: detection and quantification of bacteria by lysis-filtration.
AB  == background: hidradenitis suppurativa (hs) is a cicatrising and persistent disease of apocrine gland-bearing areas in adults. the severity of this condition varies  from a few suppurating lesions to widespread, disabling disease. the aetiology is obscure, but suggested contributory factors include a genetic predisposition, comedones occluding the pilosebaceous apparatus, bacterial infections, and hormonal factors. treatment consists mainly of surgery, while medical therapies serve principally as adjunct therapy. objectives: the aim of the study was to determine the number and type of bacteria circulating in the bloodstream in patients with hs undergoing surgical treatment with a carbon dioxide laser stripping-secondary intention technique. methods: twenty-one patients (20 females and 1 male, mean age 36, range 20-55 years) were included in the study. one blood sample (8.3 ml) was taken before surgery, one during the operation and the last one 10 min after surgery. five healthy persons (all females, mean age 36, range 23-48 years) not undergoing any operation were used as the controls. the blood was cultured by a lysis-filtration technique which had been shown to be very sensitive. since the filter catches the microorganisms and colonies are formed during culturing, the number of bacteria in the samples is easily determined. results: in 6 patients, all samples were negative, which indicates that the method of surgery itself caused no spread of bacteria from the lesions. bacterial growth in the first blood sample was found in 9 patients, from the second sample  in 10 and from the third one in 6. in 1 patient, bacteria were detected in three  samples. at least 12 bacterial species were identified. the dominating bacteria were coagulase-negative staphylococci of which most were subtyped as staphylococcus warneri. among the anaerobic microorganisms, propionibacterium acnes and p.granulosum were the most frequently isolated bacteria. the bacterial  findings in the blood samples accord well with the results from a previous study  in which cultures were taken from the deep parts of the hs lesions. in the 5 controls, no microbial growth was detected. conclusion: the carbon dioxide laser  stripping technique caused no additional spread of bacteria into the bloodstream. the evaluation of cultures containing microorganisms from normal skin flora is controversial. since the bacteria encountered in this study are in close agreement with the findings in cultures from the deeper parts of hs lesions they  seem to be relevant. the growth of bacteria in the first blood sample taken before surgery may indicate that some of these patients have bacteria continuously circulating in their blood.

AB  == an acidic polysaccharide cs-f2 from camellia sinensis was examined to characterize its anti-adhesive effects against pathogenic bacteria, most notably  helicobacter pylori, propionibacterium acnes, and staphylococcus aureus. cs-f2 showed marked inhibitory activity against the pathogen-mediated hemagglutination  with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) between 0.01 and 0.1 mg/ml, which is lower than the previously reported mic values for panax ginseng and artemisia  capillaris. the inhibitory effects of cs-f2 on the adhesion of h. pylori to ags adenocarcinoma gastric epithelial cells, or p. acnes and s. aureus to nih 3t3 fibroblast cells, were further assessed resulting in mic values between 0.063 and 0.13 mg/ml. importantly, cs-f2 showed no inhibitory effects against lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, or staphylococcus epidermidis. our results suggest that cs-f2, which is a pectin-type polysaccharide with a molecular weight of approximately 8.0 x 10(4) da, may exert a selective anti-adhesive effect against  certain pathogenic bacteria, while exerting no effects against beneficial and commensal bacteria.

TI  == transfer of bacteria between biomaterials surfaces in the operating room--an experimental study.
AB  == bacterial adhesion to and transfer between surfaces is a complicated process. with regard to the success of biomaterials implants, studies on bacterial adhesion and transfer should not be confined to biomaterials surfaces in the human body, but also encompass surfaces in the operating room, where the origin of many biomaterials related infections is found. the purpose of this study was to quantify the transfer of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and propionibacterium acnes from one operating room material to another, while accounting for surface hydrophobicity and roughness, moistness and application of friction during transfer. the tested operating room materials were gloves, broaches (orthopaedic drills), theatre gowns, and light handles. as a possible clinical intervention method to prevent transfer, it was investigated whether dipping the gloves in a chlorhexidine splash-basin affected the viability of the  transferred bacteria. transfer (moist and without friction) was demonstrated to some extent with all bacterial strains and with every material, ranging from 17%  to 71%, and was influenced by the bacterial strain, moistness of the inoculum, the application of friction, and the characteristics of both the donating and the receiving surface. dipping the glove material in 4% or 0.4% chlorhexidine solutions killed all bacteria present, regardless of whether surfaces were dried  or moist and thus prevented transfer.

AB  == purpose: we studied whether topical antibiotics prevent endophthalmitis after cataract surgery. methods: cefmenoxime hydrochloride (cmx) or artificial tears (at) were randomly instilled 72 hours before surgery. conjunctival swab samples were taken before the instillation of eye drops (1) and after the instillation of eye drops (2). aqueous humor (3) was cultured intraoperatively. results: positive cultures were found in the cmx group of eyes in 76.3% of (1) samples, 58.1% of (2) samples, and 6.0% of (3) samples. in the at group of eyes, positive cultures  were found in 78.6% of (1) samples, 63.8% of (2) samples, and 2.9% of (3) samples. cmx was not effective. in the cmx group of eyes, staphylococcus epidermidis was found in 59 eyes of group (1), 5 eyes of group (2), and 0 eyes of group (3). in the at group of eyes, s. epidermidis was found in 70 eyes of group  (1), 26 eyes of group (2), and 1 eye of group (3). in the cases where s. epidermidis was decreased by cmx topical use propionibacterium acnes was increased. conclusions: there is a possibility that preoperative topical use of cmx can reduce s. epidermidis. on the other hand, it might increase p. acnes. considering these results and the fact that there was no difference in effectiveness in the aqueous humor cultures, preoperative cmx topical use may not prevent postoperative endophthalmitis except for endophthalmitis due to s. epidermidis.

TI  == an in vitro study of antimicrobial activity and efficacy of iodine-generating hydrogel dressings.
AB  == objective: to determine the antimicrobial activity and efficacy of different formulations of novel bioxygenating hydrogel dressings (which deliver both iodine and oxygen into the wound) against various target organisms by means of an in vitro test system that more effectively mimics the conditions encountered when dressings are in contact with wounds. method: three bioxygenating hydrogels were  tested: oxyzyme, which releases low levels of iodine into the wound, and iodozyme 402 and iodozyme 401, which release higher levels of iodine, with iodozyme 402 releasing twice the amount of 401. cellulose filter disks (n = 32) were inoculated with indicator species and placed equidistant from each other as a matrix onto agar test beds. cut squares of control or test dressings were placed  on top of each disk. kill curves were constructed from determinations of the numbers of survivors (log cfu per disk) over time by removing disk samples at various time points. results: significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between the controls and test samples. the order of sensitivity for oxyzyme was fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), candida albicans and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the order of efficacy of the three hydrogel dressings (iodozyme 402, followed by iodozyme 401 and then oxyzyme) was  the same regardless of the target species. conclusion: the novel hydrogel skin surface wound dressings are broad-spectrum in activity, encompassing antibiotic-resistant organisms, anaerobes and yeasts; their antimicrobial function appears to be rapidly effective.

TI  == revision shoulder arthroplasty with positive intraoperative cultures: the value of preoperative studies and intraoperative histology.
AB  == currently, there are no reported results of patients without overt infection who  had a positive intraoperative culture during revision shoulder arthroplasty. we therefore reviewed the intraoperative and preoperative investigations as well as  the postoperative course of these patients who had positive intraoperative cultures. we reviewed the results of 75 shoulders without overt infection that underwent revision shoulder arthroplasty at our institution between january 1, 1974 and december 31, 2002 who had positive intraoperative cultures. preoperatively, the results of 67 (93%) of 72 white-blood-cell counts were negative, 64 (91%) of 70 polymorphonuclear percentage distributions were negative, and 36 (86%) of 42 samples of erythrocyte sedimentation rate were negative. c-reactive protein concentration was measured in 16 patients, of which  12 (75%) had negative results. results of intraoperative histologic evaluations were negative in 67 (92%) of 73 patients. the most common pathogen cultured was propionibacterium acnes in 45 of 75, followed by staphylococcus epidermidis in 10 of 75. another operation was necessary in 10 (13%) of 75 shoulders to decrease pain or improve function. the mean time to re-revision was 2.5 years. the data from this study suggest that there are no good preoperative or intraoperative investigations to detect who will have a positive intraoperative culture at the time of revision shoulder arthroplasty.

TI  == effect of bacteriocin produced by lactococcus sp. hy 449 on skin-inflammatory bacteria.
AB  == this study was carried out to evaluate the effect of bacteriocin produced by lactococcus sp. hy 449 against skin-inflammatory bacteria such as staphylococcus  epidermidis atcc 12228, staphylococcus aureus atcc 65389, streptococcus pyogenes  atcc 21059, and propionibacterium acnes atcc 6919. the spot-on-the-lawn method was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin against indicator strains on the human skin. the bacteriocin produced by lactococcus sp. hy 449 inhibited the growth of s. epidermidis atcc 12228, s. aureus atcc 65389, strep. pyogenes atcc 21059, and p. acnes atcc 6919. the treatment of crude bacteriocin caused a rapid inactivation of p. acnes atcc 6919. the lc50 of bacteriocin on human fibroblast was ca. 50mg/ml at which the inhibition of cell proliferation was not observed. neither any irritations nor allergic reactions by the bacteriocin were evident in a human patch test. the bacteriocin produced by lactococcus sp. hy 449 may be a useful antimicrobial substance to control the growth of p. acnes and to prevent skin inflammation and acne.

TI  == role of intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide in the treatment of postoperative endophthalmitis.
AB  == purpose: to report the use of commercially available triamcinolone acetonide as adjunct treatment for acute-onset endophthalmitis after intraocular procedures. methods: charts of 14 patients who received intravitreal triamcinolone in combination with intravitreal antibiotics for treatment of acute endophthalmitis  were reviewed. patients were included if they presented with pain, vision loss, and severe anterior chamber reaction or hypopyon. visual acuities, intraocular pressures, anterior chamber reaction, and view of fundus details were recorded at baseline, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months to 5 months. results: culture-positive results were found for 57% (8/14) of patients. isolated species  included staphylococcus epidermidis, viridans streptococcus, group d streptococcus (nonenterococcus), propionibacterium acnes, and diphtheroid bacilli. visual acuities improved an average of 7.5 snellen lines. preendophthalmitis level visual acuities were recovered in 78.6% patients (11/14), with 64% (9/14) of patients achieving visual acuity of 20/40 or better regardless of presenting vision. resolution of anterior chamber reaction and view of fundus details were consistent with visual acuities. conclusions: intravitreal triamcinolone combined with intravitreal antibiotics appears to have a safety profile similar to current modalities with a favorable effect on visual recovery  and function in the setting of acute postoperative endophthalmitis.

TI  == elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: the prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (pcs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. which key  steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was  investigated. study design and methods: ten bacteria species were used. blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees c for 8 hours. the buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. pcs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. at each preparation step and during pc storage, bacteria contents were measured.  in additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees c for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. results: enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. bacillus cereus, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the pcs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. with the exception of p. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the pcs. remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. conclusions: bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor pcs. also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for  most species. when buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.

TI  == pulmonary immune responses to propionibacterium acnes in c57bl/6 and balb/c mice.
AB  == propionibacterium acnes (pa) is a gram-positive anaerobic bacterium implicated as a putative etiologic agent of sarcoidosis. to characterize the pulmonary immune response to pa, c57bl/6 and balb/c mice were intraperitoneally sensitized and intratracheally challenged with heat-killed bacteria. c57bl/6 mice challenged with pa developed a cellular immune response characterized by elevations in th1 cytokines/chemokines, increased numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages in lung lavage fluid, and peribronchovascular granulomatous inflammation composed of t- and b-lymphocytes and epithelioid histiocytes. t-lymphocytes in the lung lavage fluid showed a marked cd4+ cell predominance. in contrast, c57bl/6 mice challenged with staphylococcus epidermidis (se), another gram-positive commensal  of human skin, and balb/c mice challenged with pa, showed only a modest induction of th1 cytokines, less pulmonary inflammation, and no granulomatous changes in the lung. enhancement of toll-like receptor expression was seen in pa-exposed c57bl/6 mice within 24 h after exposure, suggesting that induction of innate immunity by pa contributes to the robust, polarized th1 immune response elicited  by this bacterium. these findings suggest that pa-induced pulmonary inflammation  may be a useful model for testing the contributions of both bacterial and host factors in the development, maintenance, and resolution of granulomatous inflammation in the lung.

TI  == pectin-like acidic polysaccharide from panax ginseng with selective antiadhesive  activity against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == previous studies have revealed the inhibitory effects of an acidic polysaccharide purified from the root of panax ginseng against the adhesion of helicobacter pylori to gastric epithelial cells and the ability of porphyromonas gingivalis to agglutinate erythrocytes. in this study, this acidic polysaccharide from p. ginseng, pg-f2, was investigated further, in order to characterize its antiadhesive effects against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, propionibacterium acnes, and staphylococcus aureus. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were found to be in a range of 0.25-0.5mg/ml. however, results showed no inhibitory effects of pg-f2 against lactobacillus acidophilus,  escherichia coli, or staphylococcus epidermidis. pg-f2 is a pectin-type polysaccharide with a mean mw of 1.2 x 10(4) da, and consists primarily of galacturonic and glucuronic acids along with rhamnose, arabinose, and galactose as minor components. the complete hydrolysis of pg-f2 via chemical or carbohydrolase enzyme treatment resulted in the abrogation of its antiadhesive activity, but limited hydrolysis via treatment with pectinase (ec. 3.2.1.15) yielded an oligosaccharide fraction, with activity comparable to the precursor pg-f2 (the mic of ca. 0.01 mg/ml against h. pylori and p. gingivalis). our results suggest that pg-f2 may exert a selective antiadhesive effect against pathogenic bacteria, while having no effects on beneficial and commensal bacteria.

TI  == susceptibility of propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus epidermidis to killing by mpo-halide system products. implication for taurine bromamine as a new candidate for topical therapy in treating acne vulgaris.
AB  == introduction: taurine chloramine (taucl) and taurine bromamine (taubr) are the main haloamines produced by activated neutrophils. taucl exerts both anti-inflammatory and microbicidal activities. clinical studies showed that taucl may be useful as an antimicrobial agent in the local treatment of infections. much less is known about taubr. circumstantial evidence suggests that propionibacterium acnes (pa) has a role in the inflammation of acne. available topical therapies include antimicrobial agents which reduce total pa numbers and  anti-inflammatory agents which suppress activity of the cells present in acne inflammatory lesions. in this study the bactericidal activities of taubr and taucl against pa and staphylococcus epidermidis (se), as a control strain, were investigated. moreover, the influence of these haloamines on the generation of reactive oxygen species (ros) by activated neutrophils was also tested. materials and methods: taubr and taucl were prepared by reaction of taurine with hobr and hocl, respectively. the reaction was monitored by uv absorption spectra. the bactericidal activities of taubr and taucl were determined by the pourplate method. the generation of ros by neutrophils was determined by luminol chemiluminescence assay. results: in our experimental set-up, taubr showed stronger antibacterial activity than taucl. interestingly, pa was significantly more susceptible to taubr than se was. moreover, taubr at non-cytotoxic concentrations significantly reduced ros generation by neutrophils. conclusions:  since pa is considered to be an etiological agent in acne and ros are closely correlated with the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin diseases, the reported data suggest that taubr may be a good candidate for the topical therapy for acne vulgaris.

TI  == influence of a new surface modification of intraocular lenses with fluoroalkylsilan on the adherence of endophthalmitis-causing bacteria in vitro.
AB  == introduction: dynasilan is a fluoroalkylsilan that is able to interact with surface active centres on intraocular lenses (iol), offering a new way for surface modification of different iol materials. the purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the influence of this new surface modification on the adherence of two typical endophthalmitis causing bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis, propionibacterium acnes). materials and methods: in a pilot experiment, the effect of dynasilan coating on the adherence of s. epidermidis was tested on glass slides. forty-two dynasilan-modified and 42 unmodified iol (14 pmma, 14 silicone and 14 hydrogel) were incubated at 37 degrees c in brain heart infusion broth (10(8) cfu/ml) with either s. epidermidis for 24 h or with p. acnes for 1 h. subsequently, the adherent bacteria were resuspended using ultrasonification at 35 khz for 3x45 s. after dilution series and incubation at 37 degrees c on petri dishes for 24 h and 3 days, respectively, the colonies were counted. results: in the pilot experiment, a markedly lower number of adherent s. epidermidis was observed on dynasilan-modified glass slides. of all iol materials incubated with s. epidermidis, those modified with dynasilan showed a lower mean  number of adherent bacteria (mean 1.37x10(7); sd 2.37x10(7)) than those untreated (2.43x10(7); sd 3.04x10(7)). iols incubated with p. acnes showed a significantly  lower mean number of adherent bacteria of 2.51x10(4) (sd 2.71x10(4)) on dynasilan-modified iols versus 6.27x10(4) (sd 7.70x10(4)) on untreated iols. conclusion: the presented in vitro results indicate that dynasilan surface modification is able to reduce the adherence of s. epidermidis and p. acnes on all iol materials tested. further studies regarding the stability of this modification and its biocompatibility must be performed.

TI  == basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: flow cytometry (facs) is a common technique in blood banking. it is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. it was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (pcs).  study design and methods: plasma-reduced pcs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees c for various times. the following 10 species were used: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica. bacterial dna was stained with thiazole orange. after the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by facs. results: all bacteria species used were detectable by facs. the lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microl, that is, 10(5) per ml. in general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. in one  case (k. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with  that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. when pc samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per ml of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees c, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. exceptions were e. cloacae and p. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. at 20 to 24 degrees c, the detection times were strongly prolonged. conclusion: sterility testing of pcs by facs is a feasible approach. the present  data suggest incubating pc samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees c before testing. for slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1  to 2 days.

TI  == very low dose isotretinoin is effective in controlling seborrhea.
AB  == background: excessive seborrhea, coarse-pored skin, minimal acne and oily scalp hair comprise a well-known clinical entity. it causes considerable concern, has social impact, and affects the quality of life in some individuals. some patients seek treatment for seborrhea. no effective topical sebosuppressive medication is  available. oral isotretinoin is the only remedy for men. in women, oral isotretinoin is the most effective remedy, followed by antiandrogens. patients and methods: eleven patients in three groups were treated for 6 months with very  low dose isotretinoin. the influence on seborrhea was measured during oral treatment with 5 mg/d, 2.5 mg/d, or 2.5 mg 3x weekly. results: sebum production,  measured with sebutape, was reduced by up to 64%. acne lesions regressed by as much as 84%. follicular filaments were reduced by 66%. microcomedones were reduced on average up to 86%. quantitative bacteriology showed a reduction of propionibacterium acnes but no increase of staphylococcus epidermidis. biopsies revealed a 51% reduction in sebaceous gland size. with bentonite, a reduction of  lipids was demonstrated with 2.5 and 5 mg isotretinoin/d but not with 2.5 mg 3x weekly. there was a shift within the lipid fractions: triglycerides dominated, followed by squalenes and free fatty acids. conclusions: good results were achieved in all patients. the small number of patients did not permit a statistical analysis of the three isotretinoin doses studied, but there was a tendency toward better results with the two higher doses.

TI  == detection of potentially novel bacterial components of the human skin microbiota  using culture-independent molecular profiling.
AB  == although the micro-organisms forming the cutaneous microbiota are considered to play important roles in the modification and prevention of skin diseases, a comprehensive analysis of their composition has not yet been carried out because  of difficulties in determining yet-to-be-cultured micro-organisms in the samples. swab-scrubbed forehead skin samples of five healthy volunteers were analysed by profiling 16s rrna genes, as well as by conventional culture methods, to provide  a profile of the cutaneous microbiota that included yet-to-be-cultured bacteria from normal human skin. cluster analyses of the 16s rrna gene sequences indicated a marked increase in diversity compared with that derived from the culture methods. nineteen previously recognized species and 13 novel phylotypes were obtained from the analysis of 416 clones. in addition to well-known bacteria such as staphylococcus epidermidis and propionibacterium acnes, phylotype a, the 16s rrna gene of which is 97 % similar to that of methylophilus methylotrophus, was detected in three of the five samples, in one of which it was the predominant clone. culture-independent genetic profiling of 16s rrna genes for detecting human cutaneous microbiota has allowed us to detect potentially novel components  of the cutaneous microbiota in humans.

TI  == optimal sampling time after preparation of platelet concentrates for detection of bacterial contamination by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background and objectives: a universal quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr), based on bacterial 16s rdna, to detect bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (pcs), was developed previously and compared with automated culturing. in the present study, this real-time pcr method was evaluated to determine the optimal sampling time for screening of bacterial contamination in pcs. materials and methods: routinely prepared pcs were spiked with suspensions of escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and propionibacterium acnes to 1, 10 and 100 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml and stored at room temperature for 7 days. the presence of bacteria in these pcs was monitored by quantitative real-time pcr. as a reference method (additional control), bact/alert automated culturing was used. for pcr, 1-ml aliquots were drawn from all (spiked) pcs on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 of storage. as a control, triplicate samples (10 ml) were inoculated into aerobic and anaerobic bact/alert culture bottles immediately after spiking (day 0) and after  storage for 1, 2, 3, 6 or 7 days. results: with quantitative real-time pcr, all bacterial species tested were reproducibly detected on day 1 after spiking at original concentrations of 10 and 100 cfu/ml. bacteria were also detected on day  1 from pcs spiked with an initial concentration of 1 cfu/ml, except for e. coli,  which was detected in only one of the three samples and p. aeruginosa, for which  analysis was not performed on day 1. with the reference method, bacteria were detected in culture bottles (inoculated on day 0) within a mean time of 20.1 h, with the exception of p. acnes which was detected at a mean time of 102.3 and 49.3 h (for original spiking concentrations of 10 and 100 cfu/ml respectively). conclusions: pcr enables the rapid detection of low initial numbers of bacteria in pcs. for reliable detection, our results support that sampling of pcs for real-time pcr screening should not be carried out earlier than 1 day after preparation (48 h after blood collection). importantly, the real-time pcr approach has the potential to be used before the release of pcs from the blood centre or shortly before they are transfused in the hospital.

TI  == evaluation of bact/alert plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  == background: in certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (plt)-rich plasma  plts can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. one prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single  unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 cfus/ml). this study evaluated the bact/alert (biomerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. study design and methods: bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single plt units (target, 10 and 100 cfus/ml; mean recovered, 5 and 92 cfus/ml) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 ml was plated (10 sets). results: all cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 cfus per ml. with b. cereus (< or =2 cfus/ml), all bottles were reactive. with k. pneumoniae and s. viridans (< or =3 cfus/ml), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. with s. marcescens (< 2 cfus/ml), only 7  of the 10 sets were reactive. with c. perfringens (0.2 cfus/ml), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. conclusions: this study evaluates the use of the bact/alert system for detection of bacteria in plt pools. overall, the bact/alert detected all contaminated pooled plts when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 cfus per ml with 10 different species of bacteria. low recovered concentrations (< or =2 cfus/ml) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.

TI  == the antimicrobial activities of psidium guajava and juglans regia leaf extracts to acne-developing organisms.
AB  == this study aims to present the in vitro inhibitory effect of psidium guajava and  juglans regia leaf extracts on the main developer of acne lesions, propionibacterium acnes (p. acnes), and other organisms that are isolated from acne lesions. thirty-eight subjects (males and females) who had various types of  acne were enrolled in the study. the contents of the acne lesions were cultured and the frequency of p. acnes (alone and with staphylococci spp.) was 47%, whereas the frequencies for staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis  were 13% and 24%, respectively. the antimicrobial activities of psidium guajava and juglans regia leaf extracts, determined by disk diffusion method (zone of inhibition), were compared to tea tree oil (tto), doxycycline and clindamycin antibiotics. the zones of inhibition due to the psidium guajava and juglans regia leaf extracts ranged from 15.8-17.6 mm against p. acnes, 11.3-15.7 mm against s.  aureus and 12.9-15.5 mm against s. epidermidis, respectively. these zones of inhibition were significantly higher than those of tto and equivalent in case of  staphylococci spp., but less in case of p. acnes, to those obtained from doxycycline or clindamycin. it can be concluded that psidium guajava and juglans  regia leaf extracts may be beneficial in treating acne especially when they are known to have anti-inflammatory activities.

TI  == formulation and evaluation of an effective ph balanced topical antimicrobial product containing tea tree oil.
AB  == the effect of ph on the antimicrobial activity of melaleuca alternifolia essential oil formulations was studied. microemulsions, liposomal dispersions, multiple emulsions and a colloidal bed of sterile clay were formulated using 5% w/w of tea tree oil. a number of formulations were prepared at various ph values  (5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, and 7.0). thermal stability studies showed that the formulations were stable for more than eight months. agar dilution tests showed mics of 1.0% v/v s. aureus and s. epidermidis. in the broth dilution test, mbc of the oil for p. acnes was 0.5% v/v. mic and mbc values were comparable to those of non-formulated tea tree oil, indicating that tea tree oil retained its activity in the above-mentioned formulations. the microbiological evaluation showed that the formulations containing 5% w/w tea tree oil had a maximum effect at ph 5.5.

TI  == nadifloxacin, an antiacne quinolone antimicrobial, inhibits the production of proinflammatory cytokines by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and normal  human keratinocytes.
AB  == background: acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disease involving colonization of propionibacterium acnes (p. acnes), activation of neutrophils and lymphocytes. circumstantial evidence suggests that antigen-independent and -dependent immune responses against p. acnes are involved in the pathogenesis of  inflammatory acne. epidermal keratinocytes are also suggested to be involved in initiation and progression of cutaneous inflammation. nadifloxacin, a fluorinated quinolone, has potent antimicrobial activities against gram-negative and -positive microbes and is used to treat multiple inflamed acne lesions. however,  its effect on immune conferring cells such as mononuclear cells and keratinocytes has not been examined. objective: to evaluate the possible involvement of potential anti-inflammatory activity of nadifloxacin in its therapeutic effect on inflammatory acne, we examined the effects of nadifloxacin, in comparison with other antibiotics used to treat acne vulgaris, on cytokine production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) and keratinocytes. methods: cytokine production by pbmc was determined after treatment with heat-killed p. acnes in the presence or absence of antimicrobials using a real-time pcr and elisa. cultured human epidermal keratinocytes were stimulated by ifn-gamma plus il-1beta and the effects of antimicrobials were examined by using elisa. results: nadifloxacin as well as macrolide antibiotics and clindamycin inhibited il-12 and ifn-gamma production by pbmc stimulated by heat-killed p. acnes. the drug also inhibited the il-1alpha, il-6, il-8 and gm-cms production by keratinocytes treated with ifn-gamma plus il-1beta. conclusions: inhibitory effects of nadifloxacin to activate t cells and keratinocytes may be involved at least in part in the mechanism of its therapeutic effect against inflammatory acne.

TI  == different pro-inflammatory and immunogenic potentials of propionibacterium acnes  and staphylococcus epidermidis: implications for chronic inflammatory acne.
AB  == introduction: propionibacterium acnes (pa) and staphyloccocus epidermidis (se) are two major bacterial strains isolated from acne lesions. nevertheless, only pa seems to be implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory acne vulgaris. evidence for this, however, remains indirect and the precise role of pa in inflammatory acne is still a matter for conjecture. the aim of this study was to  compare some pro-inflammatory and adjuvant properties of pa and se. material/methods: to determine some of the pathogenic, immunostimulatory, and pro-inflammatory proper of pa and se, two experimental models of inflammation were used. in vivo; chronic inflammation was induced by intradermal injection of  living bacteria into the ear. in vitro; peritoneal macrophages elicited by the bacteria were examined for their ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ros), nitric oxide (no), and cytokines. results: pa, but not se, evoked mild local inflammation of infected ears. macrophages elicited with pa produced more tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin il-12 than those induced with se, while se was a stronger inducer of il-10 production. both bacteria equally induced the generation of no and ros. in contrast, only pa showed adjuvant proper-ties. conclusions: the results of these studies indicate that se, in contrast to pa, does not exert pro-inflammatory properties. thus it is unlikely that se may be implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory acne vulgaris.

TI  == retrospective case review of capsular contracture after two-stage breast reconstruction: is colonization of the tissue expander pocket associated with subsequent implant capsular contracture?
AB  == periprosthetic capsular contracture is a common problem associated with implant-based breast reconstruction. the purpose of this study was to determine if bacterial colonization of the tissue expander contributes to contracture of the permanent implant. medical records were reviewed for 86 patients (124 tissue  expanders) between 1997 and 2001 in 1 institution. three specimens taken from the expander were cultured. the overall incidence of colonization was 42.7%; 49.4% (38.8-60.0) of immediate and 28.2% (14.1-42.3) of delayed expanders had at least  1 positive culture site (p = 0.043). the most common organisms were propionibacterium acnes (57.6%), staphylococcus epidermidis (31.0%), and peptostreptococcus (5.8%). statistical analysis revealed no significant difference between colonization of the expander and capsular contracture of the permanent prosthesis (p = 0.59). 45.8% (25.9-65.8) of breasts irradiated preoperatively developed contracture versus 14% (7.2-20.8) with no irradiation (p = 0.0013). these results suggest that colonization of the expander occurs frequently, irradiation predisposes to contracture, and colonization did not contribute to secondary implant contracture in this study population.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == validation of bact/alert plastic culture bottles for use in testing of whole-blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich-plasma-derived platelets.
AB  == background: bacterial detection of platelet (plt)-rich-plasma (prp)-derived plts  presents unique challenges for countries that do not allow pooling before storage. this study validated the bact/alert for use in testing pooled prp-derived plts with nine contaminating organisms. study design and methods: isolates of bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into two prp-derived plt pools (target, 10 and 100 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml; actual recovered concentrations, 5 and 90 cfus/ml). four milliliters of each postbacterial inoculation sample was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles and 0.5 ml was plated onto blood agar. results: all organisms (excluding p. acnes) were detected in 8.2 to 22.0 and 7.6 to 20.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) and the mean time to detection was 15.0 and 13.1 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respective). p. acnes was detected with the anaerobic bottles in a mean of 74.9 and 64.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively). with e. cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. viridans detection with the anaerobic bottles was faster or equivalent to the detection with the aerobic bottles. this was most notable with s. viridans where  the anaerobic bottle was reactive on average 21.6 and 10.8 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) faster than the aerobic bottle. conclusions: this study validates the use of the bact/alert system for the detection of bacteria in prp-derived plts in a pooled format. overall, the use of the bact/alert system allowed the detection of pooled prp-derived plts inoculated with nine bacteria at 10 and 100 cfus per ml in 7.6 to 22.0 hours (excluding p. acnes).

TI  == evaluation of the antibacterial efficacy of diesters of azelaic acid.
AB  == a number of diesters of the topical dermatosis treatment azelaic (nonanedioic) acid were prepared and tested for antibacterial effect. two esters, bis-[(hexanoyloxy)methyl] nonanedioate and especially bis-[(butanoyloxy)methyl] nonanedioate showed promising activity against acne related bacteria in vitro. no activity of azelaic acid was detected in mueller hinton ii agar at ph 7.3 when using the agar diffusion method, whereas both esters gave zones of growth inhibition. at ph 5.6, activity of azelaic acid was detected. at this ph, the zones of inhibition and mic values obtained with azelaic acid were smaller than those of bis-[(butanoyloxy)methyl] nonanedioate for all test organisms. a preparation for topical use containing 20% (w/w) bis-[(butanoyloxy)methyl] nonanedioate, and the commercially available skinoren (20% (w/w) azelaic acid), were compared for antibacterial effect against cutaneous bacteria using contact plate analyses of the skin. though skinoren was usually most effective, the differences were not statistically significant. furthermore, bacteria surviving contact with the topical preparations were invariably more sensitive to the ester than to azelaic acid upon subculturing onto agar (ph 5.6) containing either preparation at 0.2-0.7 mg/ml. this might indicate that other factors, such as the composition of the cream base, mitigate the antibacterial activity of the ester.  it is proposed that the pharmacological and microbiological properties of bis-[(butanoyloxy)methyl] nonanedioate are worthy of further study based on an extended screening of acne sufferers.

TI  == evaluation of a new generation of plastic culture bottles with an automated microbial detection system for nine common contaminating organisms found in plt components.
AB  == background: a microbial detection system (bact/alert 3d, biomerieux [formerly organon teknika]) has previously been validated with a variety of bacterial contaminants in plts. the recovery of nine organisms seeded into plts with new plastic culture bottles was studied in comparison to the current glass bottles. the use of plastic instead of glass would be expected to reduce the risk of injury. study design and methods: isolates of bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into day 2 (>24 hr <48 hr) apheresis plt  units to 10 and 100 cfus per ml. replicate samples (4 ml) were inoculated into both current- and new-generation standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles. results: all organisms (with the exception of p. acnes) were detected in a mean time of 9.3 to 18.9 hours (10 cfus/ml) or 8.7 to 18.2 hours (100 cfus/ml). in aggregate (with the exception of p. acnes), the plastic and glass aerobic bottles had a mean difference in detection of 1.2 hours (p < 0.0001), and the plastic and glass anaerobic bottles had a mean difference of 3.3 hours (p < 0.0001). in all cases,  the mean detection time was superior or clinically comparable (within 0.1 hr) with the new plastic bottles. p. acnes (an anaerobic organism) was detected with  the new and current anaerobic bottles in a mean of 72.8 and 90.4 hours (10 cfus/ml) or 64.0 and 80.8 hours (100 cfus/ml), respectively. the narrower bottle  neck and smaller inoculation septum present with the new-generation plastic bottles were inoculated with comparable ease to that of the glass bottles. conclusions: these data demonstrate that the new plastic bottles are clinically comparable or superior to the current glass standard aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles.

TI  == endophthalmitis isolates and antibiotic sensitivities: a 6-year review of culture-proven cases.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the spectrum of organisms causing culture-proven endophthalmitis and their sensitivities to commonly used antimicrobial agents. design: retrospective, noncomparative, consecutive case series. methods: medical  records were reviewed of all patients with culture-proven endophthalmitis at a single institution between january 1, 1996, and december 31, 2001. endophthalmitis categories included postoperative, posttraumatic, endogenous, and miscellaneous (for example, keratitis). the outcome measures included intravitreal isolates identified, antibiotic sensitivities, and category of endophthalmitis. results: in all, 313 organisms were isolated from 278 patients during the study interval. the most common organisms identified were staphylococcus epidermidis in 27.8% (87/313), streptococcus viridans group in 12.8% (40/313), other coagulase-negative staphylococci in 9.3% (29/313), staphylococcus aureus in 7.7% (24/313), and propionibacterium acnes in 7.0% (22/313). overall, 246 of 313 (78.5%) isolates were gram-positive organisms, 37 (11.8%) were gram-negative organisms, and 27 (8.6%) were fungi. for gram-positive organisms, sensitivities were the following: vancomycin 100%, gentamicin 78.4%, ciprofloxacin 68.3%, ceftazidime 63.6%, and cefazolin 66.8%. for gram-negative organisms, sensitivities were the following: ciprofloxacin 94.2%, amikacin 80.9%, ceftazidime 80.0%, and gentamicin 75.0%. fungal isolates were candida species (9/313), aspergillus species (9/313), and other molds (9/313). among the endophthalmitis categories, the most frequent organisms were the following: (1) acute-onset postoperative: s epidermidis, 46.9%; (2) delayed-onset postoperative: s epidermidis, 22.7%; (3) delayed-onset bleb-associated: fastidious gram-negative rods, 20.4%; (4) posttraumatic: s epidermidis, 20.8%; (5) endogenous: aspergillus species, 20.8%; and (6) miscellaneous: molds (other), 36.4%. conclusions: in considering antibiotic treatment of endophthalmitis, it is important to recognize that no single antibiotic provided coverage for all of the microbes isolated from eyes with endophthalmitis. combination therapy is recommended as the initial empiric treatment of suspected bacterial endophthalmitis. appropriate history and characteristic clinical features may justify the use of initial antifungal agents. knowledge of the most frequent causative organisms in various categories  will help direct appropriate initial therapy.

TI  == [the influence of a new surface treatment of silicone intracoular lenses with fluoralkylsitan on the adherence of endophthalmitic bacteria in vitro]].
AB  == introduction: dynasilan is a fluoroalkylsilan which is able to bind to surface active molecules of intraocular lenses (iols), thereby offering a new option for  surface modification of silicone lenses. the purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the influence of this new surface treatment on the adherence of two typical endophthalmitis-inducing bacteria ( staphylococcus epidermidis, propionibacterium acnes). materials and methods: a total of 14 dynasilan-treated  and 14 untreated silicone lenses were incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h in brain heart infusion broth (10(8) cfu/ml) either with staphylococcus epidermidis or with propionibacterium acnes for 1 h. subsequently, the adherent bacteria were resuspended using ultrasonification at 35 khz for 3 x 45 s. after a dilution series and incubation at 37 degrees c for 24 h or 3 days the colonies were counted. results: on untreated iols incubated with staphylococcus epidermidis the average number of bacteria was 3.6 x 10(7)/ml, and on treated iols the number of  counted colonies was reduced to 1.09 x 10(7)/ml. incubated with propionibacterium acnes the average number of adherent bacteria on untreated iols was 4.75 x 10(4)/ml and on modified iols the number was reduced to 2.94 x 10(4)/ml. conclusion: dynasilan surface treatment may reduce the adherence of staphylococcus epidermidis and propionibacterium acnes on silicone intraocular lenses. further studies regarding the stability of this treatment, its biocompatibility and influence on lens epithelial cell adhesion are in progress.

TI  == severe infective keratitis leading to hospital admission in new zealand.
AB  == aim: to identify key risk factors and the management and outcome of severe infective keratitis leading to public hospital admission in new zealand. methods: over a 2 year period, all admissions of presumed infective keratitis to auckland  hospital were identified. the clinical records of all 103 cases were retrospectively reviewed with respect to clinical features, risk factors, management, and outcomes. results: the mean time from first symptoms or signs and presentation to hospital was 8.9 (sd 15.5) days. the majority of subjects, 88%, had at least one of the risk factors commonly associated with infective keratitis including previous ocular surgery (30%), contact lens wear (26%), topical corticosteroid use (25%), and ocular trauma (24%). corneal scraping was performed in 92% and of a total of 105 scrapes, 71% were positive. bacteria were isolated in all these cases, the majority being gram positive organisms (72%). the most common isolates identified were coagulase negative staphylococcus (16%), propionibacterium acnes (14%), staphylococcus epidermidis (11%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (9%). in addition, yeasts were isolated in 5%, fungi in  4%, virus in 2%, and chlamydia in 1%. importantly, polymicrobial infection accounted for 33% of culture positive cases. antimicrobial treatment was changed  on the basis of culture results in 17 cases (16.5%). median initial visual and final best corrected visual acuity was 6/36-6/48 (logmar 0.86) (iqr 0.39-2.00) and 6/12-6/15 (logmar 0.360) (iqr 0.15-1.70), respectively. previous ocular surgery and topical corticosteroid use were significantly associated with poorer  visual acuity. the mean hospital stay was 5.8 days and the median 4.0 (iqr 2.0-8.0) days. longer duration of stay was associated with the presence of hypopyon, larger ulcers, previous ocular surgery, and poor visual acuity. conclusions: infectious keratitis is an important cause of ocular morbidity. a significant proportion of cases have potentially modifiable risk factors. previous ocular surgery and topical corticosteroid use, in particular, were associated with poorer visual outcomes. many cases of severe keratitis might be avoided, or their severity reduced, by appropriate education of patients and ophthalmologists.

AB  == study design: a case report describes unilateral complete laminar erosion of the  caudal thoracic spine and late-presenting infection in a patient 10 years after anteroposterior reconstruction for scoliosis. objective: to present an unusual but significant complication that may occur after implantation of spinal instrumentation. summary of background data: the reported patient presented with  a deep infection and persistent back pain 10 years after successful anteroposterior reconstruction for adult idiopathic scoliosis. delayed onset infections after implantation of spinal instrumentation are infrequent, yet when  present, often require hardware removal. methods: the case of a 51-year-old woman who underwent irrigation and debridement for a late-presenting infection and removal of posterior hardware 10 years after her index procedure is presented. interoperatively, it was noted that full-thickness laminar erosion was present from t4 to t12. results: the patient was taken to the operating room for wound irrigation, debridement, and hardware removal. it was discovered that a cotrel-dubousset rod placed on the convexity of the curve had completely eroded through the lamina of t7-t12. infectious material was found along the entire length of both the convex and concave cotrel-dubousset rods. intraoperative cultures grew staphylococcus epidermidis and propionibacterium acnes. intravenous and oral antibiotics were administered, resulting in resolution of the infection  and preoperative pain. conclusions: the exact role of late-presenting infection with regard to the laminar erosion and rod migration seen in this case remains to be elucidated. however, the authors believe the primary cause of bony erosion was mechanical in origin. regardless, most spine surgeons will treat many patients who have had posterior spinal implants and will perform hardware removal on a significant number of these patients during their careers. a full-thickness laminar erosion exposes the spinal cord to traumatic injury during hardware removal and debridement. this case is presented as a cautionary note to help surgeons become cognizant of a potentially devastating complication.

TI  == formation of propionibacterium acnes biofilms on orthopaedic biomaterials and their susceptibility to antimicrobials.
AB  == failure to treat and eradicate prosthetic hip infection with systemic antibiotic  regimens is usually due to the fact that the infection is associated with biofilm formation and that bacterial cells growing within a biofilm exhibit increased resistance to antimicrobial agents. in this in vitro study, we investigated the susceptibility of prosthetic hip propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus spp.  isolates growing within biofilms on polymethylmethacrylate (pmma) bone cement to  a range of antibiotics. all p. acnes isolates in the biofilm mode of growth demonstrated considerably greater resistance to cefamandole, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin. in contrast, only four of the eight p. acnes isolates demonstrated an increase in resistance to gentamicin. all ten staphylococcus spp. isolates in the biofilm mode of growth exhibited large increases in resistance to gentamicin and  cefamandole with eight of the ten isolates also exhibiting an increase in resistance to vancomycin. however, only three of the ten staphylococcus spp. isolates exhibited an increase in resistance to ciprofloxacin. biofilms were also formed on three different titanium alloys and on pmma bone cement using p. acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus strains to determine if the  underlying biomaterial surface had an effect on biofilm formation and the antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacteria growing within biofilms. although differences in the rate at which the three strains adhered to the different biomaterials were apparent, no differences in biofilm antibiotic resistance between the biomaterials were observed. in the light of these results, it is important that the efficacy of other antibiotics against p. acnes and staphylococcus spp. prosthetic hip isolates growing within biofilms on orthopaedic biomaterials be determined to ensure optimal treatment of orthopaedic implant infection.

TI  == acne phototherapy with a high-intensity, enhanced, narrow-band, blue light source: an open study and in vitro investigation.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of phototherapy with a  newly-developed high-intensity, enhanced, narrow-band, blue light source in patients with mild to moderate acne. an open study was performed in acne patients who were treated twice a week up to 5 weeks. acne lesions were reduced by 64%. two patients experienced dryness. no patient discontinued treatment due to adverse effects. in vitro investigation revealed that irradiation from this light source reduced the number of propionibacterium acnes (p. acnes), but not staphylococcus epidermidis that were isolated from the acne patients. phototherapy using this blue light source was effective and well tolerated in acne patients and had an ability to decrease numbers of p. acnes in vitro, suggesting that this phototherapy may be a new modality for the treatment of acne.

TI  == [therapeutic strategy in delayed postoperative endophtalmitis: a report on 15 cases].
AB  == purpose: to report the treatment strategies and visual acuity outcomes of chronic postoperative endophthalmitis. material: and methods: the authors reviewed the records of 15 patients presenting 3 or more weeks after cataract surgery with intraocular inflammation and treated at bicetre hospital from 1992 to 1998. group i included 6 consecutive patients treated with vitrectomy and intravitreal antibiotic injection (vancomycin and cefazolin). group ii included 9 consecutive  patients treated with intravitreal antibiotic injection (vancomycin and ceftazidime) and irrigation of the capsular bag (vancomycin). the minimum follow-up period was 1 year. results: in group i, 2 patients had recurrent inflammation. in these patients, the capsular bag and the intraocular implant were removed. in 1 patient there was culture-proven corynebacterium and in 1 patient a staphylococcus epidermidis was found. final visual acuity was 20/40 or  better in 5 patients and 20/100 in 1 patient. visual acuity improved in all cases. in group ii no recurrence was seen in the 12-20 months of follow-up. in 2  patients there was proven staphylococcus epidermidis and in one patient propionibacterium acnes was found. final visual acuity was 20/40 or more in 3 patients, 20/100 or more in 4 patients and less than 20/200 in 2 patients. visual acuity improved in 8 cases. conclusions: intravitreal antibiotic injection with vitrectomy and intravitreal antibiotic injection with antibiotic irrigation of the capsular bag are both effective in the treatment of delayed chronic postoperative endophthalmitis; however, with the second approach, there is minimal surgical trauma and the intraocular implant is retained.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  == background: retinoids such as retinoic acid (ra), retinol (rol) and retinaldehyde (ral) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. aim: to analyse the potential anti-infective  activities of topical rol, ral and ra. methods: microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of rol, ral and ra were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus flavus, propionibacterium acnes, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus hominis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus group b, enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and pseudomonas/klebsiella. in two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% ral or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% ral or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. results: of the three retinoids tested, only ral showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like s. aeureus, micrococcus spp. or  p. acnes. no activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. these results on  reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. mic(50) and mic(90) values for ral were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant s. aureus. the two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with ral had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. in the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2)  for p. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. no resistant bacteria were  found after 2 weeks of topical use. preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of ral is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. conclusion: we have shown that ral differs from parent natural retinoids such as rol and ra in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. this activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the  potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.

TI  == mediastinitis after cardiac surgery: improvement of bacteriological diagnosis by  use of multiple tissue samples and strain typing.
AB  == the diagnosis of postsurgical mediastinitis (psm) among patients with sternal wound complication (swc) after cardiac surgery is sometimes difficult, as fever,  elevated c-reactive protein levels, and chest pain can be caused by a general inflammatory reaction to the operative trauma and/or sternal dehiscence without infection. the definitions of psm usually used emphasize clinical signs and symptoms easily observed by the surgeon. the aim of the study was to investigate  whether the use of standardized multiple tissue sampling, optimal culturing methods, and strain typing, together with a microbiological criterion for infection, could identify more infected patients than clinical assessment alone.  patients reexplored due to swc after cardiac artery bypass grafting (cabg) or heart valve replacement (hvr) with or without cabg performed at the department for cardio-thoracic surgery at the uppsala university hospital between 10 march 1998 and 9 september 2000 were investigated prospectively. tissue samples were taken from the sternum or adjacent mediastinal tissue, preferably before the administration of antibiotics. culturing was performed both directly (on agar plates) and using enrichment broth. species identification was performed by standard methods, and strain typing was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. a total of 41 cases with at least five tissue samples each were  included in the study group. of these patients, 32 were infected according to the microbiological criterion (i.e., the same strain was found in >/=50% of the samples). staphylococcus epidermidis was the primary pathogen in 38% of the cases (12/32), s. aureus was the primary pathogen in 31% (10/32), p. acnes was the primary pathogen in 25% (8/32), and s. simulans and s. haemolyticus were the primary pathogens in 3% (1/32) each. all cases of s. aureus infection and 86% (12/14) of coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cons) infections were identified from primary cultures. all cases fulfilling the microbiological criterion for s.  aureus infection were clinically diagnosed as cases of infection, but among the 14 cases fulfilling the criterion for microbiological diagnosis of cons infection, only 10 appeared to qualify clinically as cases of infection. among the patients with sternal dehiscence in whom a microbiological diagnosis was established, 67% (12/18) had a cons infection, compared to 14% (2/14) of those without sternal dehiscence. the difference was statistically significant. psm caused by s. aureus is readily identified by the surgeon, whereas 30% of cases with cons infections may be misinterpreted as noninfected. multiple sampling before administration of antibiotics, primary culturing on agar plates, species identification, strain typing, and susceptibility testing should be used to ensure a fast and microbiologically correct diagnosis which identifies the primary pathogen and infected patients among those with minor infective symptoms. the role of p. acnes as a possible cause of psm needs further investigation. psm  caused by cons is significantly related to sternal dehiscence.

TI  == evaluation of a new generation of culture bottle using an automated bacterial culture system for detecting nine common contaminating organisms found in platelet components.
AB  == background: an automated bacterial culture system (bact/alert 3d, biomerieux) has been previously validated with a variety of bacteria in platelets. the recovery of bacteria in platelets using a new generation of culture bottles that do not require venting and that use a liquid emulsion sensor was studied. study design and methods: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella  oxytoca, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens,  streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes isolates were inoculated into day 2 platelets to concentrations of 10 and 100 cfu per ml. samples were then studied with current and new aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles. results:  all organisms, except p. acnes, were detected in a mean time of 9.2 to 20.4 (10 cfu/ml) or 8.7 to 18.6 (100 cfu/ml) hours. p. acnes was detected in a mean time of 69.2 (10 cfu/ml) or 66.0 (100 cfu/ml) hours. the 10-fold increase in inoculum  was associated with a mean 9.2 percent difference in detection time. the aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles had a mean difference in detection time (hours)  between the current and new bottles of 0.10 (p=0.61), 0.4 (p=0.38), and 1.0 (p <  0.001), respectively. conclusion: no difference in detection time between the current and new aerobic and anaerobic bottles was demonstrated. the new pediatric bottles had a small but significant delay in detection.

TI  == bacterial contamination of the anterior chamber during phacoemulsification cataract surgery.
AB  == purpose: to determine the incidence of bacterial contamination of the anterior chamber after phacoemulsification cataract surgery with intraocular lens (iol) implantation. setting: department of ophthalmology, royal prince alfred hospital, sydney, australia. methods: ninety-eight consecutive eyes of 96 patients having phacoemulsification cataract surgery with iol implantation were included in this  prospective study. two intraoperative anterior chamber aspirates were obtained from each patient, 1 taken at the start and the other at the conclusion of surgery. in addition, preoperative and postoperative conjunctival swabs were acquired. the 4 specimens were cultured using direct culturing techniques under aerobic and anaerobic conditions for 14 days. no preoperative antibiotics were used. results: the incidence of intraoperative anterior chamber contamination was 0% (95% confidence interval, 0%-3.7%) as all intraoperative anterior chamber samples proved culture negative. sixty-five percent of the preoperative conjunctival swabs were positive for growth, with corynebacteria, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and propionibacterium acnes being the most frequently cultured organisms. sixteen percent of the postoperative conjunctival  swabs were positive for growth, with corynebacteria and coagulase-negative staphylococci being the most common bacteria. one patient developed culture-positive postoperative endophthalmitis; using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis for further typing, the implicated staphylococcus epidermidis was indistinguishable from that isolated from the patient's preoperative conjunctival swab. conclusions: the bacterial contamination rate of the anterior chamber after phacoemulsification and iol implantation was extremely low. additional findings support the conjunctiva as being a primary source of bacteria causing postoperative endophthalmitis as well as the ability of povidone-iodine to reduce the conjunctival bacterial load.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of t-3912, a novel non-fluorinated topical quinolone.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo activity of t-3912, a novel non-fluorinated topical quinolone, was compared with that of nadifloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin and gentamicin. the in vitro activity of t-3912 against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, ofloxacin-resistant  s. epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and propionibacterium acnes was four-fold to 16 000-fold greater than that of other agents at the mic90 for the clinical isolates. the activity of t-3912 was not influenced by grla mutation in s. aureus, and the degree of mic increase of t-3912 for grla-gyra double and triple mutants was lowest among the quinolones tested (nadifloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin). the inhibitory activity of t-3912 was compared with other quinolones for dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv of  s. aureus sa113. t-3912 showed the greatest inhibitory activity for both enzymes  among the quinolones tested. the isolation frequency of spontaneous mutants resistant to t-3912 was < 1.7 x 10(-9) and < 2.0 x 10(-9) for s. aureus sa113 and p. acnes jcm 6425, respectively. furthermore, resistance to t-3912 could not be clearly detected in the 28th transfer by the serial passage method. t-3912 exhibited more potent bactericidal activity against s. aureus and p. acnes than nadifloxacin and clindamycin in a short time period. t-3912 in a 1% gel formulation showed good therapeutic activity against a burn infection model caused by s. aureus sa113, p. acnes jcm6425 and multidrug-resistant s. aureus f-2161. these results indicate that t-3912 is potentially a useful quinolone for  the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections and that its potent bactericidal activity might be able to shorten the treatment period.

TI  == erythromycin-resistance of cutaneous bacterial flora in acne.
AB  == some studies have raised the problem of an increase of bacterial resistance in acne patients. this study was carried out in france, where no previous studies about resistance to erythromycin has been performed, on 40 patients with mild to  moderately severe acne. microbiological samples were obtained by using williamson and kligman method. this study showed that the prevalence of bacterial resistance to erythromycin was 95% for staphylococcus epidermidis strains and 52% for propionibacterium acnes strains. resistant strains were more frequent in patients with predominantly inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules). the influence of  previous or current treatment with erythromycin was also studied and showed that  even patients without any previous use of erythromycin had resistant strains for  propionibacterium acnes (42%). in addition the minimum inhibitory concentrations  (mic) for zinc were evaluated. all the propionibacterium acnes strains tested were inhibited at concentrations less or equal to 512 mug/ml of zinc. however, zinc combined with erythromycin in vitro did not modify the erythromycin mic. this first french study on bacterial resistance to erythromycin in acne patients  confirms the results of studies performed in other countries.

TI  == shunt nephritis from propionibacterium acnes in a solitary kidney.
AB  == since its initial description in 1965, immune complex glomerulonephritis associated with ventriculoatrial shunts (vas) has been reported widely in the literature. the most common incriminating organism is staphylococcus epidermidis, but less often, an organism generally regarded as nonpathogenic, such as propionibacterium acnes, has been noted as the cause. shunt infection usually occurs within a few months after placement or manipulation of the shunt, and shunt nephritis (sn) develops gradually over months to years after. treatment involves mandatory removal of the shunt and antibiotics; prognosis is variable. we report a case of sn with p acnes that is unusual because of its occurrence in  a solitary kidney 6 years after shunt placement, persistently negative blood cultures, and normal complement levels. percutaneous biopsy of a solitary kidney  should be considered if it is expected that the result may guide therapy of progressive renal failure.

TI  == delayed infections after posterior tsrh spinal instrumentation for idiopathic scoliosis: revisited.
AB  == objective: to determine the incidence of delayed infections in idiopathic scoliosis treated with tsrh instrumentation, proper wound management after instrumentation removal, and whether the previously identified bacterial trend remains consistent. methods: all patients with idiopathic scoliosis > or =2 years after surgery with posterior tsrh instrumentation were included. those cases with delayed infections were retrospectively reviewed. time of presentation (infection) from index operation, clinical picture, sedimentation rate, presence  of pseudarthrosis, organisms grown on culture, type of wound closure, and duration of antibiotics were examined. results: a total of 489 patients were identified > or =2 years postoperation; 23 had delayed infections (4.7%). time of presentation averaged 27 months after initial surgery. spontaneous drainage occurred in 15 patients, fluctuance in 6, and neither in the remaining 2 (pain and fever). sedimentation rate averaged 48 mm/hr. all patients had instrumentation removed. primary closure (1 stage) was performed in 14 patients,  and delayed primary closure (> or =2 stages) was performed in nine patients. all  wounds healed uneventfully. cultures at the time of instrumentation removal grew  propionibacterium acnes in 12 patients, staphylococcus epidermidis (or staphylococcus coagulase-negative) in 4, micrococcus varians in 1, and staphylococcus aureus in 1. five patients had negative cultures. after removal, patients received parenteral antibiotics; in 21 of these patients this was followed by oral antibiotics. conclusions: low-virulent skin organisms are primarily responsible for delayed infections. intraoperative seeding followed by  subclinical quiescent periods appears to be the method by which infection occurs. the increased bulk and modularity of modern instrumentation systems can lead to inflammation and bursa formation, thus contributing significantly to the activation of these infections. primary wound closure results in successful wound healing. delayed closure after 48 hours is unnecessary. short-term postoperative  parenteral antibiotics (2-5 days) followed by short-term oral antibiotics (7-14 days) is recommended.

TI  == evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == killing of cutaneous microbial species by photodynamic therapy.
AB  == background: photodynamic therapy (pdt) utilizes photosensitizers and light. whereas pdt use in cancer treatment has been widely accepted, antimicrobial pdt (apdt) is still in its early stages of development. objectives: to study microbial killing in vitro using apdt. methods: we used a combination of methylene blue and visible light, and a range of microbial species representative of those encountered on the skin in health and disease. using standard light intensity conditions (slide projector, 25 cm distance from target, 42 mw cm(-2))  and methylene blue dye at 100 microg ml(-1), kill rates and subsequent d-values were determined against staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, corynebacterium minutissimum, propionibacterium acnes and candida albicans. results: d-values for these species were 72, 66, 48, 120, 30 and 660 s, respectively. the effects of light intensity on the killing of s. epidermidis showed the kill rate to be proportional to the light intensity. a high rate of cell kill was also obtained using natural sunlight. conclusions: overall, these results indicate that apdt of the skin may represent a useful alternative to conventional antimicrobial treatment.

AB  == we examined the species of bacteria aerobically and anaerobically isolated from 30 acne lesions and determined antimicrobial susceptibilities of propionibacterium acnes (p. acnes) and staphylococcus epidermidis (s. epidermidis) using nine antimicrobial agents. among the bacteria isolated, s. epidermidis was most dominant. both p. acnes and s. epidermidis were isolated from half of the acne lesions. the mic of seven antimicrobials (ampicillin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, minocycline, nadifloxacin) against p. acnes was under 3.13 micrograms/ml. there were very few  resistant strains of p. acnes, but many of s. epidermidis. more than 30% of the s. epidermidis isolates were resistant to erythromycin, roxithromycin, and clindamycin. after long-term systemic antibiotic therapy, the resistant strains of s. epidermidis increased, but p. acnes resistance was still limited. when we use antimicrobial agents for the treatment of acne, it should be noticed that not only p. acnes but also s. epidermidis in the acne lesions may acquire resistance  to antimicrobials.

TI  == [in vitro activities of levofloxacin and other antibiotics against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == in this study, the in vitro activity of levofloxacin (lvfx) against 1,020 fresh bacterial clinical isolates was compared with the activities of a range of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin (cpfx), ampicillin (abpc), cefaclor, cefpodoxime, methicillin and benzylpenicillin. the clinical isolates except vibrio cholerae were collected in japan during 1998 from patients with infectious diseases. mics  were determined using the agar dilution method according to the recommendations by the japan society of chemotherapy. some isolates of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and coagulase negative staphylococcus were resistant to fluoroquinolones, but the mic50 of lvfx against mrsa was 6.25 micrograms/ml. lvfx was the most active against mrsa among the antibiotics tested. most of staphylococcus epidermidis strains were susceptible to the fluoroquinolones. lvfx showed greater activity against all streptococci strains compared with fluoroquinolones tested. in particular, all streptococcus pneumoniae strains including prsp were susceptible to lvfx at < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml. among enterococcus, abpc showed superior activity against enterococcus faecalis but many isolates of enterococcus species were resistant to abpc. lvfx was more active against to these enterococcus species compared with other fluoroquinolones. on the other hand, lvfx and cpfx showed similar activity against isolates of enterobacteriaceae. cpfx had an mic50/90 of 0.20, 0.39 microgram/ml and lvfx showed an mic50/90 of 0.78, 1.56 micrograms/ml against pseudomonas aeruginosa. lvfx (mic50/90 0.10, 0.20 microgram/ml) was more active against acinetobacter species than cpfx (mic50/90 0.10, 0.39 microgram/ml). haemophilus influenzae, branhamella (moraxella) catarrhalis and v. cholerae were  inhibited by low concentration of the fluoroquinolones tested. the mic90 of lvfx  and cpfx were < or = 0.10 microgram/ml against above three species. some isolates of neisseria gonorrhoeae and campylobacter species were moderately resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested but the mic50 of lvfx and cpfx were < or = 0.39 microgram/ml. among anaerobes, propionibacterium acnes was more susceptible than  peptostreptococcus species, and the mic90 of beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones tested were < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. in conclusion, this study, performed on large number of strains, confirmed an excellent and wide spectrum antibacterial activity of lvfx compared with the fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams tested. and  our results suggest that lvfx may be useful in the treatment of various bacterial infections.

TI  == [prognosis of postoperative endophthalmitis].
AB  == background: the outcome of 20 patients is summarized in a retrospective study to  identify clinical findings that influence the long-term prognosis of postoperative endophthalmitis. patients: between 1991 and 1997 a total of 20 patients with postoperative endophthalmitis were admitted. median age was 80 years (range: 9-95), 11 patients were male, 9 female. sixteen pars-plana vitrectomies, 2 anterior vitrectomies and 2 rinsings of the anterior chamber without vitrectomy were performed. furthermore, all patients received intraocular and systemic antibiotic treatment. for microbiological investigation, specimens from vitreous, anterior chamber and conjunctiva were sent in. long-term outcome was controlled for an average of 14 months after treatment of the endophthalmitis (range: 4-36 months). results: at the end of treatment, 40% of patients had a visual acuity of 0.4 or better, 80% had 1/20 or better. patients with a preoperative visual acuity of at least hand movement had a better postoperative visual outcome than patients with only light perception. visual acuity was better in patients with chronic endophthalmitis than in patients with acute or subacute  endophthalmitis. in patients with chronic or subacute endophthalmitis, improvement of visual acuity was found some months after the operation more often than in patients with acute endophthalmitis. however, in 40% of cases with an acute onset, no improvement or even worsening of the visual acuity was documented. best postoperative results were found after infection with staphylococcus epidermidis and propionibacterium acnes. conclusion: important prognostic factors of postoperative endophthalmitis are visual acuity, the onset  of the endophthalmitis (acute, subacute or chronic) and the microbiological findings. at the time of surgery and antibiotic treatment, visual acuity should be at least hand motion to expect an improvement in the visual outcome.

TI  == optimizing breast pocket irrigation: an in vitro study and clinical implications.
AB  == subclinical infections have been implicated in the etiology of capsular contracture. intraoperatively, breast pocket irrigation with povidone-iodine or other antibiotic solutions has been popularized; however, detrimental effects on  wound healing for these agents have been reported and their efficacy against common organisms found around breast implants has not been studied. the purpose of this study was to compare the in vitro efficacy of serial dilutions of povidone-iodine and two double antibiotic solutions dab-1 (gentamicin/polymyxin b) and dab-2 (gentamicin/cefazolin), against organisms most commonly found around breast implants. in phase i trials, serial dilutions of povidone-iodine and dab were combined 1:1 with cultures of five common organisms found around implants. in phase ii, povidone-iodine was serially diluted in dab-1 rather than saline. in phase iii, povidone-iodine was serially diluted with dab-2. efficacy for all phases was determined by plating the mixture onto agar plates and incubating at 37 degrees c for 48 hours. povidone-iodine was 100 percent effective at a dilution of 12.5% against staphylococcus epidermidis and 25% against staphylococcus aureus but relatively ineffective against escherichia coli and pseudomonas, dab-1 was found to be ineffective against s. epidermidis but effective against s. aureus, propionibacterium acnes, e. coli, and pseudomonas. in phase ii trials, a concentration of 12.5% povidone-iodine in dab was effective at killing all experimental bacteria. in phase iii trials, 10% povidone-iodine in dab-2 was effective at killing all bacteria tested. in conclusion, to maximize bacterial control of common breast implant organisms and to minimize the detrimental effects on wound healing, 10% povidone-iodine in gentamycin/cefazolin may be used with excellent results and its use clinically may reduce the incidence of capsular contracture.

AB  == thirteen teeth with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis and nine severe periodontal pockets were cultured for presence of beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms. samples were dispersed and plated on two non-selective and one selective growth media and incubated anaerobically and in 10% co2 in air. a total of 59 beta-hemolytic colonies were purified and identified. eight beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates were obtained from three  of the severe marginal periodontitis sites. all were identified as belonging to the streptococcus sanguis group. no beta-hemolytic streptococci were detected in  apical periodontitis samples. twenty obligately anaerobic isolates were detected, all of which were known periodontal and endodontic pathogens. isolates from apical periodontitis sites were identified as propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces naeslundii, actionomyces odontolyticus and peptostreptococcus micros, while severe marginal periodontal sites contained the same species with the addition of actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces meyeri. of 19 staphylococci and  micrococci, staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant isolate in both apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis sites. however, less commonly known organisms such as staphylococcus cohnii and micrococcus sp. were identified in severe marginal periodontitis sites. the isolation of bacillus sp. (12 isolates) in one severe marginal periodontitis and two apical periodontitis subjects was especially interesting, warranting consideration of this organism as a legitimate isolate and potential pathogen in oral disease.

TI  == in vitro viability of external eye microbial flora in hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose.
AB  == the aim of this study was to verify the in vitro influence of various dilutions of a viscoelastic substance containing 2% hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose (hpmc) on the viability of some microbial strains representative of the normal flora of  the external eye. pure reference strain cultures of candida albicans, pseudomonas aeruginosa, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and a fresh clinical isolate of proteus mirabilis were selected for this study. serial twofold dilutions of 2% hpmc, prepared so as to obtain a final concentration ranging from 50 to 0.78% of the product in sterile saline solution  (0.85% nacl), were taken out with a pipette that delivered 1.0 ml per tube. one hundred microliters of the abovementioned microbial inocula, used for the evaluation of the positive control of the test organism, were dispensed into each tube. after 24 h of incubation, 100 microl of samples were taken from each tube and plated into the specific medium for the growth of the test organism. after 24-48 h of incubation, these agar plates were examined and the colony-forming-unit count of each test organism was compared to the corresponding total colony count, acting as a positive control, in order to determine the quantitative variation of the test organism grown in the presence of the viscoelastic compounds. c. albicans and p. aeruginosa showed a statistically significant increase in growth with hpmc dilutions varying from 1:2 to 1:16. p. acnes and p. mirabilis growth was significantly reduced by all dilutions except for the 1:128 one. s. epidermidis growth was also significantly reduced in the presence of hpmc dilutions varying from 1:2 to 1:64. s. aureus growth was not significantly influenced. the viability of p. aeruginosa in hpmc dilutions needs  to be carefully considered because of the ability of this organism to induce endophthalmitis, and the possibility that during cataract surgery, a small amount of hpmc may be left in the eye, trapped behind the intraocular lens optic.

TI  == [bacterial keratitis in patients with and without contact lens anamnesis].
AB  == background: the study shows differences between contact lens wearers and patients without history of contact lenses regarding the spectrum of etiological agents in bacterial keratitis. based on microbiological analysis, there are given recommendations for an optimal initial antibiotic treatment in both groups. material and methods: from 1989 to 1997 smears, scrapings and corneal biopsies were taken from 218 patients with bacterial keratitis. the causing pathogens were isolated on directly inoculated culture media and identified by staining and microscopy. the resistance pattern of a total of 275 germs was analysed for different antibiotics. results: the most frequently isolated germs were staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus spp., propionibacterium acnes and pseudomonas aeruginosa. whereas sensitive gram-positive germs were predominating in contact lens wearers as well as in non-contact lens wearers, multiresistant gram-negative germs could nearly exclusively be isolated from contact lens wearers. frequently administered antibiotics like aminoglycosides and quinolones are effective in infections caused by staphylococcus spp., but increasing resistance could be seen to streptococcus spp. in this case, erythromycin is very sensitive. gram-negative germs like pseudomonas aeruginosa are sensitive to quinolones and some aminoglycosides (e.g. tobramycin). conclusion: in contact lens wearers, more aggressive germs have to be considered than in non-contact lens wearers. in such  cases, frequently administered antibiotics like amino-glycosides are not effective. to cover problematic gram-negative germs we recommend the application  of quinolones alternating with erythromycin. the latter one is more effective than quinolones and aminoglycosides in case of streptococcus spp. co-involvement.

TI  == prospective evaluation of external ocular microbial growth and aqueous humor contamination during cataract surgery.
AB  == purpose: to analyze the route of aqueous humor contamination leading to the development of postoperative endophthalmitis. setting: department of ophthalmology, university of helsinki, finland. methods: forty-nine eyes of 49 patients (31 having phacoemulsification and 18 extracapsular cataract extraction  [ecce]) participated in the study. four bacterial cultures were taken: preoperative conjunctival swab, lid margin culture, intraoperative lacrimal lake  sample, and immediate postoperative anterior chamber fluid sample. results: preoperative lid margin cultures were positive in 59.2% of eyes, conjunctival cultures in 69.4%, and lacrimal lake cultures in 24.9%. four aqueous humor samples (8.2%) showed bacterial growth in the anterior chamber aspirate: 3 in the phacoemulsification and 1 in the ecce group. the bacteria isolated in this study, staphylococcus epidermidis and propionibacterium acnes (2 positive isolates each) were sensitive to the preoperative topical antibiotics used. no aqueous humor sample or any from other locations showed gram-negative microbe growth. the most  frequently recovered microbes in all samples collected from the 3 other sources were s epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, followed  by p acnes and other propionibacterium species. staphylococcus aureus, and diptheroids. conclusion: the ocular surface significantly contributed to the transmission of microbes into the eye during cataract surgery. these microbes could not be eradicated by topical preoperative antibiotics. however, no patient  developed postoperative endophthalmitis. natural defense mechanisms appear to fend off a minor inoculum with these microbes of relatively low pathogenicity.

TI  == improved detection of infection in hip replacements. a currently underestimated problem.
AB  == our aim was to determine if the detection rate of infection of total hip replacements could be improved by examining the removed prostheses. immediate transfer of prostheses to an anaerobic atmosphere, followed by mild ultrasonication to dislodge adherent bacteria, resulted in the culture of quantifiable numbers of bacteria, from 26 of the 120 implants examined. the same  bacterial species were cultured by routine microbiological techniques from only five corresponding tissue samples. tissue removed from 18 of the culture-positive implants was suitable for quantitative tissue pathology and inflammatory cells were present in all samples. furthermore, inflammatory cells were present in 87%  of tissue samples taken from patients whose implants were culture-negative. this  suggests that these implants may have been infected by bacteria which were not isolated by the techniques of culture used. the increased detection of bacteria from prostheses by culture has improved postoperative antibiotic therapy and should reduce the need for further revision.

TI  == possible implication of sterile connecting device in contamination of pooled platelet concentrates.
AB  == considering the possibility that a pooled random donor platelet concentrate could become contaminated by welding with a sterile connecting device, we undertook a study to determine the influence of pooling on the contamination rate. as a control group, apheresis platelets were examined. bacteriological testing was done with a sensitive co2 detecting culture system, the bact/ alert. out of 1105  pooled platelet concentrates prepared by the buffy coat method, 15 (1.4%) were confirmed as contaminated, all with staphylococcus epidermidis and two with a second bacterial species, i.e. staphylococcus capitis and propionibacterium acnes, respectively. median detection time by the bact/alert was 23 h. twelve pools of five units were contaminated, which is significantly more than the three contaminated pools of four units. on the other hand, the reuse of the welding wafers proved not be a risk factor for contamination. one welded tubing segment of a contaminated platelet concentrate failed the air leakage test, an incident which was 73 times more frequent than with the sterile platelet concentrates. we  found five pooled platelet concentrates containing staphylococci from which no bacteria could be grown from the individual buffy coats that had been pooled. we  suggest the contamination here to have occurred after separation of the buffy coat from the whole blood, possibly during the welding process. finally, none out of 378 apheresis platelet concentrates was contaminated. all our observations highlight the potential risk for contamination when making pooled platelet concentrates with a sterile connecting device. for this type of transfusion product, we advocate bacteriological screening of all units before release. the incubation time for the sterility test should, however, be limited to 36 h, if logistical problems with the availability of platelets are to be avoided.

AB  == igg subclasses specific to staphylococcus epidermidis and propionibacterium acnes were determined in sera from patients with mild, moderate or severe acne and from a control group. titres specific to s. epidermidis were all within the same range and did not differ between groups. the titres of igg subclasses to specific to p. acnes did vary between groups. igg1 and igg3 were significantly higher in severe  acne patients compared with moderate acne patients, while igg2 was significantly  higher in moderate and severe patients compared with controls. titres of igg4 did not differ between groups. the pattern of titres observed suggests that, while the antibody response to s. epidermidis is relatively harmless, antibodies to p.  acnes may be involved in the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris.

TI  == bacteraemia caused by periodontal probing.
AB  == bacteraemia of oral origin may result in infective endocarditis in susceptible individuals. the aim of this pilot study was to investigate the occurrence of bacteraemia due to periodontal probing. thirty patients (15 male, 15 female; mean age 42.7 years) with untreated periodontitis were investigated. all were free of  significant medical disorders and none had taken antibiotics in the previous month. prior to and immediately following periodontal probing, 20 ml of venous blood were obtained from each patient and inoculated into aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles and incubated. negative bottles were monitored continuously for three weeks before being discarded. periodontal probing consisted of measuring pockets at six points around each tooth and recording the presence or absence of bleeding. a positive bacteraemia was recorded for three of the patients prior to probing. one patient exhibited prevotella species whilst two exhibited skin commensals. following probing, 13 patients (43 per cent) exhibited bacteraemia of oral origin. viridans streptococci were the most common isolates (45 per cent). no significant correlations were found between bacteraemia and the severity of periodontitis or extent of bleeding on probing. the results indicate  that periodontal probing can cause bacteraemia in patients with periodontitis. it would be advisable for patients considered at risk of developing infective endocarditis to receive antibiotic prophylaxis for periodontal probing if they have radiographic evidence of periodontitis.

TI  == identification and antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from periapical lesions.
AB  == periradicular tissues from 28 refractory endodontic cases requiring surgical intervention were submitted for histological diagnosis and microbiological culture. bacteria isolated from these lesions were identified and then tested for their antibiotic sensitivity to a panel of common antibiotics. the periapical tissue specimens of 22 out of 28 lesions (79%) contained microorganisms. of the 22 cases showing positive growth cultures, 15 were polymicrobial and 7 were single species isolates. fifty-three different species were recovered: 29 anaerobes, 19 facultative anaerobes, and 5 aerobes. microbes were observed under  light microscopy in only one case. the most common organisms isolated were propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus intermedius, wolinella recta, fusobacterium species, and clostridium species. antibiotic susceptibility results showed no clear cut evidence of significant antibiotic resistance among the species tested. the results of this study seem to corroborate earlier studies regarding the microbial population of periapical lesions refractory to nonsurgical endodontics.

TI  == presumed noninfectious endophthalmitis after cataract surgery.
AB  == purpose: to study the clinical features and results of conservative management in cases of presumed noninfectious endophthalmitis after cataract surgery. setting:  l.v. prasad eye institute, hyderabad, india. methods: this retrospective study evaluated cases of presumed noninfectious endophthalmitis occurring after cataract surgery in a hospital-based population. patients with minimal hypopyon and decreased visual acuity unassociated with pain, lid edema, conjunctival chemosis, corneal abscess, and obvious vitreous involvement were treated conservatively. the mainstays of treatment were topical and systemic steroids. four eyes with clinical evidence of worsening required surgical intervention. main outcome measures were resolution of inflammation and final visual acuity. results: in 23 of 27 patients, the inflammation resolved with medical therapy alone; 21 had a final visual acuity of 20/50 or better. in 3 of the 4 eyes that had surgery, the culture was positive for low virulent organisms; all had a satisfactory outcome. one eye with preoperative glaucoma developed absolute glaucoma with resolution of inflammation. conclusion: noninfectious endophthalmitis invariably presents with hypopyon and decreased vision unassociated with pain and lid edema. a trial of medical therapy with corticosteroids as the mainstay of treatment is often rewarding. frequent monitoring and preparation for surgical intervention if required are key.

TI  == microbial evaluation: 139 implants removed from symptomatic patients.
AB  == possible adverse effects of microbial organisms have been implicated in symptomatic silicone implant patients. in the literature, numerous authors have investigated the possible role of infection with respect to implant problems. to  date, various bacterial species have been reported, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococci, and clostridium perfringens. infections in polyurethane-coated prostheses also have been shown to prolong morbidity. antibiotic use has been relatively empirical in this regard. the purpose of this study was, first, to determine the frequency, type, and clinical relevance of microbial colonization on implant surfaces removed from symptomatic patients and, second, to determine possible effects of microbial colonization on implant integrity (gel bleed, rupture). a total of 139 implants from 72 symptomatic patients were entered into the prospective clinical study between february of 1993 and july of 1994 at the ucla medical center. the implant shell types included smooth (79 percent), polyurethane (8 percent), textured (7 percent), and smooth and dacron (6 percent). the implant locations were subglandular (71 percent), submuscular (28 percent), and subcutaneous (1 percent). of the 139 implants removed, 69 percent were intact and 31 percent were ruptured. forty-seven percent of 139 implants were culture-positive. propionibacterium acnes was isolated most frequently (57.5 percent), followed by  staphylococcus epidermidis (41 percent), and then escherichia coli (1.5 percent). no fungal infections were identified. culture positivity was not significantly associated with systemic symptoms. sixty-seven percent of the positive culture implants were intact; 33 percent were ruptured. the frequency (47 percent) and types (p. acnes and s. epidermidis) of microbial colonization are determined in symptomatic silicone implant patients.

TI  == [antibiotic prophylaxis in open fractures].
AB  == the administration of antibiotics is now generally accepted as a prophylactic treatment of infection in compound fractures. nevertheless the question is not completely resolved and many problems are still to be discussed.the efficacy of antibiotherapy in this field has just been recently demonstrated ; with the animals by worlock et al. (1988) using an experimental rabbit model, and clinically by braul et al. (1987) which randomized 87 patients with open fractures to receive either cloxacillin or placebo. the rate of infection was significantly lower in the antibiotic group.no reports comparing various antimicrobial drugs draw effective conclusions regarding the choice of antibiotics. in the same way it seems that the time of interval from injury to antibiotic administration was not associated with a significantly different incidence of infection.the study of duration of the treatment was perfectly conducted by dellinger. in his prospective trial 248 patients received different  doses of the same antibiotic, from a single dose to four doses daily during 5 days. in conclusion he found no relation between the duration of the treatment and the risk of infection.a semantic but very important question concerns the reality of a preventive action of antibiotics against infection in open fractures. in order to answer, it is necessary to assess the incidence of contamination, its nature and its density.according to papers reporting the results of early cultures of the fracture wound, bacterial contamination was present in 30-70% of the cases. but the bacteria most commonly isolated were members of the normal skin flora (staphylococcus epidermidis, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium sp. micrococcus) or environmental contaminants which infrequently were the cause of infection.the specimens taken from patients who have an infection show mostly hospitalacquired bacteria as staphylococcus aureus  or pseudomonas aeruginosa. these findings emphasize the risk of colonization of the wound by nosocomial bacteria.in addition, it seems that the density of contamination may also be a determinant of subsequent clinical infection. quantitative bacterial counts suggest a greater risk of infection when microorganisms were present in high number more than 105 colony forming unit per  g. of tissue.in conclusion, the prophylactic action of antibiotics against infection in open fractures is well established, but many points are still subject to discussion and need further study. furthermore antibioprophylaxis is only a complement to surgical treatment, debridement and immobilization, which remains of paramount importance.

TI  == clinical significance of intracapsular fluid in patients' breast implants.
AB  == clinical reports on the incidence and clinical significance of intracapsular fluid are lacking in the literature. it remains unknown whether the presence of intracapsular fluid has any relation to implant infection or colonization. the purpose of this study was to determine the frequency and type of intracapsular fluid, specifically, whether intracapsular fluid causes implant infection, implant rupture, or bacterial colonization. a total of 139 implants from 72 symptomatic patients were entered into the prospective clinical study. our study  demonstrated the presence of intracapsular fluid in 21 of 139 (15%) implants. positive microbial cultures were identified in 39% of the implants in the positive intracapsular fluid group, compared to 43% in the negative fluid group.  there was no statistically significant difference between these groups. also, no  adverse clinical relationship was demonstrated between local symptoms and presence of intracapsular fluid. there was, however, a positive trend toward the  presence of fluid when implant shell types were nonsmooth (polyurethane and textured silicone implants). further studies are indicated to elucidate the fluid production mechanism and possible secretory activity of prosthetic capsules interfacing the textured breast implant surface.

AB  == major components of two tea-tree oil samples were identified using thin layer and gas-liquid chromatography (tlc and glc). using a tlc-bioautographic technique, the tea-tree oils, terpinen-4-ol, alpha-terpineol and alpha-pinene were found to  be active against staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis and propionibacterium acnes whereas cineole was inactive against these organisms. the mic values of the three active compounds increased in the order alpha-terpineol < terpinen-4-ol < alpha-pinene for all three micro-organisms. mic values of the tea-tree oils and terpinen-4-ol were lower for p. acnes than for the two staphylococci. this study  supports the use of tea-tree oil in the treatment of acne, and demonstrates that  terpinen-4-ol is not the sole active constituent of the oil.

TI  == in vitro modulation of keratinocyte-derived interleukin-1 alpha (il-1 alpha) and  peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived il-1 beta release in response to cutaneous commensal microorganisms.
AB  == the ability of a range of skin commensal microorganisms to modulate interleukin-1 (il-1) release by cultured human keratinocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) was investigated by a combination of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and bioassays. three fractions (formaldehyde-treated whole cells, culture  supernatants, and cellular fractions) were prepared from propionibacterium acnes, propionibacterium granulosum, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis, staphylococcus hominis, and malassezia furfur serovar b. the levels of immunochemical il-1 alpha released by cultured keratinocytes during coincubations with these microbial fractions ranged from 0 to 136 pg/ml and were maximal after  72 h. no microbial fraction consistently upregulated immunochemical il-1 alpha release by freshly isolated keratinocytes from two donors and a transformed cell  line, all of which produced the cytokine constitutively to various extents. bioassays revealed that most of the il-1 released was biologically inactive. in contrast, whole cells of formaldehyde-treated p. granulosum and s. epidermidis significantly stimulated release of il-1 beta by pbmcs from three donors compared with the negative control (culture medium). release was maximal at 24 h. coincubation with intact cells of the yeast m. furfur significantly decreased levels of il-1 beta below the values for the negative control by pbmcs from all three donors. there was good correlation between bioassay data and immunoassay data for il-1 beta, and the depressive effect of m. furfur cells on cytokine production by all three cultures of pbmcs was mirrored in the levels of bioactive cytokine. this reduction in il-1 beta release by pbmcs by m. furfur may provide an explanation why dermatoses thought to be caused by this yeast are essentially  noninflammatory or only mildly inflammatory.

TI  == delayed infections following posterior spinal instrumentation for the treatment of idiopathic scoliosis.
AB  == ten patients who had been managed with posterior spinal arthrodesis and texas scottish rite hospital instrumentation because of idiopathic scoliosis had a delayed deep wound infection at an average of twenty-five months after the operation. the signs of infection included spontaneous drainage in eight patients and fluctuance in two patients. in addition, six patients--including five of the  eight who had drainage--had mild pain in the back. the average erythrocyte sedimentation rate was thirty-nine millimeters per hour (range, nineteen to eighty-one millimeters per hour). the instrumentation was removed from all of the patients. in two patients, a pseudarthrosis that had not been noted on preoperative radiographs was noted intraoperatively; in both patients, the pseudarthrosis occurred at a level at which two hooks had been placed in one intervertebral space. primary closure was performed in seven patients, and delayed primary closure was performed on the third postoperative day in three patients. all wounds healed uneventfully. cultures of specimens taken from deep within the wound were positive for propionibacterium acnes (five patients), staphylococcus epidermidis (two patients), a rare coagulase-negative staphylococcus species (one patient), or micrococcus varians (one patient). no organisms grew on culture of the specimen obtained from the remaining patient. propionibacterium acnes required an extended period of incubation before identification. antibiotics were administered parenterally to all of the patients after the removal of the hardware, and this treatment was followed by oral administration of antibiotics for nine of the patients. we suspect--but can not prove--that several of the delayed infections resulted from intraoperative seeding and remained subclinical for an extended period of time.

AB  == purpose: bacterial contamination of anterior chamber at the end of cataract surgery, was compared between two techniques: extracapsular extraction and phacoemulsification. the effectiveness of preoperative antibiotic eyedrops using  norfloxacine 0.3% (chibroxine) was also evaluated. method: the study focused on 101 patients grouped according to surgical technique and presence of preoperative antibiotic eyedrops. conjunctival sampling was made the day prior the surgery, as well as in the operating room, after skin and conjunctival desinfection with povidone iodine in all the patients included in the study. aqueous humour was collected at the end of surgery. results: eight samples out of 101 were positive  which represents 7.9% of the cases. in 75% of the cases, the anterior chamber aspirate showed a different germ or non-recurrent germ in the second conjunctival sample. none of the included patients developed endophthalmitis. the two most frequent pathogens were propionibacterium acnes in 62.5% of the cases, and staphylococcus epidermidis in 50%. another pathogen was found in a culture environment: micrococcus roseus. in two samples, two different bacteria grew: propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus epidermidis. whatever the surgical technique, no statistically significant bacterial contamination was found. there  was no significant statistical difference between patients who had local antibiotic eyedrops and those who did not. conclusion: this study confirms the poor reliability of local antibiotic eyedrops to prevent surgical contamination.  furthermore performing an anterior chamber aspirate at the end of the surgery for risk patients would help the physician identify the pathogens involved in endophthalmitis in order to begin antibiotic treatment as soon as possible.

AB  == increasing reports of gentamicin-resistant bacteria contaminating donor corneas and causing endophthalmitis have indicated that preservation of corneal storage media with 100 micrograms/ml of gentamicin alone needs reevaluation. we investigated the stability and possible cytotoxicity of streptomycin as a supplement to gentamicin in optisol corneal storage medium. the combination of gentamicin and streptomycin in optisol solution was stable at room temperature for at least 4 weeks and inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, alpha hemolytic streptococci, streptococcus group d, propionibacterium acnes, escherichia coli, and diphtheroids, but not pseudomonas  aeruginosa. the addition of vancomycin did not significantly improve the antibacterial effectiveness of the gentamicin and streptomycin combination when stored at 4 degrees c. the growth of 15 of 20 clinical ocular isolates of ps. aeruginosa was suppressed by the gentamicin-streptomycin combination. streptomycin in concentrations of up to 1,000 micrograms/ml did not decrease the  mitotic activity of corneal endothelial cells as evaluated by the in vitro incorporation of tritiated thymidine or cause cytotoxicity. the addition of 200 micrograms/ml of streptomycin to optisol corneal storage medium containing 100 micrograms/ml of gentamicin may significantly improve activity against gentamicin-sensitive and gentamicin-resistant contaminants.

TI  == effects of benzoyl peroxide and erythromycin alone and in combination against antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant skin bacteria from acne patients.
AB  == topical formulations of erythromycin and benzoyl peroxide are popular and effective treatments for mild to moderate acne vulgaris. use of the former is associated with resistance gain in both skin propionibacteria and coagulase-negative staphylococci, whereas use of the latter is not. we evaluated  the efficacy of a combination of erythromycin and benzoyl peroxide against a total of 40 erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant strains of staphylococcus epidermidis and skin propionibacteria in vitro. using the checkerboard technique, five erythromycin resistant strains of propionibacterium acnes were inhibited synergistically or additively by the combination. complete mutual indifference was exhibited between the drugs against the remaining 35 strains. however, erythromycin resistant staphylococci and propionibacteria were inhibited by the same concentration of benzoyl peroxide as erythromycin-sensitive strains. these results suggest that, although the combination of erythromycin and benzoyl peroxide is not synergistic against the majority of erythromycin-resistant staphylococci and propionibacteria, the concomitant therapeutic use of both drugs should counteract the selection of erythromycin-resistant variants and reduce the number of pre-existing resistant organisms on the skin of acne patients.

AB  == the effect of the topical acne treatment azelaic acid on the transmembrane proton gradient (delta ph) of propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus epidermidis was studied in vitro at external ph values found on human skin (ph 4.0-6.0). bacteria were grown in defined media using continuous culture and delta ph was estimated by measuring the accumulation of [14c] benzoic by the cells using flow dialysis.  in both p. acnes and s. epidermidis the addition of 30 mm azelaic acid and the membrane active inhibitors nigericin (150 microm) and cccp (150 microm) resulted  in a rapid release of [14c] label into the dialysate indicating the dissipation of delta ph between external ph values of 4.0-6.0. the addition of 60 mm nacl as  an iso-osmotic control and 150 microm valinomycin did not induce the release of [14c] label. the addition of 30 mm azelaic acid reduced the delta ph of p. acnes  by 44% at external ph 4.0 and 28% at external ph 6.0. in s. epidermidis 30 mm azelaic acid reduced delta ph by 88% at external ph 5.0 and 20% at external ph 6.0. rapid loss of viability occurred in suspensions of p. acnes and s. epidermidis containing 30 mm azelaic acid at ph 4.0 with no viable cells recovered after 60 min incubation. at ph 6.0 little change in viable numbers of p. acnes and s. epidermidis were observed over a 2 h incubation period. the results indicate that the antibacterial activity of azelaic acid is associated with the perturbation of intracellular ph.

AB  == follicular concentrations of azelaic acid (aza) were determined in vivo using a rapid, non-invasive method, after a single topical application of 20% (w/w) aza cream, in order to establish whether the in vitro antimicrobial effects observed  in previous studies are relevant in vivo. preweighed amounts of 20% (w/w) aza cream were applied over demarcated areas on the forehead and back of nine young adults, and samples were taken over a period of 5 h. aza was removed from the skin surface by washing with acetone, and follicular casts were collected using cyanacrylate gel. the samples were centrifuged to remove particulate matter, and  the supernatants derivatized for analysis by hplc. although the results showed wide-ranging variability, the follicular concentration increased as the amount present on the surface declined. the maximum follicular concentrations of aza attained ranged from 7.5 to 52.5 ng (micrograms of follicular casts)-1 and 0.5 to 23.4 ng (micrograms of follicular casts)-1 in samples taken from the back and forehead, respectively. assuming an average density of follicular material of 0.9 g ml-1, the mean maximum follicular concentration attained on the back was between 36 and 251 mmol/l, and on the forehead was between 2 and 112 mmol/l, and  indicates that the concentration of aza attained in follicular casts after a single topical application is comparable with the concentration required to inhibit the growth of propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus epidermidis, in  vitro.

TI  == the incidence of bacteraemia following laryngeal mask insertion.
AB  == the incidence of bacteraemia following insertion of the laryngeal mask airway (lma) was investigated in one hundred fit patients. four cultures were positive:  three represented contamination with skin flora; the other was a microaerophilic  streptococcus grown from an anaerobic culture bottle. although this organism can  be pathogenic, it may also represent contamination. our findings suggest that significant bacteraemia on insertion of the lma is uncommon and is probably no more than with oral intubation. antibiotic prophylaxis is of doubtful benefit in  these circumstances.

TI  == comparisons of the bacterial flora in genital regions at non-pregnancy.
AB  == in the development of infectious diseases at non-pregnancy and at pregnancy, correlations between bacterial flora in the vagina and portio vaginalis and the ascending infections of those bacteria have recently been discussed. to clarify the cause of those infectious diseases, we studied the localization of microorganisms in genital regions. patients undergone abdominal total hysterectomy (n = 172) were employed as subjects, and microorganisms isolated from 4 genital regions were studied. in addition, the preventive effect of cefmetazole (cmz) against postoperative infections was analyzed in 479 cases including the hysterectomy cases mentioned above. the results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. the isolation rate of microorganisms at non-pregnancy,  from subjects of 30 to 69 years old, was 65.6% (82/125) in the vagina and portio  vaginalis, 52.1% (25/48) in the cervical mucus, 7.3% (9/124) in the uterine cavity and 0% (0/47) in the ovarian surface. 2. numbers of microorganisms isolated in each region were 99 strains in the vagina and portio vaginalis, 28 in the cervical mucus, 10 in the uterine cavity and none in the ovarian surface. isolation of aerobic gram-positive bacteria (60-89.3%) and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (7.1-30%) were varied in each region. lactobacillus spp. (38 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (20 strains) and propionibacterium acnes (10 strains) were isolated from vagina and portio vaginalis, and lactobacillus spp. (17 strains) were the most often isolated bacteria from the cervical mucus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == influence of the ph-value on the growth of staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus and propionibacterium acnes in continuous culture.
AB  == a cutaneous isolate of staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus and propionibacterium acnes was grown in continuous culture at varying ph-values ranging from 5.0 to 8.5. in terms of the specific growth rate as well as the bacterial density during the plateau phase there were remarkable differences. in  particular, propionibacterium acnes grew much better in the ph 6.0 to 7.0 range than in a more acidic or alkaline milieu. staphylococcus epidermidis resembled staphylococcus aureus showing no major difference at ph 5.5 and 7.0. these findings substantiate the hypothesis that minor changes of the ph in the ph 5.5 to ph 6.0 range as to be induced by chemically neutral or alkaline skin cleansers on the human skin surface can increase the number of propionibacteria but not staphylococci remarkably due to the relative alkalinity by itself.

TI  == posterior lens capsule abscess due to propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus  epidermidis following extracapsular cataract extraction.
AB  == a case of posterior lens capsular abscess occurring many months after an extracapsular cataract extraction is presented. this was caused by a mixed infection involving propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus epidermidis. the significance of staph epidermidis after such a long postoperative period is uncertain, but the case shows features typical of secondary endophthalmitis due to p acnes, including a long delay in onset and a grumbling course not brought under control by medical treatment. it supports the theory that the nidus of infection is localised in the posterior lens capsule by showing development of a  visible capsular abscess with associated vitreous involvement. the subsequent removal of the capsule and vitreous, despite leaving the intraocular lens in place, led to complete resolution of the inflammation. both organisms have previously been found to be sequestered in the posterior lens capsule by histological and microbiological examination of excised capsular specimens. it is important to consider them as possible causative agents in the formation of a postoperative capsular abscess.

AB  == a previous prospective double-blind placebo-controlled study showed that cloxacillin prophylaxis significantly reduces the rate of infection after craniotomy. the purpose of the present follow-up study was to find out whether the data on routine cloxacillin prophylaxis would confirm the decreased infection rate after craniotomy. during this 1-year study, 8 infections occurred after 201  operations (4.0%) in 175 patients. no prophylaxis was given during 17 operations  in 15 patients; 4 infections occurred in this group. the most frequently isolated microorganisms were staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, and propionibacterium  acnes, all of which were sensitive to cloxacillin. we conclude that cloxacillin is beneficial as prophylaxis in patients undergoing craniotomy.

TI  == peripheral teflon catheters. potential source for bacterial contamination of orthopedic implants?
AB  == to detect low numbers of bacterial cells on teflon catheters removed from peripheral veins, 74 catheter tips were incubated in thioglycollate media for up  to ten days. fifteen (20.3%) of the catheters were found to be culture-positive.  propionibacterium acnes was isolated from seven, staphylococcus epidermidis from  six, and staphylococcus haemolyticus and staphylococcus hominis from one each, all common skin organisms associated with infection of implants. an increase in documentation of bacterial contamination resulted from incubating greater than 72 hours; this allowed the slower-replicating propionibacterium acnes to grow to detectable numbers. because of these findings and those of others, attention is focused on the peripheral vein conduit as a potential source for hematogenous seeding of implants with bacterial cells. changing peripheral catheters within 24 hours is recommended to reduce the constant risk of occult bacteremia.

AB  == the abilities of various macrophage-activating agents to trigger tumoricidal activity and/or the secretion of prostaglandin e2 (pge2), interleukin 6 (il 6) and transforming growth factor beta (tgf beta) in bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes (bmm phi) in vitro were comparatively assessed. induction of tumoricidal activity by lymphokines, that is only short-lived, was not associated with enhanced secretion of these activities by bmm phi; in contrast, incubation with heat-killed facultative intracellular bacteria resulted in persisting tumoricidal activity and in marked enhancement of the secretion of il 6 and pge2, but not of tgf beta activity. these findings support the concept that the pattern of the secretory response induced in macrophages by lymphokines differs from that triggered by bacteria and that the rapid decay of lymphokine-induced tumoricidal  activity is not due to autocrine macrophage deactivation mediated by one of these agents alone.

AB  == during a double-blind placebo-controlled study, the effect of cloxacillin prophylaxis in craniotomies on samples taken for culture from 334 operation wounds in 279 patients was assessed. patients and operations were equally divided over the cloxacillin and placebo groups. in the cloxacillin group significantly fewer samples contained microorganisms than was the case in the placebo group both just after the incision was made (p less than 0.05) and just before closure  of the wound (p less than 0.001). the contaminating bacteria found most frequently were propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus epidermidis. for material collected immediately after the incision, the percentage of cultures positive for s. epidermidis was significantly (p = 0.001) lower in the cloxacillin group than in the placebo group; the percentage of cultures with p. acnes did not differ between the two groups. for samples taken just before the wound was closed, the percentage of cultures with p. acnes or s. epidermidis was  significantly (p = 0.008 and 0.003, respectively) lower in the cloxacillin than in the placebo group. in the placebo group neurosurgical infections occurred with p. acnes and/or s. epidermidis as causative microorganisms; in almost all cases those bacteria could be cultured from the edge of the wound. in none of the patients with an infection caused by s. aureus was the bacteria found in the operation area. in 2/6 infections in the cloxacillin group the infecting microorganisms could be cultured from the operation area. these findings support  a significant reduction in the infection rate after craniotomy under cloxacillin  prophylaxis compared with placebo.

TI  == analysis of the proinflammatory property of epidermal cyst contents: chemotactic  c5a anaphylatoxin generation.
AB  == we investigated in vitro the contents of epidermal cysts for complement activation and found that they activated complement mainly through the alternative pathway. chemotactic c5a anaphylatoxin produced by the cyst contents  after contact with serum most likely plays a significant role in the initiation and aggravation of inflammation in ruptured epidermal cysts. our additional study disclosed that components of three representative follicular resident microorganisms (pityrosporum ovale, propionibacterium acnes, and staphylococcus epidermidis) also produced c5a anaphylatoxin mainly through the alternative pathway; the c5a production was more vigorous than that by a virulent pathogen, staphylococcus aureus. these results suggest that accidental colonization of the  cyst contents by these follicular microbial flora further augments the inflammatory changes in ruptured epidermal cysts.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo evaluation of a-56268 (te-031), a new macrolide.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of a-56268 (te-031), the 6-o-methyl derivative of erythromycin, was compared with those of erythromycin and other reference drugs. a-56268 had the same spectrum of antibacterial activity as erythromycin. a-56268 was generally 1 log2 dilution more potent or equal to erythromycin against all organisms except haemophilus influenzae and propionibacterium acnes, for which a-56268 was 1 log2 dilution and 3 log2 dilutions, respectively, less potent. the mbc of a-56268 and erythromycin was not significantly different from the mic against streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, and h. influenzae but was more than 2 log2 dilutions higher than the mics for some staphylococcus aureus strains. human serum at a concentration of 50% did not change the in vitro potency of a-56268 or erythromycin. a-56268 was similar to erythromycin in being  more active at ph 8.0 than at the physiologic ph of 7.3. the activity of a-56268  was synergistic with sulfamethoxazole against 4 of 12 strains of h. influenzae. in mouse protection tests, when administered orally a-56268 was more potent than  erythromycin against h. influenzae, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, and s. aureus. after subcutaneous administration the potencies of a-56268 and erythromycin were  not statistically different from each other. a-56268 was more potent than erythromycin against legionella infection in guinea pigs. the concentration of a-56268 in the serum and lung was higher than that of erythromycin after intraperitoneal administration. in a-56268 in the serum and lung was higher than  that of erythromycin after intraperitoneal administration. in mice, the peak levels in serum of a-56268 and erythromycin were similar after subcutaneous administration and seven times higher for a-56268 after oral administration. the  serum half-life of a-56268 was approximately twice that of erythromycin after administration by both routes.

TI  == the microbial flora of the continent cecal urinary reservoir, its stoma and the peristomal skin.
AB  == the bacteria occurring in reservoir urine, on the cutaneous stoma and on the abdominal skin were studied in 9 patients who had undergone urinary diversion via a continent cecal reservoir. aerobic and/or facultatively anaerobic bacteria were isolated persistently from reservoir urine in 3 patients but only occasionally in the remainder. these organisms were isolated in pure culture. anaerobic bacteria  also were found, although infrequently and only in conjunction with facultative anaerobes. most stomal cultures showed heavy growth of staphylococcus epidermidis, while fewer microbes were isolated in the abdominal skin cultures. propionibacterium acnes, present in most skin cultures, was absent or scantily represented on the stoma. microbial antibiosis was demonstrated in vitro between  stomal and urinary reservoir bacteria in 6 patients. however, bacteria from stomal isolates had no antagonistic effect against bacteria belonging to the family of enterobacteriacae or against anaerobic species isolated from urine. antibiosis may influence the microbial ecology of the urine reservoir and cutaneous stoma.

TI  == protease production by microorganisms associated with reproductive tract infection.
AB  == factors influencing pathogenicity of various microbes found in the female lower genital tract remain incompletely understood. protease production by cervico/vaginal microorganisms may alter or inactivate a variety of proteins important in host defense and structural-functional integrity including collagen-containing chorioamniotic membranes and uterine cervix. host tissues may be made more susceptible to other organisms' virulence factors by protease-producing members of genital tract local flora. microorganisms themselves may also be influenced by the presence of other microbial protease. nonspecific protease, gelatinase, collagenase, and elastase production was examined for in vitro with use of aerobic (30) and anaerobic (25) strains of microorganisms typical of those isolated from the lower genital tract of women with premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, and puerperal infection. microorganisms including bacteroides bivius, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus species, and propionibacterium acnes produce various proteases. protease production by both acknowledged pathogenic and commensal bacteria may contribute to the occurrence of reproductive tract morbidity including premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor.

TI  == evaluation of the sterility and stability of insulin from multidose vials used for prolonged periods.
AB  == diabetic patients frequently use their insulin vials for prolonged periods, even  though antibacterial preservatives used in multidose insulin vials are not required to be effective beyond 28 days. for this reason, we evaluated the antibacterial activity present in multidose insulin vials for up to 50 days. multidose lente insulin vials were inoculated with s. aureus and p. aeruginosa. vials incubated at room temperature (21 degrees c) were sterile by 48 hours, whereas when they were incubated at refrigerator temperatures (4 degrees c), s. aureus contamination persisted up to the 17th day and p. aeruginosa were killed after 10 days. the same vials were serially contaminated on days 17, 30, and 50,  and a similar antibacterial effect was maintained. sixty-nine multidose insulin vials used for an average of 53 days were cultured. eight vials demonstrated bacterial contamination with 1 cfu/ml of s. epidermidis or propionibacterium acnes. no endotoxin was detected in the multidose vials used for more than 28 days. insulin assays on 40 multidose insulin vials used for more than 28 days showed an average insulin content of 101.6 +/- 1.9 units/ml. this study did not demonstrate significant bacterial contamination, endotoxin activity, or insulin degradation of multidose insulin in vials used for periods longer than 28 days. in addition, antibacterial preservatives were more effective at room temperature  than at refrigerator temperature; thus, the practice of patients not refrigerating insulin vials is sensible.

TI  == cytotoxic activity of propionibacterium acnes and other skin organisms.
AB  == culture supernatants from four species of skin micro-organisms were tested against vero (monkey kidney cells) and skin fibroblasts for cytotoxic activity. cytotoxic activity was produced by the three species of propionibacterium tested  (p. acnes, p. avidum and p. granulosum), and this activity was highest when cultures were grown in the presence of glucose. in contrast, staphylococcus epidermidis was devoid of cytotoxic activity whether grown in the presence of glucose or not. the agent responsible for the cytotoxic activity was heat stable, of low molecular weight and removable from supernatants by ether extraction. these properties, coupled with the finding that the levels of cytotoxicity are directly proportional to the concentrations of propionate measured in samples, suggests that propionate is the agent responsible for the cytotoxicity of the culture supernatants. pure propionate and the salts of other carboxylic acids (ci to c5) were tested at the same concentrations and showed different degrees of cytotoxicity depending on their chain length. propionate may have an important role in the aetiology of the disease acne vulgaris.

TI  == susceptibility of propionibacterium acnes to killing and degradation by human neutrophils and monocytes in vitro.
AB  == propionibacterium acnes, the target of inflammation in acne, was tested for its sensitivity to the bactericidal and degradative functions of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn), monocytes, and their fractions. p. acnes strains were not killed by pmn under any conditions and were variably killed by monocytes in the presence of serum from acne patients. control strains of staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus lysodeicticus were susceptible to both pmn  and monocyte killing. p. acnes strains were also not killed by lysozyme, chymotrypsin, h2o2, human serum, pmn granule lysate, and pmn and monocyte cell lysates. the organism was sensitive to the bactericidal activity of myeloperoxidase in acid ph. in addition, p. acnes was shown to be relatively resistant to the degradative action of pmn and monocyte lysates, whereas m. lysodeicticus, s. aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis were all degraded to various degrees. the moieties that were liberated from p. acnes by pmn enzymes were predominantly low in molecular weight (1,000 to 25,000) and were consistent  with cell wall fragments.

TI  == intradermal injection of propionibacterium acnes: a model of inflammation relevant to acne.
AB  == the intradermal injection of 140 micrograms of propionibacterium acnes (cn 6134)  into the ears of female sprague-dawley rats produced a chronic inflammation with  formation of acneiform lesions. inflammation was characterized by more than a doubling of ear thickness at 24 h and a peak of 3-4 times control levels at day 21. at 42 days post injection ears were still 3 times normal thickness. histologically there was early polymorph accumulation giving way to macrophages and lymphocytes by day 7. pilosebaceous follicles overlying the inflamed area lost their sebaceous glands and became hyperplastic cords of cells that grew down and encapsulated inflammatory loci. by day 9 many of these follicles had become secondary comedones. three isolates of p. acnes from inflammatory acne lesions and 4 of 5 isolates from non-acne patients produced results similar to that of the strain cn 6134. in these cases the number of histologically evident secondary comedones was correlated with ear thickness. in contrast, samples of streptococcus lactis, escherichia coli b, and staphylococcus epidermidis failed to produce this combination of chronic inflammation and high lesion count. benzoyl peroxide, tetracycline, erythromycin, phenidone, naproxen, and cis and trans retinoic acid were inactive as inhibitors of p. acnes cn 6134-induced ear thickening. the corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide produced dramatic suppression of inflammation, but upon cessation of treatment the ears returned to inflamed levels. the specificity for p. acnes, the formation of acneiform lesions, and the recalcitrance of the inflammation suggest our model is indeed relevant to acne.

AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of acetic and propionic acid for resident bacteria on normal human skin, such as propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus epidermidis, was 25 mg/ml or more at any ph tested (ph 5.5-6.8). while the mic of these acids for most of the transient bacteria was markedly decreased by lowering the ph of the media and at ph 5.5, the mean ph value of the normal human skin, the mic was 6.25 mg/ml or less. the mic of oleic acid for some strains of gram-positive transient bacteria of streptococcus, micrococcus, or bacillus was 100 micrograms/ml or less at all ph's tested. staphylococcus aureus  was resistant to this acid at ph 6.8, but became as sensitive as streptococcus when the ph was lowered. the growth of p. acnes, the most predominant resident bacterium, was enhanced markedly and reached a maximum level at 6.25 mg/ml of propionic acid, 12.5 mg/ml of acetic acid, and 50-100 micrograms/ml of oleic acid. on the basis of these results, we presumed that acetic, propionic, and oleic acids are factors influencing the predominant residence of some species of  propionibacterium and coagulase-negative staphylococcus on normal human skin.

AB  == skin lipid extracts of 185 persons of different age were tested in vitro against  single representatives of skin bacteria: staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, propionibacterium acnes, p. granulosum and corynebacterium sp. in order to find differences in their inhibitory effects. percentages of the extracts inhibiting the first 4 bacteria were nearly the same (about 20%) while corynebacteria were inhibited by only 3 extracts. extracts showing these properties were isolated mainly from adolescents with acne changes, young adults, about 20 yr old, and from children 8--10 yr old, but not from elderly people. the age-related differences in growth inhibition may be related to known differences in relative  composition of the sebum constituents according to age. forty-two extracts of acne patients and healthy adults and adolescents showed an inverse effect in vitro: they enhanced bacterial growth. growth enhancement was demonstrated only for p. granulosum.

TI  == antibody coated bacteria in otitis media with effusions.
AB  == the significance of bacterial isolates of coagulase negative staphylococcus epidermidis and corynebacterium species in middle ear fluids remains controversial. this study was undertaken to evaluate the possible role of these organisms in different effusions. cultures were obtained from the external cartilaginous ear, bony canal, tympanic membrane, middle ear fluids, tonsils and  nasopharynx of 93 patients at the time of myringotomy for otitis media with effusion. isolates of coagulase negative staphylococci from the middle ear, external ear and posterior aural skin were evaluated in regard to antibiotic sensitivity, biochemical tests and phage typing. furthermore, in another series of patients in whom these organisms were isolated, specific antibody activity in  both middle ear washings and corresponding sera were measured, using the technique of indirect immunofluorescence. the results suggest that the isolates from the middle ear and ear canal are not always identical. there is some evidence that specific igm and igg as well as iga responses to these organisms are present in middle ear washings and not in corresponding serum. these results  suggest that coagulase negative staphylococcus and corynebacterium species in middle ear effusions may not be contaminants from the external canal and that a local immune response may be produced by these organisms. whether or not these organisms represent etiologic agents responsible for otitis media with effusion cannot be ascertained from this data. one very interesting point is the presence  of igf coating of organisms in some effusions.

TI  == bacterial colonization in intubated newborns.
AB  == the bacteriology of tracheal aspirates from 127 newborns was studied. specimens were obtained twice a week as long as the newborns were intubated. each newborn had between one and eight specimens taken (average 1.7). 127 babies had one specimen taken, 38 had two, 25 had three, 12 had four, and 10 had more than four  specimens taken, which made a total of 212 specimens. no bacterial or fungal growth was obtained from 65 specimens, whereas the remaining specimens (147) yielded 209 bacterial and fungal isolates accounting for 1.4 isolates per specimen. the total isolates recovered were 168 aerobes, 36 anaerobes, and 5 candida albicans. of this total, 70 specimens yielded one isolate, 48 two isolates, 6 three isolates, 5 four isolates, and one aspirate yielded five isolates. 78 newborns (61%) received antimicrobial therapy. a higher incidence of positive cultures and the presence of more than one organism per culture were found in those infants not receiving antibiotics. more isolates per specimen were noted with increasing time of incubation. the rate of isolation staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae remained constant with  increased length of intubation, the rate of recovery of staphylococcus epidermidis, viridans group streptococci, and propionibacterium acnes increased,  and the rate of isolation of escherichia coli and anaerobic organisms decreased.

TI  == cytotaxin production by comedonal bacteria (propionibacterium acnes, propionibacterium granulosum and staphylococcus epidermidis).
AB  == the potential role of different species of comedonal bacteria as chemotactic stimuli in the inflammatory phase of acne vulgaris was investigated by comparing  12 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, 11 strains of propionibacterium acnes,  and 5 strains of p. granulosum for production of cytotaxin in vitro. results indicated that not only were there marked differences in cytotaxin production between different strains of the same species grown under identical growth conditons, but there were often significant differences in cytotaxin activity of  the same strain grown in different media. this finding is discussed in relation to development of inflammation in quiescent comedones in acne vulgaris.

TI  == is there postdefecation bacteremia?
AB  == an investigation was done to determine the incidence of postdefecation bacteremia. a study of 82 healthy volunteers was done. among 164 predefecation cultures, only one (0.6%) from an anaerobic flask was positive for microorganism, which was identified as staphylococcus epidermidis. in only two of 328 (0.6%) postdefecation cultures did microorganisms grow, which were shown to be propionibacterium acnes. the results of this study suggest that either bacteremia after defecation does not occur or is a rare event in healthy individuals.

TI  == the feasibility of replacing antibiotics by quaternary ammonium compounds in topical antimicrobial acne therapy.
AB  == determinations of the minimum inhibitory concentrations for various antimicrobial surfactants with reference to the bacteria p. acnes, p. granulosum, and st. epidermidis are reported. the results show that quaternary ammonium compounds can display minimum inhibitory concentrations corresponding to those of relevant antibiotics. with the especially effective substance fractionated dimethylcocobenzalkoniumchloride )arquad dmmcd-b), it could be further shown that with in vivo application in 70% isopropanol or in an ethanol-containing film mask ointment suppression can be obtained of p. acnes, all propionibacteria added, and all pilosebaceous duct bacteria which can be cultured under anaerobic conditions. the studies may point out a way of replacing antibiotics in the antimicrobial therapy of acne by quaternary ammonium compounds.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of the maternal cervix and newborn gastric  fluid and conjunctiva: a prospective study.
AB  == aerobic and anaerobic cultures were performed on cervical swabs from 35 mothers and their newborn infants' gastric aspirates and conjunctival sacs. four hundred  seventy-nine isolates were obtained; 287 were aerobes and 192 were anaerobes. the cervical and gastric cultures overall yielded a similar flora, but this was not always the case when one compared mothers with their own newborn infants. the conjunctival cultures yielded about half of the number of bacteria per specimen that the gastric contents yielded, and a repeat conjunctival culture done 48 hours later showed a marked reduction in the number of potentially pathogenic bacteria isolated. the predominant aerobes isolated were staphylococcus epidermidis, diphtheroids, viridans streptococci and haemophilus vaginalis. the predominant anaerobes were the bacteroides fragilis group, propionibacterium acnes, peptococcus, other bacteroides and peptostreptococcus organisms. statistical analysis revealed significant positive correlation between the isolation of certain groups of organisms and increased duration of pregnancy, increased baby's weight, and prolonged duration of labor.

TI  == intergeneric and intrageneric inhibition between strains of propionibacterium acnes and micrococcaceae, particularly staphylococcus epidermidis, isolated from  normal skin and acne lesions.
AB  == two hundred and forty-one strains or resident skin bacteria comprising 93 isolates of propionob acterium acnes and 148 of micrococcaceae derived from 36 acne patients and 8 control subjects were screened for their ability to inhibit 32 indicator strains, including 20 strains of p. acnes and 12 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis derived from patients with all grades of acne and from normal skin. fifty-three strains (22%) showed some activity against at least one  indicator strain. both broad- and narrow-spectrum inhibition was detected. inhibitory isolates of p. acnes outnumbered inhibitory micrococcaceae by four to  one. there was a low frequency of inhibition of s. epidermidis by micrococcaceae  (2.7%) and by p. acnes (1.1%) and a higher frequency of inhibition of p. acnes by micrococcaceae (9.5%) and by p. acnes (40.8%). furthermore, 81.8% of the subjects sampled possessed strains inhibitory to p. acnes. the significance of this finding is, as yet, unknown. no difference in the prevalence of active strains in normal (20%) and acne (22.5%) skin was detected. these findings suggest that the  possession of inhibitory strains and conversely the possession of sensitive strains does not predispose to acne.

TI  == quantitation of skin bacteria: lethality of the wash solution used to remove bacteria.
AB  == a widely used technique for the quantitative removal of bacteria from the skin uses a detergent, triton x-100 (p, t-octylphenoxynonaethoxyethanol), to remove and suspend the bacteria. we determined the half-life for the survival of five common skin bacteria suspended in the solution. the shortest-lived was streptococcus pyogenes with a half-life of 0.9 hours. all of the others (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, and  klebsiella pneumoniae) had half-lives of 1.5 hours or longer. k. pneumoniae, the  only gram-negative species tested, had a half-life of more than 30 hours. thus, a one hour delay in plating and incubation of samples suspended in this detergent solution inhibits quantitation of most species tested.

TI  == anaerobic flora of the normal human conjunctival sac.
AB  == specimens from the conjunctival sacs of 92 healthy eyes were cultured on two separate occasions to determine the presence or absence of a persistent anaerobic flora. aerobic bacteria and fungi were also studied for comparison. of the 184 eye cultures, 112 (60.9%) contained at least one microorganism. obligate anaerobes were recovered from 51.6% (95/184) of the cultures. propionibacterium acnes, the predominant anaerobe encountered, was present in 49.5% (91/184) of the eyes. aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria, present in 32.6% of the total eye cultures, were less common than obligate anaerobes. staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common of these. fungi were rarely found. our findings suggest that the conjunctival sac is either sterile or normally contains small numbers of anaerobic, aerobic, or facultatively anaerobic bacteria. as other workers have suggested, the origin of the bacteria in the eyes may be the skin of the eyelids.

TI  == bacteremia after upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.
AB  == during 24 months, 200 upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed on 193 patients. blood cultures were obtained before and five and 30 minutes after the procedure using thiol (50 ml) and trypticase soy broth (100 ml) media. the mean endoscopic time was 34 minutes. sixteen patients developed bacteremia (8%). twelve groups of microorganisms were detected in positive blood cultures: streptococcus (5 species), lactobacillus sp, veillonella alcalescens, staphylococcus aureus, staph epidermidis, propioni-bacterium acnes, corynebacterium acnes, and bacillus subtilis. seven patients had positive blood cultures at five and 30 minutes, eight at five minutes, and one at 30 minutes only. there was no clear correlation of bacteremia with the age or previous history of the patient, biopsy, active bleeding, endoscopic time, or findings. a  follow-up study of all patients for six months to two years indicated no complications related to endoscopy and/or bacteremia.

TI  == the bacteriology of skin cysts.
AB  == thirty-nine clinically uninflamed cysts of the three most common varieties, epidermoid cysts, trichilemmal cysts and steatocystoma multiplex were removed under sterile conditions and the contents cultured under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. seventy-three percent of epidermoid cysts grew significant numbers of organisms whereas none of the trichilemmal cysts did so. the organisms found were the common skin commensals, staphylococcus epidermidis biotype i, anaerobic gram  positive cocci of the gaffya type and corynebacterium acnes type i. this indicates that cysts which clinically have a punctum, namely epidermoid cysts, may become colonized with surface bacteria under normal circumstances. if they become colonized with pathogenic bacteria they become inflamed, a not uncommon clinical picture. the results from patients with steatocystoma multiplex were difficult to interpret because of the small numbers of patients involved and the  unusual clinical appearance they presented.

TI  == a special report: four-year study of a boy with combined immune deficiency maintained in strict reverse isolation from birth.
AB  == a 4-year study of a boy with combined immune deficiency is presented, and the impact of this disease on various aspects of his growth and development is examined. there is no evidence of immune deficiency in either parent or in the genetic background on the maternal side. three children of a brother of the mother's father may have had immune deficiencies but two have grown to be teenagers with no problems. another died. at autopsy, however, lymph nodes appeared normal. the deceased older brother had severe combined immune deficiency (scid). the autopsy findings showed pneumocystis carinii pneumonia to be the direct cause of death and these findings contributed to the diagnosis of scid. after a successful germ-free birth, the male infant (dv) was placed in the isolator. laboratory tests were normal except that the x-rays showed no thymic shadow, his absolute lymphocyte count ranged from 399-440/mm and the lymphocytes  showed no proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (pha). specific tests showed the antibody-producing immune system and the cell-mediated immune system to be severely defective. the patient's lymphocytes elicited positive responses by lymphocytes from father, mother, and sister. subsequent search in national and international tissue-typing laboratories has shown four hla matches but none has  been nonreactive in mixed lymphocyte culture (mlc). therefore, this patient has remained in isolation to the present; now he is 4 years old. approximately 35 species of microorganisms, mostly transient contaminants, have been isolated, taking into account that the same organism may have been identified under different names in different laboratories. those isolated frequently and in sufficiently high concentration to indicate colonization have been speciated as follows: anaerobes-propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus catenaforme (disappeared spontaneously), bacteroides oralis ss. elongatus, clostridium (perenne, hastiforme, bifermentans), bacteroides clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis; aerobes-alcaligenes faecalis (eradicated by antibiotics), staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter agglomerans, microcossu sp. subgroup 1,  bacillus pulvifaciens (disappeared spontaneously); yeasts-candida (tropicalis, parapsilosis). seven are considered to be probable components of the current autoflora: p. acnes, c. bifermentans, b. clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis, s. epidermidis, micrococcus sp. subgroup 1, e. agglomerans, c. parapsilosis. no viruses or protozoa have been isolated. at age 3 years, the mean quantitation of  anaerobic cells was 7.9 x 10(7) viable cells/g feces; this falls short of the mean anaerobic load from normal children. the mean aerobic concentration was 1.2  x 10(8) viable cells/g feces, not unlike normal children. qualitatively his flora has abnormally few species and lacks those most common in normal subjects. this child has had no evidence of infection and has always been in excellent health even though some organisms which could be pathogenic under some circumstances have been isolated...

TI  == study of elastolytic activity propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus epidermis in acne vulgaris and in normal skin.
AB  == histopathological sections of anetoderma-like scars from 10 patients with acne vulgaris showed a selective absence of elastic fibers around pilosebaceous follicles. this finding is similar to the histologic changes of "perifollicular elastolysis" reported by varadi. bacteria isolated by anaerobic and aerobic cultures of swabs of the skin surface and pus of these 10 patients, 12 others with active acne vulgaris and 8 normal subjects were studied with particular attention to staphylococcus epidermis and propionibacterium acnes. these organisms were analysed for production of an elastolytic enzyme which might play  a role in the observed selective loss of elastic fibers. no elastolytic activity  was produced by s. epidermidis or p. acnes isolated from any of these individuals. thus, we cannot attribute the perifollicular loss of elastic fibers  in acne scarring to an elastase produced by organisms. the observed absence of elastic fibers might result from tissue necrosis produced by leukocytes during the inflammatory phase, followed by collagenous scar formation without regeneration of elastic fibers.

TI  == esterification of (4--14c)cholesterol by cutaneous bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis, propionibacterium acnes, and propionibacterium granulosum).
AB  == cholesterol and cholesteryl esters constitute 3 to 5% of the lipids derived from  human sebaceous glands. the present study demonstrates that cutaneous bacteria, staphylococcus epidermidis, and to a lesser extent propionibacterium acnes, and propionibacterium granulosum, esterify [4--14c]cholesterol to steryl esters in vitro. the degree of esterification is a characteristic of the strain of organism, ranging from 0 to 32.7% in the organisms tested. cholesterol esterification in these experiments was dependent on the addition of homogenates  of isolated, pooled sebaceous glands to the incubation medium. indirect evidence  suggests that the fatty acids from sebaceous triglycerides are utilized for cholesterol esterification by the bacteria. these results indicate that the proportion of steryl esters in skin surface lipids may be influenced by the density of the microbial population in the skin.

TI  == analysis of lipid composition of isolated human sebaceous gland homogenates after incubation with cutaneous bacteria. thin-layer chromatography.
AB  == the effects of specific species of skin bacteria on human sebaceous gland lipids  in vitro were analyzed. isolated dissected sebaceous glands were pooled, homogenized, and sterilized, then incorporated into peptone-yeast extract medium  and used as substrate for growth of propionibacterium acnes, p. granulosum, and staphylococcus epidermidis subgroup ii. the sebaceous lipids were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography before and after bacterial growth. the most striking effect of bacteria on sebaceous gland lipid composition was the hydrolysis of sebaceous triglycerides. the degree of hydrolysis varied with bacterial strain but was most complete with p. acnes and p. granulosum. staphylococci were not effective in hydrolyzing sebaceous triglycerides at ph 4.5 although, when the ph  of the medium was raised to ph 6.4, some strains of staphylococci were as effective as the propionibacteria in hydrolyzing sebaceous triglycerides to free  fatty acids. thus minor changes in acidity may play asignificant role in controlling the lipolytic activity of staphylococci on skin. another effect of bacterial action on sebaceous gland lipids was the esterification of sebaceous cholesterol to cholesteryl esters. thus, bacterial action must be taken into account in evaluating studies of alterations in cutaneous cholesterol and cholesteryl esters in skin surface lipids in normal and disease states.

TI  == levels of antibody to staphylococcus epidermidis in patients with acne vulgaris.
AB  == sera from 23 patients with acne vulgaris of varying degrees and sera from 15 patients with skin diseases other than acne were tested for antibody levels to staphylococcus epidermidis by use of bacterial agglutination and agar-gel immunodiffusion. antibody levels to s epidermidis varied from 0 to 1:160 in both  the patients with acne and in the control groups. there was no correlation between the antibody level to s epidermidis and the degree of acne. in a previous investigation it was found that antibody levels to corynebacterium acnes are significantly increased in serum from patients with papulopustular and cystic acne. both s epidermidis and c acnes can frequently be isolated from lesions in acne. the fact that antibody levels are increased to c acnes but not to s epidermidis may indicate that the mere presence of an organism in the acne lesion is not sufficient stimulation for antibody formation. the increase of antibody to c acnes which was demonstrated previously in patients with severe acne vulgaris may therefore reflect a direct involvement of the organism in the acne process.
