application of nontraditional meat starter cultures in production of hungarian salami.
listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli o111 have been implicated in several  outbreaks of food-borne disease linked to smallgoods products.
traditional meat starter cultures, containing a mixture of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and staphylococci, are used to maintain safety and sensory properties of hungarian salami.
the present study investigated if nontraditional meat starter (ntms) cultures can be used for improving the safety of hungarian salami.
salami batter was inoculated with list.
monocytogenes and e. coli and subsequently fermented with ntms cultures and a commercially available meat starter.
a total of 15 ntms cultures were tested.
the salami was monitored for levels of pathogen, lab and ph. when used in conjunction with the commercial meat starter, 9 ntms cultures reduced the e. coli o111 count by more than 2.5 log units, whereas 10 of the ntms cultures reduced list.
monocytogenes by more than 2.5 log units.
the commercial meat starter alone reduced e. coli and list.
monocytogenes by 1.2 and 1.3 log units, respectively.
some ntms cultures reduced the pathogen count without affecting ph of the salami batter.
all ntms cultures survived in salami throughout fermentation and maturation.
it was concluded that ntms cultures, including lactobacillus acidophilus lafti l10, l. paracasei lafti l26, l. paracasei 5119, lactobacillus sp.
l24 and bifidobacterium lactis lafti b94, may be used to increase the safety of hungarian salami because these cultures gave strong inhibition of both e. coli o111 and list.
