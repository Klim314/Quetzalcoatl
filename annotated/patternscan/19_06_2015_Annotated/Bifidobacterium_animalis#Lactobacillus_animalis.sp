TI  == immunomodulatory effects of probiotic supplementation in schizophrenia patients:  a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == although peripheral immune system abnormalities have been linked to schizophrenia pathophysiology, standard antipsychotic drugs show limited immunological effects. thus, more effective treatment approaches are required. probiotics are microorganisms that modulate the immune response of the host and, therefore, may  be beneficial to schizophrenia patients. the aim of this study was to examine the possible immunomodulatory effects of probiotic supplementation in chronic schizophrenia patients. the concentrations of 47 immune-related serum proteins were measured using multiplexed immunoassays in samples collected from patients before and after 14 weeks of adjuvant treatment with probiotics (lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis strain bb12; n = 31) or placebo (n = 27). probiotic add-on treatment significantly reduced levels  of von willebrand factor (vwf) and increased levels of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (mcp-1), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf), rantes, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta (mip-1) beta with borderline significance  (p </= 0.08). in silico pathway analysis revealed that probiotic-induced alterations are related to regulation of immune and intestinal epithelial cells through the il-17 family of cytokines. we hypothesize that supplementation of probiotics to schizophrenia patients may improve control of gastrointestinal leakage.

TI  == [effects of mono-, poly- and composite probiotics on the ulceration caused by restraint stress].
AB  == it was studied the effect of probiotic strains of bifidobacterium animalis vkl, bifidobacterium animalis vkb and lactobacillus casei imvb-7280, and their mixtures on erosive and ulcerative lesions of the gastric mucosa (gm) of rats. gm was induced by water-immersion restraint stress. it was found that investigated probiotics did not have gastroprotective properties under a single and seven-day  prophylactic administration. however, multiprobiotics (polyprobiotic bifidobacterium animalis vkl and bifidobacterium animalis vkb and composite probiotic bifidobacterium animalis vkl, bifidobacterium animalis vkb and lactobacillus casei imvb-7280) reduced the erosive and ulcerative lesions and the intensity of bleeding in rat gm when given within 14 days. it was shown that one  of the mechanisms of antiulcer preventive effect of the multistrain probiotics is the restoration of pro/antioxidant balance in the gm under the stress action. the obtained results show the effectiveness of poly- and composite probiotics in the  gastric ulcer prevention.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == effect of sublethal preculturing on the survival of probiotics and metabolite formation in set-yoghurt.
AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of preculturing of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb12 under  sublethal stress conditions on their survival and metabolite formation in set-yoghurt. prior to co-cultivation with yoghurt starters in milk, the two probiotic strains were precultured under sublethal stress conditions (combinations of elevated nacl and low ph) in a batch fermentor. the activity of  sublethally precultured probiotics was evaluated during fermentation and refrigerated storage by monitoring bacterial population dynamics, milk acidification and changes in volatile and non-volatile metabolite profiles of set-yoghurt. the results demonstrated adaptive stress responses of the two probiotic strains resulting in their viability improvement without adverse influence on milk acidification. a complementary metabolomic approach using spme-gc/ms and (1)h-nmr resulted in the identification of 35 volatiles and 43 non-volatile polar metabolites, respectively. principal component analysis revealed substantial impact of the activity of sublethally precultured probiotics on metabolite formation demonstrated by distinctive volatile and non-volatile metabolite profiles of set-yoghurt. changes in relative abundance of various aroma compounds suggest that incorporation of stress-adapted probiotics considerably influences the organoleptic quality of product. this study provides  new information on the application of stress-adapted probiotics in an actual food-carrier environment.

TI  == randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of synbiotic yogurt effect on  the health of children.
AB  == objective: to assess the effects of daily consumption of a synbiotic yogurt drink on the health, growth, and quality of life of healthy children 12-48 months of age in out-of-home child care. study design: healthy children attending child care centers were enrolled in a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. the intervention was a yogurt drink containing streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis (bb-12) (5 x 10(9) cfu/100 ml serving), and 1 g of inulin (synbiotic group) vs a similar nonsynbiotic-containing acidified milk drink (placebo group)  once daily for 16 weeks. the end points were days of diarrhea, fever, vomiting, symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, use of antibiotics, physician visits, child care absenteeism, parental work absenteeism, and quality of life (pedsql 4.0; mapi research trust, lyon, france). results: compared with placebo (n = 73), children receiving synbiotic (n = 76) had significantly fewer days of reported fever (1.85 vs 1.95, p < .05), significant improvement in social functioning (p < .035; pre-to-end intervention), and school functioning (p < .045; pre-to-mid intervention). more days with >/=3 loose/watery stools were reported in the synbiotic group (p < .05). conclusions: daily supplementation of  children's diet with yogurt containing probiotic bacteria bb-12 and inulin significantly reduced days of fever and improved social and school functioning. the increased frequency of bowel movements may be explained by an accelerating effect of bb-12 and inulin on intestinal transit. further research on the possible benefits of synbiotics on children's health is advised. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov: nct00653705.

TI  == proteolytic and ace-inhibitory activities of probiotic yogurt containing non-viable bacteria as affected by different levels of fat, inulin and starter culture.
AB  == in this study, the effects of fat (0.5 %, 3.2 % and 5.0 %), inulin (0.0 and 1.0 %) and starter culture (0.0 %, 0.5 %, 1.0 % and 1.5 %) on the angiotensin converting enzyme (ace)-inhibitory activity of probiotic yogurt containing non-viable bacteria were assessed. proteolytic activities of bacteria were also investigated. yogurts were prepared either using a sole yogurt commercial culture including streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subs. bulgaricus or bifidobacterium animalis bb-12 and lactobacillus acidophilus la5 in addition to yogurt culture. relative degrees of proteolysis were found to be considerably higher in yogurt samples than uht milk as the control. both regular  and probiotic yogurts showed considerable ace-inhibitory activities. results showed that degree of proteolysis was not influenced by different fat contents, while was increased by high concentration of starter culture (1.5 % w/w) and reduced by inulin (1 % w/w). ace-inhibitory activities of yogurt were also negatively affected by the presence of inulin and high levels of fat (5 % w/w). moreover, yogurt containing probiotic bacteria showed higher inhibitory against ace in comparison to the yogurt prepared with non-probiotic strains.

TI  == does maternal perinatal probiotic supplementation alter the intestinal microbiota of mother and child? a randomized controlled trial.
AB  == objectives: maternal probiotic supplementation has been shown to prevent the development of atopic dermatitis (ad) in their offspring. we aimed to investigate whether probiotics in pregnant and breastfeeding mothers altered the colonization pattern and the diversity of the mothers' and children's intestinal microbiota. methods: in a randomized, double-blind trial, women received probiotic milk or placebo from 36 weeks of gestation until 3 months postnatally whilst breastfeeding. the probiotic milk contained lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), l.  acidophilus la-5 and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12. stool samples  were collected from the mothers at 30 to 36 weeks gestation and 3 months after birth, and from the child at age 10 days, 3 months, 1 year and 2 years, and bacteria were analysed by quantitative pcr. additionally, stool samples from 3 months old and 2 years old children were characterized using 16s rrna gene deep sequencing to estimate the bacterial classes and genera, and the alpha and beta diversity. results: three months after birth, both the prevalence and the relative abundance of the administered probiotic bacteria were significantly increased among the mothers in the probiotic group compared to the placebo group. only the lgg bacteria colonized the children at 10 days and at 3 months of age. there were no significant differences in the abundance of the administered probiotic bacteria between the groups at 1 and 2 years of age. for the bacterial  classes and genera, and alpha and beta diversity there were no significant differences between the groups. conclusions: different probiotic bacteria seem to have different ability to transfer from the mother to the child. we found no evidence that the probiotics altered the microbial composition or alpha and beta  diversity of the children.

TI  == differential effects of two probiotics on the risks of eczema and atopy associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms to toll-like receptors.
AB  == background: there is strong evidence to support a genetic predisposition to eczema and more recently studies have suggested that probiotics might be used to  prevent eczema by modifying the expression of putative allergy-associated genes.  the aim of this present study was to investigate whether two probiotics, lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 (hn001) and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis  hn019 (hn019), can modify the known genetic predisposition to eczema conferred by genetic variation in the toll-like receptor (tlr) genes in a high-risk infant population. methods: we selected 54 snps in the toll-like receptor genes. these snps were analysed in 331 children of sole european ancestry as part of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial examining the effects of hn001 and hn019 supplementation on eczema development and atopic sensitization. results: the data showed that 26 tlr snps interacted with hn001 resulting in a significantly reduced risk of eczema, 18 for eczema severity as defined by scorad >/= 10 and 20 for atopic sensitization compared to placebo. there were only two snps that interacted with hn019 resulting in a reduced risk of eczema, eczema severity or atopy. conclusions: this is the first study to show that the negative impact of specific tlr genotypes may be positively affected by probiotic supplementation. hn001 exhibits a much stronger effect than hn019 in this respect.

TI  == evaluation of the probiotic properties of new lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains and their in vitro effect.
AB  == probiotic ingestion is recommended as a preventive approach to maintain the balance of the intestinal microbiota and to enhance the human well-being. during  the whole life of each individual, the gut microbiota composition could be altered by lifestyle, diet, antibiotic therapies and other stress conditions, which may lead to acute and chronic disorders. hence, probiotics can be administered for the prevention or treatment of some disorders, including lactose malabsorption, acute diarrhoea, irritable bowel syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis and mild forms of inflammatory bowel disease. the probiotic-mediated effect is an important issue that needs to be addressed in relation to strain-specific probiotic properties. in this work, the probiotic properties of new lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains were screened, and their effects in vitro were evaluated. they were screened for probiotic properties by determining their tolerance to low ph and to bile salts, antibiotic sensitivity, antimicrobial activity and vitamin b8, b9 and b12 production, and by considering their ability to increase the antioxidant potential and to modulate the inflammatory status of systemic-miming cell lines in vitro. three out of the  examined strains presenting the most performant probiotic properties, as lactobacillus plantarum pbs067, lactobacillus rhamnosus pbs070 and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis pbso75, were evaluated for their effects also on human intestinal ht-29 cell line. the obtained results support the possibility to move to another level of study, that is, the oral administration of these probiotical strains to patients with acute and chronic gut disorders, by in vivo experiments.

TI  == the effects of probiotics and prebiotics on the fatty acid profile and conjugated linoleic acid content of fermented cow milk.
AB  == the ability of probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus la5 and bifidobacterium animalis bb12), to produce conjugated linoleic acid (cla) in association with streptococcus thermophilus and lb. bulgaricus during milk fermentation has been evaluated in this study. pasteurized cow milk and infant formula were used. infant formula was selected for its high linoleic acid content, for being a source of cla and for its prebiotic compounds, e.g. galacto-oligosaccharides. the microorganisms were not able to increase the cla content of the fermented products under the given experimental conditions. no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) occurred between the cla content in milk and the fermented samples. the cla contents of 10 commercial fermented milk products were determined. the highest cla content was observed in fermented  milk containing only str. thermophilus and lb. bulgaricus.

TI  == plant extract enhances the viability of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus acidophilus in probiotic nonfat yogurt.
AB  == a commercial plant extract (prepared from olive, garlic, onion and citrus extracts with sodium acetate (sa) as a carrier) was evaluated to extend the viability of yogurt starter and probiotic bacteria as a means to enhance the shelf life of live and active culture, probiotic nonfat yogurt. yogurts prepared  from three different formulas (0.5* plant extract, 0.25* sa, or no supplement) and cultures (yogurt starter plus bifidobacterium animalis,lactobacillus acidophilus, or both probiotics) were assessed weekly during 29 days of storage at 5 degrees c. supplemented yogurt mixes had greater buffering capacities than non-supplemented yogurt mixes. at the end of storage, lactobacillus bulgaricus and l. acidophilus counts in supplemented yogurts were greater compared with non-supplemented yogurts. supplementation did not affect streptococcus thermophilus and b. animalis counts. hence the greater buffering capacity of yogurt containing plant extract could enhance the longevity of the probiotics, l. bulgaricus and l. acidophilus, during storage.

TI  == nature of the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus caseibifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium animalis against foodborne pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities as well as the nature of the inhibitory compounds obtained from lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium animalis strains were assayed on foodborne pathogenic - staphyloccoccus aureus subsp. aureus (ccug atcc(r) 25926) and escherichia coli (atcc(r) 25922) - and spoilage microorganisms - pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc(r) 27853). test producer strains showed inhibitory effect on all indicator microorganisms in diffusion of  cell-free concentrated supernatant by agar in well methods (10.0-22.5 mm) in periods of 24, 48 and 72 h. inhibitory compounds showed no sensitivity to the action of proteolytic enzyme trypsin and were completely inactivated by adjusting the ph of the cell-free 20 x concentrated supernatant to 7.0. the results demonstrated that antimicrobial substances do not have proteinaceous nature and are caused by the action of organic acids with decreasing medium ph.

TI  == selenite-stress selected mutant strains of probiotic bacteria for se source production.
AB  == selenium deficiency is a major health problem worldwide for about 1 billion people. bacterial cells usually possess low tolerance to selenite stress and also low ability to reduce high concentrations of toxic selenite. here, high tolerance to selenite and selenium bioaccumulation capability were developed in mutated clones of probiotic and starter bacteria including enterococcus faecium, bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis, lactobacillus casei and lactococcus lactis  ssp. lactis by food-level strain development process and clone selection. all mutant clones possessed increased glutathione concentration and glutathione reductase activity. the selenite treatment increased further these values in l. casei mutant strain pointing at a different selenite reduction pathway and/or stress response in this organism. considerable conversion of selenite to cell bound selenium forms with a concomitant high biomass production was detected in e. faecium and b. animalis ssp. lactis cultures. possible application of these strains as food and feed supplements is under investigation.

TI  == lactobacilli and bifidobacteria enhance mucosal b cell responses and differentially modulate systemic antibody responses to an oral human rotavirus vaccine in a neonatal gnotobiotic pig disease model.
AB  == b cells play a key role in generation of protective immunity against rotavirus infection, a major cause of gastroenteritis in children. current rv vaccines are  less effective in developing countries compared to developed countries. commensals/probiotics influence mucosal immunity, but the role of early gut colonizing bacteria in modulating intestinal b cell responses to rv vaccines is largely unknown. we co-colonized neonatal gnotobiotic pigs, the only animal model susceptible to hrv diarrhea, with 2 dominant bacterial species present in the gut of breastfed infants, lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg and bifidobacterium animalis lactis bb12 to evaluate their impact on b cell responses to an attenuated (att) human rotavirus (hrv) wa strain vaccine. following hrv challenge, probiotic-colonized, atthrv vaccinated piglets had significantly lower fecal scores and reduced hrv shedding titers compared to uncolonized, atthrv vaccinated pigs. the reduction in hrv diarrhea was significantly correlated with  higher intestinal iga hrv antibody titers and intestinal hrv-specific iga antibody secreting cell (asc) numbers in probiotic-colonized, atthrv vaccinated pigs compared to uncolonized, vaccinated pigs. the significantly higher small intestinal hrv iga antibody responses coincided with higher il-6, il-10 and april responses of ileal mononuclear cells (mncs) and the immunomodulatory effects of probiotics genomic dna on tgf-beta and il-10 responses. however, serum rv igg antibody titers and total igg titers were significantly lower in probiotic-colonized, atthrv vaccinated pigs compared to uncolonized, vaccinated pigs, both pre- and post-challenge. in summary, lgg and bb12 beneficially modulated intestinal b cell responses to hrv vaccine.

TI  == evaluation of culture media for selective enumeration of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to test the suitability of transgalactosylated oligosaccharides-mupirocin lithium salt (tos-mup) and mrs-clindamycin-ciprofloxacin (mrs-cc) agars, along with several other culture media, for selectively enumerating bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria (lab)  species commonly used to make fermented milks. pure culture suspensions of a total of 13 dairy bacteria strains, belonging to eight species and five genera, were tested for growth capability under various incubation conditions. tos-mup agar was successfully used for the selective enumeration of both bifidobacterium  animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 and b. breve m-16 v. mrs-cc agar showed relatively good selectivity for lactobacillus acidophilus, however, it also promoted the growth of lb. casei strains. for this reason, mrs-cc agar can only be used as a selective medium for the enumeration of lb. acidophilus if lb. casei is not present in a product at levels similar to or exceeding those of lb. acidophilus.  unlike bifidobacteria and coccus-shaped lab, all the lactobacilli strains involved in this work were found to grow well in mrs ph 5.4 agar incubated under  anaerobiosis at 37 degrees c for 72 h. therefore, this method proved to be particularly suitable for the selective enumeration of lactobacillus spp.

TI  == human intestinal mucosa-associated lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains with probiotic properties modulate il-10, il-6 and il-12 gene expression in thp-1 cells.
AB  == lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are considered one of the permanent genera of the physiological human intestinal microbiota and represent an enormous pool of potential probiotic candidates. approximately 450 isolates of presumptive lactobacillus or bifidobacterium strains were obtained from bioptic samples of colonic and ileal mucosa from 15 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years. on the basis of randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis, 20 strains were selected  for further taxonomic classification and characterisation, as well as assessment  of probiotic properties and safety. importantly, selected strains showed the capability of colonising different parts of the intestine. the most frequently isolated species was lactobacillus paracasei followed by lactobacillus fermentum. the majority of isolates were susceptible to antimicrobials of human and veterinary importance, however, tetracycline and/or erythromycin resistance was observed in lactobacillus plantarum and l. fermentum strains. thirteen strains were able to ferment more than 19 different carbon sources and three out of five  tested strains exerted antagonistic activity against several different indicator  strains. two lactobacillus isolates (l. paracasei l350 and l. fermentum l930 bb)  and one bifidobacterium isolate (bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis im386)  fulfilled in vitro selection criteria for probiotic strains and exhibited strong  downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines il-6 and il-12 and upregulation of anti-inflammatory il-10. the selected strains represent suitable candidates for further studies regarding their positive influence on host health and could play  an important role in ameliorating the symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  == immunoreactivity of lactic acid-treated mare's milk after simulated digestion.
AB  == the similarity of mare's milk to breast milk makes it an interesting substrate for the creation of dairy beverages. the aim of this study was to determine the immunoreactivity of the digested mare's milk products carried out by lactic acid  fermentation with lactobacillus casei lcy, streptococcus thermophilus mk10 and bifidobacterium animalis bi30. simulation of digestion with saliva, pepsin and pancreatin/bile salts was carried out. the immunoreactivity of the milk proteins  was assessed by competitive elisa. the separation of proteins was studied using a tricine sds-page method. it has been demonstrated that lactic acid fermentation significantly decreases the immunoreactivity of beta-lactoglobulin, beta-casein,  kappa-casein and bovine serum albumin. the level of reduction was connected to the type of bacterial strain. the simulated digestion processes caused the decline of immunoreactivity, and the decreases obtained in the experiment were as follows: lactoferrin: 95%, beta-lactoglobulin: 94%, beta-casein: 93%, alpha-lactalbumin: 82%, alpha-casein: 82%, bovine serum albumin: 76% and kappa-casein: 37%. the results of the study indicated that microbial fermentation with tested strains is a valuable method for reducing the immunoreactivity of mare's milk proteins. however, further studies with other bacterial strains are needed to gain a higher level of elimination or total reduction of mare's milk immunoreactivity to possibly introduce fermented mare's milk into the diet of patients with immune-mediated digestive problems.

TI  == the effect of yoghurt and its probiotics on blood pressure and serum lipid profile; a randomised controlled trial.
AB  == background and aims: despite strong mechanistic data, and promising results from  in vitro and animal studies, the ability of probiotic bacteria to improve blood pressure and serum lipid concentrations in humans remains uncertain. the aim of this study was to determine the effect of lactobacillus acidophilus la5 and bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis bb12, provided in either yoghurt or capsule form, on home blood pressure and serum lipid profile. methods and results: following a 3-week washout period, 156 overweight men and women over 55 y were randomized to a 6-week double-blinded, factorial, parallel study. the four intervention groups were: a) probiotic yoghurt plus probiotic capsules; b) probiotic yoghurt plus placebo capsules; c) control milk plus probiotic capsules; and d) control milk plus placebo capsules. each probiotic test article provided a minimum l. acidophilus la5 and b. animalis subsp. lactis bb12 dose of 3.0 x 10(9) cfu/d. home blood pressure monitoring, consisting of 7-day bi-daily repeat measurements, were collected at baseline and week 6. fasting total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldlc), high density lipoprotein cholesterol  (hdlc), and serum triglyceride were performed at baseline and week 6. when compared to control milk, probiotic yoghurt did not significantly alter blood pressure, heart rate or serum lipid concentrations (p > 0.05). similarly, when compared to placebo capsules, supplementation with probiotic capsules did not alter blood pressure or concentrations of total cholesterol ldlc, hdlc, or triglycerides (p > 0.05). conclusions: the probiotic strains l. acidophilus la5 and b. animalis subsp. lactis bb12 did not improve cardiovascular risk factors.

TI  == short communication: viability of culture organisms in honey-enriched acidophilus-bifidus-thermophilus (abt)-type fermented camel milk.
AB  == the aim of this research was to monitor the survival during refrigerated storage  of lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 (a), bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 (b), and streptococcus thermophilus chcc 742/2130 (t) in cultured dairy foods made from camel and, for comparison, cow milks supplemented with black locust (robinia pseudoacacia l.) honey and fermented by an acidophilus-bifidus-thermophilus (abt)-type culture. two liters of dromedary camel milk and 2 l of cow milk were heated to 90 degrees c and held for 10 min, then cooled to 40 degrees c. one half of both types of milk was fortified with black locust honey at the rate of 5.0% (wt/vol), whereas the other half was devoid of honey and served as a control. the camel and cow milks with and without honey were subsequently inoculated with abt-5 culture and were fermented at 37 degrees c until a ph value of 4.6 was reached. thereafter, the probiotic fermented milks were cooled to 15 degrees c in ice water and were each separated  into 18 fractions that were transferred in sterile, tightly capped centrifuge tubes. after 24 h of cooling at 8 degrees c (d 0), the samples were stored at refrigeration temperature (4 degrees c). three tubes of all 4 products (i.e., fermented camel and cow milks with and without honey) were taken at each sampling time (i.e., following 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 d of storage), and the counts of characteristic microorganisms and those of certain spoilage microbes (yeasts, molds, coliforms, escherichia coli) were enumerated. the entire experimental program was repeated twice. the results showed that addition of black locust honey at 5% to heat-treated camel and cow milks did not influence the growth and  survival of starter streptococci during production and subsequent refrigerated storage of fermented abt milks. in contrast, honey improved retention of viability of b. animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 in the camel milk-based product during storage at 4 degrees c up to 5 wk. no spoilage organisms were detected in any of  the samples tested in this study. in conclusion, supplementation of cultured dairy foods, especially those made from camel milk, with honey is recommended because honey is a healthy natural sweetener with a variety of beneficial microbiological, nutritional, and sensory properties.

TI  == differential modification of genetic susceptibility to childhood eczema by two probiotics.
AB  == background: in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled birth cohort, we have recently shown a beneficial effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 (hn001)  for the prevention of eczema in children through to 6 years of age but no effect  of bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis hn019 (hn019). objective: among this cohort of children, we aim to investigate whether these probiotics could modify the expression of genetic predisposition to eczema conferred by genetic variation in susceptibility genes. methods: thirty-three eczema susceptibility snps (in eleven genes) were genotyped in 331 children of european ancestry. results: children who carried a genetic variant that put them at a high risk of developing eczema were less likely to develop eczema if they had been randomized to the hn001 intervention group compared to those in the placebo group. hn019 was also able to protect against the effects of some snps. as well as modifying genetic susceptibility to childhood eczema, hn001 was also found to modify genetic susceptibility to eczema severity and atopy risk. conclusion and clinical relevance: this is the first study to show an effect of a probiotic on reducing eczema risk amongst those with particular eczema-associated genotypes. our findings suggest that lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 may be particularly effective in preventing eczema in children with specific high-risk genotypes.

AB  == in this work, we investigated the effect of supplementing fermented milk with quinoa flour as an option to increase probiotic activity during fermented milk production and storage. fermented milk products were produced with increasing concentrations of quinoa flour (0, 1, 2, or 3g/100g) and submitted to the following analyses at 1, 14, and 28 d of refrigerated storage: postacidification, bacterial viability, resistance of probiotics to simulated gastrointestinal (gi)  conditions, and adhesion of probiotics to caco-2 cells in vitro. the kinetics of  acidification were measured during the fermentation process. the time to reach maximum acidification rate, time to reach ph 5.0, and time to reach ph 4.6 (end of fermentation) were similar for all treatments. adding quinoa flour had no effect on fermentation time; however, it did contribute to postacidification of the fermented milk during storage. quinoa flour did not affect counts of bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 or lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 during storage, it did not protect the probiotic strains during simulated gi transit, and it did not have a positive effect on the adhesion of probiotic bacteria to caco-2 cells in vitro. additionally, the adhesion of strains to caco-2 cells decreased during refrigerated storage of fermented milk. although the addition of up to 3% quinoa flour had a neutral effect on probiotic activity, its incorporation to fermented milk can be recommended because it is an ingredient with high nutritive value, which may increase the appeal of the product to consumers.

TI  == superior prebiotic and physicochemical properties of novel dextran from weissella cibaria jag8 for potential food applications.
AB  == the dextran produced by dextransucrase from weissella cibaria jag8 was subjected  to physicochemical characterization and assessment of its prebiotic potential. dextran displayed a solubility of 24.5% and a water holding capacity of 352%. the emulsion and flocculation activity of dextran were 89% and 92%, respectively. the degradation temperature (td) of dextran was 353 degrees c. dextran exhibited 33-  and 12-fold less hydrolysis than inulin, in simulated gastric juice (ph 1.0) and  alpha-amylase (ph 7.0), respectively. dextran stimulated the growth of probiotic  bacteria such as bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis, bifidobacterium infantis and lactobacillus acidophilus significantly and was comparable to that of commercial inulin. however, the growth of e. coli was not enhanced by dextran  or inulin. the dextran used in this study can be used as a potential prebiotic for health benefits.

TI  == effects of probiotic supplementation over 5 months on routine haematology and clinical chemistry measures in healthy active adults.
AB  == use of probiotic-containing foods and probiotic supplements is increasing; however, few studies document safety and tolerability in conjunction with defined clinical end points. this paper reports the effects of 150 days of supplementation with either a single- (bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bl-04) or a double-strain (lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bi-07) probiotic on routine haematology and clinical chemistry measures in healthy active adults. pre- to post-intervention changes in laboratory measures were determined and compared between supplement and placebo groups. overall there were few differences in routine haematology and clinical chemistry measures between supplement and placebo groups post-intervention. exceptions included plasma calcium (p=0.03) and urea (p=0.015); however, observed changes were small and within assay-specific laboratory reference ranges. these data provide evidence supporting the use of these probiotic supplements over a period of 5 months in healthy active adults without obvious safety or tolerability issues.

TI  == [the effect of probiotic therapy on development of experimental obesity in rats caused by monosodium glutamate].
AB  == the effect of a mixture of probiotic strains (2:1:1 lactobacillus casei imvb-7280, bifidobacterium animalis vkl, bifidobacterium animalis vkb) on the development of experimental obesity in rats induced by neonatal administration of monosodium glutamate has been studied. it was shown that in rats of 4 months age, the injection of monosodium glutamate (4 mg/g) at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 days after birth elicited abdominal obesity and metabolic syndrome. an intermittent administration of a probiotic mixture to rats treated with monosodium prevented the development  of obesity. in the group of rats treated with probiotics, anthropometric parameters (weight and body length, lee index, body mass index) did not differ from the level of intact rats. visceral fat mass was decreased by probiotics by 38.5% (p < 0.05) compared to rats treated with water. probiotics improved lipid metabolism: reduced the level of vldl by 32.2% (p < 0,05), the level of ldl by 30.6% (p < 0.05), increased hdl by 25.7% (p <0,05) compared to obese control rats. probiotic strains restored the secretion of adipocytes hormones (leptin and adiponectin) to the normal level of intact animals. the results show the effectiveness of probiotics for the prevention of obesity.

TI  == immune modulating capability of two exopolysaccharide-producing bifidobacterium strains in a wistar rat model.
AB  == fermented dairy products are the usual carriers for the delivery of probiotics to humans, bifidobacterium and lactobacillus being the most frequently used bacteria. in this work, the strains bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis ipla r1 and bifidobacterium longum ipla e44 were tested for their capability to modulate immune response and the insulin-dependent glucose homeostasis using male wistar rats fed with a standard diet. three intervention groups were fed daily for 24 days with 10% skimmed milk, or with 10(9) cfu of the corresponding strain  suspended in the same vehicle. a significant increase of the suppressor-regulatory tgf- beta cytokine occurred with both strains in comparison with a control (no intervention) group of rats; the highest levels were reached in rats fed ipla r1. this strain presented an immune protective profile, as it was able to reduce the production of the proinflammatory il-6. moreover, phosphorylated akt kinase decreased in gastroctemius muscle of rats fed the strain ipla r1, without affecting the glucose, insulin, and homa index in blood,  or levels of glut-4 located in the membrane of muscle and adipose tissue cells. therefore, the strain b. animalis subsp. lactis ipla r1 is a probiotic candidate  to be tested in mild grade inflammation animal models.

TI  == exercise induction of gut microbiota modifications in obese, non-obese and hypertensive rats.
AB  == background: obesity is a multifactor disease associated with cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension. recently, gut microbiota was linked to obesity pathogenesisand shown to influence the host metabolism. moreover, several factors such as host-genotype and life-style have been shown to modulate gut microbiota composition. exercise is a well-known agent used for the treatment of numerous pathologies, such as obesity and hypertension; it has recently been demonstrated  to shape gut microbiota consortia. since exercise-altered microbiota could possibly improve the treatment of diseases related to dysfunctional microbiota, this study aimed to examine the effect of controlled exercise training on gut microbial composition in obese rats (n = 3), non-obese wistar rats (n = 3) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (n = 3). pyrosequencing of 16s rrna genes from fecal samples collected before and after exercise training was used for this purpose. results: exercise altered the composition and diversity of gut bacteria  at genus level in all rat lineages. allobaculum (hypertensive rats), pseudomonas  and lactobacillus (obese rats) were shown to be enriched after exercise, while streptococcus (wistar rats), aggregatibacter and sutturella (hypertensive rats) were more enhanced before exercise. a significant correlation was seen in the clostridiaceae and bacteroidaceae families and oscillospira and ruminococcus genera with blood lactate accumulation. moreover, wistar and hypertensive rats were shown to share a similar microbiota composition, as opposed to obese rats. finally, streptococcus alactolyticus, bifidobacterium animalis, ruminococcus gnavus, aggregatibacter pneumotropica and bifidobacterium pseudolongum were enriched in obese rats. conclusions: these data indicate that non-obese and hypertensive rats harbor a different gut microbiota from obese rats and that exercise training alters gut microbiota from an obese and hypertensive genotype background.

TI  == probiotics in the prevention of eczema: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  == objective: to evaluate a multistrain, high-dose probiotic in the prevention of eczema. design: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial. settings: antenatal clinics, research clinic, children at home. patients:  pregnant women and their infants. interventions: women from 36 weeks gestation and their infants to age 6 months received daily either the probiotic (lactobacillus salivarius cul61, lactobacillus paracasei cul08, bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis cul34 and bifidobacterium bifidum cul20; total of 10(10) organisms/day) or matching placebo. main outcome measure: diagnosed eczema at age 2 years. infants were followed up by questionnaire. clinical examination and skin prick tests to common allergens were done at 6 months and 2 years. results: the cumulative frequency of diagnosed eczema at 2 years was similar in the probiotic (73/214, 34.1%) and placebo arms (72/222, 32.4%; or 1.07, 95% ci 0.72 to 1.6). among the secondary outcomes, the cumulative frequency of skin prick sensitivity at 2 years was reduced in the probiotic (18/171; 10.5%) compared with the placebo arm (32/173; 18.5%; or 0.52, 95% ci 0.28 to 0.98). the  statistically significant differences between the arms were mainly in sensitisation to cow's milk and hen's egg proteins at 6 months. atopic eczema occurred in 9/171 (5.3%) children in the probiotic arm and 21/173 (12.1%) in the  placebo arm (or 0.40, 95% ci 0.18 to 0.91). conclusions: the study did not provide evidence that the probiotic either prevented eczema during the study or reduced its severity. however, the probiotic seemed to prevent atopic sensitisation to common food allergens and so reduce the incidence of atopic eczema in early childhood. trial registration number: isrctn26287422.

TI  == effect of probiotic supplementation on schizophrenia symptoms and association with gastrointestinal functioning: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == objective: a range of immune system abnormalities have been associated with schizophrenia. probiotic compounds modulate the immune response and offer a potential treatment strategy for schizophrenia. probiotic compounds have also been observed to improve gastrointestinal dysfunction, which is a common problem  in individuals with schizophrenia. we performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to examine whether probiotic supplementation can reduce  symptom severity in patients with schizophrenia receiving antipsychotic treatment and also whether probiotics are associated with bowel functioning. methods: outpatients with schizophrenia (n = 65) meeting dsm-iv criteria and with at least moderately severe psychotic symptoms were enrolled in the study from december 2010-august 2012. following a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients were randomly assigned to 14 weeks of double-blind adjunctive probiotic (combined lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis strain bb12) or placebo therapy. psychiatric symptoms were assessed biweekly with the positive and negative syndrome scale (panss), and patients were queried weekly about their gastrointestinal functioning. results: repeated-measures analysis of variance showed no significant differences in the panss total score between probiotic and placebo supplementation (f = 1.28, p = .25). however, patients in the probiotic group were less likely to develop severe bowel difficulty over the course of the trial (hazard ratio = 0.23; 95% ci, 0.09-0.61,  p = .003). conclusions: probiotic supplementation may help prevent a common somatic symptom associated with schizophrenia. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct01242371.

TI  == modulation of gut microbiota during probiotic-mediated attenuation of metabolic syndrome in high fat diet-fed mice.
AB  == structural disruption of gut microbiota and associated inflammation are considered important etiological factors in high fat diet (hfd)-induced metabolic syndrome (ms). three candidate probiotic strains, lactobacillus paracasei cncm i-4270 (lc), l. rhamnosus i-3690 (lr) and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis  i-2494 (ba), were individually administered to hfd-fed mice (10(8) cells day(-1)) for 12 weeks. each strain attenuated weight gain and macrophage infiltration into epididymal adipose tissue and markedly improved glucose-insulin homeostasis and hepatic steatosis. weighted unifrac principal coordinate analysis based on 454 pyrosequencing of fecal bacterial 16s rrna genes showed that the probiotic strains shifted the overall structure of the hfd-disrupted gut microbiota toward  that of lean mice fed a normal (chow) diet. redundancy analysis revealed that abundances of 83 operational taxonomic units (otus) were altered by probiotics. forty-nine altered otus were significantly correlated with one or more host ms parameters and were designated 'functionally relevant phylotypes'. thirteen of the 15 functionally relevant otus that were negatively correlated with ms phenotypes were promoted, and 26 of the 34 functionally relevant otus that were positively correlated with ms were reduced by at least one of the probiotics, but each strain changed a distinct set of functionally relevant otus. lc and lr increased cecal acetate but did not affect circulating lipopolysaccharide-binding protein; in contrast, ba did not increase acetate but significantly decreased adipose and hepatic tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene expression. these results suggest that lactobacillus and bifidobacterium differentially attenuate obesity comorbidities in part through strain-specific impacts on ms-associated phylotypes of gut microbiota in mice.

TI  == probiotic bacteria survive in cheddar cheese and modify populations of other lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: starter lactic acid bacteria in cheddar cheese face physico-chemical stresses during manufacture and ageing that alter their abilities to survive and  to interact with other bacterial populations. nonstarter bacteria are derived from milk handling, cheese equipment and human contact during manufacture. probiotic bacteria are added to foods for human health benefits that also encounter physiological stresses and microbial competition that may mitigate their survival during ageing. we added probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei and bifidobacterium animalis subsp.  lactis to full-fat, reduced-fat and low-fat cheddar cheeses, aiming to study their survival over 270 days of ageing and to determine the role of the cheese matrix in their survival. methods and results: probiotic and other lactic acid bacterial populations were enumerated by quantitative pcr using primers specifically targeting the different bacterial genera or species of interest. bifidobacteria were initially added at 10(6) cfu g(-1) cheese and survived variably in the different cheeses over the 270-day ageing process. probiotic lactobacilli that were added at 10(7) cfu g(-1) cheese and incident nonstarter lactobacilli (initially at 10(8) cfu g(-1) cheese) increased by 10- to 100-fold over 270 days. viable bacterial populations were differentiated using propidium monoazide followed by species-specific qpcr assays, which demonstrated that the starter and probiotic microbes survived over ageing, independent of cheese type.  addition of probiotic bacteria, at levels 100-fold below that of starter bacteria, modified starter and nonstarter bacterial levels. conclusions: we demonstrated that starter lactococci, nonstarter lactobacilli and probiotic bacteria are capable of surviving throughout the cheesemaking and ageing process, indicating that delivery via hard cheeses is possible. probiotic addition at lower levels may also alter starter and nonstarter bacterial survival. significance and impact of the study: we applied qpcr to study multispecies survival and viability and distinctly enumerated bacterial species in commercial-scale cheddar cheese manufacture.

TI  == effect of green tea supplementation on the microbiological, antioxidant, and sensory properties of probiotic milks.
AB  == green tea and its constituents are known for a wide range of health-promoting properties. they may exert antimicrobial action but without altering lactic acid  bacteria. the aim of the present study was to estimate the effect of green tea addition on the selected properties of probiotic milks. bioyogurts (fermented with abt-1 coculture of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12) and acidophilus milks (fermented with pure l. acidophilus la-5 culture) with addition of 0, 5, 10, or 15% (v/v) green tea infusion (gti) were produced and analyzed for the antioxidant capacity by the "diphenyl picrylhydrazyl" (dpph) and "ferric-reducing antioxidant power" (frap) methods, acidity, the count of starter bacteria, and sensory properties at the 1st, 7th, 14th, and 21st day of cold storage. the 15% addition  of gti to the acidophilus milk significantly reduced the lactic acid production during the whole study. the gti had no impact on the level of s. thermophilus and b. lactis bb-12 in bioyogurts, and its effect on the count of l. acidophilus la-5 depended on the concentration and probiotic milk type. gti similarly and in a dose-dependent manner enhanced the antioxidant capacity of both milk types. there were no significant differences between the sensory notes received for bioyogurts, whereas acidophilus milks with tea were less appreciated by the panelists. in conclusion, green tea could be successfully used as a functional additive for selected probiotic milks enhancing their health benefits, but the proper selection of tea additive and starter culture is recommended.

AB  == background: viral upper respiratory tract infections occur frequently among conscripts. probiotics have reduced viral infections in children attending day care. limited data are available on the effects of probiotics on the nasopharyngeal presence of respiratory viruses. objectives: to assess, whether probiotics could decrease nasopharyngeal occurrence of respiratory viruses in finnish conscripts. study design: in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 90- and 150-day intervention study, 239 nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from 192 symptomatic conscripts receiving daily chewable probiotic tablet containing lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 (46.9%) or control tablet (53.1%) on visits to a garrison's health care center due to symptoms of infection. the presence of respiratory viruses was tested by pcr-methods, and viral findings were compared between the intervention groups. results: 184 (76.9%) nasopharyngeal samples were positive for at least one respiratory virus. picornaviruses were the most common  viruses and were detected in 155 (84.2%) of samples. of these, 143 (92.3%) were rhinovirus-positive and 20 (12.9%) were enterovirus-positive. the control group had 83 (64%) and the probiotic group 72 (66%) picornavirus infections (p=0.79). monthly distribution of picornaviruses showed that there were less picornavirus findings after 3 months in the probiotic group than in the control group (p=0.0069). however, probiotics did not reduce picornavirus occurrence in other months. conclusions: overall, probiotics did not reduce viral occurrence in symptomatic conscripts. however, probiotics decreased the presence of picornaviruses after 3 months, which may imply that probiotics play a role against viruses causing common cold. further investigations are necessary to clarify the mechanisms involved in order to target specific probiotics on specific respiratory viruses.

TI  == thermopressurized diluted phosphoric acid pretreatment of ligno(hemi)cellulose to make free sugars and nutraceutical oligosaccharides.
AB  == ligno(hemi)cellulosics (l(h)cs) as sugarcane bagasse and loblolly pine sawdust are currently being used to produce biofuels such as bioethanol and biobutanol through fermentation of free sugars that are often obtained enzymatically. however, this bioconversion requires a pretreatment to solubilize the hemicellulose fractions, thus facilitating the action of the cellulolytic enzymes. instead of the main free monosaccharides used in these current models, the modulation of thermopressurized orthophosphoric acid as a pretreatment, in the ranges of 3-12 atm and ph 1.5-2.5, can produce nondigestible oligosaccharides (ndos) such as xylo-oligosaccharides (xos) because heteroxylan is present in both types of hardwood and softwood hemicelluloses. a comparative thin-layer chromatographic analysis of the hydrolytic products showed the best conditions for ndos production to be 7 atm/water, ph 2.25 and 2.50, and 8.5 atm/water for both sources. particular hydrolysates from 7 atm (171 degrees c) at phs 2.25 and  2.50 both for cane bagasse and pine sawdust, with respective oligosaccharide contents of 57 and 59 %, once mixed in a proportion of 1:1 for each plant source, were used in vitro as carbon sources for bifidobacterium or lactobacillus. once both bacteria attained the stationary phase of growth, an unforeseen feature emerged: the preference of b. animalis for bagasse hydrolysates and, conversely,  the preference of l. casei for pine hydrolysates. considering the fact that nutraceutical oligosaccharides from both hemicelluloses correspond to higher value-added byproducts, the technology using a much diluted thermopressurized orthophosphoric acid pretreatment becomes an attractive choice for l(h)cs.

TI  == assessment of stress tolerance acquisition in the heat-tolerant derivative strains of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg.
AB  == aims: the purpose of this study was to investigate the heat-shock response at molecular level in lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 and their heat-tolerant derivatives and to characterize the changes  that make the derivatives more robust in terms of heat stress. methods and results: the study strains were exposed for 2 h to a heat-shock treatment, bif. animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 and its derivative at 50 degrees c and the lact. rhamnosus gg and its derivative at 60 degrees c. protein synthesis before and after heat shock was examined using proteomics and rt-qpcr. the analysis revealed that the regulation of seven proteins in both strain pairs was modified as a response to heat or between the original and the derivative strain. the comparison of wild-type strains and the heat-tolerant derivatives suggests that the acquisition of heat tolerance in the bif. animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 derivative is due to a slightly increased constitutive level of chaperones, while in lact. rhamnosus gg derivative, the main reason seems to be a higher ability to induce the production of chaperones. conclusions: this study revealed possible markers of heat tolerance in b. lactis and lact. rhamnosus strains. significance  and impact of study: this study increases our knowledge on how lactobacillus and  bifidobacterium strains may acquire heat tolerance. these findings may be useful  for improving the heat tolerance of existing probiotic strains as well as screening new heat-tolerant strains.

AB  == in the present study, the cells of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (bi-01) and lactobacillus acidophilus (lac-04) were encapsulated in cocoa butter using spray-chilling technology. survival assays were conducted to evaluate the resistance of the probiotics to the spray-chilling process, their resistance to the simulated gastric and intestinal fluids (sgf and sif), and their stability during 90 days of storage. the viability of the cells was not affected by microencapsulation. the free and encapsulated cells of b. animalis subsp. lactis  were resistant to both sgf and sif. the micro-encapsulated cells of l. acidophilus were more resistant to sgf and sif than the free cells; the viability of the encapsulated cells was enhanced by 67%, while the free cells reached the detection limit of the method (10(3) cfu/g). the encapsulated probiotics were unstable when they were stored at 20 degrees c. the population of encapsulated l. acidophilus decreased drastically when they were stored at 7 degrees c; only 20%  of cells were viable after 90 days of storage. the percentage of viable cells of  the encapsulated b. animalis subsp.lactis, however, was 72% after the same period of storage. promising results were obtained when the microparticles were stored at -18 degrees c; the freeze granted 90 days of shelf life to the encapsulated cells. these results suggest that the spray-chilling process using cocoa butter as carrier protects l. acidophilus from gastrointestinal fluids. however, the viability of the cells during storage must be improved.

TI  == immune system stimulation by probiotic microorganisms.
AB  == probiotic organisms are claimed to offer several functional properties including  stimulation of immune system. this review is presented to provide detailed informations about how probiotics stimulate our immune system. lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota, bifidobacterium animalis bb-12, lactobacillus johnsonii la1, bifidobacterium lactis dr10, and saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii are the most investigated probiotic cultures for their immunomodulation properties. probiotics can enhance nonspecific cellular immune response characterized by activation of macrophages, natural killer (nk) cells, antigen-specific cytotoxic t-lymphocytes, and the release of various cytokines in strain-specific and dose-dependent manner. mixture and type (gram-positive and gram-negative) of probiotic organisms may induce different cytokine responses. supplementation of probiotic organisms in infancy could help prevent immune-mediated diseases in childhood, whereas their intervention in pregnancy could affect fetal immune parameters, such as cord blood interferon (ifn)-gamma levels, transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta1 levels, and breast milk immunoglobulin (ig)a. probiotics that can be delivered via fermented milk or yogurt could improve the gut mucosal immune system by increasing the number of iga(+) cells and cytokine-producing cells in the effector site of the intestine.

TI  == short communication: survival of the characteristic microbiota in probiotic fermented camel, cow, goat, and sheep milks during refrigerated storage.
AB  == the objective of this study was to monitor the viability during storage of lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 (a), bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 (b), and streptococcus thermophilus chcc 742/2130 (t) in probiotic cultured dairy foods made from pasteurized camel, cow, goat, and sheep milks fermented by an abt-type culture. the products manufactured were stored at 4 degrees c for 42d. microbiological analyses were performed at weekly intervals. streptococcus thermophilus chcc 742/2130 was the most numerous culture component in all 4 products both at the beginning and at the end of storage. the viable counts of streptococci showed no significant decline in fermented camel milk throughout the entire storage period. the initial numbers of lb. acidophilus la-5 were over 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of strep. thermophilus chcc 742/2130. with the progress of time, a slow and constant decrease was observed in lactobacilli counts; however, the final viability percentages of this organism did not differ  significantly in the probiotic fermented milks tested. the cultured dairy foods made from cow, sheep, and goat milks had comparable b. animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 counts on d 0, exceeding by approximately 0.5 log10 cycle those in the camel milk-based product. no significant losses occurred in viability of bifidobacteria in fermented camel, cow, and sheep milks during 6wk of refrigerated storage. in conclusion, all 4 varieties of milk proved to be suitable raw materials for the manufacture of abt-type fermented dairy products that were microbiologically safe and beneficial for human consumption. it was suggested that milk from small ruminants be increasingly used to produce probiotic fermented dairy foods. the development of camel milk-based probiotic cultured milks appears to be even more  promising because new markets could thus be conquered. it must be emphasized, however, that further microbiological and sensory studies, technology development activities, and market research are needed before such food products can be successfully commercialized.

TI  == the efficacy of probiotics for monosodium glutamate-induced obesity: dietology concerns and opportunities for prevention.
AB  == introduction: obesity becomes endemic today. monosodium glutamate was proved as obesogenic food additive. probiotics are discussed to impact on obesity development. aims and objectives: the aim was to study the effects of probiotics  on the development of monosodium glutamate (msg)-induced obesity in rats. material and methods: we included 45 wistar male rats and divided into three groups (n = 15). newborn rats of group 1 (control) received subcutaneously 8 mul/g saline. group 2 received 3 to 4 mg/g msg subcutaneously on the second, fourth, sixth, eighth and tenth day of life. within 4 months after birth, rats were on a standard diet. group 3 received an aqueous solution of probiotics mixture (2:1:1 lactobacillus casei imvb-7280, bifidobacterium animalis vkl, b. animalis vkb) at the dose of 5 x 109 cfu/kg (50 mg/kg) intragastrically. administration of probiotics was started at the age of 4 weeks just after weaning and continued for 3 months during 2-week courses. group 2 received intragastrically 2.5 ml/kg water. organometric and biochemical parameters in all  groups of rats were analyzed over 4 months. the concentration of adiponectin was  determined in serum, and leptin - in adipose tissue. results: administration of msg led to the development of obesity in rats; body weight had increased by 7.9%  vs controls (p < 0.05); body length had increased by 5.4% (p < 0.05). body mass index and lee index and visceral fat mass had increased (p < 0.001). under the neonatal injection of msg, the concentration of total cholesterol, triglycerides, vldl cholesterol and ldl cholesterol significantly increased (p < 0.001), in comparison with controls. adipose-derived hormones changed in msg obesity rats: adiponectin decreased by 58.8% (p < 0.01), and leptin concentration in adipose tissue had increased by 74.7% (p < 0.01). the probiotic therapy of rats from group 3 prevented obesity development. parameters of rats treated with probiotic  mixture did not differ from that in the control. conclusions: the introduction of msg to newborn rats caused the obesity in adulthood. periodic administration of probiotic mixture to rat injected with msg neonatally resulted in recovery of lipid metabolism and prevention of the obesity development.

TI  == advantageous direct quantification of viable closely related probiotics in petit-suisse cheeses under in vitro gastrointestinal conditions by propidium monoazide--qpcr.
AB  == species-specific quantitative real time pcr (qpcr) alone and combined with the use of propidium monoazide (pma) were used along with the plate count method to evaluate the survival of the probiotic strains lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12, and the bacteriocinogenic and potentially probiotic strain lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei 2a in synbiotic (f1) and probiotic (f2) petit-suisse cheeses exposed throughout shelf-life to in  vitro simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions. the three strains studied showed a reduction in their viability after the 6 h assay. bb-12 displayed the highest survival capacity, above 72.6 and 74.6% of the initial populations, respectively, by plate count and pma-qpcr, maintaining population levels in the range or above 6 log cfu/g. the prebiotic mix of inulin and fos did not offer any additional protection for the strains against the simulated gastrointestinal environment. the microorganisms' populations were comparable among the three methods at the initial time of the assay, confirming the presence of mainly viable and culturable cells. however, with the intensification of the stress induced throughout the various stages of the in vitro test, the differences among the methods increased. the qpcr was not a reliable enumeration method for the quantification of intact bacterial populations, mixed with large numbers of injured and dead bacteria, as confirmed by the scanning electron microscopy results. furthermore, bacteria plate counts were much lower (p<0.05) than with the pma-qpcr method, suggesting the accumulation of stressed or dead microorganisms unable to form colonies. the use of pma overcame the qpcr inability to differentiate between dead and alive cells. the combination of pma and species-specific qpcr in this study allowed a quick and unequivocal way of enumeration of viable closely related species incorporated into probiotic and synbiotic petit-suisse cheeses and under stress conditions.

TI  == the diversity of intestinal microbiota of mongolians living in inner mongolia, china.
AB  == the mongolian nationality has developed their unique lifestyle and dietary habit  for thousands of years. however, by now, little research has been focused on mongolian gut microbiota and how it is related to different dietary habits. in this study, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) methods were applied to reveal the diversity of  predominant gut bacteria of 48 healthy mongolians recruited from hohhot city and  the xilin gol pasturing area in inner mongolia. compared to similar studies of other nationalities, results from the present study have confirmed that the composition of mongolian gut microbiota is highly similar at the phylum level (firmicutes, bacteroidetes, proteobacteria and actinobacteria) but variable at the genus level. especially, the numbers of phascolarctobacterium, lactobacillus  and bifidobacterium are rather high. dgge profiles of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium revealed that lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis were predominant in the gut of the mongolian subjects studied. on the contrary, lactobacillus helveticus was detected in every pasturing area mongolian, but not in any of the hohhot city mongolians. qpcr results revealed that the numbers of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium of xilin gol mongolians were significantly higher (p<0.05) than that of hohhot mongolians, whereas the numbers of enterobacterium were significantly lower (p<0.05). in addition, by partial least squares discriminate  analysis and cluster analysis of data generated from dgge and qpcr experiments, a striking difference in the composition of intestinal microbiota of mongolians living in hohhot city and the xilin gol pasturing area has been found. this study clearly shows that diet affects the microbiota composition of mongolians living in different circumstances, i.e. urban versus rural.

TI  == suitability of bifidobacterium spp. and lactobacillus plantarum as probiotics intended for fruit juices containing citrus extracts.
AB  == a strain of lactobacillus plantarum and 4 strains of bifidobacteria were inoculated in apple juice and in a commercial beverage labeled as "red-fruit juice," containing citrus extracts as natural preservatives; the suitability of the probiotics was evaluated in relation to their resistance to 2 kinds of citrus extracts (biocitro and lemon extract), survival in juices at 4 and 37 degrees c,  and inhibition of zygosaccharomyces bailii. cell count of l. plantarum and bifidobacteria over time was fitted through the weibull equation, for the evaluation of the first reduction time (delta), death time, and microbiological shelf life (the break-point was set to 7 log cfu/ml). bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis experienced the highest delta-value (23.21 d) and death time (96.59 d) in the red-fruit juice at 4 degrees c, whereas l. plantarum was the most promising strain in apple juice at 37 degrees c. biocitro and lemon extract did not exert a biocidal effect toward probiotics; moreover, the probiotics controlled the growth of z. bailii and the combination of l. plantarum with 40 ppm of biocitro reduced the level of the yeast after 18 d by 2 log cfu/ml.

TI  == isolation and characterization of faecal bifidobacteria and lactobacilli isolated from dogs and primates.
AB  == although bifidobacteria and lactobacilli have been suggested beneficial for the host and are components of many probiotics and competitive exclusion mixtures, the knowledge on abundance, metabolic and probiotic characteristics in isolates from dogs and monkeys is still limited. the present study was aimed to isolate bifidobacterium and lactobacillus strains (faeces of 22 dogs and of 5 primates: cebus apella, eulemur fulvus, erythrocebus patas, macaca fascicularis, papio hamadryas) with the maldi-tof identification system lactobacillus murinus, bifidobacterium animalis and pediococcus acidilactici were more frequently isolated species in dogs while lactobacillus plantarum was isolated in several species of primates. ten strains of 6 species were assayed for enzymatic activities (only lactobacillus reuteri strains showed no undesirable enzymatic activity), antimicrobial susceptibility (detected higher minimum inhibitory concentration levels for tetracycline and gentamicin), and inhibitory activity against 15 indicator bacteria. all strains inhibited gram-negative indicators while lactobacilli showed larger inhibition zones than bifidobacteria. l. reuteri ii/3b/a (isolate from m. fascicularis) showed the best antimicrobial properties.  resistance to bile (0.3% w/v) was observed in all tested strains (no decrease of  cfu/ml) whereas the decrease of 68.4-94.4% (after 90 min exposition) and 78.4-99.9% cfu/ml (after 180 min) depending on the strain was detected in the artificial gastric juice.

TI  == synergistic antibacterial efficacies of the combination of bovine lactoferrin or  its hydrolysate with probiotic secretion in curbing the growth of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the occurrence of multidrug-resistant or meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) has become an important issue in clinics. this study evaluated a combinatorial treatment approach by using the well-documented antibacterial protein apo-bovine lactoferrin (apo-blf) or its hydrolysate and specific probiotic supernatants for controlling mrsa infection. clinical mrsa strains were isolated from different patient specimens. apo-blf-hydrolysate possessed stronger anti-mrsa activity than complete blf in that it inhibited the growth of most mrsa strains tested in vitro. otherwise, the supernatants produced by lactobacillus fermentum (atcc 11739), bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum (atcc 15707) and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (bcrc 17394) inhibited the growth of various mrsa strains. further, l. fermentum or b. animalis subsp. lactis supernatant plus apo-blf or blf-hydrolysate led to partially synergistic to synergistic growth-inhibitory activity against mrsa strains. however, l. fermentum and not b. animalis subsp. lactis or b. longum subsp. longum was observed to resist the antibacterial activity of both apo-lf and blf-hydrolysate. therefore, it is suggested that l. fermentum could be the best candidate to be used with apo-blf or blf-hydrolysate as a live supplement against mrsa infections.

TI  == effect of prebiotic carbohydrates on growth, bile survival and cholesterol uptake abilities of dairy-related bacteria.
AB  == background: three strains of lactic acid bacteria and one probiotic bifidobacterium strain sourced from milk origin were considered to select for the best synbiotic-like combination for cholesterol uptake ability. for that purpose, fermentative characteristics, bile salt hydrolase activity, bile survival and cholesterol removal were assessed in the presence of different carbohydrates. results: carbohydrate fermentability was highly variable among the different strains, and lactulose was the only prebiotic to favour growth of all strains, whereas pectin led to low population regardless of the strain. bile survival of bacteria could be improved by the preferred carbon source and was related to their bile salt hydrolase activities. all together, our results showed that the most advantageous synbiotic-like combinations to achieve cholesterol uptake abilities were lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus lb 340 with raffinose, streptococcus thermophilus ta040 or lactobacillus rhamnosus lbre-lsas with lactulose, and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb12 with mannitol. conclusion: the suggested synbiotics may represent new promising functional dairy additives.

TI  == lactobacillus reuteri and escherichia coli in the human gut microbiota may predict weight gain associated with vancomycin treatment.
AB  == background: antibiotics, used for 60 years to promote weight gain in animals, have been linked to obesity in adults and in children when administered during early infancy. lactobacillus reuteri has been linked to obesity and weight gain in children affected with kwashiorkor using ready-to-use therapeutic food. in contrast, escherichia coli has been linked with the absence of obesity. both of these bacteria are resistant to vancomycin. objectives and methods: we assessed vancomycin-associated weight and gut microbiota changes, and tested whether bacterial species previously linked with body mass index (bmi) predict weight gain at 1 year. all endocarditis patients treated with vancomycin or amoxicillin  in our center were included from january 2008 to december 2010. bacteroidetes, firmicutes, lactobacillus and methanobrevibacter smithii were quantified using real-time pcr on samples obtained during the 4-6 weeks antibiotic regimen. l. reuteri, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, bifidobacterium animalis and e. coli were quantified on stool samples obtained during the first week of antibiotics. results: of the193 patients included in the study, 102 were treated with vancomycin and 91 with amoxicillin. vancomycin was associated with a 10% bmi increase (odds ratio (or) 14.1; 95% confidence interval (ci; 1.03-194); p=0.047)  and acquired obesity (4/41 versus 0/56, p=0.01). in patients treated with vancomycin, firmicutes, bacteroidetes and lactobacillus increased, whereas m. smithii decreased (p<0.05). the absence of e. coli was an independent predictor of weight gain (or=10.7; 95% ci (1.4-82.0); p=0.02). strikingly, a patient with an 18% bmi increase showed a dramatic increase of l. reuteri but no increase of e. coli. conclusion: the acquired obesity observed in patients treated with vancomycin may be related to a modulation of the gut microbiota rather than a direct antibiotic effect. l. reuteri, which is resistant to vancomycin and produces broad bacteriocins, may have an instrumental role in this effect.

TI  == early supplementation with lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 reduces eczema prevalence to 6 years: does it also reduce atopic sensitization?
AB  == background: the role of probiotics in prevention of allergic disease is still not clear; efficacy may depend on the timing, dose, duration, and specific probiotic  used. using a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial (australian new zealand clinical trials registry: actrn12607000518460), we have shown that in a high-risk birth cohort, maternal supplementation from 35 weeks gestation until 6  months if breastfeeding and infant supplementation from birth until 2 years with  lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 (hn001) (6 x 10(9) cfu/day) halved the cumulative prevalence of eczema at 2 and 4 years. bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis hn019 (hn019) (9 x 10(9) cfu/day) had no significant effect. objective: to determine whether differences in effects of hn001 and hn019 on eczema persist to  age 6 years, and to investigate effects on sensitization. methods: standard procedures were used to assess eczema (the uk working party's criteria), eczema severity (scorad), atopic sensitization [skin prick tests (spt), total and specific ige] and standard questions used for asthma, wheeze, and rhinoconjunctivitis. results: hn001 was associated with significantly lower cumulative prevalence of eczema (hr = 0.56, 95% ci 0.39-0.80), scorad >/= 10 (hr  = 0.69, 0.49-0.98) and spt sensitization (hr = 0.69, 95% ci 0.48-0.99). the point prevalence of eczema (rr = 0.66, 95% ci 0.44-1.00), scorad >/= 10 (rr = 0.62, 95% ci 0.38-1.01) and spt sensitization (rr = 0.72, 95% ci 0.53-1.00) were also reduced among children taking hn001. hn019 had no significant effect on any outcome. conclusion and clinical relevance: this study provides evidence for the  efficacy of the probiotic l. rhamnosus hn001 in preventing the development of eczema and possibly also atopic sensitization in high risk infants to age 6 years. the absence of a similar effect for hn019 indicates that benefits may be species specific.

TI  == impact of 6 different intestinal bacteria on broiler breeder sperm motility in vitro.
AB  == male fertility is often evaluated by measuring sperm parameters, including concentration, viability, and motility. this is important because after copulation occurs, sperm must overcome many barriers in the female reproductive tract to fertilize the ovum. in mammalian species, sperm have been shown to have  reduced motility when bacteria are present. in male broiler breeders, bacteria have been associated with spermatozoa, but their effect on motility has not been  investigated. the sperm quality index is a modern rapid method of evaluating avian sperm motility. therefore, the objective of this study was to use the sperm quality index to determine if broiler breeder sperm motility is reduced when semen is exposed to various bacteria. in this experiment, semen was collected from 20 broiler breeders to obtain a pooled neat semen sample. six different intestinal bacteria, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium bifermentans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium animalis were cultured overnight. for each bacterium, 50 microl of semen was diluted in 450 microl of saline, sterile broth, or the overnight culture, creating 3 treatments. the experiment was repeated twice. in each treatment, 3 replicates were evaluated at 0 and 10 min postinoculation, creating a completely randomized  design with a split plot over time. also, the ph was measured for each treatment  at 0 and 10 min. the results indicated that all broths containing bacteria immediately reduced broiler breeder sperm motility when compared with the controls (p < 0.0001), but broths containing bifidobacterium or lactobacillus virtually made sperm immotile. although broth containing salmonella, campylobacter, and bifidobacterium immediately reduced sperm motility, the reduction did not change over time. broths containing e. coli, clostridium, and lactobacillus reduced sperm motility immediately, but over time motility continued to decrease. however, ph was increased when semen was exposed to the e. coli and campylobacter treatment, but when semen was exposed to bifidobacterium and lactobacillus treatments, ph was reduced. in conclusion, the results indicate that bacteria can reduce broiler breeder sperm motility upon exposure.

TI  == effect of probiotics on the development of dimethylhydrazine-induced preneoplastic lesions in the mice colon.
AB  == purpose: to determine the effect of probiotics on the development of chemically induced (1, 2-dimethylhydrazine) colonic preneoplastic lesions, in mice. methods: the animals were divided into five groups. the control group was injected with carcinogen alone and the other groups also received probiotics (1- lactobacillus  delbrueckii ufv-h2b20; 2- bifidobacterium animalis var. lactis bb12; 3- l. delbrueckii ufv-h2b20 plus b. animalis var. lactis bb12; and 4- saccharomyces boulardii) administered orally in drinking water throughout fourteen weeks. results: consumption of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria alone resulted in a significant reduction of the total number of aberrant crypt foci (55.7% and 45.1%, respectively). significant reduction in the number of these small foci (<3 aberrant crypts) was only observed in the group treated with lactobacilli (52.2%) in comparison to control group. the number of larger foci (>3 aberrant crypts) crypts had no significant reduction. conclusion: l. delbrueckii ufv-h2b20 and b.  animalis var. lactis bb12 administered alone protect colonic preneoplastic lesions in mice, while the combined treatment of these bacteria and the administration of s.boulardii were not effective in reducing such colonic lesions.

TI  == assessment of the effect of stress-tolerance acquisition on some basic characteristics of specific probiotics.
AB  == the production of viable functional probiotics presupposes stability of strain features in the final product. we evaluated the impact of acquisition of heat-tolerance and subsequent freeze-drying on the adhesion properties of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota, bifidobacterium lactis bb-12 and bifidobacterium animalis if20/1 and on their ability to inhibit the adhesion of pathogens in a mucus model. both fresh and freeze-dried cultures were evaluated. significant differences were observed between fresh, freeze dried, fresh heat-tolerant and freeze dried heat-tolerant strains, especially in the ability of the freeze dried probiotics to exclude, displace or outcompete pathogens. based on our study characterizing probiotic properties such as adhesion and competitive exclusion, it seems possible to adapt probiotics to processing stresses, such as heat, without significantly changing the probiotic properties of the strains assessed. this may provide new options for future probiotic production technology. however, our results also emphasize that the properties of the stress-adapted strains, as well as the effect of the production processes should always be assessed as these are strain-specific.

AB  == background: this study evaluated the effect of inulin and okara flour on textural and sensory properties of probiotic soy yoghurt (sy) throughout 28 days of storage at 4 degrees c. employing a 2(2) design, four formulations of sy produced from soymilk and fermented with an abt-4 culture (lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, bifidobacterium animalis bb-12 and streptococcus thermophilus) were studied: sy-c (control); sy-i (with inulin); sy-o (with okara); sy-io (with inulin + okara). results: the addition of okara and the refrigerated storage led to significant differences in the instrumental texture parameters of sy (p < 0.05). inulin and okara did not affect sy sensory acceptability (p > 0.05), but there was a tendency for higher scores in the presence of inulin. on the other hand, the storage period, particularly at 21 days, was unfavourable regarding the acceptance of the different sy. conclusion: the results showed that the addition  of okara flour and the storage were significant factors to increase firmness of the soy yoghurts. sy acceptability was not affected by the incorporation of inulin or okara. these results suggest that okara, discarded as industrial waste, may be used in probiotic soy yoghurt, helping to increase the nutritional and functional properties without altering its acceptability.

TI  == in vitro growth of four individual human gut bacteria on oligosaccharides produced by chemoenzymatic synthesis.
AB  == the present study aimed at examining oligosaccharides (os) for potential stimulation of probiotic bacteria. nineteen structurally well-defined candidate os covering groups of beta-glucosides, alpha-glucosides and alpha-galactosides with degree of polymerization 2-4 were prepared in >100 mg amounts by chemoenzymatic synthesis (i.e. reverse phosphorolysis or transglycosylation). fourteen of the os are not naturally occurring and five (beta-d-glucosyl-fructose, beta-d-glucosyl-xylitol, alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-d-mannose, alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-d-xylose; alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-l-fucose) have recently been synthesized for the first time. these os have not been previously tested for effects of bacterial growth and here the ability of all 19 os to support growth of four gastrointestinal bacteria: three probiotic bacteria bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, and lactobacillus acidophilus, and one commensal bacterium, bacteroides vulgatus has  been evaluated in monocultures. the disaccharides beta-d-glucosyl-xylitol and beta-d-glucosyl-(1,4)-xylose noticeably stimulated growth yields of l. acidophilus ncfm, and additionally, beta-d-glucosyl-(1,4)-xylose stimulated b. longum bl-05. alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-glucosamine and alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-n-acetyl-glucosamine enhanced the growth rate of b. animalis subsp. lactis and b. longum bl-05, whereas l. acidophilus ncfm and bac. vulgatus  did not grow on these os. alpha-galactosyl-(1,6)-alpha-galactosyl-(1,6)-glucose advanced the growth rate of b. animalis subsp. lactis and l. acidophilus ncfm. thus several of the structurally well-defined os supported growth of beneficial gut bacteria. this reflects a broad specificity of their sugar transporters for os, including specificity for non-naturally occurring os, hence showing promise for design of novel prebiotics.

TI  == effect of probiotics lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on gut-derived lipopolysaccharides and inflammatory cytokines: an in vitro study using a human colonic microbiota model.
AB  == gut-derived lipopolysaccharides (lps) are critical to the development and progression of chronic low-grade inflammation and metabolic diseases. in this study, the effects of probiotics lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on gut-derived lipopolysaccharide and inflammatory cytokine concentrations were evaluated using  a human colonic microbiota model. lactobacillus reuteri, l. rhamnosus, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium animalis, b. bifidum, b. longum, and b. longum subsp.  infantis were identified from the literature for their anti-inflammatory potential. each bacterial culture was administered daily to a human colonic microbiota model during 14 days. colonic lipopolysaccharides, and gram-positive and negative bacteria were quantified. raw 264.7 macrophage cells were stimulated with supernatant from the human colonic microbiota model. concentrations of tnf-alpha, il-1beta, and il-4 cytokines were measured. lipopolysaccharide concentrations were significantly reduced with the administration of b. bifidum (-46.45 +/- 5.65%), l. rhamnosus (-30.40 +/- 5.08%), b. longum (-42.50 +/- 1.28%), and b. longum subsp. infantis (-68.85 +/- 5.32%) (p < 0.05). cell counts  of gram-negative and positive bacteria were distinctly affected by the probiotic  administered. there was a probiotic strain-specific effect on immunomodulatory responses of raw 264.7 macrophage cells. b. longum subsp. infantis demonstrated higher capacities to reduce tnf-alpha concentrations (-69.41 +/- 2.78%; p < 0.05) and to increase il-4 concentrations (+16.50 +/- 0.59%; p < 0.05). colonic lipopolysaccharides were significantly correlated with tnf-alpha and il-1beta concentrations (p < 0.05). these findings suggest that specific probiotic bacteria, such as b. longum subsp. infantis, might decrease colonic lipopolysaccharide concentrations, which might reduce the proinflammatory tone. this study has noteworthy applications in the field of biotherapeutics for the prevention and/or treatment of inflammatory and metabolic diseases.

TI  == the substitution of a traditional starter culture in mutton fermented sausages by lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium animalis.
AB  == common starter cultures used in fermented mutton sausages were substituted by probiotic strains of lactobacillus acidophilus ccdm 476 and bifidobacterium animalis 241a. technological properties of the traditional and the probiotic sausages were compared. the potential probiotic effect was evaluated by enumeration of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in stool samples of 15 volunteers  before and after a 14-day consumption period. the numbers of lactobacilli (10(7)  cfu/g) and bifidobacteria (10(3) cfu/g) in the final product did not affect the technological properties. the use of l. acidophilus as a starter culture was found more beneficial than the use of b. animalis. even after 60 days of storage, high counts of l. acidophilus (10(6) cfu/g) were detected; on the other hand, the counts of b. animalis were under the detection limit. regarding sensory properties, the probiotic products showed better texture, and, curiously, a reduction of the typical smell of mutton. the numbers of lactobacilli in stool samples increased significantly after the consumption of the probiotic sausages.

TI  == impact of inulin and okara on lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 and bifidobacterium  animalis bb-12 viability in a fermented soy product and probiotic survival under  in vitro simulated gastrointestinal conditions.
AB  == the effect of inulin and/or okara flour on lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 and bifidobacterium animalis bb-12 viability in a fermented soy product (fsp) and on  probiotic survival under in vitro simulated gastrointestinal conditions were investigated throughout 28 days of storage at 4 degrees c. employing a 2(2) design, four fsp trials were produced from soymilk fermented with abt-4 culture (la-5, bb-12, and streptococcus thermophilus): fsp (control); fsp-i (with inulin, 3 g/100 ml of soymilk); fsp-o (with okara, 5 g/100 ml); fsp-io (with inulin + okara, ratio 3:5 g/100 ml). probiotic viabilities ranged from 8 to 9 log cfu/g during the 28 days of storage, and inulin and/or okara flour did not affect the viability of la-5 and bb-12. bb-12 resistance to the artificial gastrointestinal  juices was higher than for la-5, since the bb-12 and la-5 populations decreased approximately 0.6 log cfu/g and 3.8 log cfu/g, respectively, throughout storage period. even though the protective effect of inulin and/or okara flour on probiotic microorganisms was not significant, when compared to a fresh culture, the fsp matrix improved bb-12 survival on day 1 of storage and may be considered  a good vehicle for bb-12 and could play an important role in probiotic protection against gastrointestinal juices.

TI  == consumption of fermented milk product with probiotic modulates brain activity.
AB  == background & aims: changes in gut microbiota have been reported to alter signaling mechanisms, emotional behavior, and visceral nociceptive reflexes in rodents. however, alteration of the intestinal microbiota with antibiotics or probiotics has not been shown to produce these changes in humans. we investigated whether consumption of a fermented milk product with probiotic (fmpp) for 4 weeks by healthy women altered brain intrinsic connectivity or responses to emotional attention tasks. methods: healthy women with no gastrointestinal or psychiatric symptoms were randomly assigned to groups given fmpp (n = 12), a nonfermented milk product (n = 11, controls), or no intervention (n = 13) twice daily for 4 weeks. the fmpp contained bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis, streptococcus thermophiles, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and lactococcus lactis subsp lactis. participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after the intervention to measure brain response to an emotional faces attention task and resting brain activity. multivariate and region of interest analyses were performed. results: fmpp intake was associated with reduced task-related response of a distributed functional network (49% cross-block covariance; p = .004) containing affective, viscerosensory, and somatosensory cortices. alterations in  intrinsic activity of resting brain indicated that ingestion of fmpp was associated with changes in midbrain connectivity, which could explain the observed differences in activity during the task. conclusions: four-week intake of an fmpp by healthy women affected activity of brain regions that control central processing of emotion and sensation.

TI  == in vitro inhibition of clostridium difficile and clostridium perfringens by commercial probiotic strains.
AB  == probiotics have gained importance in human and veterinary medicine to prevent and control clostridial enteric disease. limited information is available on the ability of different probiotic bacteria used in food products to inhibit clostridium difficile and clostridium perfringens. the objective of this study was to examine the in vitro inhibitory effects of selected commercial bacterial strains on pathogenic clostridia and their growth characteristics under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. the inhibitory effects of 17 commercial strains of lactobacillus (n = 16) and bifidobacterium (n = 1) on the reference strains of c. difficile and c. perfringens were assessed by an agar well diffusion assay and by a broth culture inhibition assay using cell-free supernatant harvested at different growth phases, with and without ph neutralization. to study growth characteristics, probiotic strains were cultivated in different acid and bile environments, and growth in the modified media was compared to growth in standard medium. in the agar well diffusion assay, supernatant obtained from two probiotic strains inhibited the growth of both reference and clinical strains of c. perfringens. this effect as seen when supernatant was assessed with and without ph neutralization. supernatants obtained from 10 probiotic strains inhibited c. difficile only when supernatant was added without ph neutralization. in the broth culture inhibition assay, growth of c. perfringens and c. difficile was inhibited by supernatant without ph neutralization from 5 and 10 probiotic strains, respectively. all potential probiotic strains were able to grow at ph 4.0 and in  the presence of 0.15% and 0.3% bile but none were able to grow or survive at ph 2.0. altogether five probiotic strains [lactobacillus plantarum (n = 2), lactobacillus rhamnosus (n = 2), bifidobacterium animalis lactis (n = 1)] were shown to inhibit all strains of c. difficile and c. perfringens. the inhibitory effect was probiotic strain-specific. two strains showed a ph-independent inhibitory effect likely due to production of either antibiotics or bacteriocins  inhibiting c. perfringens only. these strains have favourable growth characteristics for use as probiotics and their efficacy as prophylactic or therapeutic measures against clostridial enteric disease should be further evaluated by clinical trials in animals.

TI  == correlation between body mass index and gut concentrations of lactobacillus reuteri, bifidobacterium animalis, methanobrevibacter smithii and escherichia coli.
AB  == background: genus and species level analysis is the best way to characterize alterations in the human gut microbiota that are associated with obesity, because the clustering of obese and lean microbiotas increases with the taxonomic depth of the analysis. bifidobacterium genus members have been associated with a lean status, whereas different lactobacillus species are associated both with a lean and an obese status. objectives and methods: we analyzed the fecal concentrations of bacteroidetes, firmicutes, methanobrevibacter smithii, the genus lactobacillus, five other lactobacillus species previously linked with lean or obese populations, escherichia coli and bifidobacterium animalis in 263 individuals, including 134 obese, 38 overweight, 76 lean and 15 anorexic subjects to test for the correlation between bacterial concentration and body mass index (bmi). of these subjects, 137 were used in our previous study. findings: firmicutes were found in >98.5%, bacteroidetes in 67%, m. smithii in 64%, e. coli in 51%, lactobacillus species between 17 and 25% and b. animalis in 11% of individuals. the fecal concentration of lactobacillus reuteri was positively correlated with bmi (coefficient=0.85; 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.12-0.58; p=0.02) in agreement with what was reported for lactobacillus sakei. as reported, b. animalis (coefficient=-0.84; 95% ci -1.61 to -0.07; p=0.03) and m. smithii (coefficient=-0.43, 95% ci -0.90 to 0.05; p=0.08) were negatively associated with the bmi. unexpectedly, e. coli was found here for the first time to negatively correlate with the bmi (coefficient=-1.05; 95% ci -1.60 to -0.50; p<0.001). conclusion: our findings confirm the specificity of the obese microbiota and emphasize the correlation between the concentration of certain lactobacillus species and obesity.

TI  == bioactivity of probiotic whey cheese: characterization of the content of peptides and organic acids.
AB  == background: probiotic whey cheeses have been produced for several years. it is recognized that several bacterium-mediated metabolic activities contribute differently to the final sensory and nutritional profiles of dairy products. hence the metabolic activity of probiotic strains in a whey cheese and their contribution to the bioactivity of such matrices were investigated here, including in particular bifidobacterium animalis, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei. results: both l. casei and b. animalis produce lactic and acetic acids, whereas l. acidophilus produce mainly lactic acid; these metabolites may be considered bioprotection factors. water-soluble extracts (wse) obtained from these cheese matrices were subjected to ultrafiltration through a 3 kda cut-off membrane, and the eluted peptides were resolved by high-performance liquid chromatography. different qualitative and quantitative profiles were obtained, depending on the strain. wse were further assayed for their ability to  inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme; the <3 kda fraction exhibited higher activities in the case of l. casei and b. animalis than the control and l. acidophilus. conclusion: whey cheeses with higher nutritional value were those inoculated with l. casei.

AB  == the yacon (smallanthus sonchifolius) tuber was examined with regard to its prebiotic effects compared with commercialized fructo-oligosaccharides (fos). a feed containing 10% yacon tuber, which is equivalent to 5% commercialized fos in  terms of the amount of fructo-oligosaccharides (gf2, gf3 and gf4), was administrated to rats for 28 days. the yacon diet changed the intestinal microbial communities beginning in the first week, resulting in a twofold greater concentration of cecal short-chain fatty acids (scfas). the scfa composition differed, but the cecal ph in rats fed yacon tuber was equal to that in rats fed  fos. serum triglycerides were lower in rats fed yacon compared with rats fed fos  and the control diet. cecal size was greater with the yacon tuber diet compared with the control diet. the abundant fermentation in the intestines created a selective environment for the intestinal microbiota, which included lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium animalis and barnesiella spp. according to identification with culture-independent analysis, 16s rrna gene pcr-dgge combined with cloning and sequencing. barnesiella spp. and b. pseudolongum were only found in the rats fed the yacon diet, while l. acidophilus and b. animalis were found in abundance in rats fed both the yacon and fos diets. the genus barnesiella has not previously been reported to be associated with yacon or fos fermentation. we concluded that the physiological and microbiological effects of the yacon tuber were different from those of fos.  differences in cecal size, blood triglycerides and microbial community profiles including their metabolites (scfas) between the yacon tuber and fos were shown to be more greatly affected by the yacon tuber rather than fos.

TI  == effect of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on insulin resistance in pregnant women: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  == background/objectives: owing to excess body weight and increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines primarily during the third trimester, pregnancy is associated with elevated insulin resistance. to our knowledge, no report is available indicating the effects of probiotic yoghurt consumption on serum insulin levels in pregnant women. this study was designed to determine the effects of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on insulin resistance and serum insulin levels of iranian pregnant women. subjects/methods: in this randomized controlled clinical trial, 70 primigravida pregnant women with singleton pregnancy at their third trimester were participated. we randomly assigned participants to consume 200 g per day of conventional (n=33) or the probiotic group (n=37) for 9 weeks. the probiotic yoghurt was a commercially available product prepared with the starter cultures of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus, enriched with probiotic culture of two strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus acidophilus la5) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium  animalis bb12) with a total of min 1 x 10(7) colony-forming units. fasting blood  samples were taken at baseline and after 9-week intervention to measure fasting plasma glucose and serum insulin levels. homeostatic model assessment of insulin  resistance (homa-ir) was used to calculate insulin resistance score. results: although consumption of probiotic yogurt for 9 weeks did not affect serum insulin levels and homa-ir score, significant differences were found comparing changes in these variables between probiotic and conventional yogurts (changes from baseline in serum insulin levels: +1.2+/-1.2 vs +5.0+/-1.1 muiu/ml, respectively, p=0.02;  and in homa-ir score: -0.2+/-0.3 vs 0.7+/-0.2, respectively, p=0.01). conclusions: it is concluded that in contrast to conventional yogurt, daily consumption of probiotic yogurt for 9 weeks maintains serum insulin levels and might help pregnant women prevent developing insulin resistance.

TI  == assessment of probiotic viability during cheddar cheese manufacture and ripening  using propidium monoazide-pcr quantification.
AB  == the use of a suitable food carrier such as cheese could significantly enhance probiotic viability during storage. the main goal of this study was to assess viability of commercial probiotic strains during cheddar cheesemaking and ripening (4-6 months) by comparing the efficiency of microbiological and molecular approaches. molecular methods such as quantitative pcr (qpcr) allow bacterial quantification, and dna-blocking molecules such as propidium monoazide  (pma) select only the living cells' dna. cheese samples were manufactured with a  lactococci starter and with one of three probiotic strains (bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12, lactobacillus rhamnosus ro011, or lactobacillus helveticus ro052) or a mixed culture containing b. animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 and l. helveticus ro052 (mc1), both lactobacilli strains (mc2), or all three strains (mc3). dna extractions were then carried out on pma-treated and non-treated cell pellets in order to assess pma treatment efficiency, followed by quantification using the 16s rrna gene, the elongation factor tu gene (tuf) or the transaldolase gene (tal). results with intact/dead ratios of bacteria showed  that pma-treated cheese samples had a significantly lower bacterial count than non-treated dna samples (p < 0.005), confirming that pma did eliminate dead bacteria from pcr quantification. for both quantification methods, the addition of probiotic strains seemed to accelerate the loss of lactococci viability in comparison to control cheese samples, especially when l. helveticus ro052 was added. viability of all three probiotic strains was also significantly reduced in mixed culture cheese samples (p < 0.0001), b. animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 being  the most sensitive to the presence of other strains. however, all probiotic strains did retain their viability (log 9 cfu/g of cheese) throughout ripening. this study was successful in monitoring living probiotic species in cheddar cheese samples through pma-qpcr.

TI  == fatty acid profile, trans-octadecenoic, alpha-linolenic and conjugated linoleic acid contents differing in certified organic and conventional probiotic fermented milks.
AB  == development of dairy organic probiotic fermented products is of great interest as they associate ecological practices and benefits of probiotic bacteria. as organic management practices of cow milk production allow modification of the fatty acid composition of milk (as compared to conventional milk), we studied the influence of the type of milk on some characteristics of fermented milks, such as acidification kinetics, bacterial counts and fatty acid content. conventional and organic probiotic fermented milks were produced using bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis hn019 in co-culture with streptococcus thermophilus ta040 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus lb340. the use of organic milk led to a higher acidification rate and cultivability of lactobacillus bulgaricus. fatty  acids profile of organic fermented milks showed higher amounts of trans-octadecenoic acid (c18:1, 1.6 times) and polyunsaturated fatty acids, including cis-9 trans-11, c18:2 conjugated linoleic (cla-1.4 times), and alpha-linolenic acids (ala-1.6 times), as compared to conventional fermented milks. these higher levels were the result of both initial percentage in the milk and increase during acidification, with no further modification during storage. finally, use of bifidobacteria slightly increased cla relative content in the conventional fermented milks, after 7 days of storage at 4 degrees c, whereas no  difference was seen in organic fermented milks.

AB  == the 67 kda myosin-cross-reactive antigen (mcra) is a member of the mcra family of proteins present in a wide range of bacteria and was predicted to have fatty acid isomerase function. we have now characterised the catalytic activity of mcras from four lab stains, including lactobacillus rhamnosus lgg, l. plantarum st-iii, l. acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12. mcra genes  from these strains were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein function was analysed with lipid profiles by gc-ms. the four  mcras catalysed the conversion of linoleic acid and oleic acid to their respective 10-hydroxy derivatives, which suggests that mcra proteins catalyse the first step in conjugated linoleic acid production. this is the first report of mcra from l. rhamnosus with such catalytic function.

AB  == thirty-four strains of lactic acid bacteria (seven bifidobacterium, 11 lactobacillus, six lactococcus, and 10 streptococcus thermophilus) were assayed in vitro for antioxidant activity against ascorbic and linolenic acid oxidation (taa(aa) and taa(la)), trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (teac), intracellular glutathione (tgsh), and superoxide dismutase (sod). wide dispersion of each of taa(aa), taa(la), teac, tgsh, and sod occurred within bacterial groups, indicating that antioxidative properties are strain specific. the strains bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis dsmz 23032, lactobacillus acidophilus dsmz 23033, and lactobacillus brevis dsmz 23034 exhibited among the highest taa(aa), taa(la), teac, and tgsh values within the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. these  strains were used to prepare a potentially antioxidative probiotic formulation, which was administered to rats at the dose of 10(7), 10(8), and 10(9) cfu/day for 18 days. the probiotic strains colonized the colon of the rats during the trial and promoted intestinal saccharolytic metabolism. the analysis of plasma antioxidant activity, reactive oxygen molecules level, and glutathione concentration, revealed that, when administered at doses of at least 10(8) cfu/day, the antioxidant mixture effectively reduced doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress. probiotic strains which are capable to limit excessive amounts  of reactive radicals in vivo may contribute to prevent and control several diseases associated with oxidative stress.

TI  == a protective effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 against eczema in the first  2 years of life persists to age 4 years.
AB  == background: using a double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial (australian  new zealand clinical trials registry: actrn12607000518460), we have shown that in a high risk birth cohort, maternal supplementation from 35 weeks gestation until  6 months if breastfeeding and infant supplementation until 2 years with lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 (hn001) (6 x 10(9) cfu/day) halved the cumulative prevalence of eczema by age 2 years. bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis hn019  (hn019) (9 x 10(9) cfu/day) had no effect. objective: the aim of this study was to investigate the associations of hn001 and hn019 with allergic disease and atopic sensitization among these children at age 4 years, 2 years after stopping  probiotic supplementation. methods: the presence (uk working party's diagnostic criteria) and severity scoring atopic dermatitis (scorad) of eczema and atopy (skin prick tests) and parent-reported symptoms of asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis were assessed using standard protocols and questions. results: four-hundred and seventy-four infants were eligible at birth of whom 425 (90%) participated in this follow-up. the cumulative prevalence of eczema by 4 years (hazard ratio (hr) 0.57 (95% ci 0.39-0.83)) and prevalence of rhinoconjunctivitis at 4 years (relative risk 0.38 (95% ci 0.18-0.83)) were significantly reduced in the children taking hn001; there were also nonsignificant reductions in the cumulative prevalence of scorad >/= 10 (hr 0.74 (95% ci 0.52-1.05), wheeze (hr 0.79 (95% ci 0.59-1.07)) and atopic sensitization (hr = 0.72 (95% ci 0.48-1.06)). hn019 did not affect the prevalence of any outcome. conclusions and clinical relevance: this study showed that the protective effect of hn001 against eczema,  when given for the first 2 years of life only, extended to at least 4 years of age. this, together with our findings for a protective effect against rhinoconjunctivitis, suggests that this probiotic might be an appropriate preventative intervention for high risk infants.

TI  == gut balance, a synbiotic supplement, increases fecal lactobacillus paracasei but  has little effect on immunity in healthy physically active individuals.
AB  == synbiotic supplements, which contain multiple functional ingredients, may enhance the immune system more than the use of individual ingredients alone. a double blind active controlled parallel trial over a 21 d exercise training period was conducted to evaluate the effect of gut balance, which contains lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (l. casei 431(r)), bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis (bb-12(r)), lactobacillus acidophilus (la-5(r)), lactobacillus rhamnosus (lgg(r)), two prebiotics (raftiline and raftilose) and bovine whey derived lactoferrin and immunoglobulins with acacia gum on fecal microbiota, short chain  fatty acids (scfa), gut permeability, salivary lactoferrin and serum cytokines. all subjects randomized were included in the analysis. there was a 9-fold (1.2-fold to 64-fold; 95% confidence intervals p = 0.03) greater increase in fecal l. paracasei numbers with gut balance compared with acacia gum supplementation. gut balance was associated with a 50% (-12% to 72%; p = 0.02) smaller increase in the concentration of serum il-16 in comparison to acacia gum  from pre- to post-study. no substantial effects of either supplement were evident in fecal scfa concentrations, measures of mucosal immunity or gi permeability. clinical studies are now required to determine whether gut balance may exert beneficial gi health effects by increasing the recovery of fecal l. paracasei. both supplements had little effect on immunity. twenty two healthy physically active male subjects (mean age = 33.9 +/- 6.5y) were randomly allocated to either daily prebiotic or synbiotic supplementation for 21 d. saliva, blood, urine and fecal samples were collected pre-, mid and post-intervention. participants recorded patterns of physical activity on a self-reported questionnaire.

TI  == assessment of dietary supplementation with probiotics on performance, intestinal  morphology and microflora of chickens infected with eimeria tenella.
AB  == we evaluated the effects of dietary supplementation with different preparations of probiotics on the performance of broiler chickens experimentally infected with 2 x 10(4) sporulated oocysts of eimeria tenella at 14 days of age. three hundred, day-old, cobb-500 chicks, as hatched, were separated into 10 equal groups with three replicates. two of the groups, one challenged with e. tenella oocysts and the other not, were given a basal diet and served as controls without medication. the other challenged groups were given the anticoccidial lasalocid (60 mg/kg) or  enterococcus faecium (5 x 10(8) or 5 x 10(9)cfu/kg feed), bifidobacterium animalis (5 x 10(8)cfu/kg feed), lactobacillus reuteri (5 x 10(8)cfu/kg feed), bacillus subtilis (5 x 10(8)cfu/kg feed), or a multi-species probiotic mix at 5 x 10(8) or 5 x 10(9)cfu/kg feed, respectively. the trial lasted 6 weeks. individual body weight, feed intake per pen and feed conversion ratio values were recorded weekly, along with the extent of bloody diarrhea, excreta oocyst numbers and bird mortality. caecal lesions were assessed and intestinal samples were taken for histopathological and bacteriological evaluation from ileum and caecum. overall growth performance of chickens fed the multi-species probiotic mix at both levels was higher (p<0.05) compared to the infected control. overall oocyst shedding was lowest (p<0.05) in the lasalocid supplemented group. villous height was higher (p<0.05) in bacillus supplemented groups compared to infected controls. the lactobacillus supplemented group had the highest (p<0.05) numbers of both lactobacillus and bifidobacterium in ileum and caecum. in conclusion, dietary probiotics are promising for further investigation on improving intestinal health and growth performance of broiler chickens experimentally challenged with e. tenella.

TI  == probiotics in milk replacer influence lamb immune function and meat quality.
AB  == this study was undertaken to assess the effect of milk replacer (mr) containing lactobacillus acidophilus and a mix of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis and bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum on lamb immune response and on lamb meat quality. a 6-week-trial was conducted on 40 male comisana lambs, divided into four groups, fed maternal milk (mm), mr, mr with l. acidophilus supplementation (mrl) and mr with a mix (1 : 1) of b. animalis subsp. lactis and b. longum subsp. longum supplementations (mrb). lambs fed mr containing a mix of bifidobacteria showed the highest in vivo cellular immune response to phytohemagglutinin, whereas mm and mrb showed the highest antibody response to ovalbumin. at day 11 of the trial, mrl displayed the highest value of interleukin-10; differences disappeared among groups subsequently. blood cholesterol levels in lambs fed mr containing l. acidophilus was almost halved compared with that found in mm and mr groups. meat from artificially reared lambs was characterized by trans-11 18:1 and total conjugated 18:2n-6, whereas meat from the dam-suckled lambs was characterized by 14:0, cis-9 14:1 and 16:0. polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio was higher in meat of mr, mrl and mrb than in mm lambs. meat from artificially reared lamb fed mr containing probiotics showed an improved fatty acid profile for human diet.

TI  == rapid and accurate bacterial identification in probiotics and yoghurts by maldi-tof mass spectrometry.
AB  == probiotic food is manufactured by adding probiotic strains simultaneously with starter cultures in fermentation tanks. here, we investigate the accuracy and feasibility of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) for bacterial identification at the species level in  probiotic food and yoghurts. probiotic food and yoghurts were cultured in columbia and lactobacillus specific agar and tested by quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) for the detection and quantification of lactobacillus sp. bacterial identification was performed by maldi-tof analysis and by amplification and sequencing of tuf and 16s rdna genes. we tested 13 probiotic food and yoghurts and we identified by qpcr that they presented 10(6) to 10(7) copies of lactobacillus spp. dna/g. all products contained very large numbers of living bacteria varying from 10(6) to 10(9) colony forming units/g. these bacteria were  identified as lactobacillus casei, lactococcus lactis, bifidobacterium animalis,  lactobacillus delbrueckii, and streptococcus thermophilus. maldi-tof ms presented 92% specificity compared to the molecular assays. in one product we found l. lactis, instead of bifidus spp. which was mentioned on the label and for another  l. delbrueckii and s. thermophilus instead of bifidus spp. maldi-tof ms allows a  rapid and accurate bacterial identification at the species level in probiotic food and yoghurts. although the safety and functionality of probiotics are species and strain dependent, we found a discrepancy between the bacterial strain announced on the label and the strain identified. practical application: maldi-tof ms is rapid and specific for the identification of bacteria in probiotic food and yoghurts. although the safety and functionality of probiotics  are species and strain dependent, we found a discrepancy between the bacterial strain announced on the label and the strain identified.

AB  == a randomized clinical trial studied the effects of early administration of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 (bb-12) on oral colonization of (1)  mutans streptococci (ms), and (2) bb-12. in this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, infants (n = 106) received probiotic bacteria (bb-12 group), xylitol (x group), or sorbitol (s group). test tablets were administered twice a day (from the age of 1-2 months) with a novel slow-release pacifier or a spoon (daily dose  of bb-12 10(10) cfu, polyol 200-600 mg). samples were collected from mucosa/teeth at the age of 8 months and 2 years for bb- 12 determination (qpcr) and plate culturing of ms (msb, tycsb), lactobacilli (rogosa) and yeasts (sabouraud). the ms levels of the mothers were determined (dentocult sm strip mutans). the baseline characteristics of the three groups were similar. mean duration of tablet delivery was 14.9 +/- 6.7 months. in all groups, >90% of the mothers showed high ms counts (log cfu >/=5). ms colonization percentages of the children at the age of 2 years were rather low (bb-12 group: 6%; x group: 31%; s group: 10%; p < 0.05). the levels of lactobacilli and yeasts did not differ between the  groups. bb-12 cell counts barely exceeding the detection limit were found in three of the oral samples of the 8-month-old children; however, the 2-year samples did not contain bb-12. the early administration of bb-12 did not result in permanent oral colonization of this probiotic or significantly affect ms colonization in the children.

TI  == fibers from fruit by-products enhance probiotic viability and fatty acid profile  and increase cla content in yoghurts.
AB  == this study evaluated the effect of the supplementation of total dietary fiber from apple, banana or passion fruit processing by-products on the post-acidification, total titratable acidity, bacteria counts and fatty acid profiles in skim milk yoghurts co-fermented by four different probiotics strains: lactobacillus acidophilus l10 and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bl04, hn019 and b94. apple and banana fibers increased the probiotic viability during shelf-life. all the fibers were able to increase the short chain and polyunsaturated fatty acid contents of yoghurts compared to their respective controls. a synergistic effect between the type of fiber and the probiotic strain on the conjugated linoleic acid content was observed, and the amount of alpha-linolenic acid was increased by banana fiber. the results of this study demonstrate, for the first time, that fruit fibers can improve the fatty acid profile of probiotic yoghurts and point out the suitability of using fibers from  fruit processing the by-products to develop new high value-added fermented dairy  products.

TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and bifidobacterium animalis mb5 induce intestinal but not systemic antigen-specific hyporesponsiveness in ovalbumin-immunized rats.
AB  == probiotics may modulate the host immune response by mechanisms not yet fully understood. we evaluated the modulation of intestinal and systemic antigen-specific immune response by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg) or bifidobacterium animalis mb5 in tolerized and immunized rats. three groups of rats received orally lgg, b. animalis, or pbs (control) for 28 d. each group was  divided into two subgroups of tolerized or immunized rats receiving orally ovalbumin (ova; 7 mg) or pbs on d 7, 9, and 11. all rats were immunized with ova  (300 mug) on d 14 and 21. in tolerized rats, the ova-induced proliferative response of mesenteric lymph nodes (mln) and spleen cells did not differ from control, indicating that the two probiotics maintained the tolerance. lgg and b.  animalis in immunized rats reduced the ova-induced proliferative response in mln  (p < 0.01) but not in spleen, whereas the proliferative response to anti-cd3 and  concanavalin a of mln and spleen cells as well as the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction were not affected by probiotic treatment, indicating ova-specific hyporesponsiveness restricted to intestinal immunity. this hyporesponsiveness was associated with cd4+cd25+foxp3+ t cell expansion (p < 0.01) and increased il-10 and tgfbeta after lgg (p < 0.05), and increased apoptosis after b. animalis (p < 0.001) in mln. in conclusion, we report a novel  activity of lgg and b. animalis in inducing ova-specific hyporesponsiveness in mln of ova-immunized rats that can be useful for a therapeutic strategy to prevent undesirable reactions to immunogenic antigens in the gut.

TI  == effect of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on lipid profiles in pregnant women: a randomized controlled clinical trial.
AB  == background: due to enhanced fat storage primarily during the mid-pregnancy period, pregnancy is associated with elevated levels of lipid profiles. to our knowledge, no reports are available indicating the effects of probiotic yoghurt consumption on serum lipid profiles in pregnant women. objective: this study was  designed to determine the effects of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on lipid profiles of iranian pregnant women. methods: this randomized single-blinded controlled clinical trial was performed among 70 pregnant women, primigravida, aged 18-30 years old who were carrying singleton pregnancy at their third trimester. subjects were randomly assigned to consume 200 g/d of conventional (n=33) or the probiotic group (n=37) for 9 weeks. the probiotic yoghurt was a commercially available product prepared with the starter cultures of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus, enriched with probiotic  culture of two strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus acidophilus la5) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium animalis bb12) with a total of min 1 x 10(7) colony-forming units. the conventional yoghurt contained the starter cultures of  s. thermophilus and l. bulgaricus. fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after 9-weeks intervention to measure serum lipid profiles. results: although consumption of probiotic yogurt for 9 weeks had been resulted in a significant reduction in serum total- (-53.7 mg/dl, p=0.001), ldl- (-35.2 mg/dl, p=0.006) and hdl-cholesterol levels (-9.8 mg/dl, p=0.002) as well as serum triglyceride concentrations (-42.8 mg/dl, p=0.029), no significant differences were found comparing probiotic and conventional yogurts in terms of their effect on serum lipid profiles. within-group differences in conventional yogurt group revealed a  significant reduction in hdl-cholesterol levels (-8.4 mg/dl, p=0.005) and borderline significant reduction in serum total cholesterol concentrations (-21.6 mg/dl, p=0.08). conclusion: in conclusion, consumption of probiotic yogurt among  pregnant women could not affect serum lipid profiles as compared to the conventional yogurt.

TI  == the impact of a consortium of fermented milk strains on the gut microbiome of gnotobiotic mice and monozygotic twins.
AB  == understanding how the human gut microbiota and host are affected by probiotic bacterial strains requires carefully controlled studies in humans and in mouse models of the gut ecosystem where potentially confounding variables that are difficult to control in humans can be constrained. therefore, we characterized the fecal microbiomes and metatranscriptomes of adult female monozygotic twin pairs through repeated sampling 4 weeks before, 7 weeks during, and 4 weeks after consumption of a commercially available fermented milk product (fmp) containing a consortium of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, two strains of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris,  and streptococcus thermophilus. in addition, gnotobiotic mice harboring a 15-species model human gut microbiota whose genomes contain 58,399 known or predicted protein-coding genes were studied before and after gavage with all five sequenced fmp strains. no significant changes in bacterial species composition or in the proportional representation of genes encoding known enzymes were observed  in the feces of humans consuming the fmp. only minimal changes in microbiota configuration were noted in mice after single or repeated gavage with the fmp consortium. however, rna-seq analysis of fecal samples and follow-up mass spectrometry of urinary metabolites disclosed that introducing the fmp strains into mice results in significant changes in expression of microbiome-encoded enzymes involved in numerous metabolic pathways, most prominently those related to carbohydrate metabolism. b. animalis subsp. lactis, the dominant persistent member of the fmp consortium in gnotobiotic mice, up-regulates a locus in vivo that is involved in the catabolism of xylooligosaccharides, a class of glycans widely distributed in fruits, vegetables, and other foods, underscoring the importance of these sugars to this bacterial species. the human fecal metatranscriptome exhibited significant changes, confined to the period of fmp consumption, that mirror changes in gnotobiotic mice, including those related to  plant polysaccharide metabolism. these experiments illustrate a translational research pipeline for characterizing the effects of fmps on the human gut microbiome.

TI  == evaluation of chitoligosaccharides effect upon probiotic bacteria.
AB  == the main objective of the present study was to evaluate the antibacterial effect  - through the determination of minimum inhibitory (and lethal) concentrations, as well as the possible prebiotic potential of chitooligosaccharides (cos) - through the determination of growth curves, on bifidobacterium animalis bb12, bifidobacterium animalis bo and lactobacillus acidophilus ki. atomic force microscopy was further used to obtain high resolution images of cos effects upon  the cell morphology. our results demonstrate that cos do not stimulate the growth of those strains, neither the strains are capable of using cos as a primary source of carbon. analysis of morphology when exposed to inhibitory/bactericidal  concentrations, suggested that cos do not exert any direct damage upon the bacteria structure, instead the bacteria are apparently covered by cos, which likely prevent nutrient uptake.

AB  == the consumption of synbiotics, a mixture of probiotics and indigestible food constituents such as dietary fiber, has been reported to reduce colon cancer risk. we investigated the effects of fermented wheat aleurone enriched with the probiotics lactobacillus rhamnosus gg/bifidobacterium animalis supsp. lactis on the gene expression and functional end points related to cellular defence in ht29 and primary human colon cells. aleurone was digested and fermented in vitro with/without probiotics. the resulting fermentation supernatants (fs) were analyzed for concentrations of deoxycholic acid and ammonia. the cells were treated with the fs, and effects on gene expression of catalase, gstp1 and sult2b1, enzyme activity of catalase and glutathione s-transferase as well as h(2)o(2)-induced dna damage were examined. fermentation of aleurone reduced deoxycholic acid concentration by 84%, while the probiotics enhanced this effect. ammonia was increased by fs aleurone, whereas a reduction occurred by the addition of l. rhamnosus gg/b. animalis supsp. lactis 12. gstp1 expression tended to result in an increase by the fs aleurone in both cell types, whereas the probiotics could not additionally increase the effect. catalase was not modulated by fs aleurone enriched with probiotics. only in ht29 cells, expression of sult2b1 was enhanced by fs aleurone. enzyme activity of catalase and glutathione  s-transferase was induced (2-3.6 fold, 72 h) in ht29 cells only. addition of probiotics had no influence on this effect. in ht29 cells, a reduced h(2)o(2)-induced dna damage by the fs aleurone after 48 h, enhanced by the addition of probiotics, was detected. the observed effects could improve detoxification of xenobiotics and therefore may lower colon cancer risk.

TI  == analysis of the human intestinal epithelial cell transcriptional response to lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus salivarius, bifidobacterium lactis and escherichia coli.
AB  == the complex microbial population residing in the human gastrointestinal tract consists of commensal, potential pathogenic and beneficial species, which are probably perceived differently by the host and consequently could be expected to  trigger specific transcriptional responses. here, we provide a comparative analysis of the global in vitro transcriptional response of human intestinal epithelial cells to lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, lactobacillus salivarius ls-33, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 420, and enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 (ehec). interestingly, l. salivarius ls-33 dce-induced changes were overall more similar to those of b. lactis 420 than to l. acidophilus ncfm, which is consistent with previously observed in vivo immunomodulation properties. in the gene ontology and pathway analyses both specific and unspecific changes were observed. common to all was the regulation of apoptosis and adipogenesis, and lipid-metabolism related regulation by the probiotics. specific changes such as regulation of cell-cell adhesion by b. lactis 420, superoxide metabolism by l. salivarius ls-33, and regulation of mapk  pathway by l. acidophilus ncfm were noted. furthermore, fundamental differences were observed between the pathogenic and probiotic treatments in the toll-like receptor pathway, especially for adapter molecules with a lowered level of transcriptional activation of myd88, trif, irak1 and traf6 by probiotics compared to ehec. the results in this study provide insights into the relationship between probiotics and human intestinal epithelial cells, notably with regard to strain-specific responses, and highlight the differences between transcriptional  responses to pathogenic and probiotic bacteria.

AB  == background: obesity is associated with increased health risk and has been associated with alterations in bacterial gut microbiota, with mainly a reduction  in bacteroidetes, but few data exist at the genus and species level. it has been  reported that the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium genus representatives may have a critical role in weight regulation as an anti-obesity effect in experimental models and humans, or as a growth-promoter effect in agriculture depending on the strains. objectives and methods: to confirm reported gut alterations and test whether lactobacillus or bifidobacterium species found in the human gut are associated with obesity or lean status, we analyzed the stools  of 68 obese and 47 controls targeting firmicutes, bacteroidetes, methanobrevibacter smithii, lactococcus lactis, bifidobacterium animalis and seven species of lactobacillus by quantitative pcr (qpcr) and culture on a lactobacillus-selective medium. findings: in qpcr, b. animalis (odds ratio (or)=0.63; 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.39-1.01; p=0.056) and m. smithii (or=0.76; 95% ci 0.59-0.97; p=0.03) were associated with normal weight whereas lactobacillus reuteri (or=1.79; 95% ci 1.03-3.10; p=0.04) was associated with obesity. conclusion: the gut microbiota associated with human obesity is depleted in m. smithii. some bifidobacterium or lactobacillus species were associated with normal weight (b. animalis) while others (l. reuteri) were associated with obesity. therefore, gut microbiota composition at the species level is related to body weight and obesity, which might be of relevance for further studies and the  management of obesity. these results must be considered cautiously because it is  the first study to date that links specific species of lactobacillus with obesity in humans.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of gastrointestinal survival of lactobacillus amylovorus dsm  16698 alone and combined with galactooligosaccharides, milk and/or bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12.
AB  == probiotic properties of lactobacillus amylovorus dsm 16698 were previously demonstrated in piglets. here, its potential as a human probiotic was studied in  vitro, using the tim-1 system, which is fully validated to simulate the human upper gastrointestinal tract. to evaluate the effect of the food matrix composition on the survival of l. amylovorus dsm 16698 in tim-1, the microorganism was inoculated alone or with prebiotic galactooligosaccharides (gos), partially skimmed milk (psm) and/or commercial probiotic bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 (bb-12). samples were collected from tim-1 for six hours, at one-hour intervals and l. amylovorus populations were enumerated on mrs agar plates with confirmation of identity of selected isolates by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) fingerprinting. the cumulative survival for l. amylovorus alone (control) was 30% at the end of the experiment (t=6h). co-administration of l. amylovorus with gos, psm and/or bb-12 increased its survival in comparison with the control significantly from the 4th hour after ingestion onwards (p<0.05). furthermore, by the use of high performance anion exchange chromatography, both l. amylovorus and bb-12 were observed to promptly degrade gos compounds in samples collected from tim-1, as assessed at t=2h. hence, food matrix composition interfered with survival and growth of l. amylovorus during passage through tim-1, providing leads towards optimization of  probiotic properties in vivo.

TI  == incorporation of probiotic bacteria in whey cheese: decreasing the risk of microbial contamination.
AB  == for dairy products that are consumed fresh, contamination by spoilage microorganisms and pathogens from the environment is a major concern. contamination has been associated with a number of outbreaks of foodborne illnesses; however, consistent data pertaining to the microbial safety of whey cheeses specifically have not been reported. hence, the goals of this research effort were (i) to manufacture a probiotic whey cheese with bifidobacterium animalis and lactobacillus casei and (ii) to assess the antimicrobial activity of these probiotics against a set of foodborne pathogens (listeria innocua, salmonella enteritidis, and staphylococcus aureus) and food spoilage microorganisms (pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli). three ranges of these microbial contaminants were used for inoculation of cheeses: 10(3) to 10(4), 10(4) to 10(6), and 10(6) to 10(8) cfu/g. inoculation in plain culture medium served as a control. the inhibition produced by the probiotics was calculated, and the major effect was found to be bacteriostatic. in specific cases, full inhibition was observed, i.e., by b. animalis against p. aeruginosa and by l. casei against salmonella enteritidis and l. innocua. conversely, the least inhibition was detected for l. casei against p. aeruginosa. our results suggest that use of these probiotic strains can extend the shelf life of whey cheeses and make them safer by delaying or preventing growth of common contaminant bacteria.

TI  == screening of species-specific lactic acid bacteria for veal calves multi-strain probiotic adjuncts.
AB  == the selection of promising specific species of lactic acid bacteria with potential probiotic characteristics is of particular interest in producing multi  species-specific probiotic adjuncts in veal calves rearing. the aim of the present work was to select and evaluate in vitro the functional activity of lactic acid bacteria, bifidobacterium longum and bacillus coagulans strains isolated from veal calves in order to assess their potential use as multi species-specific probiotics for veal calves. for this purpose, bacterial strains  isolated from faeces collected from 40 healthy 50-day-calves, were identified by  riboprinter and 16s rrna gene sequence. the most frequent strains belonged to the species b. longum, streptococcus bovis, lactobacillus animalis and streptococcus  macedonicus. among these, 7 strains were chosen for testing their probiotic characteristics in vitro. three strains, namely l. animalis sb310, lactobacillus  paracasei subsp. paracasei sb137 and b. coagulans sb117 showed varying individual but promising capabilities to survive in the gastrointestinal tract, to adhere, to produce antimicrobial compounds. these three selected species-specific bacteria demonstrated in vitro, both singularly and mixed, the functional properties needed for their use as potential probiotics in veal calves.

TI  == effect of kynurenic acid on the viability of probiotics in vitro.
AB  == probiotics are bacteria that are commercially available as dietary supplements. one of the important properties of probiotics is their ability to survive in the  intestine. recent evidence has identified kynurenic acid (kyna) as a bactericidal constituent of intestinal fluid. these data led us to study the influence of kyna on the viability of selected probiotics. we found that kyna supported the growth  of bacteria in the probiotics acidolac (lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium) and lakcid forte (lactobacillus rhamnosus) or retarded the growth of bacteria from the acidolac, biogaia (lactobacillus reuteri protectis),  dicoflor (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg), lacium (lactobacillus plantarum) and trilac (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis) probiotics depending on its concentration. kyna did not affect the viability of bacteria from the probiotic linex (lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12). our results suggest a potential role of kyna in the regulation of bacterial growth in the digestive system.

TI  == use of tuf gene-based primers for the pcr detection of probiotic bifidobacterium  species and enumeration of bifidobacteria in fermented milk by cultural and quantitative real-time pcr methods.
AB  == due to the increasing use of bifidobacteria in probiotic products, it is essential to establish a rapid method for the qualitative and quantitative assay  of the bifidobacteria in commercial products. in this study, partial sequences of the tuf gene for 18 bifidobacterium strains belonging to 14 species were determined. alignment of these sequences showed that the similarities among these bifidobacterium species were 82.24% to 99.72%. based on these tuf gene sequences, 6 primer sets were designed for the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay of b. animalis subsp. animalis, b. animalis subsp. lactis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. longum subsp. infantis, b. longum subsp. longum, and the genus of bifidobacterium, respectively. these bifidobacterium species are common probiotic species present in dairy and probiotic products. when each target bifidobacterium spp. was assayed with the designed primers, pcr product with expected size was generated. in addition, for each target species, more than 70 bacterial strains other than the target species, including strains of other bifidobacterium species, strains of lactobacillus spp., enterococcus spp., and other bacterial species, all generated negative results. pcr assay with primers specific to b. animalis subsp. lactis and b. longum subsp. longum confirmed the presence of these bifidobacterium species in commercial yogurt products. in addition, for each product, enumeration of the bifidobacteria cells by culture method with bim-25 agar and the quantitative real-time pcr showed similar cell counts. such results indicated that within 15-d storage (4 degrees c) after manufacture, all the bifidobacteria cells originally present in yogurt products were viable and culturable during the storage.

TI  == a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial with lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis.
AB  == background and aims: to investigate the clinical effect of treatment with lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 (probio-tec ab-25) to maintain remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. methods: patients with left-sided ulcerative colitis in remission - including proctitis and at least one relapse within the last year were randomised (2:1) in  a double-blind placebo-controlled study to probio-tec ab-25 or placebo for 52 weeks. the patients were evaluated clinically, endoscopically and histologically  at entry and if relapsing. no other medication for ulcerative colitis than the study drug was allowed during the study. primary endpoint was maintenance of clinical remission, secondary endpoints comparisons of days to relapse, and safety and tolerability of the study drug. the concentrations of the probiotic bacterial strains in stool were analysed in a subset of patients. results: thirty-two patients were randomised. twenty patients received probio-tec ab-25 and twelve patients received placebo. five patients (25%) in the probio-tec ab-25 group and one patient (8%) in the placebo group maintained remission after 1 year of treatment (p=0.37). the median time to relapse was 125.5days (range 11-391 days) in the probiotic group and 104 days (range 28-369 days) in the placebo group respectively, (p=0.683). probio-tec ab-25 was overall well tolerated. conclusions: in this small randomised placebo-controlled trial no significant clinical benefit of probio-tec ab-25 could be demonstrated in comparison with placebo for maintaining remission in patients with left-sided ulcerative colitis. a difference may be achieved in larger studies, but the clinical significance of  this would be questionable. this study was registered in clinicaltrial.gov (nct00268164).

TI  == probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus downregulates fcer1 and hrh4 expression in human mast cells.
AB  == aim: to investigate the effects of four probiotic bacteria and their combination  on human mast cell gene expression using microarray analysis. methods: human peripheral-blood-derived mast cells were stimulated with lactobacillus rhamnosus  (l. rhamnosus) gg (lgg((r))), l. rhamnosus lc705 (lc705), propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js (pjs) and bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb12 (bb12) and their combination for 3 or 24 h, and were subjected to global microarray analysis using an affymetrix genechip((r)) human genome u133 plus 2.0  array. the gene expression differences between unstimulated and bacteria-stimulated samples were further analyzed with gorilla gene enrichment analysis and visualization tool and mev multiexperiment viewer-tool. results: lgg and lc705 were observed to suppress genes that encoded allergy-related high-affinity ige receptor subunits alpha and gamma (fcer1a and fcer1g, respectively) and histamine h4 receptor. lgg, lc705 and the combination of four probiotics had the strongest effect on the expression of genes involved in mast cell immune system regulation, and on several genes that encoded proteins with a  pro-inflammatory impact, such as interleukin (il)-8 and tumour necrosis factor alpha. also genes that encoded proteins with anti-inflammatory functions, such as il-10, were upregulated. conclusion: certain probiotic bacteria might diminish mast cell allergy-related activation by downregulation of the expression of high-affinity ige and histamine receptor genes, and by inducing a pro-inflammatory response.

TI  == impact of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 and, lactobacillus acidophilus la-5-containing yoghurt, on fecal bacterial counts of healthy adults.
AB  == this randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, parallel dose-response study investigated the impact of 4-week commercial yoghurt consumption supplemented with bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (bb-12) and lactobacillus acidophilus (la-5) on fecal bacterial counts of healthy adults. fifty-eight volunteers were randomly assigned to three different groups: 1. placebo (no probiotic, no starter and no green tea extract); 2. yoptimal (10(9)cfu/100g of bb-12 and la-5 and 40mg  of green tea extract) and 3. yoptimal-10 (10(10)cfu/100g of bb-12, 10(9)cfu/100g  of la-5 and 40mg of green tea extract). these yoghurt products also contained lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (10(7)cfu/100g) and streptococcus thermophilus (10(10)cfu/100g). the quantitative pcr (qpcr) results showed that there were significant increases (p=0.02) in bifidobacteria counts with the yoptimal treatment as compared to baseline. the fecal numbers of b. animalis subsp. lactis and la-5 significantly increased in the two probiotic treatments compared to the placebo treatment. viable counts of fecal lactobacilli were significantly higher (p=0.05) and those of enterococci were significantly lower (p=0.04) after the intervention when compared to placebo. no significant difference was observed between treatments in volunteers' weight, waist girth, blood pressure, fasting plasma triglyceride and hdl-c concentrations, as well as  cholesterol/hdl-cholesterol ratio. however, a significant increase in plasma cholesterol levels was observed in the placebo group (p=0.0018) but the levels remained stable in the two probiotic yoghurt groups. these results show that probiotic strains supplemented in the form of yoghurt remain active during gut transit and are associated with an increase in beneficial bacteria and a reduction in potentially pathogenic bacteria. this trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as nct00730626.

TI  == beneficial effects of a synbiotic supplement on self-perceived gastrointestinal well-being and immunoinflammatory status of healthy adults.
AB  == the use of synbiotics as health promoters is still poorly defined, and human intervention studies are scarce. this study was designed to evaluate the effects  of a commercialized synbiotic product containing lactobacillus acidophilus la5, bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, streptococcus thermophilus, and fructooligosaccharides on the self-reported gastrointestinal well-being and the immunoinflammatory status of healthy human subjects. in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 20 women and 16 men (25-45 years old) received either three tablets per day of the synbiotic product (2.4 x 10(9) colony-forming units/day) or placebo during 6 weeks. gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel habits were evaluated through a self-administered questionnaire. in those subjects suffering from any kind of digestive disturbance (mild dyspepsia,  flatulence, postprandial bloating, constipation, etc.), improvements in symptoms  after product consumption were also evaluated. blood lymphocyte subsets, phagocytic activity, serum c-reactive protein, ceruloplasmin, and adhesion molecules concentrations were analyzed prior and after treatment. a significant improvement in overall self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel habit was found in the synbiotic group. a marginal effect of treatment (analysis of variance p = .050) was observed with l-selectin, which showed a significant decrease in the synbiotic group (p = .019). in addition, basal l-selectin levels  correlated with final intercellular adhesion molecule (icam)-1 levels (r = 0.468; p = .050), and basal icam-1 levels tended to correlate negatively with final l-selectin concentration (r = -0.457; p = .056). none of these correlations was found in the placebo group. the rest of the immunological parameters studied were not modified by the intervention. in conclusion, consumption of the synbiotic product improves self-perceived bowel habits and might facilitate a better profile of adhesion molecules in healthy adults.

TI  == predominant genera of fecal microbiota in children with atopic dermatitis are not altered by intake of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bi-07.
AB  == the effect of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium lactis bi-07 on the composition of the lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium and the total bacterial population in feces from young children with atopic dermatitis was investigated. the study included 50 children randomized to intake of one of the probiotic strain or placebo. microbial composition was characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, quantitative pcr and, in a subset of subjects, by pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna  gene. the core population of the lactobacillus group was identified as lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, leuconostoc mesenteroides, while the bifidobacterial community included bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium catenulatum. the fecal numbers of l. acidophilus and b. lactis increased significantly after intervention, indicating survival of the ingested bacteria. the levels of bifidobacterium correlated positively (p=0.03), while the levels of the lactobacillus group negatively (p=0.01) with improvement of atopic eczema evaluated by the severity scoring of atopic dermatitis index. this correlation was observed across the whole study cohort and not attributed to the probiotic intake. the main conclusion of the study is that administration of l. acidophilus ncfm and b. lactis bi-07 does not affect the composition and diversity of the main bacterial populations in feces.

TI  == the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis is increased following probiotic administration to preterm pigs.
AB  == preterm birth and necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) is associated with inappropriate gut colonization and immunity, which may be improved by probiotic bacteria. using a preterm pig model of nec, we investigated the effects of probiotics on intestinal structure, function, microbiology, and immunology in the immediate postnatal period. just after birth, caesarean-delivered preterm pigs were inoculated with lactobacillus paracasei, bifidobacteria animalis, and streptococcus thermophilus (total 2.4 x 10(10)/d) either as live (prolive, n = 14) or gamma-irradiated dead bacteria (prodead, n = 12) and compared with controls (n = 14). all pigs received parenteral nutrition for 2 d followed by enteral formula feeding until tissue collection on d 5. compared with control pigs, intestinal weight was lower and nec incidence was higher in both groups given probiotics (64-67 vs. 14%; p<0.01). hexose absorption, brush border enzyme  activities, and gut barrier function were lower in the prodead group compared with the other groups (p < 0.05), whereas live probiotics induced higher expression of the proinflammatory cytokines il-1alpha and il-6 (p < 0.05). probiotics minimally affected gut colonization, except that live probiotics induced a higher density of b. animalis and lower bacterial diversity in the distal intestinal mucosa and lower scfa concentrations in the colon (p < 0.05). the detrimental effects of probiotic bacteria in this study may relate to the specific strain and dose combination and may have involved the very immature gut  immune system and low nec incidence in the control group. it remains to be determined whether similar adverse responses to probiotics occur in preterm infants.

TI  == persistence of probiotic strains in the gastrointestinal tract when administered  as capsules, yoghurt, or cheese.
AB  == most clinical studies of probiotics use freeze-dried, powdered bacteria or bacteria packed in capsules. however, probiotics are commercially available in various food matrices, which may affect their persistence in the gastrointestinal tract. the objective of the study was to compare oral and faecal recovery during  and after administration of a combination of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lc705, propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii js, and bifidobacterium  animalis subsp. lactis bb12 as capsules, yoghurt, or cheese. this randomized, parallel-group, open-label trial (n=36) included a 4-week run-in, 2-week intervention, and 3-week follow-up period. participants consumed 10(10)cfu/day of probiotic combination and provided saliva and faecal samples before, during, and  after the intervention. strain-specific real-time pcr was used to quantify the strains. l. rhamnosus gg was the only probiotic strain regularly recovered in saliva samples. during the intervention period it was recovered in the saliva of  88% of the volunteers at least once. no difference was found between the yoghurt  and cheese groups. at the end of the intervention, l. rhamnosus gg and lc705 counts were high in faecal samples of all product groups (8.08 and 8.67log(10) genome copies/g, respectively). there was no matrix effect on strain quantity in  faeces or the recovery time after ceasing the intervention. for p. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii js and b. animalis subsp. lactis bb12, a matrix effect was found at the end of the intervention (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively) and in the recovery time during follow-up (p<0.05 for both). yoghurt yielded the highest faecal quantity of js and bb12 strains (8.01 and 9.89log(10) genome copies/g, respectively). the results showed that the administration matrix did not influence the faecal quantity of lactobacilli, but affected faecal counts of propionibacteria and bifidobacteria that were lower when consumed in cheese. thus, the consumption of probiotics in yoghurt matrix is highly suitable for studying potential health benefits and capsules provide a comparable means of administration when the viability of the strain in the capsule product is confirmed.

TI  == impact of probiotic supplementation on mortality of induced 1,2-dimethylhydrazine carcinogenesis in a mouse model.
AB  == rationale: probiotic bacterial strains have been increasingly used in clinical practice as many health benefits result from their use. however, severe side effects such as bacteremia and fungemia have been reported in inmunocompromised patients and those with chronic disease. objective: the purpose of this study was to report the impact of probiotic supplementation on the mortality of mice undergoing carcinogenesis induction with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh). methods: two treatment protocols were used. in experiment 1, lactobacillus delbrueckii ufv-h2b20, bifidobacterium animalis var. lactis bb12, and saccharomyces boulardii were added to the drinking water, to control mice and those undergoing injections of dmh daily. probiotic supplementation was started 1 wk before and continued throughout the 6 wk of dmh injections. in experiment 2, the same probiotics were  administered daily, except on the first day that dmh was administered. the mortality of these animals was recorded. bacterial translocation was determined in mice in experiment 1. results: groups with dmh-induced injury treated with lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and the mixture of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria  presented with 40%, 30%, and 60% mortality, respectively. death happened mainly between 48 h and 72 h after the first injection of dmh. on the other hand, no mice in experiment 2 died during the study period. bacteria were found to be translocated to mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. conclusion: supplementation of l. delbrueckii ufv-h2b20 and b. animalis var. lactis bb12 in mice with dmh-induced injury led to death in some animals. the results suggest that increased bacterial translocation was probably related to mortality. these findings are an alert to the potentially severe side effects associated with the  use of probiotics under extremely stressful situations.

AB  == the probiotic properties of commensal bacteria including lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are likely to be determined at least in part by their effects on dendritic cells. like traditional immune stimulants such as lipopolysaccharides (lps), probiotic bacteria promote maturation of cultured human dendritic cells (dc) by inducing elevated expression of mhc-ii and co-stimulatory molecules. different effects have been reported on cytokine induction, especially of major regulatory cytokines such as tnf-alpha, il-12 and il-10. yet, these previous analyses have failed to reveal consistent differences between such effects of probiotics on the one hand, and of lps on the other. selective response markers for probiotics, however, would be important for our understanding of their biological properties and for a rational selection of strains for in vivo studies. in this study, we compared in detail both early and late effects on cultured human dc of 4 different probiotics with those of lps. at the early stages of stimulation, all stimuli induced qualitatively very similar responses in dc at the level of surface markers and secretion of cytokines and chemokines.  a lower immune stimulatory effect was observed by bifidobacterium animalis bb-12  as compared to lactobacilli. late responses, on the other hand, tended to diverge. microarray transcript profiling for 268 cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and their receptors after 2 days of culture revealed various transcripts  to be selectively induced by certain probiotics but not lps. our data indicate that late rather than early dc responses may be helpful to clarify the divergent  biological effects of probiotics on human innate immune responses.

TI  == [probiotic properties of industrial strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria].
AB  == lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from the samples of dry microbial substance "vivolac" and identified. the lactic acid bacteria were identified as lactobacillus acidophilus. l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. paracasei. bifidobacteria belonged to the species bifidobacterium animalis. manifestation of biological activity of all studied strains was investigated. it  was shown, that adhesive activity of the studied strains depended on the genus of the strain: lactobacilli manifested medium adhesiveness to buccal epithelium (medium adhesive index 2.07-2.26), bifidobacteria manifested high adhesiveness (medium adhesive index 4.11-4.76). antagonism against pathogenic and opportunistic reference strains was manifested to a greater extent to pseudomonas aeruginosa. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were resistant to aminoglycosides. sensitivity of the studied strains to antibiotics did not depend on the genus and species of microorganism. lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains were capable  to survive in gastric juice and at different concentration of bile, which is promising for development of probiotic preparations on the basis of these strains.

TI  == dietary supplementation with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria is well tolerated and not associated with adverse events during late pregnancy and early infancy.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria are increasingly being administered to pregnant women and infants with the intention of improving health. although these organisms have a long record of safe use, it is important to identify any adverse effects in potentially vulnerable populations. in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, we evaluated the safety of a bacterial dietary supplement for the prevention of atopy in infants. two strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus salivarius cul61 and lactobacillus paracasei cul08) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis cul34 and bifidobacterium  bifidum cul20) with a total of 1 x 10(10) colony-forming units were administered  daily to women during the last month of pregnancy and to infants aged 0-6 mo. adverse events (ae) were classified according to who international statistical classification of diseases criteria. common symptoms were recorded by regular questionnaires. baseline characteristics of 220 mother-infant dyads in the treatment and 234 in the placebo group were similar. compliance with the trial interventions, loss to follow-up, symptoms, drug usage, infant growth, method of  feeding, visits to the doctor, and mothers' assessment of infant health were similar in the 2 groups. fifteen (6.8%) mothers and 73 (33.2%) infants in the treatment group and 21 (9.0%) mothers and 75 (32.1%) infants in the placebo group reported ae (p = 0.49 and p = 0.84, respectively). severe ae occurred in 18 mothers and 63 infants with a similar frequency in each group. none of the ae were attributed to the intervention. our findings support the safe use of this consortium of organisms during pregnancy and early infancy.

TI  == comparison of in vitro models to study bacterial adhesion to the intestinal epithelium.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the adhesion ability of intestinal bacteria to different in vitro models of intestinal epithelia, and to estimate the suitability of these models and the type of interactions involved. methods and results: the adhesion of probiotic (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb12), commensal (b. animalis iata-a2 and b. bifidum iata-es2) and potentially pathogenic bacteria (e. coli and l. monocytogenes) was determined. the adhesion models used were polycarbonate-well plates, with or without mucin, and different configurations of caco-2 and/or ht29-mtx cell cultures. all bacteria adhered to wells without mucin (2.6-27.3%), the values being highly variable depending on the bacterial strain. adhesion percentages of potentially probiotic bacteria to caco-2 cultures were remarkably lower (p < 0.05) than those to mucin, and more similar to those of pathogenic strains. the lowest adhesion of different bacterial strains was detected on ht29-mtx (0.5-2.3%) cultures and caco-2/ht29-mtx (0.6-3.2%) cocultures, while these values were increased in caco-2 cultures plus mucin. conclusions: the results suggested that bacterial strains exhibit different capacities to adhere to cellular components and several types of mucin present in different models, showing preferences for intestinal muc2. significance and impact of the study: the use of caco-2 cells monolayer plus mucin (type ii) better approaches the physiological characteristics of in vivo situation, providing a reliable and suitable in vitro model to evaluate bacterial adhesion.

TI  == oral treatment with probiotics reduces allergic symptoms in ovalbumin-sensitized  mice: a bacterial strain comparative study.
AB  == background/aim: evidence demonstrating an important role of the intestinal microbiota in the incidence of allergic disorders has led to the concept of using probiotics as possible antiallergic therapy. this study aimed to select a bacterial strain with the best antiallergic treatment effects from a panel of 6 bacterial strains in a mouse model of ovalbumin(ova)-allergic asthma. methods: ova-sensitized balb/c mice were orally administered the bacterial strains bifidobacterium breve m-16v, b. infantis numres251, b. animalis numres252 and numres253, lactobacillus plantarum numres8 and l. rhamnosus numres6. after challenge by ova inhalation in the lungs, the response to methacholine was measured. pulmonary inflammation was assessed by analyzing bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for the presence of eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes and for interleukin 4, interleukin 5, interleukin 10 and interferon-gamma. ova-specific ige, igg1 and igg2a were measured in serum. next, the effect on acute allergic skin reaction was measured after treatment with b. breve m-16v and l. plantarum numres8. results: of the panel of 6 strains, b. breve m-16v and l. plantarum numres8 inhibited (1) the response to methacholine, (2) reduced the number of eosinophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, (3) reduced both ova-specific ige and (4) ova-specific igg1, whereas the other strains did not affect all these parameters simultaneously. b. breve m-16v but not l. plantarum numres8 reduced interleukin 4, interleukin 5 and interleukin 10. furthermore, b.  breve m-16v but not l. plantarum numres8 reduced acute allergic skin reactions to ova. conclusion: b. breve m-16v was identified as the most potent antiallergic strain.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by bifidobacterium longum ipla e44 and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis ipla r1 modify the composition and metabolic activity of human faecal microbiota in ph-controlled batch cultures.
AB  == exopolysaccharides (eps) isolated from two bifidobacterium strains, one of human  intestinal origin (bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum ipla e44) and the other from dairy origin (bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis ipla r1), were subjected to in vitro chemically simulated gastrointestinal digestion, which showed the absence of degradation of both polymers in these conditions. polymers  were then used as carbon sources in ph-controlled faecal batch cultures and compared with the non-prebiotic carbohydrate glucose and the prebiotic inulin to  determine changes in the composition of faecal bacteria. a set of eight fluorescent in situ hybridisation oligonucleotide probes targeting 16s rrna sequences was used to quantify specific groups of microorganisms. growth of the opportunistic pathogen clostridium histolyticum occurred with all carbohydrates tested similarly to that found in negative control cultures without added carbohydrate and was mainly attributed to the culture conditions used rather than enhancement of growth by these substrates. polymers e44 and r1 stimulated growth  of lactobacillus/enterococcus, bifidobacterium, and bacteroides/prevotella in a similar way to that seen with inulin. the eps r1 also promoted growth of the atopobium cluster during the first 24h of fermentation. an increase in acetic and lactic acids was found during early stages of fermentation (first 10-24h) correlating with increases of lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and atopobium. propionic acid concentrations increased in old cultures, which was coincident with the enrichment of clostridium cluster ix in cultures with eps r1 and with the increases in bacteroides in cultures with both microbial eps (r1 and e44) and inulin. the lowest acetic to propionic acid ratio was obtained for eps e44. none  of the carbohydrates tested supported the growth of microorganisms from clostridium clusters xiva+b and iv, results that correlate with the poor butyrate production in the presence of eps. thus, eps synthesized by bifidobacteria from dairy and intestinal origins can modulate the intestinal microbiota in vitro, promoting changes in some numerically and metabolically relevant microbial populations and shifts in the production of short chain fatty acids.

TI  == the effect of pomegranate (punica granatum l.) byproducts and ellagitannins on the growth of human gut bacteria.
AB  == the consumption of pomegranate products leads to a significant accumulation of ellagitannins in the large intestines, where they interact with complex gut microflora. this study investigated the effect of pomegranate tannin constituents on the growth of various species of human gut bacteria. our results showed that pomegranate byproducts and punicalagins inhibited the growth of pathogenic clostridia and staphyloccocus aureus. probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were generally not affected by ellagitannins, while relatively small growth inhibition by ellagic acid likely resulted from decreasing media quality due to the formation of tannin-protein complexes. the effect of pomegranate ellagitannins on bifidobacteria was species- and tannin-dependent. the growth of  bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis was slightly inhibited by punicalagins, punicalins, and ellagic acid. pomx supplementation significantly enhanced the growth of bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium infantis.

TI  == production of exopolysaccharides by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains of  human origin, and metabolic activity of the producing bacteria in milk.
AB  == this work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the eps-producing strains in milk. the strains belong to the species  lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. the molar mass distribution of eps fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some eps from bacteria of food origin. in general, we detected an association between the eps size distribution and the eps-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial eps tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. the main monosaccharide components of the eps under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the  galactose ratio in our human bacterial eps. all eps-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. the lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the eps-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. with respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, l. plantarum h2 and l. rhamnosus e41 and e43r were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the eps-producing streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive  control. therefore, these human eps-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts  in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. this is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of eps isolated from human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == dynamics of fecal microbiota in hospitalized elderly fed probiotic lkm512 yogurt.
AB  == the comprehensive dynamics of intestinal microbiota including uncultured bacteria in response to probiotic consumption have not been well studied. the aims of this study were twofold: firstly to analyze the impact on intestinal microbiota of yogurt fermented by bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis lkm512, lactobacillus  delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus lkm1759, and streptococcus thermophilus lkm1742 (lkm512 yogurt) and placebo fermented by these lactic acid bacterial strains without lkm512; and secondly to investigate the changes in intestinal microbiota  that influence the concentration of pa, one of the beneficial metabolites produced by bacteria in the intestine. the lkm512 yogurt/placebo trial was performed in six hospitalized elderly patients (three men and three women with an average age of 80.3 years) and lasted seven weeks with the following schedule: pre-consumption for one week, lkm512 yogurt consumption for two weeks, washout period for two weeks, and placebo consumption for two weeks. the amount of ingested lkm512 yogurt or placebo was 100 g/day/individual. fecal samples were analyzed using t-rflp and real-time pcr. the t-rflp patterns in five of the six volunteers were changed in a similar fashion by lkm512 yogurt consumption, although these patterns were individually changed following consumption of placebo. it was confirmed that b. animalis subsp. lactis was increased dramatically and lactobacillus spp. tended to be decreased by lkm512 yogurt consumption. some indigenous uncultured bacteria were increased and some decreased by lkm512 yogurt/placebo consumption. the similar changes in the intestinal microbiota of the elderly caused by consumption of the lkm512 yogurt were found to be influenced by the lkm512 strain itself, and not by the lactic acid bacteria in the yogurt. moreover, this study suggests that the increase in intestinal pa concentrations caused by lkm512 yogurt consumption is probably dependent on the lkm512 strain colonizing the intestine.

TI  == quantification of live and dead probiotic bacteria in lyophilised product by real-time pcr and by flow cytometry.
AB  == the basic requirement for probiotic bacteria to be able to exert expected positive effects is to be alive; therefore, appropriate quantification methods are crucial. due to disadvantages of conventional microbiological methods, the bacterial quantification based on the nucleic acid detection is increasingly used. the objective of this study was to evaluate the possibility to use propidium monoazide (pma) in combination with real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method or live/dead baclight viability kit in combination with flow cytometry (fcm) for determination of probiotic bacteria in a lyophilised product  containing lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 and bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12. in addition, the viability of probiotic bacteria in lyophilised product during 3 months storage was investigated. in the product, the results of  real-time pcr quantification of pma-treated cells did not differ significantly from those of non-treated cells, which indicate that most of the bacterial cells  retained the membrane integrity although they have lost the culturability. the results obtained by fcm analysis were comparable with those by pma real-time pcr. in conclusion, the pma real-time pcr and fcm determination of the viability of probiotic bacteria could complement the plate count method which considers only the culturable part of the population.

AB  == the present work investigates some probiotic properties of four different microorganisms (bifidobacterium animalis var. lactis bb-12, escherichia coli emo, lactobacillus casei and saccharomyces boulardii). in vitro and in vivo tests were carried out to compare cell wall hydrophobicity, production of antagonistic substances, survival capacity in the gastrointestinal tract of germ-free mice without pathological consequence, and immune modulation by stimulation of kupffer cells, intestinal siga and il-10 levels. in vitro antagonism against pathogenic bacteria and yeast was only observed for the probiotic bacteria b. animalis and l. casei. the hydrophobic property of the cell wall was higher for b. animalis and e. coli emo, and this property could be responsible for a better ability to colonize the gastrointestinal tract of germ-free mice. higher levels of siga were observed mainly for s. boulardii, followed by e. coli emo and b. animalis, and only s. boulardii induced a significant higher level of il-10. in conclusion, for a probiotic use, s. boulardii presented better characteristics in terms of immunomodulation, and b. animalis and l. casei for antagonistic substance production. the knowledge of the different probiotic properties could be used to  choice the better microorganism depending on the therapeutic or prophylactic application.

AB  == the gastrointestinal environment is a complex interactive system involving the host, ingested dietary components, and numerous microbial species. we hypothesized that isolation and screening of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria adherent to healthy canine gastrointestinal tissue would yield strains with commensal activity in canines. the aims of this study were (1) to isolate a bank  of commensal organisms from the canine gastrointestinal tract; (2) to screen these novel microbial isolates for potential probiotic effects; (3) to select one organism from these screens and test its impact on the canine microbiota. lactic  acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from resected canine gastrointestinal tissue and screened in vitro for putative probiotic activities. murine studies examined  gastrointestinal transit and inhibition of salmonella typhimurium translocation.  one strain was progressed to a canine study where its impact on the gastrointestinal microbiota was determined. of the 420 isolates from the canine gut, 62 strains were characterised as lab. following assessment of the strain bank with regard to ph sensitivity, bile resistance, pathogen inhibition and survival following freeze-drying, four lactobacillus strains and two bifidobacteria strains were selected for further examination. bifidobacterium animalis ahc7 adhered to epithelial cells, transited the murine gastrointestinal  tract to high numbers and significantly reduced s. typhimurium translocation. b.  animalis ahc7 consumption significantly reduced the carriage of clostridia, in particular clostridium difficile, in dogs. this study describes the isolation and screening of canine-derived bacterial strains with commensal traits. the results  demonstrate that b. animalis ahc7 has significant potential for improving canine  gastrointestinal health.

AB  == background: probiotics may protect against inflammatory bowel disease through regulation of lamina propria lymphocytes (lpls) function. data are lacking on possible involvement of intraepithelial lymphocytes (iels). the aim of this study was to investigate whether different probiotic mixtures prevented gut inflammatory disease and the role of both iels and lpls. methods: balb/c mice received 2 probiotic mixtures orally for 3 weeks, as mix1 (lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium longum), or mix2 (lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus thermophilus, and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis). colitis  was induced by intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (tnbs). probiotics in stools were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). colon subpopulations of iels and lpls were assayed by flow cytometry. serum cytokines were measured by cytometric bead array (cba). results: all probiotics colonized the intestine. the 2 mixtures prevented the tnbs-induced intestinal damage, and mix1 was the most effective. the mix1 protection was associated with a reduction in cd4(+) cells of iels and lpls, an increase in gammadeltat cells of iels, and a decrease in gammadeltat cells of lpls. an expansion of t regulatory (treg) cells of iels was induced by mix1 and mix2. both probiotic mixtures inhibited tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha and monocyte chemotactic protein (mcp)-1 production and upregulated interleukin (il)-10. in addition, mix1 prevented the tnbs-induced increase of il-12 and interferon (ifn)-gamma. conclusions: the 2 probiotic mixtures were able to prevent the tnbs-induced colitis; the l. acidophilus and b. longum mixture was the most effective. other than an involvement of lpls, our results report a novel importance of the iels population in probiotic protection.

TI  == evaluation of the passage of lactobacillus gasseri k7 and bifidobacteria from the stomach to intestines using a single reactor model.
AB  == background: probiotic bacteria are thought to play an important role in the digestive system and therefore have to survive the passage from stomach to intestines. recently, a novel approach to simulate the passage from stomach to intestines in a single bioreactor was developed. the advantage of this automated  one reactor system was the ability to test the influence of acid, bile salts and  pancreatin.lactobacillus gasseri k7 is a strain isolated from infant faeces with  properties making the strain interesting for cheese production. in this study, a  single reactor system was used to evaluate the survival of l. gasseri k7 and selected bifidobacteria from our collection through the stomach-intestine passage. results: initial screening for acid resistance in acidified culture media showed a low tolerance of bifidobacterium dentium for this condition indicating low survival in the passage. similar results were achieved with b. longum subsp. infantis whereas b. animalis subsp. lactis had a high survival.these initial results were confirmed in the bioreactor model of the stomach-intestine passage. b. animalis subsp. lactis had the highest survival rate (10%) attaining approximately 5 x 106 cfu ml-1 compared to the other tested  bifidobacteria strains which were reduced by a factor of up to 106. lactobacillus gasseri k7 was less resistant than b. animalis subsp. lactis but survived at cell concentrations approximately 1000 times higher than other bifidobacteria. conclusion: in this study, we were able to show that l. gasseri k7 had a high survival rate in the stomach-intestine passage. by comparing the results with a previous study in piglets we could confirm the reliability of our simulation. of  the tested bifidobacteria strains, only b. animalis subsp. lactis showed acceptable survival for a successful passage in the simulation system.

TI  == enumeration of the contaminating bacterial microbiota in unfermented pasteurized  milks enriched with probiotic bacteria.
AB  == pasteurized and unfermented milks supplemented with probiotic bacteria are appearing on the market. it then becomes a challenge to ascertain the undesirable contamination microbiota in the presence of a largely superior population of probiotic bacteria. a method to enumerate the contaminating microbial microbiota  in such probiotic-enriched milks was developed. the probiotic cultures, lactobacillus rhamnosus lb-immuni-t and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12(r), were added to a pasteurized unfermented milk to reach a minimum of 1 billion cfu per 250 ml portion, as ascertained by plating on de man - rogosa - sharpe (mrs) agar in anaerobic conditions. no growth of b. animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 was noted on plate count agar (pca) or petrifilm plates, and the presence of this culture did not affect standard plate counts (spc) of contaminating bacteria. however, l. rhamnosus formed colonies on pca and petrifilm plates. attempts were thus made to inhibit the growth of the probiotic lactobacilli in pca. the addition of 2% sodium phosphate (sp) or 5% glycerophosphate (gp) inhibited the growth of the lactobacilli in broths, but pin-point colonies of l.  rhamnosus lb-immuni-t nevertheless appeared on pca supplemented with phosphates.  spc could be obtained on pca + 2% sp by only counting the large colonies, but this resulted in a significant (4.4 fold) underestimation of spc values. on petrifilm ac, at dilutions 0 to 2, all colonies were considered as being contaminants, while at dilutions 3 and 4, only large colonies were counted for spc determinations. there was a direct correlation (r2 = 0.99) between spc values with petrifilm in uninoculated milks and those obtained on probiotic-enriched milks. the high correlation obtained over the 102 to 106 cfu/ml range of spc values show that this petrifilm method is appropriate to evaluate the microbiological quality of pasteurized milks enriched with l. rhamnosus lb-immuni-t and b. animalis subsp. lactis bb-12.

AB  == the addition of probiotics to infant formula has been shown to be an efficient way to increase the number of beneficial bacteria in the intestine in order to promote a gut flora resembling that of breast-fed infants. the objective of the present study was to evaluate the safety and tolerance of a combination of two probiotic strains in early infancy. a group of 126 newborns were randomised to receive a prebiotic-containing starter formula supplemented with lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei and bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis or the same formula without probiotics for the first 3 months of life. a total of eighty infants continued the study until they were aged 6 months. growth measurements were taken monthly at healthy baby clinics. diaries were used to monitor behaviour, infections, use of antibiotics, as well as stool characteristics. normal growth occurred in all infants and no statistically significant differences were detected between the probiotics group and the control group for  gain in weight, length and head circumference. infants in the probiotics group produced softer and more frequent stools during the first 3 months of life. no differences were found in crying and sleeping hours, number of parent-diagnosed infections, antibiotic use, visits to the general practitioner and number of adverse events. the use of a prebiotic-containing starter formula supplemented with l. paracasei ssp. paracasei and b. animalis ssp. lactis in early infancy is  safe, well tolerated and has no adverse effects on growth and infant behaviour.

AB  == urinary tract stones are an important clinical problem in human and veterinary medicine. hyperoxaluria is the single strongest promoter of kidney stone formation. the aims of the present study were to (a) evaluate oxalate degradation by a range of bifidobacteria species and lactobacillus species isolated from the  canine and feline gastrointestinal tract in vitro and (b) to determine the impact of oxalate degradation by selected strains in vivo. the bacteria were grown in oxalate-containing media and their ability to degrade oxalate in vitro was determined using reverse-phased hplc. bifidobacteria species and lactobacillus species that degraded oxalate in vitro and survived gastric transit were selected for further examination. the selected probiotics were fed to rats for 4 weeks. urine was collected at week's 0, 2 and 4 and oxalate levels determined by hplc. in vitro degradation was detected for 11/18 of the lactobacillus species. in contrast, the capacity to degrade oxalate was not detected for any of the 13 bifidobacterium species tested. lactobacillus animalis 223c, lactobacillus murinus 1222, l. animalis 5323 and l. murinus 3133 were selected for further investigation in a rat model. urinary oxalate levels were significantly reduced (p<0.05) in animals fed l. animalis 5323 and l. animalis 223c but were unaltered  when fed l. murinus 1222, l. murinus 3133 or placebo. probiotic organisms vary widely in their capacity to degrade oxalate. in vitro degradation does not uniformly translate to an impact in vivo. the results have therapeutic implications and may influence the choice of probiotic, particularly in the setting of enteric hyperoxaluria.

TI  == a differential effect of 2 probiotics in the prevention of eczema and atopy: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == background: the role of probiotics in prevention of allergic disease is still not clearly established, although early reports suggested lactobacillus gg halved the risk of eczema at 2 years. objective: to determine whether probiotic supplementation in early life could prevent development of eczema and atopy at 2  years. methods: double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial of infants at risk of allergic disease. pregnant women were randomized to take lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 (l rhamnosus), bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis strain hn019 or placebo daily from 35 weeks gestation until 6 months if breast-feeding, and their infants were randomized to receive the same treatment from birth to 2 years (n = 474). the infant's cumulative prevalence of eczema and point prevalence of atopy, using skin prick tests to common allergens, was assessed at 2 years. results: infants receiving l rhamnosus had a significantly (p = .01) reduced risk of eczema (hazard ratio [hr], 0.51; 95% ci, 0.30-0.85) compared with placebo, but this was not the case for b animalis subsp lactis (hr, 0.90; 95% ci, 0.58-1.41).  there was no significant effect of l rhamnosus (hr, 0.74; 95% ci, 0.46-1.18) or b animalis subsp lactis (hr, 0.82; 95% ci, 0.52-1.28) on atopy. l rhamnosus (71.5%) was more likely than b animalis subsp lactis (22.6%) to be present in the feces at 3 months, although detection rates were similar by 24 months. conclusion: we found that supplementation with l rhamnosus, but not b animalis subsp lactis, substantially reduced the cumulative prevalence of eczema, but not atopy, by 2 years. understanding how lactobacilli act to prevent eczema requires further investigation.

TI  == detection of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (bb12) in the intestine after feeding of sows and their piglets.
AB  == a real-time pcr method has been developed to distinguish bifidobacterium animalis subspecies in the gastrointestinal tracts of pigs. identification of a highly conserved single-copy tuf gene encoding the elongation factor tu involved in bacterial protein biosynthesis was used as a marker to differentiate homologous bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (strain bb12) from bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis, as well as bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, several species of lactobacillus, and enterococcus faecium. real-time pcr detection of serially diluted dna extracted from a pure culture of bb12 was linear for bacterial numbers ranging from 10 to 10,000 tuf gene copies per pcr (r(2) = 0.99). relative differences in bb12 bacterial numbers in pigs fed daily with bb12 were determined after detection of bb12 tuf gene copies in dna extracted from the intestinal contents. piglets treated with bb12 immediately after birth maintained a high level of bb12 in their large intestines with continuous daily administration of bb12. piglets born to bb12-treated sows during the last third of their gestation and also treated with bb12 at birth (t/t group) had a higher number of bb12 organisms per gram of intestinal contents compared to placebo-treated piglets born to placebo-treated sows (c/c group), bb12-treated sows (t/c group), or piglets born to placebo sows but treated with bb12 immediately after birth (c/t group). in addition, there was a significant increase in gene expression for toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9) in piglets from the t/t group, with no change in tlr2 and tlr4. these findings suggest that the tuf gene represents a specific and functional marker for detecting bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis strain bb12 within the microbiota of the intestine.

TI  == early administration of probiotics alters bacterial colonization and limits diet-induced gut dysfunction and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm pigs.
AB  == following preterm birth, bacterial colonization and enteral formula feeding predispose neonates to gut dysfunction and necrotizing enterocolitis (nec), a serious gastrointestinal inflammatory disease. we hypothesized that administration of probiotics would beneficially influence early bacterial colonization, thereby reducing the susceptibility to formula-induced gut atrophy, dysfunction, and nec. caesarean-delivered preterm pigs were provided total parenteral nutrition (1.5 d) followed by enteral feeding (2 d) with porcine colostrum (colos; n = 5), formula (form; n = 9), or formula with probiotics (form-p; bifidobacterium animalis and lactobacillus: l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. pentosus, l. plantarum; n = 13). clinical nec scores were reduced (p < 0.05) in form-p (2.0 +/- 0.2) and colos groups (1.7 +/- 0.5) compared with form pigs (3.4  +/- 0.6). lower nec scores were associated with elevated intestinal weight, mucosa proportion, villus height, rna integrity, and brush border aminopeptidase  a and n activities, and lower gastric organic acid concentration in the form-p and colos groups (p < 0.05). diversity of the mucosa-associated bacteria in the distal small intestine was similar among formula-fed pigs, yet the abundance of specific bacterial groups differed between form-p and form pigs. form-p pigs had  lower colonization density of a potential pathogen, clostridium perfringens, and  had commensal lactobacillus bacteria more closely associated with enterocytes along the villus-crypt axis relative to form pigs. these results suggest that probiotic administration immediately after birth promotes the colonization of a beneficial commensal microbiota capable of limiting the formula-induced mucosal atrophy, dysfunction, and pathogen load in preterm neonates, thereby reducing the incidence and severity of nec.

TI  == effects of inulin and oligofructose on the rheological characteristics and probiotic culture survival in low-fat probiotic ice cream.
AB  == the effects of supplementation of oligofructose or inulin on the rheological characteristics and survival of lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 and bifidobacterium animalis bb-12 in low-fat ice cream stored at -18 degrees c for 90 d were studied. addition of oligofructose or inulin to ice cream mix significantly increased apparent viscosity and overrun and developed the melting  properties in ice cream during storage (p < 0.05). however, the highest increase  in firmness, the lowest change in melting properties, and the longest 1st dripping time were obtained in probiotic ice cream containing inulin (p < 0.05).  some textural properties have also improved especially by the end of storage. freezing process caused a significant decrease in the viability of lactobacillus  acidophilus la-5 and bifidobacterium animalis bb-12 (p < 0.05). oligofructose significantly improved the viability of l. acidophilus la-5 and b. animalis bb-12 in ice cream mix (p < 0.05). although the viable numbers for both bacteria decreased throughout the storage, the minimum level of 10(6) cfu/g was maintained for b. animalis bb-12 in only ice cream with oligofructose during storage.

TI  == probiotic intervention has strain-specific anti-inflammatory effects in healthy adults.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the effects of three potentially anti-inflammatory probiotic bacteria from three different genera on immune variables in healthy adults in a clinical setting based on previous in vitro characterization of cytokine responses. methods: a total of 62 volunteers participated in this randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled parallel group intervention study. the volunteers were randomized to receive a milk-based drink containing either lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb12 (bb12), or propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js (pjs) or a placebo  drink for 3 wk. venous blood and saliva samples were taken at baseline and on d 1, 7 and 21. fecal samples were collected at baseline and at the end of intervention. results: the serum hscrp expressed as the median auc(0-21) (minus baseline) was 0.018 mg/l in the placebo group, -0.240 mg/l in the lgg group, 0.090 mg/l in the bb12 group and -0.085 mg/l in the pjs group (p = 0.014). in vitro production of tnf-alpha from in vitro cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) was significantly lower in subjects receiving lgg vs placebo. il-2 production from pbmc in the bb12 group was significantly lower compared with the  other groups. conclusion: in conclusion, probiotic bacteria have strain-specific  anti-inflammatory effects in healthy adults.

TI  == the effect of probiotics and organic acids on shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in shiga-toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for stec. shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and  hemolytic uremic syndrome. stec possesses shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and shiga toxin 2  (stx2), both of which have a and b subunits. although stec containing both stx1 and stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. thus, the effect of lactobacillus, pediococcus, and bifidobacterium strains on stx2a expression levels in stec was investigated. lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included l. rhamnosus gg, l. curvatus, l. plantarum, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. reuteri, p. acidilactici, p. cerevisiae, p. pentosaceus, b. thermophilum, b. boum, b. suis and b. animalis. e. coli o157:h7 (edl 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. following rna extraction and cdna synthesis, relative stx2a mrna levels were determined according to a comparative  critical threshold (ct) real-time pcr. data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and the level of stx2a expression between treated and untreated stec was compared. observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2a was down-regulated, when compared to the control  culture. probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in  ph, influenced stx2a gene expression.

TI  == detoxification of patulin and ochratoxin a, two abundant mycotoxins, by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aim of the present study was to investigate the detoxification of two abundant mycotoxins, namely ochratoxin a (ota) and patulin (pat) which are frequently found in human foods, by lactic acid bacteria. the removal of the two mycotoxins  from liquid medium by thirty different lab strains was analyzed in a screening trial by the use of hplc coupled with uv- or fluorescence detection. two highly effective strains were identified; lactobacillus acidophilus vm 20 caused a decrease of ota by > or = 95% and bifidobacterium animalis vm 12 reduced pat levels by 80%. subsequently experiments showed that the binding of these compounds depends on different parameters, i.e. the concentration of toxins, the  cell density, the ph-value and on the viability of the bacteria. to proof that the decrease of the toxins by lab from liquid medium results in a reduction of their toxic properties, micronucleus (mcn) assays were conducted with a human derived hepatoma cell line (hepg2). indeed, a substantial decrease (39-59%) of ota and pat induced mcn formation was observed with the most effective strains detected in the chemical analyses. furthermore, also the inhibition of the cell division rates by the toxins was significantly reduced. these findings indicate that certain lab strains are able to detoxify the two toxins and may be useful to protect humans and/or animals against the adverse health effects of these compounds.

TI  == presence of two lactobacillus and bifidobacterium probiotic strains in the neonatal ileum.
AB  == the overall purpose of this study was to examine the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria microbiota in the human ileum at a very early stage of life. ileostomy effluents from two infants, taken at different time points, were plated on lactobacillus selective agar and cys-mrs containing mupirocin to select for bifidobacteria. in one case, a stool sample following ileostomy reversal was subsequently analyzed microbiologically. pulse-field gel electrophoresis and 16s  rrna sequencing was used to investigate the cultivable population of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) to examine the non-cultivable population. the probiotic strain, lactobacillus paracasei nfbc 338, was recovered at both time points from one of the infants and dominated in the small intestine for a period of over 3 weeks. moreover, the probiotic strain, b. animalis subsp. lactis bb12, was obtained from the other infant. this study shows the presence of two known probiotic strains in the upper intestinal tract at an early stage of human life and thus provides some evidence for their ability to colonize the infant small intestine.

TI  == effects of fructooligosaccharide and whey protein concentrate on the viability of starter culture in reduced-fat probiotic yogurt during storage.
AB  == viability of yogurt starter cultures and bifidobacterium animalis was assessed during 28 d storage in reduced-fat yogurts containing 1.5% milk fat supplemented  with 1.5% fructooligosaccharide or whey protein concentrate. these properties were examined in comparison with control yogurts containing 1.5% and 3% milk fat  and no supplement. although fructooligosaccharide improved the viability of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subs. bulgaricus, and bifidobacterium animalis, the highest growth was obtained when milk was supplemented with whey protein concentrate in reduced-fat yogurt (p < 0.05). supplementation with 1.5% whey protein concentrate in reduced-fat yogurt increased the viable counts of s. thermophilus, l. delbrueckii subs. bulgaricus,  and b. animalis by 1 log cycle in the 1st week of storage when compared to control sample. similar improvement in the growth of both yogurt bacteria and b.  animalis was also obtained in the full-fat yogurt containing 3% milk fat and no supplement. addition of whey protein concentrate also resulted in the highest content of lactic and acetic acids (p < 0.05). a gradual increase was obtained in organic acid contents during the storage.

TI  == effects of yogurt and bifidobacteria supplementation on the colonic microbiota in lactose-intolerant subjects.
AB  == aims: colonic metabolism of lactose may play a role in lactose intolerance. we investigated whether a 2-week supplementation of bifidobacterium longum (in capsules) and a yogurt enriched with bifidobacterium animalis could modify the composition and metabolic activities of the colonic microbiota in 11 chinese lactose-intolerant subjects. methods and results: the numbers of total cells, total bacteria and the eubacterium rectale/clostridium coccoides group in faeces  as measured with fluorescent in situ hybridization and the faecal beta-galactosidase activity increased significantly during supplementation. the number of bifidobacterium showed a tendency to increase during and after supplementation. with pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, in subjects in which b. animalis and b. longum were not detected before supplementation, both strains were present in faeces during supplementation, but disappeared after supplementation. the degree of lactose digestion in the small intestine and the oro-caecal transit time were not different before and after supplementation, whereas symptom scores after lactose challenge decreased after supplementation. conclusions: the results suggest that supplementation modifies the amount and metabolic activities of the colonic microbiota and alleviates symptoms in lactose-intolerant subjects. the changes in the colonic microbiota might be among the factors modified by the supplementation which lead to the alleviation of lactose intolerance. significance and impact of the study: this study provides evidence for the possibility of managing lactose intolerance with dietary lactose (yogurt) and probiotics via modulating the colonic microbiota.

AB  == aim: to compare endogenous beta-glucosidases and beta-galactosidases for hydrolysis of the predominant isoflavone glycosides into isoflavone aglycones in  order to improve biological activity of soymilk. methods and results: beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase activities of probiotic organisms including lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4461, lactobacillus casei 2607 and bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb12 in soymilk were evaluated and correlated with the increase in concentration of isoflavone aglycones during fermentation. the concentrations of isoflavone compounds in soymilk were monitored using a varian model high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) with an amperometric electrochemical detector. in all micro-organisms, beta-glucosidase activity was found greater than that of beta-galactosidase. there was an increase in the aglycone concentration with incubation time because  of the apparent hydrolytic action on isoflavone glycosides. aglycone concentration in the soymilk with l. acidophilus 4461, l. casei 2607 and b. animalis ssp. lactis bb12, increased by 5.37-, 5.52- and 6.10-fold, respectively, after 15 h of fermentation at 37 degrees c. the maximum hydrolytic potential was  also observed at 15 h of fermentation for the three micro-organims coinciding with peak activities of the two enzymes. conclusions: beta-glucosidase activity was more than 15 times higher than beta-galactosidase activity in soymilk for each of the micro-organisms during fermentation. beta-glucosidase played a greater role in isoflavone glycoside hydrolysis. significance and impact of the study: screening for beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase activities among probiotics in soymilk is important for the improvement of biological activity of  soymilk and in the selection of micro-organisms for use in the growing industry of functional foods and beverages.

TI  == a comparison of changes in the transformation of isoflavones in soymilk using varying concentrations of exogenous and probiotic-derived endogenous beta-glucosidases.
AB  == aims: to compare endogenous and exogenous beta-glucosidases for the hydrolysis of the predominant isoflavone glucosides in soymilk in order to improve the biological activity. methods and results: beta-glucosidase activity of probiotic  organisms, including bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb12, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4461 and lactobacillus casei 2607 in soymilk, was evaluated and  was related to the increase in the concentration of isoflavone aglycones during fermentation. the concentrations of isoflavone compounds in soymilk were monitored using a varian model hplc with an amperometric electrochemical detector. the aglycone composition, also known as aglycone equivalent ratio, has  been considered to be important for the delivery of health benefits of isoflavones, and was monitored during the fermentation of soymilk. comparison of  the hydrolytic effectiveness of both exogenous and endogenous enzyme during 4-h incubation in soymilk was conducted using the otieno-shah (o-s) index. results showed that exogenous enzyme exhibited faster rate of isoflavone glucoside hydrolysis than that by endogenous enzyme. highest o-s indices were obtained after 4, 3 and 2 h of incubation with enzyme solution having beta-glucosidase activity of 0.288 u ml(-1), 0.359 u ml(-1) and 0.575 u ml(-1), resulting into aglycone concentration increments of 5.87-, 6.07- and 5.94-fold, respectively. conversely, aglycone concentration in the soymilk with b. animalis ssp. lactis bb12, l. casei 2607 and l. acidophilus 4461 increased by 3.43-, 2.72- and 3.03-fold, respectively, after 4 h of fermentation at 37 degrees c. in addition,  the o-s index of endogenous enzyme was much lower than that of the exogenous enzyme over the same 4-h incubation period. optimum aglycone equivalent ratios coincided with highest o-s indices and highest aglycone concentrations in soymilk hydrolysed with exogenous enzyme. the same correlation of o-s indices and highest aglycone concentrations occurred for endogenous enzyme during the 24 h of fermentation. conclusions: obtaining highest aglycone concentration and optimum aglycone equivalent ratio could provide a critical beginning point in clinical trials for the realization of unique health benefits of soy isoflavones. significance and impact of the study: screening for beta-glucosidase activities of probiotics in soymilk and comparing their hydrolytic potentials with that of exogenous beta-glucosidase could find wide applications in the development of different aglycone-rich functional soy beverages.

TI  == microscopic colitis.
AB  == as the diagnosis of microscopic colitis (mc) is made on the basis of histologic criteria, it is crucial to render an accurate microscopic interpretation. features include 20 or more lymphocytes per 100 epithelial cells, mixed lamina propria inflammatory infiltrate, and preservation of crypt architecture for both  lymphocytic and collagenous colitis (cc). cc is further characterized by a collagen band at least 10 mum thick. although the pathogenesis of mc is poorly understood, medication-induced toxicity to the colonic mucosa is important to recognize, as medication cessation leads to prompt improvement. if mc is mild, symptomatic treatment is all that is needed, because some cases are self-limiting. budesonide, 9 mg daily for at least 8 weeks, is the best documented treatment of choice for more severe or protracted cases. a 75% response rate has been reported; however, when treatment is discontinued, relapse is common, and longer-term tapering dose therapy often is necessary. there are disadvantages and no advantage to other forms of steroid therapy. cholestyramine, bismuth, and 5-aminosalicylate derivatives appear to be less efficacious but are  reasonable therapeutic options for less severe cases. use of immunosuppressant therapy such as azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine should be highly restricted because mc is a benign condition that does not result in other complications. probiotic therapy with lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium animalis has not been shown to be effective in reducing bowel frequency. surgical diversion of the fecal stream can control diarrhea and improve histology but is very rarely indicated and should be reserved for highly selected cases of severely symptomatic steroid-refractory mc.

AB  == objective: it was determined whether a combination of lactobacillus acidophilus (l. acidophilus) 74-2 and bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis dgcc 420 (b. lactis 420) affect the faecal microbiota as well as immunological parameters and  blood lipids in healthy adults. design: a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized crossover trial was conducted. subjects: twenty-six healthy volunteers (mean age 25 years) were recruited by advertising in academical buildings. all of them completed the study. methods: after 3-week run-in period, half of the volunteers consumed 300 g/day of yoghurt supplement containing probiotic strains  l. acidophilus 74-2 and b. lactis 420, and the other half received the placebo product for a period of 5 weeks. the two groups were crossed during the following 5-week period. blood and faecal samples were collected at the end of each period. the faecal content of probiotic bacteria, faecal short-chain fatty acids (scfa),  serum lipids and plasma immune system biomarkers were evaluated. results: faecal  proportions of l. acidophilus and of b. lactis increased significantly from 0.02  to 0.19 and 0.4 to 1.4% (p<0.05), respectively. percentages of granulocytes and monocytes showing phagocytic activity were significantly elevated from 92 to 95%  during probiotic intervention, whereas their oxidative burst activity and specific immune parameters remained unaffected. fecal scfa and serum cholesterol  levels were not influenced by the probiotics. however, serum concentrations of triacylglyceroles decreased significantly by 11.6% (p<0.05) in the probiotic supplementation period. conclusions: l. acidophilus and b. lactis were recovered  in faeces in significantly elevated numbers after supplementation. they are able  to modulate unspecific cellular immune response indicated by the increased phagocytic activity.

TI  == canine intestinal lactic acid bacteria agglutinated with concanavalin a.
AB  == twenty-six out of 46 representative lactic acid bacteria (lab) that we isolated from 36 dogs in a previous study were agglutinated by concanavalin a (cona) at a  concentration of 0.1563 mg/ml, while isolates did not agglutinate without the addition of cona. amongst the isolates, l. reuteri, l. mucosae, and e. canintestini agglutinated strongly, while l. gallinarum, l. kitasatonis, l. acidophilus, l. saerimneri, b. animalis ssp. animalis, p. acidilactici, and e. hirae did not agglutinate. cona-agglutination of lab was specifically inhibited by d-glucose, d-galactose, and d-mannose at a concentration of 1.563 mg/ml. among the sugars, cona-agglutination was strongly inhibited by d-mannose, while the inhibition level by d-glucose and d-galactose were lower than that of d-mannose.  cona- agglutination of all the lab isolates was inhibited by d-mannose, except for l. reuteri (one species) and l. mucosae (two species). cona-agglutination of  bifidobacterium spp. was inhibited by only d-mannose. based on our results, cona-agglutination of lab seems to be strain-specific, but not species-specific.

TI  == tetracycline susceptibility of the ingested lactobacillus acidophilus lach-5 and  bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 strains during antibiotic/probiotic  intervention.
AB  == we investigated the effects of oral therapy with doxycycline, a tetracycline group antibiotic, on the gastrointestinal (gi) survival and tetracycline susceptibility of probiotic strains lactobacillus acidophilus lach-5 and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12. in addition, the influence of doxycycline therapy on the diversity of the predominant faecal microbiota was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). faecal samples from the antibiotic group (receiving antibiotics and probiotics) and the control group (receiving probiotics only) were analysed for anaerobically and aerobically growing bacteria, bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria as well as for the dominant microbiota. although doxycycline consumption did not have a large impact on gi survival of the probiotics, it had a detrimental effect on the bifidobacteria and on the diversity of the dominant faecal microbiota. a higher proportion of tetracycline-resistant anaerobically growing bacteria and bifidobacteria was detected in the antibiotic group than in  the control group. several antibiotic group subjects had faecal b. animalis subsp. lactis bb-12-like isolates with reduced tetracycline susceptibility. this  was unlikely to be due to the acquisition of novel tetracycline resistance determinants, since only tet(w), which is also present in the ingested b. animalis subsp. lactis bb-12, was found in the resistant isolates. thus, concomitant ingestion of probiotic l. acidophilus lach-5 and b. animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 with the antibiotic did not generate a safety risk regarding the possible gi transfer of tetracycline resistance genes to the ingested strains.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacterium spp. isolated from dairy and pharmaceutical products.
AB  == the outlines of antibiotic resistance of some probiotic microorganisms were studied. this study was conducted with the double purpose of verifying their ability to survive if they are taken simultaneously with an antibiotic therapy and to increase the selective properties of suitable media for the isolation of samples containing mixed bacterial populations. we isolated from commercial dairy and pharmaceutical products, 34 strains declared as probiotics, belonging to the  genera bifidobacterium and lactobacillus, and 21 strains of starter culture bacteria. all the microorganisms have been compared by electrophoresis of the soluble proteins for the purpose of identifying them. a multiplex-pcr with genus- and species-specific primers was used to detect for bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis presence. all bifidobacteria were b. animalis subsp. lactis except  one bifidobacterium longum. sometimes the identification showed that the used strain was not the one indicated on the label. the lactobacilli were lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. the streptococci were all streptococcus thermophilus. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of 24 common antibiotic substances has been valued by the broth microdilution method. all tested strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, clindamycin, dicloxacillin, erytromycin, novobiocin, penicillin g, rifampicin (mic(90) ranging from 0.01 to 4 microg/ml);  resistant to aztreonam, cycloserin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, polymyxin b and spectinomycin (mic(90) ranging from 64 to >1000 microg/ml). the susceptibility to cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, lincomycin, metronidazole, neomycin, paromomycin, streptomycin, tetracycline and vancomycin was variable and depending on the species.

TI  == identification and differentiation of lactobacillus, streptococcus and bifidobacterium species in fermented milk products with bifidobacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to identify and discriminate bacteria contained in commercial fermented milks with bifidobacteria by the use of amplified ribosomal  dna restriction analysis (ardra) and randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) techniques. ardra of the 16s rdna gene and rapd were performed on 13 lactobacillus strains, 13 streptococcus and 13 bifidobacterium strains isolated from commercial fermented milk. lactobacillus delbrueckii, streptococcus thermophilus and bifidobacterium animalis isolates were identified by genus- and  species-pcr and also, they were differentiated at genus and species level by ardra using mwoi restriction enzyme. the ardra technique allowed for the discrimination among these three related genus with the use of only one restriction enzyme, since distinctive profiles were obtained for each genus. therefore it can be a simple, rapid and useful method for routine identification. also, rapd technique allowed the discrimination of all bacteria contained in dairy products, at genus- and strain-level by the performance of one pcr reaction.

TI  == effect of a probiotic food as an adjuvant to triple therapy for eradication of helicobacter pylori infection in children.
AB  == objective: current recommendations for treatment of helicobacter pylori infection include a proton pump inhibitor in combination with two antibiotics. we evaluated the potential activity of a probiotic food as an adjuvant to antibiotic triple therapy for eradication of h. pylori infection in children from buenos aires, argentina. methods: sixty-five children who tested positive for h. pylori, as diagnosed by (13)c-urea breath test and endoscopy, were included in this study. patients were randomized to receive 1-wk triple therapy plus probiotic food (treated group) or milk placebo (control) that was administered for 3 mo. probiotic food consisted of 250 ml of a commercial yogurt containing bifidobacterium animalis and lactobacillus casei (10(7) colony-forming units/ml). post-treatment urea breath test controls were performed 1 and 3 mo after the end  of triple therapy. results: we found no significant differences in h. pylori eradication rates (ers) at 1 and 3 mo between the treated group (er = 45.5% and 42.4%) and the control group (er = 37.5% and 40.6%). relative risks between groups were 0.87 (95% confidence interval 0.58-1.32, p = 0.345) in the first month and 0.97 (95% confidence interval 0.64-1.46, p = 0.542) in the third month. conclusions: we could not demonstrate an adjuvant effect of the studied probiotic food to triple therapy in the eradication of h. pylori infection in children in buenos aires, argentina. however, we found lower ers than those reported for the  same therapeutic scheme in developed countries, indicating that bacterial resistance and alternative therapeutic strategies should be studied.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by probiotic strains modify the adhesion of probiotics and enteropathogens to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == exopolysaccharides (epss) are exocellular polymers present in the surface of many bacteria, including lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. the genome sequence of several strains revealed the presence of eps-encoding genes. however, the physiological role that epss play in the bacterial ecology still remains uncertain. in this study, we have assessed the effect of epss produced by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium longum nb667, and bifidobacterium animalis ipla-r1 on the adhesion of probiotic and enteropathogen strains to human intestinal mucus. the eps fraction gg had no significant effect on the adhesion of l. rhamnosus gg and b. animalis ipla-r1. however, the eps fractions nb667 and  ipla-r1 significantly reduced the adherence of both probiotic strains. in contrast, the three eps fractions increased the adhesion of enterobacter sakazakii atcc 29544 and escherichia coli nctc 8603. higher adherence of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 29631 and clostridium difficile atcc 9689 was detected in the presence of the eps fractions gg and nb667. in general,  these effects were obtained at eps concentrations of up to 5 mg/ml, and they were eps dose dependent. the competitive exclusion of probiotics in the presence of eps could suggest the involvement of these biopolymers in the adhesion to mucus.  the increase in the adherence of enteropathogens could be explained if components of the pathogen surface are able to bind to specific epss and the bound epss are  able to adhere to mucus. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work reporting the effect of epss from probiotics on bacterial adhesion properties.

TI  == immunomodulating potential of supplementation with probiotics: a dose-response study in healthy young adults.
AB  == certain probiotic microorganisms have been found beneficial in the treatment of immune-related diseases and may also affect immune function in healthy people. intervention studies of probiotics in healthy humans are urgently required. here, the immunomodulating potential of bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis (bb-12) and lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei (crl-431) was studied in a double-blind placebo-controlled parallel dose-response trial (n=71) based on five randomly assigned groups of young healthy adults supplemented for 3 weeks with 0, 10(8), 10(9), 10(10) and 10(11) cfu day(-1), respectively, of a mixture of bb-12  and crl-431. no statistically significant dose-dependent effect was found for phagocytic activity in blood leukocytes, fecal immunoglobulin a (iga) concentrations or production of interferon-gamma and interleukin-10 in blood cells. when evaluating data according to the amount of viable bb-12 recovered from faeces, the interferon-gamma production in blood cells was significantly reduced. in conclusion, no solid effect on the immune function of young healthy adults supplemented with even high doses of b. animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 and l.  paracasei ssp. paracasei crl-431 was demonstrated in this study.

TI  == probiotic bacteria bifidobacterium animalis mb5 and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg protect intestinal caco-2 cells from the inflammation-associated response induced by enterotoxigenic escherichia coli k88.
AB  == probiotic bacteria may provide protection against intestinal damage induced by pathogens, but the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. we investigated whether bifidobacterium animalis mb5 and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg  (lgg) protected intestinal caco-2 cells from the inflammation-associated response induced by enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) k88, by inhibiting pathogen attachment to the cells, which is the first step of etec pathogenicity, and regulating neutrophil recruitment, a crucial component of inflammation. a partial reduction of etec adhesion was exerted by probiotics and their culture supernatant fractions either undigested or digested with proteases. etec viability was unaffected by the presence of b. animalis, lgg or their supernatant fractions in the culture medium, indicating an absence of probiotic bactericidal  activity. probiotics and their supernatant fractions, either undigested or digested with proteases, strongly inhibited the neutrophil transmigration caused  by etec. both b. animalis and lgg counteracted the pathogen-induced up regulation of il-8, growth-related oncogene-alpha and epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide-78 gene expression, which are chemokines essential for neutrophil migration. moreover, the probiotics prevented the etec-induced increased expression of il-1beta and tnf-alpha and decrease of transforming growth factor-alpha, which are regulators of chemokine expression. these results indicate that b. animalis mb5 and lgg protect intestinal cells from the inflammation-associated response caused by etec k88 by partly reducing pathogen adhesion and by counteracting neutrophil migration, probably through the regulation of chemokine and cytokine expression.

TI  == development of a competitive exclusion product for poultry meeting the regulatory requirements for registration in the european union.
AB  == competitive exclusion treatment is able to increase the pathogen colonization resistance of day-old chicks by applying probiotic bacteria stabilizing the indigenous microflora. in order to develop a safe microbial feed additive, various bacterial strains were isolated out of the gastrointestinal tract of healthy chickens. one hundred twenty-one representatives were selected based on differences in whole-cell protein patterns and screened for antagonistic properties. five effective strains (pediococcus acidilactici, enterococcus faecium, bifidobacterium animalis ssp. animalis, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus salivarius ssp. salivarius) exhibited in vitro the ability to inhibit a range of common pathogens and were evaluated with regard to the risks associated with genetic transfer of antibiotic resistances from animals to humans via the food chain. the probiotic strains were sensitive to several clinically effective antibiotics, though some of them showed single resistances. none of the vancomycin-resistant (r) strains carried the enterococcal vana gene. two tetracycline r strains were shown to harbor a tet(m)-associated resistance. the strains contained no extrachromosomal dna and were not able to transfer the resistance by means of conjugation. on basis of the collected data the presence of easy transferable resistances was excluded and the chicken strains were considered to be suitable for the use as feed additive.

TI  == application of a microplate scale fluorochrome staining assay for the assessment  of viability of probiotic preparations.
AB  == cell viability in probiotic preparations is traditionally assessed by the plate count technique. additionally, fluorescent staining combined with epifluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry has been developed for the viability assessment, but the currently available assays are either laborious or require highly sophisticated equipment. the aim of this study was to investigate the applicability of a microplate scale fluorochrome assay for predicting the cell state of freeze-dried lactobacillus rhamnosus and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis preparations. in addition to viability assessment with live/dead baclight  bacterial viability kit, dibac(4)3 stain was used for the kinetic measurement of  changes in bifidobacterial cell membrane functions during exposure to low ph. the microplate scale fluorochrome assay results on the viability and cell numbers of  probiotic preparations correlated well with the results obtained with the culture-based technique and (with few exceptions) with epifluorescence microscopy. the assay was applicable also for the viability assessment of stressed (acid-treated) cells provided that the cell density in treatments was adjusted to the optimal measurement level of the fluorometer. the microplate scale fluorochrome assay offers a rapid and robust tool for the viability assessment of probiotic preparations, and enables also kinetic measurements.

TI  == a dynamic model that simulates the human upper gastrointestinal tract for the study of probiotics.
AB  == a dynamic model of the human upper gastrointestinal (gi) tract was designed to better simulate conditions of ingestion and digestion, by including a food matrix as part of the model design. the dynamic model consisted of two reactors maintained at 37 degrees c, one simulating stomach conditions and the other simulating duodenum conditions. the model was tested by comparing survival of bacteria isolated from humans (bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus acidophilus) animals (bifidobacterium  animalis, 2 strains), and fermented dairy products (bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus kefir, lactobacillus kefirgranum, and leuconostoc mesenteroides) with their survival as determined by conventional methods. five strains were not  able to survive (>3 log reduction) 15 min in a medium acidified at ph 2.0 using the conventional testing method, but survival was improved significantly for some strains in the dynamic model. two strains (bifidobacterium animalis atcc 25527 and lactobacillus johnsonii la-1 ncc 533) showed good survival with both methods. the dynamic model was shown to better represent the events during upper gi tract  transit than the conventional methods, by incorporation of a food matrix to buffer the gastric acidity and therefore expose bacteria to ph levels found in vivo before, during, and after a meal.

TI  == effects of feeding a probiotic preparation (sim) containing inulin on the severity of colitis and on the composition of the intestinal microflora in hla-b27 transgenic rats.
AB  == an overly aggressive immune response to the intestinal microflora in a genetically susceptible host background has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. we measured the impact of a probiotic preparation (sim) containing inulin on the severity of colitis and on intestinal microflora profiles of hla-b27-beta(2)-microglobulin transgenic (tg) rats. sim is a mixture  of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and inulin. two-month-old tg rats received either sim or water. control tg rats received metronidazole, alone or in combination with sim, for 8 weeks. nontransgenic rats received sim or water. the  cecal content was removed for analysis of the intestinal microflora by pcr combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. the colon was scored for histological evidence of inflammation, colonic myeloperoxidase activity and interleukin-1beta rna levels were measured photometrically or by real-time quantitative pcr. at 4 months, the colonic inflammation of tg rats treated with sim was histologically diminished compared to that in untreated tg rats (2.2 +/-  0.2 versus 2.9 +/- 0.1; p </= 0.03). the administration of sim altered the microflora profiles of tg rats by increasing the diversity and stimulating specifically the growth of bifidobacterium animalis. the probiotic bacteria added to sim were below the detection level in cecal stool samples at the end of the study period. the administration of sim resulted in a measurable impact on the cecal microflora profiles of tg rats with attenuation of colitis. the lack of detection of any added probiotic bacteria in the cecal content suggests that prebiotic inulin is the major effective compound.

TI  == bifidobacterium lactis dsm 10140: identification of the atp (atpbefhagdc) operon  and analysis of its genetic structure, characteristics, and phylogeny.
AB  == the atp operon is highly conserved among eubacteria, and it has been considered a molecular marker as an alternative to the 16s rrna gene. pcr primers were designed from the consensus sequences of the atpd gene to amplify partial atpd sequences from 12 bifidobacterium species and nine lactobacillus species. all pcr products were sequenced and aligned with other atpd sequences retrieved from public databases. genes encoding the subunits of the f(1)f(0)-atpase of bifidobacterium lactis dsm 10140 (atpbefhagdc) were cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequences of these subunits showed significant homology with the sequences of other organisms. we identified specific sequence signatures for  the genus bifidobacterium and for the closely related taxa bifidobacterium lactis and bifidobacterium animalis and lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus johnsonii, which could provide an alternative to current methods for identification of lactic acid bacterial species. northern blot analysis showed that there was a transcript at approximately 7.3 kb, which corresponded to the size of the atp operon, and a transcript at 4.5 kb, which corresponded to the atpc, atpd, atpg, and atpa genes. the transcription initiation sites of these two mrnas were mapped by primer extension, and the results revealed no consensus promoter sequences. phylogenetic analysis of the atpd genes demonstrated that the lactobacillus atpd gene clustered with the genera listeria, lactococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus and that the higher g+c content and highly biased codon usage with respect to the genome average support the hypothesis that there  was probably horizontal gene transfer. the acid inducibility of the atp operon of b. lactis dsm 10140 was verified by slot blot hybridization by using rna isolated from acid-treated cultures of b. lactis dsm 10140. the rapid increase in the level of atp operon transcripts upon exposure to low ph suggested that the atpase complex of b. lactis dsm 10140 was regulated at the level of transcription and not at the enzyme assembly step.

TI  == relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in indigenous and exogenous bacteria.
AB  == aims: to investigate whether there is a relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and enterococci. methods and results: hydrophobicity, cell wall protein profiles and sites of interaction in the gut (by using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled bacteria) were determined for lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, b. animalis and enterococcus faecalis. we also determined the number of immunoglobulin (ig)a+, tumour necrosis factor (tnf)alpha+, interleukin (il)-6+ and il-10+ cells after oral administration of the above bacteria to balb/c mice.  all strains assessed were found to interact with the sites of induction of the immune response in the gut. no correlation with hydrophobicity was observed. when some strains at certain doses were administered to mice, bacterial translocation  to liver was observed. the oral administration of indigenous (104 cells day(-1))  and exogenous (107 cells day(-1)) bifidobacteria and lactobacilli for 5 consecutive days activated the systemic and intestinal mucosal immune response in a strain-specific way, independently whether the strain was indigenous or exogenous in relation to the host. the differences in the immunopotentiating capacity of the various strains might be related to the differences in their cell wall protein profiles. conclusions: indigenous bacteria activated the mucosal immune response at a dose significantly smaller than the one required for probiotic exogenous bacteria. however, probiotic exogenous bacteria can be used at high concentrations in fermented dairy products with a great impact on the immune system, favouring its immunomodulation. significance and impact of the study: the immunomodulation capacity of probiotic bacteria is strain specific and independent of the specificity of the host. the ability of certain strains to down-regulate the production and release of il-6 by il-10 may have potential implications in their use in cases in which cytokine deregulation or excessive production at the mucosal level can be the cause of tissue damage.

AB  == growth and metabolism of five probiotic strains with well-documented health effects were studied in ultra-high temperature (uht) treated milk, supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) tryptone or 0.75% (w/v) fructose. the probiotic strains were lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lb. acidophilus 1748, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg,  lactobacillus reuteri sd 2112 and bifidobacterium animalis bb12. fermentation was followed for 72 h at 37 degrees c and the samples were analysed for ph, log cfu ml(-1), volatile compounds, organic acids and carbon dioxide. the strains reduced ph from 6.7 to between 3.9 and 4.4 after 24 h of incubation. all strains attained viable cell counts above 8.7-9.18 log cfu ml(-1) after 6-16 h of incubation. the  two lb. acidophilus strains showed a stable level of viable cells during 12-72 h  of incubation but the three other strains showed a reduction of 0.4-1.1 log cfu ml(-1) from 24 to 72 h of incubation. however, all strains showed cell levels between 7.8 and 8.7 log cfu ml(-1) after 72 h of incubation. after 48 h of incubation, the amount of lactic acid produced varied according to strain from 6949 to 14,000 mg kg(-1) and acetic acid produced varied from 0 to 6901 mg kg(-1). three of the strains metabolised citrate but only low amounts of diacetyl and acetoin were detected within strains, 0.2-0.8 and 6.5-10 mg kg(-1), respectively. carbon dioxide produced varied from 221 to 3942 mg kg(-1) and was connected to the citrate-fermenting ability of the strain used and their carbohydrate fermentation pathway. three of the strains produced detectable levels of acetaldehyde and the concentration varied from 9.4 to 12.6 mg kg(-1) after 24 h of incubation. all five probiotic strains showed very different profiles of metabolites during fermentation; however, the two lb. acidophilus strains were the most alike. our findings show the importance of controlling the  fermentation time since the probiotic strains produced different amounts of metabolic products according to fermentation time.

TI  == synthesis and utilisation of folate by yoghurt starter cultures and probiotic bacteria.
AB  == thirty-two bacterial isolates from species commonly used in yoghurts and fermented milks were examined for their ability to synthesise or utilise folate during fermentation of skim milk. the organisms examined included the traditional yoghurt starter cultures, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus, and probiotic lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and enterococcus faecium. folate was synthesised by s. thermophilus, bifidobacteria,  and e. faecium. s. thermophilus was the dominant producer, elevating folate levels in skim milk from 11.5 ng g(-1) to between 40 and 50 ng g(-1). generally,  lactobacilli depleted the available folate in the skim milk. fermentations with mixed cultures showed that folate production and utilisation by the cultures was  additive. fermentations using a combination of bifidobacterium animalis and s. thermophilus resulted in a six-fold increase in folate concentration. although increased folate levels in yoghurts and fermented milks are possible through judicious selection of inoculum species, the folate levels remain relatively low  in terms of recommended daily allowance.

TI  == production of oligosaccharides in yogurt containing bifidobacteria and yogurt cultures.
AB  == yogurts were prepared by using yogurt cultures combined to mixed cultures of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, and bifidobacterium longum) and  by adding a preincubation step (1.5 h at 50 degrees c) with bifidobacteria to the conventional method of manufacture in order to produce oligosaccharides. the survival of bifidobacteria was drastically affected during storage of yogurts, except for products containing b. animalis, in which viable counts remained at >10(6) cfu/g after 28 d of storage at 4 degrees c. oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization of 3 were produced during the preincubation step (0.31 to 0.68%), and the amount in the final products varied according to the species of bifidobacteria inoculated during the preincubation step or the concentration of bifidobacteria used as second inoculum during the fermentation process. in fact,  the higher concentration of oligosaccharides measured at the end of the fermentation process (0.72%) and the 28 d-storage period (0.67%) was obtained for yogurts containing b. infantis. however, yogurts containing b. breve showed higher beta-galactosidase activities and had lower lactose concentrations after the fermentation process and the storage period than the other yogurts. the use of a mixed cultures of bifidobacteria (b. animalis, b. infantis, or b. breve) thus allows the production of yogurts in which bifidobacteria can survive in relatively high cell numbers and contain appreciable amount of oligosaccharides.

TI  == effects of different probiotic strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on bacterial translocation and liver injury in an acute liver injury model.
AB  == septic complications represent frequent causes of morbidity in liver diseases and following hepatic operations. most infections are caused by the individual own intestinal microflora. the intestinal microflora composition is important in physiological and pathophysiological processes in the human gastrointestinal tract, but their influence on liver in different situations is unclear. we therefore studied the effect of different lactobacillus strains and a bifidobacterium strain on the extent of liver injury, bacterial translocation and intestinal microflora in an acute liver injury model. sprague-dawley rats were divided into five groups: acute liver injury control, acute liver injury + b. animalis nm2, acute liver injury + l. acidophilus nmi, acute liver injury + l. rhamnosus atcc 53103, and acute liver injury + l. rhamnosus dsm 6594 and l. plantarum dsm 9843. the bacteria were administered rectally daily for 8 days. liver injury was induced on the 8th day by intraperitoneal injection of d-galactosamine (1.1 g/kg bw). samples were collected 24 h after the liver injury. liver enzymes and bilirubin serum levels, bacterial translocation (to arterial and portal blood, liver and mesenteric lymph nodes (mlns)), and intestinal microflora were evaluated. l. acidophilus nm1; l. rhamnosus atcc 53103, and l. rhamnosus dsm 6594 + l. plantarum dsm 9843 decreased bacterial translocation compared to the liver injury control group. b. animalis nm2 increased bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes. the levels of alanine aminotransferase (alat) were significantly lower in the l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus atcc 53103, l. rhamnosus dsm 6594 + l. plantarum dsm 9843 groups compared to the liver injury group. the l. rhamnosus and l. rhamnosus + l. plantarum groups significantly reduced alat levels compared to the b. animalis group. all administered bacteria decreased the enterobacteriaceae count in the cecum and colon. administration of different lactobacilli and a bifidobacterium strain in an acute liver injury rat model, has shown different effects on bacterial translocation and hepatocellular damage. l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus,  and l. rhamnosus + l. plantarum reduced bacterial translocation and hepatocellular damage. b. animalis nm2 increased bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes and did not affect hepatocellular damage.

TI  == nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the bifidobacterium longum mb 219 lacz gene.
AB  == the gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of escherichia coli from bifidobacterium longum mb219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten bifidobacterium strains tested of the species b. longum, b. breve, b. adolescentis, b. indicum, b. animalis and b. cuniculi. the nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to e. coli revealed the presence of a lacz-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site.  a sequence showing 72% identity with the proline trna of bacillus subtilis and a  gene probably encoding the dna-3-methyladenine glycosydase i were located downstream from the lacz gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. by primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacz gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the  -10 region of the putative promoter. the nucleotide sequence of lacz and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes  and enzymes from other microorganisms. high similarity was demonstrated between the b. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, e. coli, clostridium acetobutylicum, leuconostoc lactis, klebsiella pneumoniae and kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the lacz family. the b. longum mb219 lacz gene was cloned in bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. the expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.

TI  == a colony immunoblotting method for quantitative detection of a bifidobacterium animalis probiotic strain in human faeces.
AB  == a colony immunoblotting method has been developed to allow detection of the probiotic bifidobacterium animalis strain dn-173 010 in human faecal samples. rabbits were immunized with heat-killed dn-173 010 bacteria resulting in the production of an antiserum highly specific for bacteria belonging to bif. animalis species. of the 89 strains representative of 29 different bifidobacterial species tested, only the 15 strains of the bif. animalis species  could be detected with the antiserum. in western immunoblotting the serum reacts  with a protein of 45-kda apparent molecular weight. none of the bacteria classically encountered in human faecal samples and able to grow on non-selective columbia blood agar (enterobacteria, bacteroides or lactobacillus for instance) reacted with the antiserum. taking advantage of the high specificity of the antiserum and of the absence of bif. animalis bacteria in faeces samples of five  human volunteers, we demonstrated that strain dn-173 010 survives the intestinal  transit. being based on a combination of semiselective cultivation and colony immunoblotting techniques, the method allowed detection of the bif. animalis strain even when it represented only one thousandth of the total bifidobacterial  population.

TI  == a probiotic strain of l. acidophilus reduces dmh-induced large intestinal tumors  in male sprague-dawley rats.
AB  == probiotic bacteria strains were examined for their influence on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh)-induced intestinal tumors in 100 male sprague-dawley  rats. lactobacillus acidophilus (delvo pro la-1), lactobacillus rhamnosus (gg), bifidobacterium animalis (cscc1941), and streptococcus thermophilus (dd145) strains were examined for their influence when added as freeze-dried bacteria to  an experimental diet based on a high-fat semipurified (ain-93) rodent diet. four  bacterial treatments were compared: l. acidophilus, l. acidophilus + b. animalis, l. rhamnosus, and s. thermophilus, the bacteria being added daily at 1% freeze-dried weight (10(10) colony-forming units/g) to the diet. trends were observed in the incidence of rats with large intestinal tumors for three treatments: 25% lower than control for l. acidophilus, 20% lower for l. acidophilus + b. animalis and l. rhamnosus treatments, and 10% lower for s. thermophilus. large intestinal tumor burden was significantly lower for treated rats with l. acidophilus than for the control group (10 and 3 tumors/treatment group, respectively, p = 0.05). large intestinal tumor mass index was also lower  for the l. acidophilus treatment than for control (1.70 and 0.10, respectively, p < 0.05). other treatments showed no statistically significant change from control for these indexes of tumorigenesis. for rats fed l. acidophilus, no adenocarcinomas were present in the colons. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of bacterial chromosomal dna fragments was used to differentiate introduced (exogenous) bacterial strains from indigenous bacteria of the same genera present in the feces. survival during gut passage and displacement of indigenous lactobacilli occurred with introduced l. acidophilus and l. rhamnosus gg during the probiotic treatment period. however, introduced strains of b. animalis and s. thermophilus were not able to be isolated from feces. it is concluded that this strain of l. acidophilus supplied as freeze-dried bacteria in the diet was protective, as seen by a small but significant inhibition of tumors within the rat colon.

TI  == conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == primers designed from consensus regions of the major cold shock gene of different bacterial species were used in pcr amplification of lactic acid bacteria (lab). an appropriately-sized pcr product was obtained from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ll43-1 and mg1363; lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris lc10-1, lc11-1, and  lc12-1; streptococcus thermophilus st1-1; enterococcus faecalis ef1-1; lactobacillus acidophilus la1-1; lactobacillus helveticus lh1-1; pediococcus pentosaceus pp1-1; and bifidobacterium animalis ba1-1. the pcr products were cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequences displayed high sequence similarity with the major cold shock proteins of escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis and the human y-box factor. the amino acid residues of the cold shock domain implicated in nucleic acid binding in several unrelated species were also  highly conserved in the lab strains. it is possible, therefore, that this protein in lab may also act as a transcriptional enhancer to other cold shock genes and/or act as an rna chaperone unwinding tightly folded rna molecules.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.

TI  == development and application of an in vitro methodology to determine the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species in the upper human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == an in vitro methodology which mimics in vivo human upper gastrointestinal transit was developed. the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species was determined by exposing washed cell suspensions at 37  degrees c to a simulated gastric juice (ph 2.0), containing pepsin (0.3% w/v) and sodium chloride (0.5% w/v), and a simulated small intestinal juice (ph 8.0), containing pancreatin usp (1 g l-1) and sodium chloride (5 g l-1), and monitoring changes in total viable count periodically. the methodology was also employed to  determine the effect of adding milk proteins (1 g l-1), hog gastric mucin (1 g l-1) and soyabean trypsinchymotrypsin inhibitor [sbtci] (1 g l-1) on transit tolerance. the majority (14 of 15) of isolates lost > 90% viability during simulated gastric transit. only one isolate, lactobacillus fermentum kld, was considered intrinsically resistant. the addition of milk proteins, singly and in  combination, generally improved gastric transit tolerance. in this regard, two isolates, lact. casei 212.3 and bifidobacterium infantis 25962, exhibited 100% gastric transit tolerance in the presence of milk proteins. in general, the addition of hog gastric mucin did not influence simulated gastric transit tolerance of lactobacilli but tended to increase that of bifidobacteria. however, it increased that of lact. casei 242 and lact. salivarius 43338 but diminished that of b. bifidum 2715 and b. animalis bo. selected bile salts-resistant isolates were intrinsically tolerant to simulated small intestinal transit. only  lact. casei f19 and b. adolescentis 15703t showed significant reduction in viability after 240 min. in general, the addition of milk proteins and sbtci did  not affect simulated small intestinal transit tolerance. however, they significantly improved the intrinsic resistance of lact. casei f19 but diminished that of b. breve 15700t. it is concluded that, whereas the majority of bile salts-resistant lactobacilli and bifidobacteria may be intrinsically sensitive to gastric transit, they are intrinsically resistant to small intestinal transit. in addition, it is postulated that milk proteins and mucin may function as both buffering agents and inhibitors of digestive protease activity in vivo, thereby protecting ingested bacterial strains during upper gastrointestinal transit.

TI  == biotherapeutic effects of probiotic bacteria on candidiasis in immunodeficient mice.
AB  == four species of probiotic bacteria were assessed for their capacities to protect  athymic bg/bg-nu/nu and euthymic bg/bg-nu/+ mice from mucosal and systemic candidiasis. each bacterial species and candida albicans colonized the gastrointestinal tracts of both strains of mice. the presence of probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus casei gg, or bifidobacterium animalis) in the gastrointestinal tracts prolonged the survival of adult and neonatal bg/bg-nu/nu mice compared to that of isogenic mice colonized with c. albicans alone. the incidence of systemic candidiasis in bg/bg-nu/nu mice was significantly reduced by each of the four probiotic bacterial species. the numbers of c. albicans present in the alimentary tracts of euthymic bg/bg-nu/+ mice were significantly reduced by l. casei gg and b. animalis. none of the probiotic bacteria species completely prevented mucosal candidiasis, but b. animalis reduced its incidence and severity. probiotic bacteria also modulated antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses to c. albicans. the prolonged survival of mice, decreased severity of mucosal and systemic candidiasis, modulation of immune responses, decreased number of c. albicans in the alimentary tract, and reduced numbers of orogastric infections demonstrated not only that probiotic bacteria have biotherapeutic potential for prophylaxis against and therapy of this fungal disease but also that probiotic bacteria protect mice from candidiasis by a variety of immunologic (thymic and extrathymic) and nonimmunologic mechanisms in this model.

TI  == colonization of congenitally immunodeficient mice with probiotic bacteria.
AB  == we assessed the capacity of four probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus casei gg, and bifidobacterium animalis) to colonize, infect, stimulate immune responses in, and affect the growth and survival of congenitally immunodeficient gnotobiotic beige-athymic (bg/bg-nu/nu)  and beige-euthymic (bg/bg-nu/+) mice. the bacteria colonized and persisted, in pure culture, in the alimentary tracts of both mouse strains for the entire study period (12 weeks). although all adult and neonatal beige-euthymic mice survived probiotic colonization, some infant mortality occurred in beige-athymic pups born to mothers colonized with pure cultures of l. reuteri or l. casei gg. the probiotic bacteria manifested different capacities to adhere to epithelial surfaces, disseminate to internal organs, affect the body weight of adult mice and the growth of neonatal mice, and stimulate immune responses. although the probiotic species were innocuous for adults, these results suggest that caution and further studies to assess the safety of probiotic bacteria for immunodeficient hosts, especially neonates, are required.

TI  == digoxigenin-labeled deoxyribonucleic acid probes for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == the numbers of bifidobacteria in fecal samples were specifically determined by colony hybridization with the mixture of digoxigenin-labeled dna probes that were prepared from whole chromosomal dna of bifidobacterium longum 6001 and bifidobacterium adolescentis 6003. these dna probes strongly hybridized with dna  of b. longum, b. adolescentis, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium angulatum, and bifidobacterium animalis. detectable positive signals with dna of bifidobacterium pseudolongum ssp. pseudolongum, bifidobacterium catenulatum, and bifidobacterium  thermophilum were also found after hybridization. when dot-blot hybridization was performed with whole cells of 47 reference strains containing 11 species (16 strains) of bifidobacteria, all of the bifidobacteria tested could be specifically detected by using these dna probes; lactobacillus fermentum jcm 1173, however, showed a slight nonspecific signal. the counts of bifidobacteria by colony hybridization in the fecal samples of four of the five subjects were the same as the counts that were obtained by the conventional method using bl agar medium. furthermore, no significant difference existed in the number of bifidobacteria that were determined by either method.

TI  == antiproliferative effect of fermented milk on the growth of a human breast cancer cell line.
AB  == in vivo and in vitro studies have shown an antitumor activity of lactobacilli in  colon cancer, and some epidemiologic studies have indicated a reduced risk of breast cancer in women who consume fermented milk products. we studied the direct effect of milk fermented by five bacteria strains (bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium animalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus paracasei) on the growth of the mcf7 breast cancer cell line. our results showed a growth inhibition induced by all fermented milks, even though b. infantis and l. acidophilus were the most effective (85% inhibition after 9 days). the antiproliferative effect was not related to the presence of bacteria in fermented milk, and neither whole milk (crude or ultrahigh temperature sterlizied) nor its main fractions (lactalbumin or beta-lactoglobulin fraction) affected cell growth. our findings suggest the presence of an ex novo soluble compound produced by lactic acid bacteria during milk fermentation or the microbial transformation of some milk components in a biologically active form. although the mechanism of the antitumor activity is not clear, the present study  suggests the potentiality offered by fermented milk as producers of compounds with antiproliferative activity useful in the prevention and therapy of solid tumors like breast cancer.
