TI  == improved in vitro assay for determining the mucin adherence of bacteria sensitive to triton x-100 treatment.
AB  == mucin-associated microbiota are in relatively close contact with the intestinal epithelium and may thus have a more pronounced effect on host health. we have previously developed a simple mucin agar assay to simulate initial mucus colonization by intestinal microbial communities. adherence of microbiota was estimated using flow cytometry after detachment with triton x-100. in this study, the effect of this detergent on the cultivability of both virulent and commensal  strains was investigated. mucin attachment of selected strains was evaluated using the mucin adhesion assay. bacteria were dislodged from the mucin surface by incubation with triton or from the whole mucin agar layer using a stomacher. mechanical extraction resulted in 1.24 +/- 0.42, 2.69 +/- 0.44, and 1.56 +/- 0.85 log cfu/ml higher plate counts of lactobacillus rhamnosus, bacillus cereus, and escherichia coli strains, respectively, than the chemical method. the sensitivity of bacteria to triton varied among microbial species and strains. among others, triton inhibited the growth of salmonella enterica lmg 10396 and pseudomonas aeruginosa lmg 8029 on laboratory media, although these bacteria maintained their viability during this treatment. only gram-positive strains, enterococcus hirae lmg 6399 and l. rhamnosus gg, were not affected by this detergent. therefore, the mechanical method is recommended for the extraction of mucin-adhered bacteria that are sensitive to triton, especially when followed by traditional cultivation techniques. however, this approach can also be recommended for strains that are not affected by this detergent, because it resulted in higher recovery of adhered l. rhamnosus gg compared to the chemical extraction.

TI  == the potential probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus ctc1679 survives the passage through the gastrointestinal tract and its use as starter culture results in safe nutritionally enhanced fermented sausages.
AB  == the human-derived potential probiotic strain lactobacillus rhamnosus ctc1679 was  used as a starter culture in reduced fat and sodium low-acid fermented sausages (fuets) to assess its ability to survive through the gastrointestinal tract (git) in a human intervention study consisting of 5 healthy volunteers who consumed 25  g fuet a day for 21 days. faecal samples were analysed during and after consumption. l. rhamnosus ctc1679 produced a transient colonisation of the human  git and persisted during the ingestion period of fuet containing l. rhamnosus ctc1679 at levels ca. 8log cfu/g. after 3 days of non-consumption, the strain was still recovered in the faeces of all the volunteers. to evaluate the safety of the nutritionally enhanced manufactured fuets, a challenge test was designed in a separately manufactured batch. l. rhamnosus ctc1679 was able to grow, survive and dominate (levels ca. 10(8) cfu/g) the endogenous lactic acid bacteria (lab), prevented the growth of listeria monocytogenes throughout the whole ripening process of the fuets and eliminated salmonella. after 35 days of storage at 4 degrees c, l. monocytogenes was not detected, achieving absence in 25 g of the product. the application of high hydrostatic pressure (hhp) treatment (600 mpa for 5 min) at the end of ripening (day 14) produced an immediate reduction of l.  monocytogenes to levels <1log cfu/g. after 35 days of storage at 4 degrees c the  pathogen was not detected. thus, the strain l. rhamnosus ctc1679 is a suitable starter culture for producing safe potentially probiotic fermented sausages.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the mucin-adhesion ability and probiotic potential of lactobacillus mucosae lm1.
AB  == aims: in this report, we characterized the probiotic potential of lactobacillus mucosae lm1, focusing on its in vitro mucin-adhesion abilities. methods and results: screening assays were used to evaluate lm1. previous studies on lact. mucosae species have been performed, but few have examined the ability of this species to adhere to and colonize the intestinal mucosa. thus, adhesion, aggregation and pathogen inhibition assays of lm1 along with microbial adhesion to solvents (mats) assay were carried out in comparison with another putative probiotic, lactobacillus johnsonii pf01, and the commercial strain, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. based on mats assay, the cell surfaces of the lactobacilli strains  were found to be hydrophobic and highly electron-donating, but the average hydropathy (gravy) index of predicted surface-exposed proteins in the lm1 genome  indicated that most were hydrophilic. lm1 showed the highest adhesion, aggregation and hydrophobicity among the strains tested and significantly inhibited the adhesion of escherichia coli k88 and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium kccm 40253. correlations among adhesion, aggregation and hydrophobicity, as well as between coaggregation and displacement of e. coli, were observed. conclusions: increased adhesion may not always correlate with increased pathogen inhibition due to various strain-specific mechanisms. nevertheless, lm1 has promising probiotic properties that can be explored further using a genomics approach. significance and impact of the study: our data on adhesion of lm1 strain showed a significant correlation between adhesion, hydrophobicity of cell surface and autoaggregation. this study gives basic knowledge for the elucidation of the adhesion mechanism of lactobacillus sp. and  prediction of its adherence in specific host models.

TI  == pathogen exclusion properties of canine probiotics are influenced by the growth media and physical treatments simulating industrial processes.
AB  == aims: manufacturing process used in preparation of probiotic products may alter beneficial properties of probiotics. the effect of different growth media and inactivation methods on the protective properties of canine-originated probiotic  bacteria against adhesion of canine enteropathogens was investigated. methods and results: three established dog probiotics, lactobacillus fermentum vet9a, lactobacillus plantarum vet14a and lactobacillus rhamnosus vet16a, and their mixture were assessed using the dog mucus pathogen exclusion model. the pathogens used were enterococcus canis, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and clostridium perfringens. the effect of growth media, one reflecting laboratory and the other manufacture conditions, and viability (viable and heat inactivated, 80 degrees c per 30 min) on the pathogen exclusion properties of probiotics were  characterized. greater pathogen exclusion percentages were noted for probiotics growing in conditions reflecting manufacture when compared to laboratory (p < 0.05). inactivation of probiotics by heat (80 degrees c per 30 min) increased pathogen exclusion compared with their viable forms (p < 0.05). conclusions: manufacturing process conditions such as growth media, incubation temperature and pretreatment methods may significantly affect the protective properties of the tested strains. significance and impact of the study: growing conditions and pretreatment methods should be carefully considered when designing new probiotics to reduce the risk of common infections in dogs. the studied probiotics are promising potential feed additives for dogs.

TI  == tailoring the probiotic potential of non-starter lactobacillus strains from ripened parmigiano reggiano cheese by in vitro screening and principal component  analysis.
AB  == non-starter lactic acid bacteria (nslab) inhabiting fermented food have been recently revised as source of probiotic strains. here, we in vitro assessed the potential probiotic aptitude of a de-replicated set of nslab previously isolated  from long ripened parmigiano reggiano cheeses (22 lactobacillus rhamnosus, 18 lactobacillus paracasei, 3 lactobacillus casei, 2 lactobacillus harbinensis, and  2 lactobacillus fermentum). most strains showed moderate to good resistance to biological barriers, including bile salts, lysozyme, and simulated gastric and pancreatic juices. antimicrobial susceptibility tests against seven antimicrobials belonging to different categories showed that most strains are susceptible towards all the antibiotics, with the exception of vancomycin and streptomycin. the strains lost the streptomycin resistance when assayed on agar medium containing 0.5% bile salts, suggesting that detergent-like properties of cholic acids increase membrane permeability and mediate streptomycin susceptibility. no isolate showed bile salt hydrolase (bsh) activities, supporting that bile salts resistance and bsh activity are unpaired traits. finally, nslab strains had moderate to high auto-aggregative and hydrophobic phenotypes, whereas two subsets of 22 and 8 strains co-aggregated with escherichia coli and salmonella enterica s. typhimurium, respectively. a multivariate analysis was effective to segregate one l. casei and two l. rhamnosus strains showing physiological characteristics compatible with probiotic properties.

TI  == genotoxicity assessment of multispecies probiotics using reverse mutation, mammalian chromosomal aberration, and rodent micronucleus tests.
AB  == genotoxicity assessment is carried out on freeze dried powder of cultured probiotics containing lactobacillus rhamnosus lcr177, bifidobacterium adolescentis ba286, and pediococcus acidilactici pa318. ames tests, in vitro mammalian chromosome aberration assay, and micronucleus tests in mouse peripheral blood are performed. for 5 strains of salmonella typhimurium, the ames tests show no increased reverse mutation upon exposure to the test substance. in cho cells,  the frequency of chromosome aberration does not increase in responding to the treatment of probiotics. likewise, the frequency of micronucleated reticulocytes  in probiotics-fed mice is indistinguishable from that in the negative control group. taken together, the toxicity assessment studies suggest that the multispecies probiotic mixture does not have mutagenic effects on various organisms.

TI  == adhesive ability means inhibition activities for lactobacillus against pathogens  and s-layer protein plays an important role in adhesion.
AB  == eighty-five strains of lactobacillus were isolated from the pig intestine and identified by sequencing analysis based on 16s rrna gene, from which five lactobacillus strains with high adhesive ability were selected. the inhibition ability of the five lactobacillus strains with or without s-layer proteins against adherence of escherichia coli k88 and salmonella enteritidis 50335 to caco-2 was evaluated in vitro with lactobacillus rhamnosus gg strain (lgg) as a positive control. in addition, tolerance of lactobacilli to heat, acid, bile, zn(2+) and cu(2+) were assessed. all five selected strains, lactobacillus salivarius zj614 (jn981856), lactobacillus reuteri zj616 (jn981858), l. reuteri zj617 (jn981859), l. reuteri zj621 (jn981863) and l. reuteri zj623 (jn981865), showed inhibition against the two pathogens, e. coli k88 and s. enteritidis 50335. l. reuteri zj621 showed higher inhibition ability than the others to s. enteritidis 50335 (p < 0.05). sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) analysis indicated that all five strains had abundant  bands with molecular weight ranging from 34 to 130 kda as well as had a common band of approximately 42 kda. after treatment with 5 m licl to remove s-layer protein, the inhibition activities of the lactobacilli against pathogens decreased significantly (p < 0.05). the results showed that higher adhesive ability means higher inhibition activity for lactobacillus against pathogen, in which s-layer proteins plays an important role.

TI  == the expression of adhesin ef-tu in response to mucin and its role in lactobacillus adhesion and competitive inhibition of enteropathogens to mucin.
AB  == aims: to analyse the expression of ef-tu in lactobacillus strains with response to mucin exposure and its role in interfering with adhesion of enteropathogens to mucin. methods and results: the lactobacillus strains were analysed for their ability to adhere to immobilized mucin in microtiter plates. lactobacillus delbrueckii m and lactobacillus plantarum cs24.2 showed statistically significant adhesion to mucin, which was similar to lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, the best binding probiotic strain. lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lact. delbrueckii m, lact.  plantarum cs23 and lact. plantarum cs24.2 were able to effectively antagonize the adhesion of escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhi to mucin. in the presence of lactobacillus adhesin - ef-tu, the adhesion of lact. delbrueckii  m and the strains of lact. plantarum to mucin was significantly inhibited. similarly, ef-tu also reduced the adhesion of enteropathogens to mucin. furthermore, the relative fold change in gene expression analysis showed significant up-regulation of ef-tu gene in the strains of lact. plantarum and lact. delbrueckii m when exposed to mucin for 3 h. conclusions: the study shows the significant role of ef-tu in lactobacilli adhesion and enteropathogens inhibition. significance and impact of the study: the study suggests ef-tu as an  important factor linked to the lactobacillus adhesion as well as enteropathogen inhibition. lactobacillus plantarum cs23 and lact. plantarum cs24.2 can be used as potential probiotic strains.

TI  == study of probiotic potential of four wild lactobacillus rhamnosus strains.
AB  == the four wild lactobacillus rhamnosus strains were examined in vitro for resistance to simulated gastro and intestinal juices, adhesion to ht-29 cells, antagonistic activity against enteric pathogens and immunomodulating activity. the strains l. rhamnosus sb5l, j5l and in1l were able to survive in simulated gastro juice while the strain l. rhamnosus sb31l lost viability exposed to simulated gastro juice for 3 h. the four strains had high viability in simulated  small intestinal juice with little loss (<1.0 cycle reduction). the strains sb5l, j5l and in1l antagonized against escherichia coli atcc 25922, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 14028, shigella sonnei atcc 25931. the strain l. rhamnosus in1l had the highest adhesive capability to ht-29 cells in vitro (251 bacteria cells per 100 ht-29 cells) compared to the other three l. rhamnosus strains. the live bacteria, cell wall and dna of the four l. rhamnosus induced the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines il-12 (p70), ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha  by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs). the levels of il-12 (p70), ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha produced by stimulated pbmcs were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those of the control. those data indicated that the four l. rhamnosus strains have the potential as the probiotic for human being use, although further studies are still needed.

TI  == competitive inhibition of three novel bacteria isolated from faeces of breast milk-fed infants against selected enteropathogens.
AB  == numerous in vitro and in vivo studies conducted using different probiotic micro-organisms have demonstrated their ability to interfere with the growth and  virulence of a variety of enteropathogens. the reported beneficial effects of the use of probiotics to complement antibiotic therapy or prevent diarrhoea or gastrointestinal infection in infants have increased in recent years. in the present study, we demonstrated the capacity of supernatants obtained from three novel probiotics (lactobacillus paracasei cncm i-4034, bifidobacterium breve cncm i-4035 and lactobacillus rhamnosus cncm i-4036) isolated from the faeces of breastfed infants to inhibit the growth of enterotoxigenic and enteropathogenic (epec) bacteria, such as escherichia coli, salmonella and shigella. to assess their potential antimicrobial activity, the 17 and 24 h cell-free supernatants broth concentrates (10x) having 1, 2 or 4 % of the three probiotics were incubated with epec bacteria strains. after 17 h of co-culture, the supernatants  were able to inhibit the growth of e. coli, salmonella and shigella up to 40, 55  and 81 %, respectively. however, the inhibitory capacity of some supernatants was maintained or completely lost when the supernatants (ph 3.0) were neutralised (ph 6.5). overall, these results demonstrated that l. paracasei cncm i-4034, b. breve cncm i-4035 and l. rhamnosus cncm i-4036 produce compounds that exhibited strain-specific inhibition of enterobacteria and have the potential to be used as probiotics in functional foods.

TI  == probiotic-mediated competition, exclusion and displacement in biofilm formation by food-borne pathogens.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine the inhibitory effect of probiotic strains on pathogenic biofilm formation in terms of competition, exclusion and displacement. probiotic strains (lactobacillus acidophilus kacc 12419, lact. casei kacc 12413, lact. paracasei kacc 12427 and lact. rhamnosus kacc 11953) and  pathogens (salmonella typhimurium kccm 40253 and listeria monocytogenes kacc 12671) were used to evaluate the auto-aggregation, hydrophobicity and biofilm formation inhibition. the highest auto-aggregation abilities were observed in lact. rhamnosus (17.5%), lact. casei (17.2%) and lact. acidophilus (15.1%). salm. typhimurium had the highest affinity to xylene, showing the hydrophobicity of 53.7%. the numbers of l. monocytogenes biofilm cells during the competition, exclusion and displacement assays were effectively reduced by more than 3 log when co-cultured with lact. paracasei and lact. rhamnosus. the results suggest that probiotic strains can be used as alternative way to effectively reduce the biofilm formation in pathogenic bacteria through competition, exclusion and displacement.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == effects of bile salt deconjugation by probiotic strains on the survival of antibiotic-resistant foodborne pathogens under simulated gastric conditions.
AB  == this study was designed to evaluate the effects of bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains on the antibiotic susceptibility of antibiotic-sensitive and multiple antibiotic-resistant salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus. eight probiotic strains, bifidobacterium longum b6, lactobacillus acidophilus adh, lactobacillus brevis kacc 10553, lactobacillus casei kacc 12413, lactobacillus paracasei atcc 25598, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, leuconostoc mesenteroides kacc 12312, and pediococcus acidilactici kacc 12307, were used to examine bile acid tolerance. the ability to deconjugate bile acids was evaluated  using both thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography.  the antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out to determine the synergistic inhibitory activity of deconjugated bile acids. l. acidophilus, l. brevis, and p. acidilactici showed the most tolerance to the conjugated bile acids. p. acidilactici deconjugated glycocholic acid and glycodeoxycholate from 3.18 and 3.09 mm to the detection limits, respectively. the antibiotic susceptibility of selected foodborne pathogens was increased by increasing the concentration of deconjugated bile acids. the study results are useful for understanding the relationship between bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains and antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of deconjugated bile acids, and they may be useful for designing new probiotic-antibiotic combination therapy based on bile acid deconjugation.

TI  == in vitro screening of lactobacilli isolated from chicken excreta to control salmonella enteritidis and typhimurium.
AB  == 1. the aim of this work was to select lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains from chicks and hens of egg-laying strains for potential use to control salmonellae. 2. nineteen lab strains obtained from culture collections, and 24 strains isolated from excreta of laying hens and chicks, were evaluated for inhibitory capacities against two salmonella serotypes using a "spot-the-lawn" technique and other in vitro properties that could be predictive of antimicrobial activity. 3.  the size of the inhibition zone differed slightly between salmonella serotypes, however, the mean size of the salmonella inhibition zone differed greatly among the lab strains. lactobacillus salivarius, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. reuteri exhibited powerful inhibitory effects to each salmonella strain. 4. the result of the acid tolerance test showed that all l. salivarius, l. kitasatonis strains and each of l. ingluviei cannot survive in a low ph environment. in the bile acid tolerance assay, growth was inhibited in all strains, except l. kitasatonis he4, and a large inhibition was observed in most of the l. salivarius and l. crispatus strains. 5. the results demonstrate that some lab of poultry origin were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella and survive simulated passage through the gastrointestinal tract. the selected lab could act in the lower gastrointestinal tract to prevent salmonellosis in poultry.

TI  == antimicrobial and safety properties of lactobacilli isolated from two cameroonian traditional fermented foods.
AB  == twenty-one lactobacillus isolates from "sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. these isolates were preliminarily identified as lactobacillus plantarum (62%), lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting. twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, proteinase k) and inhibition of other lactobacillus spp. these  bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin g, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. the bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria,  several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the world health organization, as well as multidrug-resistant strains. these include staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare typhi, bacillus cereus, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae and shigella flexneri. these lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.

TI  == the antimicrobial properties of the lowbush blueberry (vaccinium angustifolium) fractional components against foodborne pathogens and the conservation of probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  == the antimicrobial properties of lowbush blueberry (vaccinium angustifolium) were  studied against escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, and lactobacillus rhamnosus to determine which fractional components have antimicrobial effects and which microorganisms are most susceptible to these antimicrobial properties. lowbush blueberry extract (f1) was separated using a c-18 sep-pak cartridge into monomeric phenolics (f2) and anthocyanins plus proanthocyanidins (f3). fraction 3 was further separated into anthocyanins (f4) and proanthocyanidins (f5) using a lh-20 sephadex column. each fraction was initially screened for antimicrobial properties using agar diffusion assay. treatments that demonstrated inhibition were further analyzed for inhibition in liquid culture. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) were determined using a two-fold dilution series and viable cell counts taken at 0 and 24 h to examine growth reduction. fraction  3 demonstrated the lowest mics/mbcs followed by f1, f2, f4, and f5. l. monocytogenes was the most susceptible to blueberry fraction treatment, followed  by e. coli o157:h7, and s. typhimurium. l. rhamnosus was the least susceptible to each fraction treatment. the results can be applied to the field of preventive medicine, food safety, and enrich the understanding of the health benefits of lowbush blueberries.

TI  == lingonberry (vaccinium vitis-idaea) and european cranberry (vaccinium microcarpon) proanthocyanidins: isolation, identification, and bioactivities.
AB  == european, small-fruited cranberries (vaccinium microcarpon) and lingonberries (vaccinium vitis-idaea) were characterized for their phenolic compounds and tested for antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiadhesive, and antiinflammatory effects. the main phenolic compounds in both lingonberries and cranberries were proanthocyanidins comprising 63-71% of the total phenolic content, but anthocyanins, hydroxycinnamic acids, hydroxybenzoic acids, and flavonols were also found. proanthocyanidins are polymeric phenolic compounds consisting mainly  of catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin, and epigallocatechin units. in the present study, proanthocyanidins were divided into three groups: dimers and trimers, oligomers (mdp 4-10), and polymers (mdp > 10). catechin, epicatechin, a-type dimers and trimers were found to be the terminal units of isolated proanthocyanidin fractions. inhibitions of lipid oxidation in liposomes were over 70% and in emulsions over 85%, and in most cases the oligomeric or polymeric fraction was the most effective. polymeric proanthocyanidin extracts of lingonberries and cranberries were strongly antimicrobial against staphylococcus  aureus, whereas they had no effect on other bacterial strains such as salmonella  enterica sv. typhimurium, lactobacillus rhamnosus and escherichia coli. polymeric fraction of cranberries and oligomeric fractions of both lingonberries and cranberries showed an inhibitory effect on hemagglutination of e. coli, which expresses the m hemagglutin. cranberry phenolic extract inhibited lps-induced no  production in a dose-dependent manner, but it had no major effect on inos of cox-2 expression. at a concentration of 100 mug/ml cranberry phenolic extract inhibited lps-induced il-6, il-1beta and tnf-alpha production. lingonberry phenolics had no significant effect on il-1beta production but inhibited il-6 and tnf-alpha production at a concentration of 100 mug/ml similarly to cranberry phenolic extract. in conclusion the phenolics, notably proanthocyanidins (oligomers and polymers), in both lingonberries and cranberries exert multiple bioactivities that may be exploited in food development.

TI  == protective effect of lactobacillus casei strain shirota against lethal infection  with multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 in mice.
AB  == aims: the anti-infectious activity of lactobacilli against multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 (dt104) was examined in a murine model of an opportunistic antibiotic-induced infection. methods and results: explosive intestinal growth and subsequent lethal extra-intestinal translocation  after oral infection with dt104 during fosfomycin (fom) administration was significantly inhibited by continuous oral administration of lactobacillus casei  strain shirota (lcs), which is naturally resistant to fom, at a dose of 10(8) colony-forming units per mouse daily to mice. comparison of the anti-salmonella activity of several lactobacillus type strains with natural resistance to fom revealed that lactobacillus brevis atcc 14869(t) , lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917(t) , lactobacillus reuteri jcm 1112(t) , lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469(t) and lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741(t) conferred no activity even when they obtained the high population levels almost similar to those of the effective strains such as lcs, lact. casei atcc 334(t) and lactobacillus zeae atcc 15820(t) . the increase in concentration of organic acids and maintenance of the lower ph in the intestine because of lactobacillus colonization were correlated with the anti-infectious activity. moreover, heat-killed lcs was not protective against the infection, suggesting that the metabolic activity of lactobacilli is important for the anti-infectious activity. conclusion: these results suggest that certain lactobacilli in combination with antibiotics may be  useful for prophylaxis against opportunistic intestinal infections by multi-drug  resistant pathogens, such as dt104. significance and impact of the study: antibiotics such as fom disrupt the metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiota that produce organic acids, and that only probiotic strains that are metabolically active in vivo should be selected to prevent intestinal infection when used clinically in combination with certain antibiotics.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  == this study assessed potential probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. five lactobacillus isolates identified as lactobacillus reuteri  f03, lactobacillus paracasei f08, lactobacillus rhamnosus f14, lactobacillus plantarum c06, and lactobacillus acidophilus c11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. all the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to caco-2 cells, particularly, strain l. plantarum c06 and l. reuteri f03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain l. rhamnosus gg. the strains l. paracasei f08 and l. acidophilus c11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. all the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both gram-positive (bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (escherichia coli and salmonella enterica) pathogens. moreover, the strains l. reuteri f03, l. paracasei f08, and l. plantarum c06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/ml after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees c. the viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/ml after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees c. in the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. technologically interesting lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.

AB  == microbial colonization is an important step in establishing pathogenic or probiotic relations to host cells and in biofilm formation on industrial or medical devices. the aim of this work was to verify the applicability of quantitative pcr (real-time pcr) to measure bacterial colonization of epithelial  cells. salmonella enterica and caco-2 intestinal epithelial cell line was used as a model. to verify sensitivity of the assay a competition of the pathogen cells to probiotic microorganism was tested. the qpcr method was compared to plate count and radiolabel approach, which are well established techniques in this area of research. the three methods returned similar results. the best quantification  accuracy had radiolabel method, followed by qpcr. the plate count results showed  coefficient of variation two-times higher than this of qpcr. the quantitative pcr proved to be a reliable method for enumeration of microbes in colonization assay. it has several advantages that make it very useful in case of analyzing mixed populations, where several different species or even strains can be monitored at  the same time.

TI  == evaluation of antimicrobial activity of probiotic bacteria against salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium 1344 in a common medium under different environmental conditions.
AB  == the importance of probiotics in human nutrition has been gaining recognition in recent years. these organisms have been shown to promote human health by enhancing immunological and digestive functions and fighting respiratory tract infections. we propose an improved in vitro model for the study of probiotic antimicrobial activity against enteropathogens, by attempting to re-create, in a  common culture medium, environmental growth conditions comparable to those present in the small intestine. a preliminary experiment was carried out in order to find a culture medium able to support both probiotics and pathogens. this was  done with the aim of obtaining correct assessment of the interaction under shared growth conditions. bhi medium was selected as the common culture medium and was therefore used in antimicrobial activity assays. the interactions between salmonella 1344 and lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus reuteri were then assessed at different ph and oxygen availability conditions mimicking the small intestinal environment. l. rhamnosus gg atcc 53103 (lgg) had the strongest antimicrobial effect, in particular under anaerobic conditions and at lower ph levels. its antagonistic activity involved both lactic acid and secreted non-lactic acid molecules. our findings suggest that each probiotic strain has an optimum range of action and should therefore be thoroughly investigated to optimize its use.

TI  == immunomodulatory activity of lactobacillus rhamnosus strains isolated from goat milk: impact on intestinal and respiratory infections.
AB  == the immune stimulation induced by lactobacillus rhamnosus crl1505 (lr05) and l. rhamnosus crl1506 (lr06) on the resistance to infection with an intestinal pathogen (salmonella typhimurium) and a respiratory pathogen (streptococcus pneumoniae) was studied in swiss-albine mice experimental models. the cytokine profiles that induced the innate and specific immune response in both infectious  processes were investigated. both strains were able to improve resistance against the intestinal pathogen. only lr05 was able to induce a significant decrease in the number of s. pneumoniae in the lung, prevent its dissemination into the blood and induce a significant increase in th1 (inf-gamma) and th2 (il-6, il-4 and il-10) cytokine levels in the bronchoalveolar lavages (bal). the changes in the cytokines profiles in bal were associated with an increase in the number and activity of phagocytic cells and with the increase in specific antibodies in serum and bal, which would explain the increased resistance to the challenge. the administration of lr06 did not induce significant effects at the respiratory mucosal level. the results described in the present paper showed that certain lab strains can share certain functional properties, although some of them can perform a functional role better than others, so that it is important to perform  careful studies on specific strains, according to their therapeutic use.

TI  == effects of enteropathogenic bacteria & lactobacilli on chemokine secretion & toll like receptor gene expression in two human colonic epithelial cell lines.
AB  == background & objective: the intestinal epithelium is part of the innate immune system responding to contact with pathogenic or commensal bacteria. the objective of this study was to compare innate responses of intestinal epithelial cell lines to pathogenic bacteria and to lactobacilli. methods: two human intestinal epithelial cell lines, ht29 (enterocyte-like) and t84 (crypt-like), were exposed  to pathogenic bacteria representative of non invasive (vibrio cholerae o1 and o139), adherent (enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli, ehec) or invasive (salmonella typhimurium and shigella flexneri) phenotypes and to non pathogenic lactobacillus rhamnosus gg or lactobacillus plantarum. interleukin-8 (il-8) was measured in culture supernatant by elisa, while mrna from cells was subjected to  quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr for several other chemokines (cxcl1, ccl5  and cxcl5) and for toll-like receptors (tlr) 2, 4, 5 and 9. results: v. cholerae, s. typhimurium, s. flexneri and ehec induced il-8 secretion from epithelial cells into the medium. salmonella, shigella and ehec, but not v. cholerae, significantly increased mrna expression of cxcl1. none of the pathogens induced ccl5 or cxcl5. salmonella and vibrio significantly increased tlr4 expression, while vibrio and ehec decreased tlr5 expression. ehec also decreased tlr9 expression. lactobacilli attenuated the il-8 response of the cell lines to v. cholerae, salmonella, and ehec but did not significantly change the il-8 response to shigella. interpretation & conclusion: distinct patterns of epithelial cell chemokine responses were induced by the bacterial pathogens studied and these were modulated by commensal lactobacilli. alterations in tlr expression by these  pathogens are likely to be important in pathogenesis.

TI  == salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium adhesion and cytotoxicity during epithelial cell stress is reduced by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg.
AB  == background: physiological stressors may alter susceptibility of the host intestinal epithelium to infection by enteric pathogens. in the current study, cytotoxic effect, adhesion and invasion of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (s. typhimurium) to caco-2 cells exposed to thermal stress (41 degrees c, 1 h) was investigated. probiotic bacteria have been shown to reduce interaction of pathogens with the epithelium under non-stress conditions and may  have a significant effect on epithelial viability during infection; however, probiotic effect on pathogen interaction with epithelial cells under physiological stress is not known. therefore, we investigated the influence of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactobacillus gasseri on salmonella adhesion and salmonella-induced cytotoxicity of caco-2 cells subjected to thermal stress. results: thermal stress increased the cytotoxic effect of both s. typhimurium (p  = 0.0001) and nonpathogenic e. coli k12 (p = 0.004) to caco-2 cells, and resulted in greater susceptibility of cell monolayers to s. typhimurium adhesion (p = 0.001). thermal stress had no significant impact on inflammatory cytokines released by caco-2 cells, although exposure to s. typhimurium resulted in greater than 80% increase in production of il-6 and il-8. blocking s. typhimurium with anti-shda antibody prior to exposure of salmonella decreased adhesion (p = 0.01)  to non-stressed and thermal-stressed caco-2 cells. pre-exposure of caco-2 cells to l. rhamnosus gg significantly reduced salmonella-induced cytotoxicity (p = 0.001) and salmonella adhesion (p = 0.001) to caco-2 cells during thermal stress, while l. gasseri had no effect. conclusion: results suggest that thermal stress increases susceptibility of intestinal epithelial caco-2 cells to salmonella adhesion, and increases the cytotoxic effect of salmonella during infection. use  of l. rhamnosus gg as a probiotic may reduce the severity of infection during epithelial cell stress. mechanisms by which thermal stress increases susceptibility to s. typhimurium colonization and by which l. rhamnosus gg limits the severity of infection remain to be elucidated.

TI  == lactobacilli stimulate the innate immune response and modulate the tlr expression of ht29 intestinal epithelial cells in vitro.
AB  == the potentially probiotic strain lactobacillus plantarum bfe 1685 isolated from a child's faeces and the probiotic strain lactobacillus rhamnosus gg were investigated for their capability to influence the innate immune response of ht29 intestinal epithelial cells towards salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. furthermore, their capacity to modulate toll-like receptor expression of ht29 cells was investigated at the mrna and protein levels. tnf-alpha was used in cell culture with ht29 cells to mimic an inflammatory background, and in the presence  of this chemokine ht29 cells were sensitised to respond to the lactobacillus strains as evidenced by an increased response in il-8 production. in addition, when ht29 cells were first treated with lactobacilli and then infected with s. typhimurium, the il-8 levels in response to s. typhimurium were significantly higher, indicating that ht29 cells were sensitised by lactobacilli. neither of the lactobacilli was able to stimulate tlr4 production at the mrna level, however, tlr2 and tlr9 transcription levels measured by quantitative pcr were up-regulated when ht29 cells were incubated with lactobacilli, but not with s. typhimurium. up-regulation of tlr9 expression was higher for l. rhamnosus gg than for l. plantarum bfe 1685. expression levels of tlr2 and tlr5 were enhanced also  at the protein level as determined by flow cytometry after staining with the respective antibodies. in contrast, tlr9 expression was not significantly up-regulated, which may be explained by protein degradation, or possible down-stream regulatory effects. these findings show that stimulation of specific  signaling pathways occurs in the cross-talk between probiotic bacteria and gut epithelium cells, which can help to explain the adjuvant properties of probiotic  lactobacilli.

TI  == campylobacter jejuni drives myd88-independent interleukin-6 secretion via toll-like receptor 2.
AB  == gastrointestinal disease caused by campylobacter jejuni is characterized by localized inflammation and the destruction of the epithelial cell barrier that forms host innate protection against pathogens. this can lead to an imbalance in  fluid transport across the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in severe diarrhea.  the mechanisms of host cell receptor recognition of c. jejuni and downstream immune signaling pathways leading to this inflammatory disease, however, remain unclear. the aim of this study was to analyze the mechanisms involved in c. jejuni induction of the acute-phase inflammatory response regulator interleukin-6 (il-6). polarized intestinal epithelial caco-2 monolayers responded to infections with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and eight isolates of c. jejuni by an increase in levels of expression and secretion of il-6. no such il-6 response, however, was produced upon infection with the human commensal organism lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. the il-6 signaling pathway was further characterized  using short interfering rna complexes to block gene expression. the inhibition of myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (myd88) expression in this manner did not affect c. jejuni-induced il-6 secretion, suggesting a myd88-independent route to il-6 signal transduction in c. jejuni-infected human epithelial cells. however, a significant reduction in levels of il-6 was evident  in the absence of toll-like receptor 2 (tlr-2) expression, implying a requirement for tlr-2 in c. jejuni recognition. caco-2 cells were also treated with heat-inactivated and purified membrane components of c. jejuni to isolate the factor responsible for triggering il-6 signaling. the results demonstrate that c. jejuni surface polysaccharides induce il-6 secretion from intestinal epithelial cells via tlr-2 in a myd88-independent manner.

TI  == the potential influence of fruit polyphenols on colonic microflora and human gut  health.
AB  == the effect of common dietary polyphenols on growth of human gut bacteria and their adhesion to enterocytes was investigated. the influence on the growth of a  probiotic (lactobacillus rhamnosus), a commensal (escherichia coli) and two pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium) was determined, together with effects on adhesion of pathogenic and probiotic bacteria to cultured caco-2 cells. all polyphenols, except rutin, were found to affect the viability of representative gut flora in vitro, at doses likely to be  present in the gastrointestinal tract, but to differing degrees. naringenin and quercetin were the most active with the lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations  for all the four bacteria tested. the remaining polyphenols had the most marked effect on the gram positive enteropathogen s. aureus. naringenin and phloridzin were the most effective inhibitors of s. typhimurium adherence to caco-2 enterocytes while phloridzin and rutin enhanced the adherence of the probiotic l. rhamnosus. polyphenols appear to have potential to alter gut microecology and, by affecting the total number of beneficial microflora in the gut, may confer positive gut health benefits.

TI  == subtractive screening for probiotic properties of lactobacillus species from the  human gastrointestinal tract in the search for new probiotics.
AB  == in the search for new probiotics, 61 lactobacillus spp. isolates, belonging to 12 species and isolated as dominant lactic acid bacteria from the feces of healthy humans, were subjected to a subtractive system of in vitro analyses, which included desirable and undesirable traits. twenty-four isolates were able to grow in 2% bovine bile, of which 13 grew in acidified broth at ph 3.5 in acidified cysteine-containing mrs broth. intrinsic resistance to certain antimicrobial agents (cefoxitin, metronidazole, vancomycin) was observed in most isolates, but  atypical resistances to erythromycin, clindamycin, or tetracycline were also found in 5 strains. undesirable traits such as alpha-chymotrypsin or n-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activities were not detected, but low beta-glucuronidase and moderate beta-glucosidase activities were recorded in 2 strains. two lactobacillus gasseri and 2 lactobacillus paracasei selected strains inhibited several intestinal pathogens in an agar spot test, including strains of escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus. they also adhered to human caco-2 and ht-29 epithelial cells in a manner comparable to lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg, and were unable to degrade pig gastric mucin in a plate assay. together, these results suggest these 4 strains to be good probiotic candidates, concluding that the subtractive screening devised in this work could be a valuable tool in large-scale surveys for probiotics.

AB  == the effect of different types of probiotics present in yogurt over known populations of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes and salmonella enteritidis was evaluated. the three types of yogurt used were: without added probiotics, with added probiotics (lactobacillus casei crl_431 and l. acidophilus crl_730 chr hansen) and another one with the same probiotics mentioned above and lactobacillus rhamnosus (lr-35) culture. about 10(9) cfu/ ml of each potentially pathogenic bacteria was added to each type of yogurt tested, and kept in refrigeration at 4 degrees c during its shelf life, about 30 days. bacterial count was done the initial day and every four days. results obtained show that there is a difference in the inhibition between yogurts without added probiotics and the commercial yogurt with added probiotics; there is a clear inhibitory effect of the last one over s. aureus, e. coli o157:h7 and listeria monocytogenes. the yogurt with added probiotics and l. rhamnosus did not show any additional inhibitory effect over the bacteria tested  when compared with the yogurt with added probiotics. s. enteritidis could not be  evaluated because it was not detectable in any yogurt samples evaluated four days after its inoculation. this study confirms the antagonic effect of probiotic cultures over potentially pathogenic bacteria for human beings and animals that may be present in food. nevertheless, the use of l. rhamnosus did not produce any additional inhibitory effect.

TI  == the lactobacillus plantarum strain aca-dc287 isolated from a greek cheese demonstrates antagonistic activity in vitro and in vivo against salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
AB  == aims: the purpose of this study was to investigate the antibacterial activity of  the xynotyri cheese isolate lactobacillus plantarum aca-dc287 using a set of in vitro and in vivo assays. methods and results: the co-culture of l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strain sl1344 results in the killing of the pathogen. the killing activity was produced mainly  by non-lactic acid molecule(s) that were present in the cell-free culture supernatant of the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287. the culture of the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 inhibited the penetration of s. typhimurium sl1344 into cultured human enterocyte-like caco-2/tc7 cells. in conventional mice infected with s. typhimurium sl1344, the intake of l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 results in a decrease in the levels of salmonella associated with intestinal tissues or those  present in the intestinal contents. in germ-free mice, the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 colonized the gastrointestinal tract. conclusions: the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 strain exerts anti-salmonella activity similar that of the established probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota yit9029 and lactobacillus johnsonii la1. significance and impact of the study: the observation that a selected cheese lactobacillus strain exerted antibacterial activity that was similar to those of probiotic lactobacillus strains, is of interest for the use of this strain as an adjunct strain for the production of health-giving cheeses.

TI  == adhesive and chemokine stimulatory properties of potentially probiotic lactobacillus strains.
AB  == five lactobacillus plantarum strains and two lactobacillus johnsonii strains, stemming either from african traditionally fermented milk products or children's  feces, were investigated for probiotic properties in vitro. the relationship between the hydrophobic-hydrophilic cell surface and adhesion ability to ht29 intestinal epithelial cells was investigated, and results indicated that especially the l. johnsonii strains, which exhibited both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface characteristics, adhered well to ht29 cells. four l. plantarum and two l. johnsonii strains showed high adherence to ht29 cells, generally higher than that of the probiotic control strain lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. most strains with high adhesion ability also showed high autoaggregation ability. the two l. johnsonii strains coaggregated well with the  intestinal pathogens listeria monocytogenes scott a, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 14028. the l. plantarum bfe 1685 and l. johnsonii 6128 strains furthermore inhibited the adhesion of at least two of these intestinal pathogens in coculture with ht29 cells in a strain-dependent way. these two potential probiotic strains  also significantly increased interleukin-8 (il-8) chemokine production by ht29 cells, although modulation of other cytokines, such as il-1, il-6, il-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and transforming growth factor beta (tgf-beta), did not occur. altogether, our results suggested that l. plantarum bfe 1685 and l. johnsonii bfe 6128 showed good adherence, coaggregated with pathogens, and stimulated chemokine production of intestinal epithelial cells, traits that may be considered promising for their development as probiotic strains.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by probiotic strains modify the adhesion of probiotics and enteropathogens to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == exopolysaccharides (epss) are exocellular polymers present in the surface of many bacteria, including lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. the genome sequence of several strains revealed the presence of eps-encoding genes. however, the physiological role that epss play in the bacterial ecology still remains uncertain. in this study, we have assessed the effect of epss produced by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium longum nb667, and bifidobacterium animalis ipla-r1 on the adhesion of probiotic and enteropathogen strains to human intestinal mucus. the eps fraction gg had no significant effect on the adhesion of l. rhamnosus gg and b. animalis ipla-r1. however, the eps fractions nb667 and  ipla-r1 significantly reduced the adherence of both probiotic strains. in contrast, the three eps fractions increased the adhesion of enterobacter sakazakii atcc 29544 and escherichia coli nctc 8603. higher adherence of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 29631 and clostridium difficile atcc 9689 was detected in the presence of the eps fractions gg and nb667. in general,  these effects were obtained at eps concentrations of up to 5 mg/ml, and they were eps dose dependent. the competitive exclusion of probiotics in the presence of eps could suggest the involvement of these biopolymers in the adhesion to mucus.  the increase in the adherence of enteropathogens could be explained if components of the pathogen surface are able to bind to specific epss and the bound epss are  able to adhere to mucus. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work reporting the effect of epss from probiotics on bacterial adhesion properties.

AB  == the mechanism(s) underlying the antibacterial activity of probiotic lactobacillus strains appears to be multifactorial and includes lowering of the ph and the production of lactic acid and of antibacterial compounds, including bacteriocins  and nonbacteriocin, non-lactic acid molecules. addition of dulbecco's modified eagle's minimum essential medium to the incubating medium delays the killing activity of lactic acid. we found that the probiotic strains lactobacillus johnsonii la1, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota yit9029, l. casei dn-114 001, and l. rhamnosus gr1 induced a dramatic decrease in the viability of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344 mainly attributable to non-lactic acid molecule(s) present in the cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs). these molecules were more active against serovar typhimurium sl1344 in the exponential growth phase than in the stationary growth phase. we also showed  that the production of the non-lactic acid substance(s) responsible for the killing activity was dependent on growth temperature and that both unstable and stable substances with killing activity were present in the cfcss. we found that  the complete inhibition of serovar typhimurium sl1344 growth results from a ph-lowering effect.

TI  == microarray analysis and motif detection reveal new targets of the salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium hila regulatory protein, including hila itself.
AB  == dna regulatory motifs reflect the direct transcriptional interactions between regulators and their target genes and contain important information regarding transcriptional networks. in silico motif detection strategies search for dna patterns that are present more frequently in a set of related sequences than in a set of unrelated sequences. related sequences could be genes that are coexpressed and are therefore expected to share similar conserved regulatory motifs. we identified coexpressed genes by carrying out microarray-based transcript profiling of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium in response to the spent culture supernatant of the probiotic strain lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. probiotics are live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts,  confer a health benefit on the host. they are known to antagonize intestinal pathogens in vivo, including salmonellae. s. enterica serovar typhimurium causes  human gastroenteritis. infection is initiated by entry of salmonellae into intestinal epithelial cells. the expression of invasion genes is tightly regulated by environmental conditions, as well as by many bacterial factors including the key regulator hila. one mechanism by which probiotics may antagonize intestinal pathogens is by influencing invasion gene expression. our microarray experiment yielded a cluster of coexpressed salmonella genes that are  predicted to be down-regulated by spent culture supernatant. this cluster was enriched for genes known to be hila dependent. in silico motif detection revealed a motif that overlaps the previously described hila box in the promoter region of three of these genes, spi4_h, sica, and hila. site-directed mutagenesis, beta-galactosidase reporter assays, and gel mobility shift experiments indicated  that sica expression requires hila and that hila is negatively autoregulated.

TI  == adhesion of bacteria to resected human colonic tissue: quantitative analysis of bacterial adhesion and viability.
AB  == adhesion to the intestinal mucosa is considered to be one of the main selection criteria of lactic acid bacteria for probiotic use. adhesive probiotics are, for  example, considered to provide better antagonism against pathogenic bacteria when compared to non-adhesive strains. here a new model is described for studying adhesion and interaction of probiotic and pathogenic bacteria in the intestinal mucus in which the intestinal microbiota is present. the model is based on the use of human intestinal tissue, fluorescent-tagged bacteria and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) in adhesion measurements as well as human intestinal mucus and bioluminescent-tagged bacteria in viability measurements. use of clsm enabled, for the first time, real-time three-dimensional observations of live probiotic bacteria in their natural environment, the intestinal mucosa. when the  real-time measurement of bacterial adhesion was combined with the real-time sensitive measurement of bacterial viability, it could be studied whether or not  the adherent pathogens were alive. the model was used to study the interaction between lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. we show that l. rhamnosus gg did not affect the adhesion or the viability of s. enterica serovar typhimurium. instead s. enterica serovar typhimurium was shown to decrease the adhesion of l. rhamnosus gg in displacement assays. moreover, the method is suitable for studies in which the interaction of two or more bacteria is examined in an environment in which other bacteria are present.

AB  == the mechanism of the apparent anti-inflammatory action of probiotic organisms is  unclear. lactobacillus reuteri is effective in inhibiting colitis in interleukin-10 (il-10)-deficient mice. nerve growth factor (ngf), in addition to  its activity on neuronal cell growth, has significant anti-inflammatory effects in several experimental systems in vitro and in vivo, including a model of colitis. our experiments were designed to explore the mechanism of effect of l. reuteri in the human epithelial cell lines t84 and ht29 on cytokine and ngf synthesis and il-8 response to tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha). epithelial cells were cultured for various times with live and killed l. reuteri  and examined by reverse transcription-pcr for ngf, il-10, and tnf-alpha-induced il-8 expression. an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantitate intracellular il-8 and secreted product. western blotting and confocal microscopy were used to determine the effects on ikappab and nf-kappab, respectively. live but not heat-killed or gamma-irradiated l. reuteri upregulated ngf and dose dependently inhibited constitutive synthesis by t84 and ht29 cells of il-8 and that induced by tnf-alpha in terms of mrna and intracellular and secreted protein. similarly, l. reuteri inhibited il-8 synthesis induced by salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. l. reuteri required preincubation and adherence for effect, inhibited translocation of nf-kappab to the nuclei of hela cells, and prevented degradation of ikappab. neither cellular lysates nor media supernatants had any effect on tnf-alpha-induced il-8. the conclusion is that l. reuteri has potent direct anti-inflammatory activity on human epithelial cells, which is likely to be related to the activity of ingested probiotics. l. reuteri also upregulates an unusual anti-inflammatory molecule, ngf, and inhibits nf-kappab translocation to the nucleus.

TI  == interaction between probiotic lactic acid bacteria and canine enteric pathogens:  a risk factor for intestinal enterococcus faecium colonization?
AB  == selected probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab) have been shown to elicit positive  health effects particularly in humans. competitive exclusion of pathogens is one  of the most important beneficial health claims of probiotic bacteria. the effect  of probiotic lab on competitive exclusion of pathogens has been demonstrated in humans, chicken and pigs. in this study we evaluated the ability of certain lab strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium lactis bb12, lactobacillus pentosus uk1a, l. pentosus sk2a, enterococcus faecium m74 and e. faecium sf273) to inhibit the adhesion of selected canine and zoonotic pathogens (staphylococcus intermedius, salmonella typhimurium atcc 14028, clostridium perfringens and campylobacter jejuni) to immobilised mucus isolated from canine jejunal chyme in  vitro. adhesion of c. perfringens was reduced significantly by all tested lab strains, between 53.7 and 79.1% of the control without lab, the lab of canine origin yielding the best reduction. the adhesion of s. typhimurium and s. intermedius were not significantly altered by any of the lab included in the study. both enterococci tested significantly enhanced the adhesion of c. jejuni,  to 134.6 and 205.5% of the control without lab. e. faecium may thus favor the adhesion and colonization of c. jejuni in the dog's intestine, making it a potential carrier and possibly a source for human infection. enhanced c. jejuni adhesion is a new potential risk factor of enterococci. our results further emphasize the importance of safety guidelines to be established for the probiotics intended for animal use.

TI  == protection against translocating salmonella typhimurium infection in mice by feeding the immuno-enhancing probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus strain hn001.
AB  == the probiotic lactic acid bacterium lactobacillus rhamnosus (strain hn001) is known to stimulate enhanced innate and acquired immune responses in mice. following oral delivery. here, the ability of hn001 to confer immune enhancement  and protection against an oral challenge of salmonella typhimurium was investigated. hn001-fed and non-probiotic-fed control balb/c mice were challenged with either a single dose of s. typhimurium (atcc strain 1772), or with five repeated daily doses of the pathogen; post-challenge clinical, behavioural, bacteriological and immunological parameters were assessed. mice began to show ostensible signs of infection 3-4 days following the initiation of salmonella challenge, and the first mortalities were observed after 6 days. following single-dose salmonella challenge, hn001-fed mice maintained a higher mean pre-mortality general health score than control mice; retained significantly greater food and water intake and weight gain, produced higher titres of serum and intestinal tract anti-salmonella antibodies, and showed greater overall survival of infection (27/30 mice surviving at 21 days post-challenge, compared to 2/29 in the control group). following repeated-dose salmonella challenge, hn001-fed mice had significantly lower mean pathogen burdens in visceral organs (spleen, liver) compared to controls, and additionally, blood and peritoneal leucocytes obtained from hn001-fed mice exhibited significantly higher ex vivo phagocytic capacity compared to control-mice. this study affirms that lb. rhamnosus strain hn001 displays immuno-enhancing properties in s. typhimurium-infected mice, and demonstrates that oral delivery of this probiotic  can promote increased protection against a highly virulent enteric bacterial pathogen.

TI  == the effect of probiotic bacteria on the adhesion of pathogens to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == human intestinal glycoproteins extracted from faeces were used as a model for intestinal mucus to investigate adhesion of pathogenic escherichia coli and salmonella strains, and the effect of probiotics on this adhesion. s-fimbriated e. coli expressed relatively high adhesion in the mucus model, but the other tested pathogens adhered less effectively. probiotic strains lactobacillus gg and l. rhamnosus lc-705 as well as a l. rhamnosus isolated from human faeces were able to slightly reduce s-fimbria-mediated adhesion. adhesion of s. typhimurium was significantly inhibited by probiotic l. johnsonii lj1 and l. casei shirota. lactobacillus gg and l. rhamnosus (human isolate) increased the adhesion of s. typhimurium suggesting that the pathogen interacts with the probiotic.
