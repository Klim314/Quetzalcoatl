effects of glass ionomer and microfilled composite subgingival restorations on periodontal tissue and subgingival biofilm: a 6-month evaluation.
background: this 6-month study evaluated the effects of resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (rmgi) and microfilled composite (mc) subgingival restorations on periodontal tissues and subgingival biofilm. methods: fifty-four periodontally healthy patients were assigned as follows: group 1 (n = 18), root exposure (re) without non-carious cervical lesions (nccl) treated with coronally positioned flap (cpf); group 2 (n = 18), re with nccl treated rmgi restorations plus cpf; group 3 (n = 18), re with nccl treated with mc restorations plus cpf. probing depth (pd), visible local plaque score (pl), and local bleeding on probing (bop) were assessed at baseline and 6 months after surgeries. restored and non-restored root recoverage (rr) was assessed at 6 months. each experimental tooth was subgingivally sampled (baseline and 6 months) and analyzed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: clinical results showed no significant differences among the groups regarding pl, bop, and pd at baseline and 6 months. the rr means were similar among the groups at 6 months. intragroup analyses revealed that the proportions of 10 periodontopathogens decreased at 6 months for the control group. for the rmgi group, there was a significant decrease in the proportions of nine periodontopathogens. for the mc group, there was a significant increase in the proportions of fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum and gemella morbillorum and a decrease in five periodontopathogens. intergroup analyses showed an increase in the proportion of f. nucleatum polymorphum for the mc group. conclusions: in a 6-month evaluation, well-finished rmgi or mc subgingival restorations did not negatively affect periodontal health. furthermore, rmgi seems to exert more positive effects on the subgingival biofilm composition than mc.
