TI  == disrupted intestinal microbiota and intestinal inflammation in children with cystic fibrosis and its restoration with lactobacillus gg: a randomised clinical  trial.
AB  == background & aims: intestinal inflammation is a hallmark of cystic fibrosis (cf). administration of probiotics can reduce intestinal inflammation and the incidence of pulmonary exacerbations. we investigated the composition of intestinal microbiota in children with cf and analyzed its relationship with intestinal inflammation. we also investigated the microflora structure before and after lactobacillus gg (lgg) administration in children with cf with and without antibiotic treatment. methods: the intestinal microbiota were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). intestinal inflammation was assessed by measuring fecal calprotectin (clp) and rectal nitric oxide (rno) production in children with cf as compared with healthy controls. we  then carried out a small double-blind randomized clinical trial with lgg. results: twenty-two children with cf children were enrolled in the study (median  age, 7 years; range, 2-9 years). fecal clp and rno levels were higher in children with cf than in healthy controls (184+/-146 microg/g vs. 52+/-46 microg/g; 18+/-15 vs. 2.6+/-1.2 micromol/l no2 (-), respectively; p<0.01). compared with healthy controls, children with cf had significantly different intestinal microbial core structures. the levels of eubacterium rectale, bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium catenulatum, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were reduced in children with cf. a similar but more extreme pattern was observed in children with cf who were taking antibiotics. lgg administration reduced fecal clp and partially restored intestinal microbiota. there was a significant correlation between reduced microbial richness and intestinal inflammation. conclusions: cf causes qualitative and quantitative changes in intestinal microbiota, which may represent a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of cf. administration of probiotics restored gut microbiota, supporting the efficacy of probiotics in reducing intestinal inflammation and pulmonary exacerbations. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct 01961661.

TI  == cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) allelic variants relate to shifts in faecal microbiota of cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  == introduction: in this study we investigated the effects of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) gene variants on the composition of faecal microbiota, in patients affected by cystic fibrosis (cf). cftr mutations (f508del is the most common) lead to a decreased secretion of chloride/water, and to mucus sticky secretions, in pancreas, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. intestinal manifestations are underestimated in cf, leading to ileum meconium at  birth, or small bowel bacterial overgrowth in adult age. methods: thirty-six cf patients, fasting and under no-antibiotic treatment, were cftr genotyped on both  alleles. faecal samples were subjected to molecular microbial profiling through temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis and species-specific pcr. ecological parameters and multivariate algorithms were employed to find out if cftr variants could be related to the microbiota structure. results: patients were classified by two different criteria: 1) presence/absence of f508del mutation; 2) disease severity in heterozygous and homozygous f508del patients. we found that homozygous-f508del and severe cf patients exhibited an enhanced dysbiotic faecal microbiota composition, even within the cf cohort itself, with higher biodiversity and evenness. we also found, by species-specific pcr, that potentially harmful species (escherichia coli and eubacterium biforme) were abundant in homozygous-f508del and severe cf patients, while beneficial species (faecalibacterium prausnitzii, bifidobacterium spp., and eubacterium limosum) were reduced. conclusions: this is the first report that establishes a link among cftr variants and shifts in faecal microbiota, opening the way to studies that perceive cf as a 'systemic disease', linking the lung and the gut in a joined axis.
