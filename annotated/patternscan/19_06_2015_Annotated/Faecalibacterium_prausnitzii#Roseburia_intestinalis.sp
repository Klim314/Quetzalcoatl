TI  == diets high in resistant starch and arabinoxylan modulate digestion processes and  scfa pool size in the large intestine and faecal microbial composition in pigs.
AB  == the effects of a high level of dietary fibre (df) either as arabinoxylan (ax) or  resistant starch (rs) on digestion processes, scfa concentration and pool size in various intestinal segments and on the microbial composition in the faeces were studied in a model experiment with pigs. a total of thirty female pigs (body weight 63.1 (sem 4.4) kg) were fed a low-df, high-fat western-style control diet  (wsd), an ax-rich diet (axd) or a rs-rich diet (rsd) for 3 weeks. diet significantly affected the digestibility of dm, protein, fat, nsp and nsp components, and the arabinose:xylose ratio, as well as the disappearance of nsp and ax in the large intestine. rs was mainly digested in the caecum. ax was digested at a slower rate than rs. the digesta from axd-fed pigs passed from the  ileum to the distal colon more than twice as fast as those from wsd-fed pigs, with those from rsd-fed pigs being intermediate (p< 0.001). axd feeding resulted  in a higher number of faecalibacterium prausnitzii, roseburia intestinalis, blautia coccoides-eubacterium rectale, bifidobacterium spp. and lactobacillus spp. in the faeces sampled at week 3 of the experimental period (p< 0.05). in the caecum, proximal and mid colon, axd feeding resulted in a 3- to 5-fold higher pool size of butyrate compared with wsd feeding, with the rsd being intermediate  (p <0.001). in conclusion, the rsd and axd differently affected digestion processes compared with the wsd, and the axd most efficiently shifted the microbial composition towards butyrogenic species in the faeces and increased the large-intestinal butyrate pool size.

TI  == microbiota and diabetes: an evolving relationship.
AB  == the gut microbiota affects numerous biological functions throughout the body and  its characterisation has become a major research area in biomedicine. recent studies have suggested that gut bacteria play a fundamental role in diseases such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. data are accumulating in animal  models and humans suggesting that obesity and type 2 diabetes (t2d) are associated with a profound dysbiosis. first human metagenome-wide association studies demonstrated highly significant correlations of specific intestinal bacteria, certain bacterial genes and respective metabolic pathways with t2d. importantly, especially butyrate-producing bacteria such as roseburia intestinalis and faecalibacterium prausnitzii concentrations were lower in t2d subjects. this supports the increasing evidence, that butyrate and other short-chain fatty acids are able to exert profound immunometabolic effects. endotoxaemia, most likely gut-derived has also been observed in patients with metabolic syndrome and t2d and might play a key role in metabolic inflammation. a further hint towards an association between microbiota and t2d has been derived from studies in pregnancy showing that major gut microbial shifts occurring during pregnancy affect host metabolism. interestingly, certain antidiabetic drugs such as metformin also interfere with the intestinal microbiota. specific members of the microbiota such as akkermansia muciniphila might be decreased in diabetes and when administered to murines exerted antidiabetic effects. therefore, as a 'gut signature' becomes more evident in t2d, a better understanding of the role of the microbiota in diabetes might provide new aspects regarding its pathophysiological relevance and pave the way for new therapeutic principles.

TI  == senior thai fecal microbiota comparison between vegetarians and non-vegetarians using pcr-dgge and real-time pcr.
AB  == the fecal microbiotas were investigated in 13 healthy thai subjects using polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). among the 186 dna bands detected on the polyacrylamide gel, 37 bands were identified as representing 11 species: bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides  ovatus, bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides vulgatus, clostridium colicanis, eubacterium eligenes, e. rectale, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, megamonas funiformis, prevotella copri, and roseburia intestinalis, belonging mainly to the groups of bacteroides, prevotella, clostridium, and f. prausnitzii. a dendrogram  of the pcr-dgge divided the subjects; vegetarians and non-vegetarians. the fecal  microbiotas were also analyzed using a quantitative real-time pcr focused on bacteroides, bifidobacterium, enterobacteriaceae, clostrium coccoides-eubacterium rectale, c. leptum, lactobacillus, and prevotella. the nonvegetarian and vegetarian subjects were found to have significant differences in the high abundance of the bacteroides and prevotella genera, respectively. no significant  differences were found in the counts of bifidabacterium, enterobacteriaceae, c. coccoides-e. rectale group, c. leptum group, and lactobacillus. therefore, these  findings on the microbiota of healthy thais consuming different diets could provide helpful data for predicting the health of south east asians with similar  diets.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus salivarius ls-33 on fecal microbiota in obese adolescents.
AB  == background & aims: this study is a part of the clinical trials with probiotic bacterium lactobacillus salivarius ls-33 conducted in obese adolescents. previously reported clinical studies showed no effect of ls-33 consumption on the metabolic syndrome in the subject group. the aim of the study was to investigate  the impact of l. salivarius ls-33 on fecal microbiota in obese adolescents. methods: the study was a double-blinded intervention with 50 subjects randomized  to intake of l. salivarius ls-33 or placebo for 12 weeks. the fecal microbiota was assessed by real-time quantitative pcr before and after intervention. concentrations of fecal short chain fatty acids were determined using gas chromatography. results: ratios of bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas group to  firmicutes belonging bacteria, including clostridium cluster xiv, blautia coccoides_eubacteria rectale group and roseburia intestinalis, were significantly increased (p </= 0.05) after administration of ls-33. the cell numbers of fecal bacteria, including the groups above as well as clostridium cluster i, clostridium cluster iv, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, enterobacteriaceae, enterococcus, the lactobacillus group and bifidobacterium were not significantly  altered by intervention. similarly, short chain fatty acids remained unaffected.  conclusion: l. salivarius ls-33 might modify the fecal microbiota in obese adolescents in a way not related to metabolic syndrome. clinical trial number: nct 01020617.

TI  == the antimicrobial action of chitosan, low molar mass chitosan, and chitooligosaccharides on human colonic bacteria.
AB  == antibacterial effect of chitooligosaccharides (cos) and low molar mass chitosans  (lmwc) is considered as one of the most important characteristics of chitosan (cs) hydrolysates. here, we show the in vitro effect of different cos, lmwc, and  cs on representative anaerobic bacteria isolated from human colon as a possibility of targeting modification of colonic microflora composition by supplementation of dietary cs products by humans. specific growth rate of seven selected nonpathogenic anaerobic bacterial strains (clostridium paraputrificum, clostridium beijerinckii, roseburia intestinalis, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteriodes thetaiotaomicron, faecalibacterium prausnitzii and blautia coccoides) was determined in the presence of 0.25 and 0.5% cos (2, 3, and 6 kda), 0.025 and  0.05% of lmwc (10 and 16 kda), and 0.025 and 0.1% of cs in vitro. the growth rate decreased in all strains in the presence of cos and lmwc in higher concentrations in comparison to control incubations. a relatively higher resistance to cs hydrolyzates was detected in r. intestinalis and f. prausnitzii, and more susceptible were bacteria belonging to bacteoides sp. and clostridium sp. the antimicrobial activity, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic), and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc) were determined. the antimicrobial activity increased with the degree of polymerization (dp). mic ranged from 0.25 to 4.5% in dependence on bacterial strain and dp of cs/lmwc. mbc also decreased with dp. the most effective antimicrobial action was detected in lmwc with 16 kda and cs. weak antimicrobial activity was found in cos with small molecules (2 and 3 kda).

TI  == studies on the effect of system retention time on bacterial populations colonizing a three-stage continuous culture model of the human large gut using fish techniques.
AB  == fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to quantitate bacteria growing in a three-stage continuous culture system inoculated with human faeces, operated at two system retention times (60 and 20 h). twenty-three different 16s rrna gene oligonucleotide probes of varying specificities were used to detect bacteria. organisms belonging to genera bacteroides and bifidobacterium, together with the  eubacterium rectale/clostridium coccoides group, the atopobium, faecalibacterium  prausnitzii and eubacterium cylindroides groups, as well as the segmented filamentous bacteria, the roseburia intestinalis group and lactic acid bacteria,  were all present in high numbers in the continuous culture system. other groups and species such as ruminococci and enterobacteria also persisted in the model, though not always at levels that allowed reliable quantitation. some organisms such as streptococci and corynebacteria, present in the faecal inoculum, did not  colonize the system. other probes specific for eubacterium lentum and for members of the genus desulfovibrio did not detect these organisms at any time. short chain fatty acid production was always highest in vessel i of the continuous culture system, however, a marked increase in acetate formation and a reduction in butyrate production occurred when system retention time was reduced to 20 h, which correlated with reductions in the numbers of butyrate-producing roseburia.

TI  == lactate-utilizing bacteria, isolated from human feces, that produce butyrate as a major fermentation product.
AB  == the microbial community of the human colon contains many bacteria that produce lactic acid, but lactate is normally detected only at low concentrations (<5 mm)  in feces from healthy individuals. it is not clear, however, which bacteria are mainly responsible for lactate utilization in the human colon. here, bacteria able to utilize lactate and produce butyrate were identified among isolates obtained from 10(-8) dilutions of fecal samples from five different subjects. out of nine such strains identified, four were found to be related to eubacterium hallii and two to anaerostipes caccae, while the remaining three represent a new  species within clostridial cluster xiva based on their 16s rrna sequences. significant ability to utilize lactate was not detected in the butyrate-producing species roseburia intestinalis, eubacterium rectale, or faecalibacterium prausnitzii. whereas e. hallii and a. caccae strains used both d- and l-lactate,  the remaining strains used only the d form. addition of glucose to batch cultures prevented lactate utilization until the glucose became exhausted. however, when two e. hallii strains and one a. caccae strain were grown in separate cocultures  with a starch-utilizing bifidobacterium adolescentis isolate, with starch as the  carbohydrate energy source, the l-lactate produced by b. adolescentis became undetectable and butyrate was formed. such cross-feeding may help to explain the  reported butyrogenic effect of certain dietary substrates, including resistant starch. the abundance of e. hallii in particular in the colonic ecosystem suggests that these bacteria play important roles in preventing lactate accumulation.

TI  == oligonucleotide probes that detect quantitatively significant groups of butyrate-producing bacteria in human feces.
AB  == 16s rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes were designed for butyrate-producing bacteria from human feces. three new cluster-specific probes detected bacteria related to roseburia intestinalis, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and eubacterium  hallii at mean populations of 2.3, 3.8, and 0.6%, respectively, in samples from 10 individuals. additional species-level probes accounted for no more than 1%, with a mean of 7.7%, of the total human fecal microbiota identified as butyrate producers in this study. bacteria related to e. hallii and the genera roseburia and faecalibacterium are therefore among the most abundant known butyrate-producing bacteria in human feces.

TI  == effects of alternative dietary substrates on competition between human colonic bacteria in an anaerobic fermentor system.
AB  == duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different carbohydrate energy sources. a panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16s rrna sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii, ruminococcus flavefaciens-ruminococcus bromii, eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides, and eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of  bacteria related to r. flavefaciens-r. bromii and e. cylindroides. the ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. the roseburia-related strain a2-183(f) was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex  carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by  cross-feeding. in contrast, roseburia intestinalis l1-82(r) and eubacterium sp. strain a2-194(r) survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that a2-194(r) was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. these results suggest that many low-g+c-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics  from their effects in vitro.
