TI  == bacteria and yeast microbiota in milk kefir grains from different italian regions.
AB  == kefir grains are a unique symbiotic association of different microrganisms, mainly lactic acid bacteria, yeasts and occasionally acetic acid bacteria, cohabiting in a natural polysaccharide and a protein matrix. the microbial composition of kefir grains can be considered as extremely variable since it is strongly influenced by the geographical origin of the grains and by the sub-culturing method used. the aim of this study was to elucidate the bacteria and yeast species occurring in milk kefir grains collected in some italian regions by combining the results of scanning electron microscopy analysis, viable counts on selective culture media, pcr-dgge and pyrosequencing. the main bacterial species found was lactobacillus kefiranofaciens while dekkera anomala was the predominant yeast. the presence of sub-dominant species ascribed to streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis and acetobacter genera was also highlighted. in addition, lc. lactis, enterococcus sp., bacillus sp., acetobacter fabarum, acetobacter lovaniensis and acetobacter orientalis were identified as part of the cultivable community. this work further confirms both the importance  of combining culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches to study microbial diversity in food and how the combination of multiple 16s rrna gene targets strengthens taxonomic identification using sequence-based identification  approaches.

TI  == four new tetramic acid and one new furanone derivatives from the plant endophytic fungus neopestalotiopsis sp.
AB  == four new tetramic acid analogues neopestalotins a-d (1-4), one new furanone derivative neopestalotin e (6), and the known compound hymenosetin have been isolated from the solid cultures of the plant endophytic fungus neopestalotiopsis sp. the structures of the new compounds were determined mainly by nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) experiments. the absolute configurations of 1 and 2 were assigned by circular dichroism (cd) data, whereas those of 3 and 4 were deduced by a combination of cd and heteronuclear long range coupling (hetloc) data. compound 2 showed modest antimicrobial activity against the gram-positive bacteria, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus col, and streptococcus pneumoniae.

TI  == excretion of cytosolic proteins (ecp) in bacteria.
AB  == excretion of cytosolic proteins (ecp) has been reported in bacteria and eukaryotes. as none of the classical signal peptide (sp) dependent or sp-independent pathways could be associated with ecp, it has been also referred to as 'non-classical protein export'. when microbiologists first began to study this subject in 1990, mainly singular cytoplasmic proteins were investigated, such as gapdh at the cell surface and in the supernatant of pathogenic streptococci or glutamine synthetase (glna) as a major extracellular protein in pathogenic mycobacteria. later, with the rising popularity of proteomics, it became obvious that the secretome of most bacteria contained a copious amount of  cytosolic proteins. in particular ancient proteins such as glycolytic enzymes, chaperones, translation factors or enzymes involved in detoxification of reactive oxygen were found in the supernatants. as the excreted proteins do not possess a  common motive, the most widespread opinion is that ecp is due to cell lysis. indeed, upregulation of autolysins or distortion of the murein structure increased ecp, suggesting that enhanced ecp is some sort of survival strategy to  counteract osmotic stress. however, in the meantime there are mounting evidences  and hints that speak against cell lysis as a primary mechanism for ecp. very likely, ecp belongs to the normal life cycle of bacteria and involves a programmed process. this review provides a brief overview of the 'non-classical protein export'.

TI  == dietary supplementation with bacillus subtilis, saccharomyces cerevisiae and aspergillus oryzae enhance immunity and disease resistance against aeromonas hydrophila and streptococcus iniae infection in juvenile tilapia oreochromis niloticus.
AB  == a feeding trial was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary administration of probiotic with bacillus subtilis, aspergillus oryzae and saccharomyces cerevisiae on growth, innate immune response, hemato-immunological  parameters and disease resistance of nile tilapia, oreochromis niloticus. animals were distributed in three equal groups, each of five replicates and received one  of the following experimental diets for four weeks: control, non-supplemented diet; 5 g kg(-1) probiotic mixture (b. subtilis 1.5 x 10(9) cfu g(-1), s. cerevisiae 10(9) cfu g(-1) and a. oryzae 2 x 10(9) cfu g(-1)); and 10 g kg(-1) probiotic mixture (b. subtilis 3.0 x 10(9) cfu g(-1), s. cerevisiae 2.0 x 10(9) cfu g(-1) and a. oryzae 4.0 x 10(9) cfu g(-1)). the respiratory burst activity, white blood cells and hematological parameters were evaluated after four, five and six weeks of feeding. at the end of the growth trial, fish were sampled for intestinal microbiology and challenged by intraperitoneal injection of ld50 concentration of aeromonas hydrophila and streptococcus iniae. mortality was recorded for the following 3 weeks. results showed that administration of the probiotic had no significant effect on the growth rates of nile tilapias, although the fish fed probiotics had better feed conversion. respiratory burst activity, erythrocyte fragility and levels of white blood cells were significantly improved in tilapias fed diet supplemented with probiotic levels (p < 0.05), which may exhibit up-regulating effects on tilapia immune parameters. the cumulative mortality after a. hydrophila and s. iniae challenge decreased in  tilapias fed with probiotic (p < 0.05). the present study demonstrated the potential of b. subtilis, s. cerevisiae and a. oryzae combined as beneficial dietary probiotic in juvenile o. niloticus.

TI  == chemical composition of essential oil from ripe fruit of schinus terebinthifolius raddi and evaluation of its activity against wild strains of hospital origin.
AB  == the essential oil (eo) composition of ripe fruit of s. terebinthifolius raddi was analyzed by gc-ms. the oil extraction yielded 6.54 +/- 1.06% (w/w). seventeen compounds were identified, accounting for 91.15% of the total oil, where monoterpenes constituted the main chemical class (85.81%), followed by sesquiterpenes (5.34%). the major monoterpene identified was delta-3-carene (30.37%), followed by limonene (17.44%), alpha-phellandrene (12.60%) and alpha-pinene (12.59%). trans-caryophyllene (1.77%) was the major sesquiterpene identified. the antibacterial activity of the essential oil was evaluated against wild strains of hospital origin (escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp., klebsiella oxytoca, corynebacterium sp., staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter sp., enterobacter agglomerans, bacillus sp., nocardia sp. and streptococcus group d).  the essential oil of the ripe fruit of s. terebinthifolius raddi has shown to be  active against all tested wild strains, with minimum inhibitory concentration ranging from 3.55 mug/ml to 56.86 mug/ml. however, it has revealed some differences in susceptibility: the general, gram-positive species showed greater  sensitivity to the action of eo, which is probably due to the lower structural complexity of their cell walls.

TI  == microbiological quality of indoor air in university libraries.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the concentration of bacteria and fungi in the indoor environment of jimma university libraries, so as to estimate the health hazard and to create standards for indoor air quality control. methods: the microbial quality of indoor air of eight libraries of jimma university was determined. the  settle plate method using open petri-dishes containing different culture media was employed to collect sample twice daily. isolates were identified according to standard methods. results: the concentrations of bacteria and fungi aerosols in the indoor environment of the university libraries ranged between 367-2595 cfu/m(3). according to the sanitary standards classification of european commission, almost all the libraries indoor air of jimma university was heavily contaminated with bacteria and fungi. in spite of their major source difference,  the average fungi density found in the indoor air of libraries did appear to follow the same trend with bacterial density (p=0.001). the bacteria isolates included micrococcus sp., staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus sp. and neisseria sp. while cladosporium sp., alternaria sp., penicillium sp. and aspergillus sp. were the most isolated fungi. conclusions: the indoor air of all  libraries were in the range above highly contaminated according to european commission classification and the most isolates are considered as potential candidates involved in the establishment of sick building syndromes and often associated with clinical manifestations like allergy, rhinitis, asthma and conjunctivitis. thus, attention must be given to control those environmental factors which favor the growth and multiplication of microbes in indoor environment of libraries to safeguard the health of users and workers.

TI  == characterization of rumen bacterial strains isolated from enrichments of rumen content in the presence of propolis.
AB  == propolis presents many biological properties, including antibacterial activities, and has been proposed as an additive in ruminant nutrition. twenty bacterial strains, previously isolated from enrichments of brazilian cow rumen contents in  the presence of different propolis extracts (llos), were characterized using phenotyping and 16s rrna identification. seven strains were assigned to streptococcus sp., most likely s. bovis, and were all degrading starch. one amylolytic lactate-utilizing strain of selenomonas ruminantium was also found. two strains of clostridium bifermentans were identified and showed proteolytic activity. two strains were assigned to mitsuokella jalaludinii and were saccharolytic. one strain belonged to a bacillus species and seven strains were affiliated with escherichia coli. all of the 20 strains were able to use many sugars, but none of them were able to degrade the polysaccharides carboxymethylcellulose and xylans. the effect of three propolis extracts (llos b1, c1 and c3) was tested on the in vitro growth of four representative isolates  of s. bovis, e. coli, m. jalaludinii and c. bifermentans. the growth of s. bovis, e. coli and m. jalaludinii was not affected by the three propolis extracts at 1 mg ml(-1). c. bifermentans growth was completely inhibited at this llos concentration, but this bacterium was partially resistant at lower concentrations. llos c3, with the lower concentration of phenolic compounds, was  a little less inhibitory than b1 and c1 on this strain.

TI  == the blow fly, chrysomya megacephala, and the house fly, musca domestica, as mechanical vectors of pathogenic bacteria in northeast thailand.
AB  == the oriental latrine fly, chrysomya megacephala (fabricius) (diptera: calliphoridae) and the house fly, musca domestica l., (diptera: muscidae) are synanthropic flies which are adapted to live in close association with human habitations, thereby making them likely mechanical vectors of several pathogens to humans. there were two main aims of this study. the first aim was to determine the prevalence of these two fly species from five types of human habitations including: fresh-food markets, garbage piles, restaurants, school cafeterias and  paddy fields, in the muang ubon ratchathani and warinchamrap districts of ubon ratchathani province of northeast thailand. flies collection were conducted monthly from september 2010-october 2011 using a reconstructable funnel trap, containing 1 day-tainted beef offal as bait. a total of 7 750 flies (6 401 c. megacephala and 1 349 m.domestica) were collected. the second aim was to examine  the potential of these flies to carry pathogenic bacteria. bacteria were isolated from 994 individual flies collected using a sweep net (555 c. megacephala and 439 m. domestica). a total of 15 bacterial genera were isolated from the external surfaces, comprising ten genera of gram-negative bacteria and five gram-positive  bacteria. the most common bacteria isolated from both species were coagulase-negative staphylococci, followed by streptococcus group d non-enterococci. human pathogenic enteric bacteria isolated were salmonella sp.,  shigella sp., escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhi, bacillus sp., and enterococcus sp., of which s. typhi is the first report of isolation from these fly species. other human pathogens included staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. not only were the number of c. megacephala positive for bacteria significantly higher than for m. domestica, but they were also carrying ~11-12 times greater bacterial load than m. domestica. these data suggest that both fly  species should be considered potential mechanical vectors of bacterial pathogens  associated with human habitations year-round in this region of northeast thailand.

TI  == poultry farm hygiene: microbiological quality assessment of drinking water used in layer chickens managed under the battery cage and deep litter systems at three poultry farms in southwestern nigeria.
AB  == water troughs from deep litter and caged chicken water troughs (drinkers) fixed to each of the different 3-tier cages containing layer chickens in farms a, b and c were subjected to a 7-day study which involved the monitoring of poultry farm hygiene. drinkers were washed before filling with water on day 1. for days 3, 5 and 7 water was served without prior washing. the occurrence and characterization of the bacteria isolates were investigated and data obtained were analyzed and compared. for the bacterial count on day 1, for layer chickens on cage system, no significant differences (p > 0.05) among the farms and between the farms tier interactions. on day 3, no significant difference (p > 0.05) among the parameters. on day 5, there was significant difference (p<0.05) among the farms and on day 7, there was high significant difference (p < 0.01) among the farms. on days 5 and 7, there were no significant differences (p>0.05) among the tiers nor between the interactions of the farms and tiers. the bacterial count in water troughs of layer chickens in deep litter system, on day 1, had no significant differences (p > 0.05) between the farms, water troughs and their interactions. on day 3, no significant difference (p > 0.05) among the parameters. on days 5 and 7, there were significant difference (p<0.05) and a high significant difference (p < 0.01) between the farms respectively. on days 5 and 7, no significant differences between the water troughs and between the interaction of  the farms and the water troughs. farm a isolates contained staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermis, klebsiella sp., salmonella sp., bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus salivarius and corynebacterium sp. farm b had staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermis, bacillus subtilis, corynebacterium sp., escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis and klebsiella sp. while for farm c, apart from the prevalent bacteria isolates obtained in farms a and b, additional 2 bacterial isolates, lactobacillus salivarius and pseudomonas aeuriginosa were found. in conclusion, water troughs when cleaned on daily basis carry minimum bacterial load. those left for 3, 5 and 7 days uncleaned had progressively high bacterial loads, suggesting that the flock of birds and the consumers of the eggs and meat  from the chickens are at risk of bacterial infection unless strict farm hygiene is ensured through regular monitoring.

TI  == identification of polybacterial communities in patients with postoperative, posttraumatic, and endogenous endophthalmitis through 16s rrna gene libraries.
AB  == endophthalmitis is a potential vision-threatening complication following surgical procedures (postoperative endophthalmitis [poe]), trauma (posttraumatic endophthalmitis [pte]), and bacteremic seeding of the eye from a distant infection site (endogenous endophthalmitis [ee]). several studies have revealed the polybacterial characteristics of endophthalmitis, which make the administration of antibiotics to treat the disease challenging. however, until now, the polybacterial communities of poe, pte, and ee have not been precisely studied. hence, the present study was designed to identify the bacterial community of endophthalmitis through 16s rrna gene libraries. of the 40 intraocular samples tested, 30 libraries were constructed with bacterial nested-pcr-positive samples. the obtained recombinant clones were screened through amplified rrna gene restriction analysis (ardra) to identify unique clones. the multiple types of ardra patterns (p=0.345) and diverse bacterial sequences (p=0.277) within the libraries revealed the polybacterial nature of infection in poe, pte, and ee. moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on polybacterial infection in ee. gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus spp. (n=19), streptococcus spp. (n=18), staphylococcus spp. (n=6), exiguobacterium spp. (n=3), gemella spp. (n=2), enterococcus spp. (n=2), a lysinibacillus sp. (n=1), a clostridium sp. (n=1), and a nocardia sp. (n=1), and  gram-negative bacteria, including serratia spp. (n=18), pseudomonas spp. (n=10),  enterobacter spp. (n=8), acinetobacter spp. (n=3), pantoea spp. (n=3), a haemophilus sp. (n=1), and a massilia sp. (n=1), were identified. interestingly,  among them, 10 bacterial species were not previously reported to be associated with endophthalmitis or other ocular infections. besides, the presence of 4 unidentifiable clones suggests the possibility of novel organisms that might cause eye infections. therefore, it is recommended that, in addition to the polybacterial nature of poe, pte, and ee infections, the spectrum of the pathogenic bacterial community identified in this work should be considered while administering antibiotic therapy in suspected endophthalmitis cases.

TI  == microbiological assessment of indoor air of a teaching hospital in nigeria.
AB  == objective: to investigate the quality of indoor air of different wards and units  of olabisi onabanjo university teaching hospital, sagamu, to ascertain their contribution to infection rate in the hospital. methods: the microbial quality of indoor air of nine wards/units of olabisi onabanjo university teaching hospital,  sagamu, nigeria was conducted. sedimentation technique using open petri-dishes containing different culture media was employed and samplings were done twice daily, one in the morning shortly after cleaning and before influx of people/patients into the wards/units and the other in the evening when a lot of activities would have taken place in these wards. isolates were identified according to standard methods. results: results showed that there was a statistically significant difference (chi(2) = 6.016 7) in the bacteria population of the different sampling time whereas it was not so for fungi population (chi(2) = 0.285 7). male medical ward (mmw) and male surgical general  (msg) recorded the highest bacterial and fungal growth while the operating theatre (ot) was almost free of microbial burden. the bacteria isolates were staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella sp., bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes and serratia marscences while the fungi isolates included  aspergillus flavus, penicillium sp., fusarium sp., candida albicans and alternaria sp. staphylococcus aureus was the predominantly isolated bacterium while penicillium sp. was the most isolated fungus. conclusions: though most of the microbial isolates were potential and or opportunistic pathogens, there was no correlation between the isolates in this study and the surveillance report of  nosocomial infection during the period of study, hence the contribution of the indoor air cannot be established. from the reduction noticed in the morning samples, stringent measures such as proper disinfection and regular cleaning, restriction of patient relatives' movement in and out of the wards/units need to  be enforced so as to improve the quality of indoor air of our hospital wards/units.

TI  == intestinal microbiota of gibel carp (carassius auratus gibelio) and its origin as revealed by 454 pyrosequencing.
AB  == the intestinal microbiota has received increasing attention, as it influences growth, feed conversion, epithelial development, immunity as well as the intrusion of pathogenic microorganisms in the intestinal tract. in this study, pyrosequencing was used to explore the bacterial community of the intestine in gibel carp (carassius auratus gibelio), and the origin of these microorganisms. the results disclosed great bacterial diversities in the carp intestines and cultured environments. the gibel carp harbored characteristic intestinal microbiota, where proteobacteria were predominant, followed by firmicutes. the analysis on the 10 most abundant bacterial operational taxonomic units (otus) revealed a majority of firmicutes in the intestinal content (by decreasing order: veilonella sp., lachnospiraceae, lactobacillales, streptococcus sp., and lactobacillus sp.). the second most abundant otu was rothia sp. (actinobacteria). the most likely potential probiotics (lactobacillus sp., and bacillus sp.) and opportunists (aeromonas sp., and acinetobacter sp.) were not much abundant. bacterial community comparisons showed that the intestinal community was closely  related to that of the sediment, indicating the importance of sediment as source  of gut bacteria in gibel carp. however, 37.95 % of the otus detected in feed were retrieved in the intestine, suggesting that food may influence markedly the microbiota of gibel carp, and therefore may be exploited for oral administration  of probiotics.

TI  == screening antimicrobial activity of various extracts of urtica dioica.
AB  == urtica dioica or stinging nettle is traditionally used as an herbal medicine in western asia. the current study represents the investigation of antimicrobial activity of u. dioica from nine crude extracts that were prepared using different organic solvents, obtained from two extraction methods: the soxhlet extractor (method i), which included the use of four solvents with ethyl acetate and hexane, or the sequential partitions (method ii) with a five solvent system (butanol). the antibacterial and antifungal activities of crude extracts were tested against 28 bacteria, three yeast strains and seven fungal isolates by the  disc diffusion and broth dilution methods. amoxicillin was used as positive control for bacteria strains, vancomycin for streptococcus sp., miconazole nitrate (30 microg/ml) as positive control for fungi and yeast, and pure methanol (v/v) as negative control. the disc diffusion assay was used to determine the sensitivity of the samples, whilst the broth dilution method was used for the determination of the minimal inhibition concentration (mic). the ethyl acetate and hexane extract from extraction method i (ea i and he i) exhibited highest inhibition against some pathogenic bacteria such as bacillus cereus, mrsa and vibrio parahaemolyticus. a selection of extracts that showed some activity was further tested for the mic and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc). mic values of bacillus subtilis and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) using butanol extract of extraction method ii (be ii) were 8.33 and 16.33mg/ml, respectively; while the mic value using ethyl acetate extract of extraction method ii (eae ii) for vibrio parahaemolyticus was 0.13mg/ml. our study showed that 47.06% of extracts inhibited gram-negative (8 out of 17), and 63.63% of extracts also inhibited gram-positive bacteria (7 out of 11); besides,  statistically the frequency of antimicrobial activity was 13.45% (35 out of 342)  which in this among 21.71% belongs to antimicrobial activity extracts from extraction method i (33 out of 152 of crude extracts) and 6.82% from extraction method ii (13 out of 190 of crude extracts). however, crude extracts from method  i exhibited better antimicrobial activity against the gram-positive bacteria than the gram-negative bacteria. the positive results on medicinal plants screening for antibacterial activity constitutes primary information for further phytochemical and pharmacological studies. therefore, the extracts could be suitable as antimicrobial agents in pharmaceutical and food industry.

TI  == gene identification and recombinant protein of a lysozyme from freshwater mussel  cristaria plicata.
AB  == lysozymes are important proteins to bivalve in the innate immune responses against bacterial infections, and provide nutrition as digestion enzymes. a new lyz1 from the freshwater mussel cristaria plicata was cloned by rapid amplification of cdna ends (race) and nested pcr method. the full-length cdna sequence of cplyz1 was 763 bp. the cdna contained a 5'-terminal untranslated region (utr) of 21 bp, a 3'- terminal utr of 259 bp with a 29 bp poly(a) tail, a  tailing signal (aataaa) and the open reading frame of 483 bp. the cplyz1 cdna encoded a polypeptide of 160 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 17.8  kda, and a theoretical isoelectric point of 6.07. the comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences with lyzs from other species showed that the enzyme belonged to i-type lysozyme. the mrna transcript of cplyz1 could be detected in all the examined tissues with the highest expression level in hepatopancreas. the expression levels of cplyz1 in hemocytes, hepatopancreas and gill significantly increased after aeromonas hydrophila challenge. the expression level of cplyz1 in hemocytes sharply decreased from 6 h to 24 h and significantly increased at 48 h, and was the highest level in hepatopancreas at 24 h, and was the maximum level in gill at 48 h. furthermore, the recombinant cplyz1 was induced to be expressed as  an inclusion body form by iptg at 37 degrees c for 4 h, and then was purified by  using the ni(2+) affinity chromatography. the relative enzyme activity of the recombinant cplyz1 was influenced on ph and temperature. the optimal ph and temperature was 5.5 and 50 degrees c, respectively. against escherichia coli, a.  hydrophila, staphyloccocus aureus, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus sp. and staphylococcus epidermidis, the recombinant cplyz1 had bacteriolytic activity.

TI  == bacterial superinfection in zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis.
AB  == background: zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (zcl) is a polymorphic disease. it is generally accepted that bacterial superinfection may play a role in the clinical appearance of the lesions and may delay or prevent the healing process.  however, the pattern of bacterial pathogens involved has rarely been investigated. material/methods: the aim of this study was to identify the bacterial species contaminating the suspected zcl and their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics. microscopic examination of stained smears and cultures were used to differentiate zcl from non-zcl lesions in a rural area north of isfahan, iran from july to december 2009. bacteria were isolated from the lesions and identified and antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard microbiological techniques. results: the results show that 602 (68%) of 855 patients were positive for zcl, of which 83.4% with volcano-shape, 8.8% psoriasiform, 6.6% popular form and 1.2% with other atypical forms of zcl. the bacteria were isolated from 66.8% of zcl (70% of volcano-shape, 60% of psoriasiform and 25% of popular form) and 64.7% of non-zcl lesions. the most common species were staphylococcus aureus (41.7%) and s. epidermidis (28%) followed by bacillus sp. streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., proteus sp., enterobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeroginosa. ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, cefazolin and clindamycin were the most effective antibiotics. conclusions: bacterial superinfection appears to be very common in zcl, but its prevalence is not different from that of non-zcl lesions and it has little effect on the clinical appearance of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (acl). local  lesion care and management of bacterial superinfection must be considered in the  treatment of zcl.

TI  == dietary administration of the probiotic, bacillus subtilis e20, enhances the growth, innate immune responses, and disease resistance of the grouper, epinephelus coioides.
AB  == the aim of this study was to improve the growth performance, immune response and  disease resistance of grouper, epinephelus coioides by using probiotic, bacillus  subtilis e20. the percent weight gain (pwg) and feeding efficiency (fe) of grouper administered the probiotic b. subtilis e20 were calculated. survival of b. subtilis e20 in the posterior intestines was determined using a specific primer pair of bphyf/bphyr, as were the non-specific immune parameters of grouper, and its susceptibility to streptococcus sp. and an iridovirus when fish  were fed diets containing b. subtilis at 0 (control), 10(4), 10(6), and 10(8) colony-forming units (cfu) g(-1) up to 28 days. results showed that grouper fed a diet containing b. subtilis at the levels of 10(4), 10(6), and 10(8) cfu g(-1) had significantly increased pgw (203.0%, 229.6%, and 238.0%) and fe (1.15, 1.20,  and 1.22) compared to control (191.8% and 1.0), and these directly increased in a dose-dependent manner with b. subtilis concentrations. b. subtilis was able to survive in the fish's posterior intestines during the feeding period. the survival rate increased in grouper challenged with streptococcus sp. or an iridovirus when the fish were fed b. subtilis at 10(4), 10(6), and 10(8) cfu g(-1) for 14 and 28 days, and it was higher at 28 days than at 14 days. after 28  days of feeding, the relative survival percentages of fish challenged with streptococcus sp. and an iridovirus were 22.8, 40.9 and 45.5, and 21.7, 30.4, and 52.2, respectively. the phagocytic activity, respiratory bursts, and superoxide dismutase (sod) level of head kidney leucocytes as well as serum lysozyme activity and serum alternative complement activity (ach(50)) of fish fed diets containing b. subtilis at 10(4), 10(6) and 10(8) cfu g(-1) were significantly and dose-dependently higher than those of fish fed the control diet for 28 days. we therefore recommend dietary b. subtilis e20 administration of 10(4) - 10(8) cfu g(-1) to e. coioides to promote growth, and enhance immunity and resistance against streptococcus sp. and an iridovirus. the best results were seen in the 10(8) cfu g(-1) group fed for 28 days.

TI  == recombinant expression and functional analysis of proteases from streptococcus pneumoniae, bacillus anthracis, and yersinia pestis.
AB  == background: uncharacterized proteases naturally expressed by bacterial pathogens  represents important topic in infectious disease research, because these enzymes  may have critical roles in pathogenicity and cell physiology. it has been observed that cloning, expression and purification of proteases often fail due to their catalytic functions which, in turn, cause toxicity in the e. coli heterologous host. results: in order to address this problem systematically, a modified pipeline of our high-throughput protein expression and purification platform was developed. this included the use of a specific e. coli strain, bl21(de3) plyss to tightly control the expression of recombinant proteins and various expression vectors encoding fusion proteins to enhance recombinant protein solubility. proteases fused to large fusion protein domains, maltosebinding protein (mbp), sp-mbp which contains signal peptide at the n-terminus of mbp, disulfide oxidoreductase (dsba) and glutathione s-transferase  (gst) improved expression and solubility of proteases. overall, 86.1% of selected protease genes including hypothetical proteins were expressed and purified using  a combination of five different expression vectors. to detect novel proteolytic activities, zymography and fluorescence-based assays were performed and the protease activities of more than 46% of purified proteases and 40% of hypothetical proteins that were predicted to be proteases were confirmed. conclusions: multiple expression vectors, employing distinct fusion tags in a high throughput pipeline increased overall success rates in expression, solubility and purification of proteases. the combinatorial functional analysis of the purified proteases using fluorescence assays and zymography confirmed their function.

TI  == structural determinants in streptococcal unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase for recognition of glycosaminoglycan sulfate groups.
AB  == pathogenic streptococcus agalactiae produces polysaccharide lyases and unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase (ugl), which are prerequisite for complete degradation of mammalian extracellular matrices, including glycosaminoglycans such as chondroitin and hyaluronan. unlike the bacillus enzyme, streptococcal ugls prefer sulfated glycosaminoglycans. here, we show the loop flexibility for substrate binding and structural determinants for recognition of glycosaminoglycan sulfate groups in s. agalactiae ugl (sagugl). ugl also degraded unsaturated heparin disaccharides; this indicates that the enzyme released unsaturated iduronic and glucuronic acids from substrates. we determined the crystal structures of sagugl wild-type enzyme and both substrate-free and substrate-bound d175n mutants by x-ray crystallography and noted that the loop over the active cleft exhibits flexible motion for substrate binding. several residues in the active cleft bind to the substrate, unsaturated chondroitin disaccharide with a sulfate group at the c-6 position of galnac residue. the sulfate group is hydrogen-bonded to ser-365 and ser-368 and close to lys-370. as  compared with wild-type enzyme, s365h, s368g, and k370i mutants exhibited higher  michaelis constants toward the substrate. the conversion of sagugl to bacillus sp. gl1 ugl-like enzyme via site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that ser-365 and lys-370 are essential for direct binding and for electrostatic interaction, respectively, for recognition of the sulfate group by sagugl. molecular conversion was also achieved in sagugl arg-236 with an affinity for the sulfate group at the c-4 position of the galnac residue. these residues binding to sulfate groups are frequently conserved in pathogenic bacterial ugls, suggesting  that the motif "r-//-sxx(s)xk" (where the hyphen and slash marks in the motif indicate the presence of over 100 residues in the enzyme and parentheses indicate that ser-368 makes little contribution to enzyme activity) is crucial for degradation of sulfated glycosaminoglycans.

TI  == bacillus subtilis cwlp of the sp-{beta} prophage has two novel peptidoglycan hydrolase domains, muramidase and cross-linkage digesting dd-endopeptidase.
AB  == for bacteria and bacteriophages, cell wall digestion by hydrolases is a very important event. we investigated one of the proteins involved in cell wall digestion, the yomi gene product (renamed cwlp). the gene is located in the sp-beta prophage region of the bacillus subtilis chromosome. inspection of the pfam database indicates that cwlp contains soluble lytic transglycosylase (slt) and peptidase m23 domains, which are similar to escherichia coli lytic transglycosylase slt70, and the staphylococcus aureus gly-gly endopeptidase lytm, respectively. the slt domain of cwlp exhibits hydrolytic activity toward the b. subtilis cell wall; however, reverse phase (rp)-hplc and mass spectrometry revealed that the cwlp-slt domain has only muramidase activity. in addition, the  peptidase m23 domain of cwlp exhibited hydrolytic activity and could cleave d-ala-diaminopimelic acid cross-linkage, a property associated with dd-endopeptidases. remarkably, the m23 domain of cwlp possessed a unique zn(2+)-independent endopeptidase activity; this contrasts with all other characterized m23 peptidases (and enzymes similar to cwlp), which are zn(2+) dependent. both domains of cwlp could hydrolyze the peptidoglycan and cell wall of b. subtilis. however, the m23 domain digested neither the peptidoglycans nor the cell walls of s. aureus or streptococcus thermophilus. the effect of defined  point mutations in conserved amino acid residues of cwlp is also determined.

TI  == bacteriological screening of donor human milk before and after holder pasteurization.
AB  == background: in order to ascertain any bacterial contamination of donor human milk, we cultured milk samples both before and after holder pasteurization. methods: during 2003, all frozen donor milk samples were thawed and aseptically placed in pools prior to pasteurization. all individual and pooled samples were cultured and incubated for 48 hours. specific microbiologic identification of group b streptococcus, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus,  alpha-streptococcus, enterococcus, and bacillus sp. was performed. gram-negative  rods (gnrs) were subtyped but not specifically identified. positive cultures were expressed in quantitative colony counts. results: samples from 303 pools and 810  individual mother's donor milk were cultured. forty-four pools (15%) represented  "preterm donor milk" from milk donated by mothers who delivered prior to 36 weeks of gestation. before pasteurization, 185 pools (62%) grew at least one lactose-fermenting gnr, and 58 pools (19%) grew a second lactose-fermenting gnr.  forty-four percent grew a non-lactose-fermenting gnr, and 20% grew an oxidase-positive gnr. the majority (87%) were colonized with staphylococcus. other gram-positive organisms identified included enterococcus (16%), alpha-streptococcus (8%), and s. aureus (4%). only one milk sample was positive for methicillin-resistant s. aureus. the majority of pooled milk samples grew two or more organisms. milk from 22% of mothers did not grow detectable bacteria on routine cultures. the bacteriologic colonization profiles of milk from mothers delivering prematurely were similar to those of mothers delivering at term. after routine holder pasteurization of donor milk, 93% of milk samples showed no growth on routine bacterial cultures. conclusions: a wide variety of bacteria contaminate human milk from donor mothers. most milk samples grew coagulase-negative staphylococcus and gram-negative organisms. although normal skin flora was cultured typically from milk samples, there were also many prepasteurization milk samples contaminated with pathogenic organisms. holder pasteurization was, however, an effective means by which to remove any detectable bacteria from samples of donor human milk.

TI  == induction of neutralizing antibodies in mice immunized with an amino-terminal polypeptide of streptococcus mutans p1 protein produced by a recombinant bacillus subtilis strain.
AB  == the oral pathogen streptococcus mutans expresses a surface protein, p1, which interacts with the salivary pellicle on the tooth surface or with fluid-phase saliva, resulting in bacterial adhesion or aggregation, respectively. p1 is a target of protective immunity. its n-terminal region has been associated with adhesion and aggregation functions and contains epitopes recognized by efficacious antibodies. in this study, we used bacillus subtilis, a gram-positive expression host, to produce a recombinant n-terminal polypeptide of p1 (p1(39-512)) derived from the s. mutans strain ua159. purified p1(39-512) reacted with an anti-full-length p1 antiserum as well as one raised against intact s. mutans cells, indicating preserved antigenicity. immunization of mice with soluble and heat-denatured p1(39-512) induced antibodies that reacted specifically with native p1 on the surface of s. mutans cells. the anti-p1(39-512) antiserum was as effective at blocking saliva-mediated aggregation of s. mutans cells and better at blocking bacterial adhesion to saliva-coated plastic surfaces compared with the anti-full-length p1 antiserum. in addition, adsorption of the anti-p1 antiserum with p1(39-512) eliminated its ability to block the adhesion of s. mutans cells to abiotic surfaces. the present results indicate that p1(39-512), expressed and purified from a recombinant b. subtilis strain, maintains important immunological features of the native protein and represents an additional tool for the development of anticaries vaccines.

TI  == a survey of veterinary hospitals in nigeria for the presence of some bacterial organisms of nosocomial and zoonotic potential.
AB  == this study was undertaken to determine the type and estimate the prevalence of bacterial organisms on contact surfaces of five close-to-patient facilities in three veterinary health care settings within the sokoto metropolis of north-western nigeria. a total of 30 samples (10 from each setting) were collected and analysed using culture, microscopy and biochemical testing. bacterial species isolated from samples in this study included the following: bacillus sp. (27.3%), staphylococcus aureus (15.9%), listeria sp. (13.6%), streptococcus sp. (11.4%), salmonella sp. (6.8%), escherichia coli (4.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (4.5%), citrobacter sp. (2.3%), klebsiella sp. (2.3%), lactobacillus sp. (2.3%), micrococcus sp. (2.3%), pasteurella sp. (2.3%), proteus sp. (2.3%), and yersinia sp. (2.3%). a higher percentage (64.3%) of the total bacterial isolates were zoonotic in nature and hence of public health significance. some pathogens have the potential of nosocomial spread. in this study, we seek to establish the first evidence of bacterial presence in the major veterinary health care settings in the sokoto region of north-western nigeria. of particular interest is the hypothesis, which has not previously been formally tested, that nosocomial infections are especially likely to be implicated in both animals and occupational diseases in nigeria. it was suggested that some of these isolates were associated with the risk of nosocomial and zoonotic infections and  hence draws attention to the need to rigorously employ standard veterinary precautions as part of the hospital's infection control programme in an attempt to protect both patients and staff from infections.

TI  == substrate specificity of streptococcal unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolases for sulfated glycosaminoglycan.
AB  == unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase (ugl) categorized into the glycoside hydrolase family 88 catalyzes the hydrolytic release of an unsaturated glucuronic acid from glycosaminoglycan disaccharides, which are produced from mammalian extracellular  matrices through the beta-elimination reaction of polysaccharide lyases. here, we show enzyme characteristics of pathogenic streptococcal ugls and structural determinants for the enzyme substrate specificity. the putative genes for ugl and phosphotransferase system for amino sugar, a component of glycosaminoglycans, are assembled into a cluster in the genome of pyogenic and hemolytic streptococci such as streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes, which produce extracellular hyaluronate lyase as a virulent factor. the ugls of these three streptococci were overexpressed in escherichia coli cells, purified, and characterized. streptococcal ugls degraded unsaturated hyaluronate  and chondroitin disaccharides most efficiently at approximately ph 5.5 and 37 degrees c. distinct from bacillus sp. gl1 ugl, streptococcal ugls preferred sulfated substrates. dna microarray and western blotting indicated that the enzyme was constitutively expressed in s. agalactiae cells, although the expression level increased in the presence of glycosaminoglycan. the crystal structure of s. agalactiae ugl (sagugl) was determined at 1.75 a resolution by x-ray crystallography. sagugl adopts alpha(6)/alpha(6)-barrel structure as a basic scaffold similar to bacillus ugl, but the arrangement of amino acid residues in the active site differs between the two. sagugl arg-236 was found to  be one of the residues involved in its activity for the sulfated substrate through structural comparison and site-directed mutagenesis. this is the first report on the structure and function of streptococcal ugls.

AB  == some copper chelates have potent antitumour activity, and in some cases also the  free ligands have activity in vivo. yet, little is known about their antimicrobial properties. copper(ii) chelates of the thiosemicarbazones of a-n-heterocyclic carboxaldehydes constitute one important group of such agents, also their ligands having marked antitumour activity. both the ligands and chelates inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. some ligands have been or are under clinical trials as antineoplastic agents. i report here a study on the antimicrobial properties of the prototype compounds of this group, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and its copper(ii) chelate. they were tested against nine microbes, including bacteria (bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus lactis), yeasts (candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisiae) and one mold (aspergillus niger). two clinical isolates of bacillus sp. and one reference strain were also studied. both the ligand and the chelate had marked activity. the ligand displayed considerable activity against all bacteria except  for s. lactis, and its activity against e. coli and p. aeruginosa was that high that practical applications might be considued. it was highly active against a. niger and moderately active against c. albicans. the chelate was highly active against s. epidermidis and s. cerevisiae. both compounds inhibited the clinical isolates markedly. since some related ligands have been or are in clinical trials on humans or are entering them, their route to clinical use, also as antimicrobials, might be much more straightforward than that of substances, whose toxicity in humans is wholly unexplored.

TI  == pulmonary collectins in innate immunity of the lung.
AB  == pulmonary collectins, hydrophilic surfactant proteins a and d (sp-a and sp-d), have been implicated in the regulation of pulmonary host defence and inflammation. sp-a and sp-d directly interact with a variety of microorganisms including bacteria and viruses, and attenuate the growth of gram-negative bacteria, histoplasma capsulatum and mycoplasma pneumoniae. the collectins are thought to contribute to bacterial clearance. these lectins augment the phagocytosis of the bacteria by macrophages. sp-a serves as an opsonin and stimulates the uptake of bacteria and bacillus calmette-guerin through a c1q receptor- and an sp-r210-mediated processes. the collectin also stimulates fcr- and cr1-mediated phagocytosis by activating the macrophages. in addition, sp-a and sp-d directly interact with macrophages and enhance the phagocytosis of streptococcus pneumoniae and mycobacterium by increasing cell surface localization of the phagocytic receptors, scavenger receptor a and mannose receptor. the collectins also modulate pulmonary inflammation. sp-a and sp-d bind to cell surface receptors including toll-like receptors, sirpalpha and calreticulin/cd91, and attenuate or enhance inflammation in a microbial ligand-specific manner. in this article we review the immunomodulatory functions  of sp-a and sp-d and their possible mechanisms in direct actions on microbes, macrophage phagocytosis and modulation of inflammation.

AB  == this work describes a novel plasmid psp187 (5550 bp) carrying the small multidrug resistance determinant smr encoding resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds (qacs). psp187 was identified in a staphylococcus pasteuri isolate recovered from bulk milk in a dairy cattle herd in norway. sequence analysis revealed 6 putative orfs in addition to the smr gene within a cassette with identical genetic organization to that found in the psk41-like staphylococcus aureus plasmid ptz22. a protein homology search suggested the gene product of orf7 to be a putative replication initiation protein, while orf2 was predicted to encode a protein homologous to members of ftsk/spoiiie cell division-dna segregation protein families. sequence similarities to some initiator proteins of rolling circle replicons (rcr) indicated that psp187 uses a rcr mode of replication, supported by the detection of intermediate ssdna using s1 nuclease treatment and hybridization analysis. interestingly, a 30-bp sequence found upstream from orf7  showed high similarity to other dyad symmetry motifs proposed as putative double-strand origins of replication in the plasmids pgi3 (bacillus thuringiensis), pstk1 (bacillus stearothermophilus), and per1-2 (streptococcus thermophilus). in conclusion: the novel smr-containing plasmid psp187 is the first member of rcr group vi to be identified in a staphylococcus sp.

TI  == analysis of the composition of bacterial communities in oil reservoirs from a southern offshore brazilian basin.
AB  == the aim of this study was to characterize and compare the bacterial community structure of two distinct oil samples from a petroleum field in brazil by using both molecular, based on the construction of 16s rrna gene libraries, and cultivation methods. statistical comparisons of libraries based on amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra) data revealed no significant differences between the communities recovered in the non-biodegraded (nbd) and highly biodegraded oils (hbd). blastn analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequences representative of distinct ribotypes from both oils showed the presence of nine different bacterial genera in these samples, encompassing members of the genera arcobacter, halanaerobium, marinobacter, propionibacterium, streptomyces, leuconostoc, acinetobacter, bacillus and streptococcus. enrichments obtained using oil as inoculum and sole carbon source yielded bacterial isolates showing high 16s rrna gene sequence similarity with achromobacter xylosoxidans, bacillus  subtilis, brevibacillus sp., dietzia sp. and methylobacterium sp. comparison between the data obtained using cultivation-independent and enrichment cultures suggests that different selection of community members may occur when using distinct approaches. all the organisms found, except for leuconostoc sp. and streptococus sp., have been previously reported in the literature as hydrocarbon  degraders and/or associated to oil field environments.

TI  == differential identification of bacillus anthracis from environmental bacillus species using microarray analysis.
AB  == aims: to determine whether microarray analysis could be employed for the differential identification of a range of environmental bacillus sp. from four strains of bacillus anthracis. methods and results: oligonucleotide probes were designed that were specific to virulence factor genes of b. anthracis (pag, lef and cap), the variable number tandem repeat region of the b. anthracis vrra gene  and to the 16s-23s rrna intergenic transcribed spacer region (its) and pleiotropic regulator (plcr) regions of the bacillus cereus subgroup species. generic probes were also designed to hybridize with conserved regions of the 16s  rrna genes of bacillus (as a positive control), neisseria sp., pseudomonas sp., streptococcus sp., mycobacterium sp. and to all members of the enterobacteriaceae to allow simultaneous detection of these bacteria. identification of b. anthracis was found to rely entirely on hybridization of dna specific to regions of the pag, lef and cap genes. cross-reaction was observed between b. anthracis and other bacillus species with all the other bacillus probes tested. results obtained using microarray hybridizations were confirmed using conventional microbiological techniques and found to have very high comparability. conclusions: microarray-based assays are an effective method for the identification of b. anthracis from mixed-culture environmental samples without problems of false-positivity that have been observed with conventional pcr assays. significance and impact of the study: identification of environmental bacillus sp. by conventional pcr is prone to potential for reporting false-positives. this study provides a method for the exclusion of such isolates.

TI  == characterization of bacterial isolates from industrial wastewater according to probable modes of hexadecane uptake.
AB  == bacterial isolates from industrial wastewater were characterized according to probable modes of hexadecane uptake based on data for cell surface hydrophobicity, emulsifying activity, glycoside content and surface tension of cell-free culture medium. the results obtained suggested that both modes of biosurfactant-enhanced hexadecane uptake by bacterial strains take place, direct  uptake and alkane transfer. the increase in cell surface hydrophobicity and glycoside production by the strains suggested the existence of biosurfactant-enhanced interfacial uptake of the alkane. such mechanism is probably predominant for three isolates, staphylococcus sp. hw-2, streptococcus sp. hw-9 and bacillus sp. hw-4. secreted biosurfactants enhanced mainly alkane emulsification for most hydrophobic isolate arthrobacter sp. hw-8, and micellar transfer for most hydrophilic isolate streptococcus sp. hw-5. for other strains (67%) both mechanisms of biosurfactant-enhanced hexadecane uptake probably take place in similar degree, interfacial uptake and alkane emulsification. the results obtained could contribute to clarifying the natural relationships between the members of water ecosystem studied as well as will reveal potential producers of surface active compounds.

TI  == immunohistochemical evidence of clostridium sp, staphylococcus aureus, and group  a streptococcus in severe soft tissue infections related to injection drug use.
AB  == severe soft tissue infections are caused by either single or multiple microorganisms. we performed a retrospective immunohistochemical (ihc) study on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded soft tissue samples from 20 injection drug users who were part of a cluster of severe illness and death after skin and soft  tissue infections in scotland and ireland in 2000. the ihc assays used antibodies against clostridium sp, staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococci, and bacillus anthracis. intact bacilli and granular clostridium antigen staining in areas with necrosis, edema, and inflammation were observed in skin, fascia, or muscle samples of 12 (60%) patients. a variety of clostridia were isolated from affected soft tissues in 10 ihc-positive cases. staphylococcus aureus antigens were observed in 3 cases including 1 where s aureus was isolated, 1 with negative cultures, and 1 where mixed cultures were obtained. group a streptococcal antigens were observed in 1 case in which streptococcus pyogenes and s aureus were isolated. by using ihc, we detected different bacteria in archival soft tissue samples from patients with severe skin and soft tissue infections. immunohistochemical assays can be of great diagnostic value, particularly for bacteria such as clostridium sp, which are difficult to isolate because of their  anaerobic fastidious growth requirements.

TI  == bacteria fauna from the house fly, musca domestica (l.).
AB  == the house fly, musca domestica has long been considered a potential agent for disease transmission ever since its existence. the general truth of this assertion remains undisputed till the present day in spite of increasing awareness toward an improved sanitation and better hygiene. the habitual movement of house fly from filthy substrata such as human faeces, animal excreta, carcasses, garbage, etc. makes them ideal candidates for disease transmission such as cholera, shigellosis, salmonellosis and others when settling on food. fly as a potential mechanical vector of pathogenic bacteria was elucidated in this study by examining flies from various breeding sites such as food courts, dumping ground, food processing areas and poultry farm in peninsular malaysia. the flies  were baited with 10% sugar solution on a glass slide in the field. all materials  used for collection of samples were sterile. bacteria from fly sample were isolated using the normal isolation technique. bacillus sp., coccobacillus sp., staphylococcus sp., microccus sp., streptococcus sp., acinetobacter sp., enterobacter sp., proteus sp., escherichia sp., klebsiella sp. and yeast cells were isolated from feaces, vomitus, external surfaces and internal organs of house fly. newly emerged house fly did not harbour any bacteria.

TI  == [etiology of community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompetent adults].
AB  == in an ideal clinical setting, empiric antimicrobial treatment prescribed in adult community acquired pneumonia (cap) should be based on national etiological surveillance and in vitro susceptibility assays. available information about etiology in ambulatory patients and intensive care unit (icu) patients is scarce, compared to information obtained in hospitalized patients. in studies designed to explore the etiology of pneumonia, no microorganism is detected in 40-50% of patients, a fact that represents limited yields in diagnostic methods. in all settings, streptococcus pneumoniae is the main respiratory pathogen recovered in  adults cap, being responsible of about 16% of cases among ambulatory patients and about 22% of those admitted to hospital and icu. about one third of cases are caused by a small group of microorganisms: haemophilus influenzae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae, respiratory viruses, staphylococcus aureus, gramnegative bacillus, legionella sp; each one is isolated in less than 10% of cases. in general, microorganism distribution varies scarcely in the following attending settings: ambulatory patients, common wards and icu. an exception is represented by a higher frequency of gram negative bacillus, s. aureus and legionella sp in icu, and of c. pneumoniae in the ambulatory setting. in chile, cap etiology in hospitalized adult patients is similar to foreign reports; no systematic information has been collected about the etiology in neither ambulatory patients nor in severe cap.

TI  == ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin aqueous humor concentrations after topical administration in dogs undergoing cataract surgery.
AB  == objective: to determine if preoperative topical administration of ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin results in aqueous humor drug concentrations that exceed the mic(90) of common ocular contaminants in dogs undergoing cataract surgery. procedures: twelve dogs were treated with topical 0.3% ciprofloxacin and 13 dogs with topical 0.3% ofloxacin once the night before surgery, and then with 1 drop of ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin every 15 min for 2 h immediately before surgery. aqueous humor samples were taken from each eye immediately before the incision was made and frozen at -70 degrees c. first eye samples (s1) were taken closer to the time of topical treatments than second eye samples (s2). samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (hplc) at the north carolina state university (ncsu) clinical pharmacology laboratory. results: in ciprofloxacin patients, s1 concentrations were 0.03-0.69 (0.17 median) microg/ml, and s2 concentrations were 0.09-0.95 (0.36 median) microg/ml. aqueous humor concentrations did not exceed the mic90 of streptococcus sp. few eyes (1/12 ou) exceeded the mic90 for staphylococcus sp. or corynebacterium sp.; moderate numbers (5/12 s1; 8/12 s2) exceeded the mic90 for e. coli. in ofloxacin patients, s1 concentrations were 0.48-2.81 (1.05 median) microg/ml, and s2 concentrations were 0.45-3.63 (1.30 median) microg/ml. although few eyes (<or=2/13 ou) exceeded  the mic90 for streptococcus sp. or corynebacterium sp., moderate numbers (7/13 s1, 9/13 s2) exceeded the mic90 for staphylococcus sp. and most eyes (12/13 ou) exceeded the mic90 for bacillus sp. all eyes exceeded the mic90 for e. coli. conclusions: ofloxacin has higher corneal penetration and ability to exceed mic90 of common ocular contaminants than ciprofloxacin, and would be a more appropriate prophylactic choice for canine cataract patients.

TI  == expression and secretion of a prokaryotic protein streptokinase without glycosylation and degradation in schizosaccharomyces pombe.
AB  == streptokinase (sk) is an important thrombolytic protein that is secreted by pathogenic strains of streptococcus. expression of streptokinase has been so far  attempted in pichia pastoris, escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis and shown to yield protein that was either highly glycosylated or degraded. since the fission  yeast, schizosaccharomyces pombe, shares several molecular characteristics with higher eukaryotes, we decided to express the streptokinase gene in this yeast. a  chimeric gene comprising the signal sequence of the plus pheromone of sz. pombe fused in-frame with the mature streptokinase from streptococcus sp. was constructed and inserted into the expression vector containing the thiamine-regulated promoter. we obtained a high level of expression of streptokinase comparable to that in e. coli and p. pastoris, with 50-100% processing of the signal sequence and secretion of the mature streptokinase into  the periplasmic fraction. the mature enzyme co-migrates with the authentic mature sk in sds gels, lacks any major modification and is functional. importantly, a higher level of expression under stationary phase conditions and improved extractability of the mature and undegraded streptokinase was achieved in a novel mutant of sz. pombe defective for a potent extracellular protease activity. we suggest that the unique vector/strain system developed here could be advantageous for large-scale production of prokaryotic proteins without significant modification or degradation in sz. pombe.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == a global approach to identify novel broad-spectrum antibacterial targets among proteins of unknown function.
AB  == attempted allelic replacement of 144 streptococcus pneumoniae open reading frames of previously uncharacterized function led to the identification of 36 genes essential for growth under laboratory conditions. of these, 14 genes (obg, spoiiij2, trmu, yaca, yacm, ydic, ydie, yjbn, ynes, yphc, ysxc, ytag, yloi and yxeh4) were also essential in staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae or escherichia coli, 2 genes (yrrk and ydib) were only essential in h. influenzae as well as s. pneumoniae and 8 genes were necessary for growth of s.pneumoniae and s. aureus and did not have a homolog in h. influenzae(murd2, ykqc, ylqf, yqeh, ytgp, yybq) or were not essential in that organism (yqel, yhct). the proteins encoded by these genes could represent good targets for novel antibiotics covering different therapeutic profiles. the putative functions of some of these  essential proteins, inferred by bioinformatic analysis, are presented. four mutants, with deletions of loci not essential for in vitro growth, were found to  be severely attenuated in a murine respiratory tract infection model, suggesting  that not all targets for antibacterial therapeutics are revealed by simple in vitro essentiality testing. the results of our experiments together with those collated from previously reported studies including bacillus subtilis, e. coli and mycoplasma sp. demonstrate that gene conservation amongst bacteria does not necessarily indicate that essentiality in one organism can be extrapolated to others. moreover, this study demonstrates that different experimental procedures  can produce apparently contradictory results.

TI  == a novel member of glycoside hydrolase family 88: overexpression, purification, and characterization of unsaturated beta-glucuronyl hydrolase of bacillus sp. gl1.
AB  == unsaturated beta-glucuronyl hydrolase of bacillus sp. gl1 catalyzes the hydrolytic release of unsaturated glucuronic acids from oligosaccharides produced through the reactions of polysaccharide lyases such as gellan, xanthan, hyaluronate, and chondroitin lyases. an overexpression system for the enzyme was  constructed in escherichia coli cells involving regulation of the enzyme gene under the t7 promoter and terminator. the expression level of the enzyme in e. coli cells was 250-fold higher than that in bacillus sp. gl1 cells. the enzyme expressed in e. coli cells was purified and characterized. the optimal ph and temperature, and substrate specificity of the purified enzyme were similar to those of the native enzyme from bacillus sp. gl1 cells, although the enzyme expressed in e. coli cells underwent self-assembly into polymeric forms through the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. circular dichroism analysis indicated that the secondary structure of the enzyme was rich in alpha-helices. genes showing high identity (over 40% identity) with that of the enzyme were found in the genomes of some pathogenic bacteria, such as streptococcus pyogenes  and streptococcus pneumoniae, which cause serious diseases (e.g., meningitis and  pneumonia). therefore, the enzyme of bacillus sp. gl1 and the streptococcal proteins form a new glycoside hydrolase family, 88.

TI  == 16s rdna-based identification of bacteria from conjunctival swabs by pcr and dgge fingerprinting.
AB  == purpose: establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. methods: from 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and dna was extracted. fragments of 200 bp, spanning the v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rdna, were amplified by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). for phylogenetic identification, dgge bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16s rdna clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened  by dgge. sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the embl database. furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from  conventional cultivation. results: 16s rdna could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. the following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: staphylococcus (n = 8),  corynebacterium (n = 7), propionibacterium (n = 7), streptococcus (n = 6), bacillus (n = 2), acinetobacter (n = 3), pseudomonas (n = 3), proteus (n = 1), and brevundimonas (n = 1). four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. they had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of pantoea and enterobacter (n = 1), kingella and neisseria (n = 1), serratia and aranicola (n = 1), and leuconostoc and weissella (n = 2), respectively. culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), corynebacteria (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), streptococcus sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). in total, 45% of  the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were pcr positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. no sample positive by culture gave negative results by pcr. conclusions: 16s rdna sequence analyses and dgge fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.

TI  == bacterial contamination of human organ-cultured corneas.
AB  == purpose: the aim of this study was to detect and identify bacterial contaminants  in human corneoscleral tissue after organ culture storage. methods: seventy-two corneoscleral rims and corneal buttons trephined from organ cultured corneoscleral discs using aseptic technique and 45 organ-cultured donor corneoscleral rims postpenetrating keratoplasty) were subjected to a mechanical extraction technique using a stomacher laboratory blender. as a control, 28 of the corneoscleral rims and buttons were halved; one half of each corneoscleral rim and button was decontaminated in formalin for 48 hours before thorough washing in balanced salt solution. corneal specimens, culture medium, and transport (5% dextran) medium were cultured in brain-heart infusion broth at 37 degrees c for 5 days. bacterial isolates were identified after culture of turbid  enrichment broth. results: bacterial contamination was demonstrated in 29% (21 of 72) of the corneoscleral rims and 15% (11 of 72) of the corneal buttons that were trephined aseptically from corneoscleral discs and in 29% (13 of 45) of postkeratoplasty corneoscleral rims. bacterial contaminants were not isolated from controls. isolated microorganisms included coagulase-negative staphylococcus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus viridans, pseudomonas sp, and bacillus sp. a correlation was not demonstrated between contamination and cause of death, death to enucleation, death to culture time, or time in culture.  postkeratoplasty endophthalmitis was not evident in the patients who had received corneal buttons from those corneoscleral discs that had contaminated corneoscleral rims. conclusions: bacterial contamination exists in corneoscleral  tissue after organ culture storage. the difference in distribution of bacteria and percentage of contamination between the peripheral and central corneas causes us to question the value of routine postpenetrating keratoplasty corneoscleral rim cultures.

TI  == rho is not essential for viability or virulence in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == we have identified the gene for transcription termination factor rho in staphylococcus aureus. deletion of rho in s. aureus reveals that it is not essential for viability or virulence. we also searched the available bacterial genomic sequences for homologs of rho and found that it is broadly distributed and highly conserved. exceptions include streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus  pyogenes, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma pneumoniae, ureaplasma urealyticum, and synechocystis sp. strain pcc6803, all of which appear not to possess a rho homolog. complementation studies indicate that s. aureus rho possesses the same activity as escherichia coli rho and that the rho inhibitor bicyclomycin is active against s. aureus rho. our results explain the lack of activity of bicyclomycin against many gram-positive bacteria and raise the possibility that the essentiality of rho may be the exception rather than the rule.

TI  == bacterial colonization of toys in neonatal intensive care cots.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the bacteria and fungi contaminating toys in neonatal  intensive care unit (nicu) cots, the colonization rates, and factors that influence them. methods: a cross-sectional, longitudinal bacteriologic survey of  all toys in the cots of infants in an nicu. all the toys in an infant's cot were  cultured weekly for 4 weeks. data were collected on the infant's postnatal age, the type of cot, whether humidity was added, characteristics of the toy, and any  infant infections. results: over the 4-week period, there were 86 cultures from 34 toys of 19 infants. bacteria were grown from 84/86 (98%): 84 of the cultures grew coagulase-negative staphylococcus, 50 micrococcus sp, 21 bacillus sp, 13 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 12 diphtheroids, 4 group b streptococcus, 3 s aureus, 3 nonhemolytic streptococci, 3 group d streptococci, 4 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and 2 coliforms. none grew fungi. the colonization  rate did not differ with cot type, presence of humidity, size of the toy, toy fiber length, or the fluffiness score. eight (42%) of the infants had positive blood culture results and 5/8 of the isolates (63%) were of the same type as that colonizing their corresponding toy. implications: with time, all the toys in nicu cots became colonized with bacteria. many were potentially pathogenic. toys may be reservoirs for potential infantile nosocomial sepsis. infant, newborn, toys, infection, neonatal intensive care.

TI  == thermobacillus xylanilyticus gen. nov., sp. nov., a new aerobic thermophilic xylan-degrading bacterium isolated from farm soil.
AB  == an aerobic, thermophilic, xylanolytic, spore-forming bacterium, xetp (t = type strain; p = patent strain), has been isolated from farm soil situated underneath  a manure heap in northern france. strain xetp, which stained negative in the gram test, occurs as short rods which sometimes form chains. its spores are ellipsoidal, central to subterminal and occur in swollen sporangia. it grows at temperatures up to 63 degrees c and in the ph range 6.5-8.5. when grown on glucose in optimal conditions, its doubling time was found to be 33 min. co2 was  observed to have a growth-stimulating effect at the start of the culture. in addition to glucose, the isolate utilizes xylose, arabinose, mannose, cellobiose, galactose, maltose, sucrose, xylan and starch. growth is inhibited by 5% nacl. the g+c content of strain xetp is 57.5 mol%. the 16s rdna sequence analysis indicated that strain xetp falls into the radiation of the bacillus-lactobacillus-streptococcus subdivision of the gram-positive phylum. its three closest phylogenetic relatives are 'bacillus viscosus', paenibacillus curdlanolyticus and bacillus popilliae with identity values of 91.15, 90.94 and 90.92%, respectively. the major cellular fatty acids are 14-methyl pentadecanoic  acid (16:0 iso), hexadecanoic acid (16:0) and 14-methyl hexadecanoic acid (17:0 anteiso). on the basis of 16s rrna sequence and chemotaxonomic characteristics, the isolate is different enough for it to be considered as a member of a new genus. it is therefore proposed that this isolate represents a new genus and species: thermobacillus xylanilyticus. strain xetp, the type strain of thermobacillus xylanilyticus, has been deposited in the collection nationale de cultures microbiennes (cncm i-1017) as a patent strain.

TI  == comb, a novel competence gene required for natural transformation of acinetobacter sp. bd413: identification, characterization, and analysis of growth-phase-dependent regulation.
AB  == here we describe five tandemly arranged and converging orfs in acinetobacter sp.  bd413, namely lytb, orfy, orfx, comb, and orfz, located upstream of the previously identified competence gene comc. the n-termini of the deduced proteins orfy and comb exhibit the conserved endopeptidase cleavage motifs of prepilin proteins; the deduced protein comb is similar to type iv pilins. lytb is similar  to the escherichia coli lytb, which has been implicated in the stringent response. no homologues of orfx, orfy and orfz could be identified. a mutation in orfy or orfz led to 100-fold reduced transformation frequencies and a mutation in comb resulted in a non-competent phenotype. disruption of lytb did not affect the natural transformation phenotype. complementation studies clearly demonstrated that comb is involved in natural transformation, whereas the transformation-deficient phenotypes of orfy and orfz mutants were due to polar effects on comb and comc, respectively. analyses of the twitching motility phenotype and of the ultrastructure of the noncompetent comb mutant suggested that the competence gene comb is not essential for the biogenesis of type iv pili and expression of the type iv pili-associated property of twitching motility. transcriptional fusions between comb and a promoter-free lacz gene were constructed, and analysis of growth-phase-dependent transcription revealed increased expression of comb during prolonged exponential and stationary phases.

TI  == enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  == enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no  antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl.  tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.

TI  == the role of probiotic cultures in the control of gastrointestinal health.
AB  == the use of probiotics to enhance intestinal health has been proposed for many years. probiotics are traditionally defined as viable microorganisms that have a  beneficial effect in the prevention and treatment of specific pathologic conditions when they are ingested. there is a relatively large volume of literature that supports the use of probiotics to prevent or treat intestinal disorders. however, the scientific basis of probiotic use has been firmly established only recently, and sound clinical studies have begun to be published. currently, the best-studied probiotics are the lactic acid bacteria, particularly lactobacillus sp. and bifidobacterium sp. however, other organisms used as probiotics in humans include escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., enterococcus sp., bacteroides sp., bacillus sp., propionibacterium sp. and various fungi. some probiotic preparations contain mixtures of more than one bacterial strain. probiotics have been examined for their effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of a diverse spectrum of gastrointestinal disorders such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea (including clostridium difficile-associated intestinal disease), infectious bacterial and viral diarrhea (including diarrhea  caused by rotavirus, shigella, salmonella, enterotoxigenic e. coli, vibrio cholerae and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency disorder, enteral feeding diarrhea, helicobacter pylori gastroenteritis, sucrase maltase deficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, small bowel bacterial overgrowth and lactose intolerance. probiotics have been found to inhibit intestinal bacterial enzymes involved in the synthesis of colonic carcinogens. there are many mechanisms by which probiotics enhance intestinal health, including stimulation of immunity, competition for limited nutrients, inhibition of epithelial and mucosal adherence, inhibition of epithelial invasion and production of antimicrobial substances. probiotics represent an exciting prophylactic and therapeutic advance, although additional investigations must be  undertaken before their role in intestinal health can be delineated clearly.

TI  == antibacterial activity of orobanche cernua extract.
AB  == the effect of the parasitic plant orobanche cernua extract was evaluated on 5 different gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. dilution experiments show that the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic; microgram/ml) of the extract was  as follows: staphylococcus aureus-1526.5; streptococcus sp.-3125; streptococcus pyogenes-25,000 and both for bacillus cereus and escherichia coli-50,000 micrograms/ml. data indicated that the mic of 3125 micrograms/ml is equal to cefotaxime (30 micrograms) and tobromycin (10 micrograms) activity against streptococcus sp. and s. aureus, respectively; 25,000 and 50,000 micrograms/ml is equal to cefotaxime (30 micrograms) activity against s. pyogenes and b. cereus, respectively, and 50,000 micrograms/ml is equal to nalidixic acid (30 micrograms) activity against e. coli. it can be concluded that the o. cernua extract displays remarkable activity against some gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus and staphylococcus.

AB  == thirteen teeth with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis and nine severe periodontal pockets were cultured for presence of beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms. samples were dispersed and plated on two non-selective and one selective growth media and incubated anaerobically and in 10% co2 in air. a total of 59 beta-hemolytic colonies were purified and identified. eight beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates were obtained from three  of the severe marginal periodontitis sites. all were identified as belonging to the streptococcus sanguis group. no beta-hemolytic streptococci were detected in  apical periodontitis samples. twenty obligately anaerobic isolates were detected, all of which were known periodontal and endodontic pathogens. isolates from apical periodontitis sites were identified as propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces naeslundii, actionomyces odontolyticus and peptostreptococcus micros, while severe marginal periodontal sites contained the same species with the addition of actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces meyeri. of 19 staphylococci and  micrococci, staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant isolate in both apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis sites. however, less commonly known organisms such as staphylococcus cohnii and micrococcus sp. were identified in severe marginal periodontitis sites. the isolation of bacillus sp. (12 isolates) in one severe marginal periodontitis and two apical periodontitis subjects was especially interesting, warranting consideration of this organism as a legitimate isolate and potential pathogen in oral disease.

TI  == rapid identification of burkholderia pseudomallei in blood cultures by a monoclonal antibody assay.
AB  == burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis. in northeast thailand, this gram-negative bacterium is a major cause of mortality from septicemia. the definitive diagnosis of this disease is made by bacterial culture. in this study, we produced a monoclonal antibody (mab) specific to the 30-kda protein of b. pseudomallei by in vivo and in vitro immunization of balb/c  mice with a crude culture filtrate antigen. the mab could directly agglutinate with all 243 clinical isolates of b. pseudomallei but not with other gram-negative bacteria, except for one strain of burkholderia mallei. however, the mab cross-reacted with the gram-positive bacillus sp. and streptococcus pyogenes. b. pseudomallei in brain heart infusion broth (bhib) subcultured from a bact/alert automated blood culture system could be identified by simple agglutination with this mab assay. the sensitivity and specificity of direct agglutination compared to the "gold standard," the culture method, were 94.12 and 98.25%, respectively. however, the mab adsorbed to polystyrene beads or latex particles directly identified the bacterium in blood culture specimens and in bhib subcultured from a bact/alert automated blood culture system. the sensitivity of the latex agglutination test was 100% for both blood culture and bhib specimens. the specificity was 85.96 and 96.49% for the blood culture and bhib specimens, respectively. the specificity could be increased if the nonspecific materials in the blood culture broths were eradicated by centrifugation at low speeds. thus, a combination of blood culture and the agglutination method could be used for the rapid diagnosis of melioidosis in the  routine bacteriological laboratory. this method could speed up detection of the bacterium in blood culture by at least 2 days, compared to the conventional bacterial culture method. in addition, the mab is stable at room temperature for  2 weeks and at 4, -20, and -70 degrees c for at least 1 year. the latex reagent was stable for at least 6 months at 4 degrees c.

TI  == conjugative mobilization of the rolling-circle plasmid pip823 from listeria monocytogenes bm4293 among gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == we determined the sequence and genetic organization of plasmid pip823, which contains the dfrd gene; dfrd confers high-level trimethoprim resistance to listeria monocytogenes bm4293 by synthesis of dihydrofolate reductase type s2. pip823 possessed all the features of the pub110/pc194 plasmid family, whose members replicate by the rolling-circle mechanism. the rep gene encoded a protein identical to repu, the protein required for initiation of the replication of plasmids ptb913 from a thermophilic bacillus sp. and pub110 from staphylococcus aureus. the mob gene encoded a protein with a high degree of amino acid identity  with the mob proteins involved in conjugative mobilization and interplasmidic recombination of ptb913 and pub110. the host range of pip823 was broad and included l. monocytogenes, enterococcus faecalis, s. aureus, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli. in all these species, pip823 replicated by generating single-stranded dna and was stable. conjugative mobilization of pip823 was obtained by self-transferable plasmids between l. monocytogenes and e. faecalis,  between l. monocytogenes and e. coli, and between strains of e. coli, and by the  streptococcal conjugative transposon tn1545 from l. monocytogenes to e. faecalis, and from l. monocytogenes and e. faecalis to e. coli. these data indicate that the gene flux observed in nature from gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria can occur by conjugative mobilization. our results suggest that dissemination of trimethoprim resistance in listeria spp. and acquisition of other antibiotic resistance determinants in this species can be anticipated.

TI  == the biological activity of selected cyclic dipeptides.
AB  == cyclic dipeptides are widely used as models for larger peptides because of their  simplicity and limited conformational freedom. some cyclic dipeptides have been shown to be antiviral, antibiotic and anti-tumour. the aim of this study was to determine the biological activity of four cyclic dipeptides synthesized in this laboratory: cyclo(l-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl), cyclo(l-tyrosyl-l-prolyl), cyclo(l-tryptophanyl-l-prolyl) and cyclo(l-tryptophanyl-l-tryptophanyl). the enhancement or inhibition of calcium channels in ventricular myocytes from rats and delayed-rectifier potassium channels in ventricular myocytes from guinea-pigs were determined by use of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. the induction of  differentiation in ht-29 cells was assessed by assaying for an increase in the expression of alkaline phosphatase. antibiotic properties against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilus and streptococcus sp. were determined by use of the kirby-bauer disc-diffusion assay. results from these assays indicate that the cyclic dipeptides have biological activity in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. three of  the dipeptides block cation channels in ventricular myocytes and all increase the expression of alkaline phosphatase. all the dipeptides have concentration-dependent antibacterial properties. these results suggest that with increased solubility the cyclic dipeptides might have potential as muscle relaxants, anti-tumour compounds and antibiotics.

TI  == bacterial infection and endotoxin in female reproductive tract in rats: correlation with the developmental status of preimplantation embryos.
AB  == during mammalian preimplantation development, a substantial numbers of embryos are believed to be lost for reasons that are unclear. using female rats, we investigated whether the developmental status of embryos is influenced by bacterial infection and endotoxin in the reproductive tract. from the vagina of cycling rats (n = 11), 21 bacterial isolates were identified; they were streptococcus faecalis (s. faecalis; 38%), escherichia coli (e. coli; 19%), acinetobactor calcoaceticus (a. calcoaceticus; 14%), and coagulase negative staphylococcus (14%), micrococcus sp. (5%), bacillus subtilis (b. subtilis; 5%) and proteus vulgaris (p. vulgaris; 5%). from the vagina of day 4 pregnant rats (n = 12), 26 isolates were identified; they were s. faecalis (23%), a. calcoaceticus (23%), e. coli (15%), micrococcus sp. (15%), b. subtilis (8%), p. vulgaris (4%),  staphylococcus aureus (4%), beta-hemolytic streptococcus (4%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%). gram negative bacteria found in the vagina of cycling and day 4  pregnant rats were 38% and 46%, respectively. in both, bacterial load was 10(3)-10(5) colony forming units and there was no association with the abnormality of the recovered embryos. however, in two day 4 pregnant animals, pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococcus) were isolated and embryos recovered from them were degenerated and deformed. the vagina of day 9 pregnant animals (n = 7) were, however, sterile. consistently, in all animals, the upper reproductive tract (uterus and oviduct) was devoid of any  bacteria and no anaerobic bacteria were isolated from any part of the tract. the  levels of endotoxin in the vagina of cycling and day 4 pregnant rats were 1.35 +/- 0.1 and 1.17 +/- 0.1 endotoxin units (eu), respectively. it was undetectable  in the oviduct and uterus of all animals (n = 5) except one which showed high levels of endotoxin in uterus (4.5 eu) and oviduct (2.2 eu) and the animal also produced degenerated and deformed embryos. these results indicate that common bacterial flora of vagina may not affect embryo development and the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the vagina and/or endotoxin in reproductive tract could be detrimental to viability of gametes and preimplantation embryos in rats.

AB  == between 1990 and 1992, 91 necropsies of small ruminants affected with pulmonary illness led to the isolation of the following strains of mycoplasma (m.): m. mycoides subsp. mycoides lc, m. ovipneumoniae, m. agalactiae, m. sp. type d2 and  m. arginini. eleven pasteurella multocida strains (serotypes a1, a3, a5, a7 and d2) and 11 pasteurella haemolytica strains (serotypes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 9) were isolated. corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, actinomyces pyogenes, staphylococcus sp., streptococcus sp., bacillus sp. and mycobacterium sp. were also isolated. thirty-two antibiograms were performed on pasteurella, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and actinomyces pyogenes strains. eighty eight p. cent were sensitive to penicillin g and oxytetracycline, and 84% to chloramphenicol; 50% were not sensitive to spiramycin and 47% to streptomycin. one capripoxvirus strain was isolated on sheep. pest of small ruminants (ppr) virus was detected by immunocapture elisa test performed on some lung samples. two serological surveys, one for contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (898 goats),  between 1991 and 1993, and one for ppr (902 sheep and goats) in 1993, were conducted in the north and far north provinces. no antibody against contagious caprine pleuropneumonia was detected. among the animals in the sample, ppr prevalence was 64 +/- 7% in the far north province and 14 +/- 3% in the north province. concerning control measures, a vaccination campaign against small ruminant pasteurellosis appears to be hardly feasible because of the antigenic diversity of the isolated pasteurella strains. ppr is endemic especially in the far north province. the efficiency of a vaccination campaign against ppr must be  estimated with a field survey.

TI  == survival and growth of selected pathogens in fermented kocho (ensete ventricosum).
AB  == a study was conducted to investigate the antagonistic potential of fermented kocho, aqueous extract of fermented kocho and spent media from lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from it on salmonella sp, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella sp, bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus. fermented kocho (ph 4.3) inhibited growth of the test bacteria soon after their introduction into the food. the spent media from all of the four lab, isolated from fermented kocho, namely pediococcus sp, leuconostoc sp, lactobacillus sp and streptococcus sp prevented the survival and growth of the test bacteria. the spent medium from streptococcus sp showed the best antagonistic effect amongst all the lab isolates. in all cases the inhibitory effects were independent of ph.

TI  == culture of intraluminal thrombus during abdominal aortic aneurysm resection: significant contamination is rare.
AB  == the significance of positive bacterial cultures from intraluminal thrombus in patients undergoing repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm remains controversial. over the last 4 years, thrombus was cultured during aneurysm repair in 116 patients. all patients received cephalosporin antibiotic before and for 48 h after operation. although none of the aneurysms appeared to be clinically infected, six patients (5.2%) had positive cultures. four groups were identified  based on the bacteria cultured: group i, coagulase-negative staphylococci, light  growth (three patients); group ii, coagulase-negative staphylococci, light growth and 'streptococcus viridans' (one patient); group iii, bacillus sp., heavy growth (gram-negative stain) (one patient); group iv, clostridium perfringens, occasional growth (one patient). one of the six patients died during resection; the other five are alive without graft infection at 5-24 (mean 12) months after operation. the absence of graft infection suggests that positive cultures were not clinically significant or were adequately covered by the antibiotic prophylaxis. the incidence of positive cultures was lower than previously reported. routine culture of aneurysm thrombus in the absence of clinical infection is probably not cost-effective.

TI  == construction of a model secretion system for oral streptococci.
AB  == a dna fragment corresponding to the secretory domain from the streptococcus mutans gs-5 gtfb gene, which encodes the putative 38-amino-acid signal peptide of the glucosyltransferase i (gtf-i) enzyme product, has been constructed. this fragment was fused with the alpha-amylase structural gene from alkalophilic bacillus sp. strain 707. this hybrid gene as well as the intact amylase gene were introduced into an escherichia coli-streptococcus shuttle vector consisting of three components: the e. coli replicon p15aori from pacyc177, an erythromycin resistance gene from pam beta-1, and the streptococcal replicon from pva838. transformation of the oral noncariogenic bacterium streptococcus gordonii with the chimeric plasmid harboring the hybrid amylase gene resulted in strong extracellular amylase production. by contrast, transformants containing the intact amylase gene exhibited only trace amounts of amylase activity in culture fluids. since the two signal peptide structures of the gtf-i enzyme and the bacillus amylase are distinct from each other, these differences might result from the inability of s. gordonii to correctly process the bacillus signal peptide. furthermore, culture fluids from transformants of s. mutans as well as streptococcus milleri harboring the hybrid amylase gene showed only weak amylase  activity. deletion of the gtfb, gtfc, or ftf gene from s. mutans gs-5 did not increase amylase secretion following transformation with the hybrid amylase gene. these results suggest that in contrast to s. gordonii, the inability of s. mutans and s. milleri to secrete hybrid amylase molecules could result from incorrect interaction of the secretory components of these organisms with amylase precursor molecules.

AB  == mesophilic heterotrophic, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria that grow on yeast tryptone glucose extract agar were isolated from the surface of olive leaves of 3 or 4 different ages in january, april, july, and october from 1984 to 1989. unweighted average linkage cluster analysis on either the jaccard coefficient or the simple matching coefficient recovered 1,701 representative strains in 32 phena defined at the 70% and 80% similarity level, respectively. of these, 25 were identified to genus or lower level. from the identity of the representative strains, the frequency of occurrence among the phylloplane bacteria over the 6-year period was estimated at 51% forpseudomonas syringae, followed byxanthomonas campestris (6.7%),erwinia herbicola (6%),acetobacter aceti (4.7%),gluconobacter oxydans (4.3%),pseudomonas fluorescens (3.9%),bacillus megaterium (3.8%),leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp.dextranicum (3.1%),lactobacillus plantarum (2.8%),curtobacterium plantarum (2.2%),micrococcus luteus (2.2%),arthrobacter globiformis (1.4%),klebsiella planticola (1.2%),streptococcus faecium (1.2%),clavibacter sp.

(6 bands), b. cereus (3 bands), b. subtilis (7 bands), staphylococcus aureus (13 bands), streptococcus faecalis (3 bands), and strep. pyogenes (5 bands). molecular masses of cell wall hydrolases ranged from 17 to 114.6 kda. lytic activities against cell walls of corynebacterium sepedonicum (clavibacter michiganense pv. sepedonicum) could be shown with the cell wall extracts of strep. pyogenes (45.7 kda), strep. faecalis (67 kda), b. megaterium (67 kda), and staph. aureus (67 kda).

AB  == a study was conducted to determine the significance of starvation resistance to the ability of a species to survive in sewage and lake water. tests were conducted for periods of up to 14 days. rhizobium meliloti and one fluorescent and one nonfluorescent strain of pseudomonas were resistant to starvation because their population sizes did not fall appreciably in buffer and sterile lake water, and the first two maintained high numbers after being added to sterile sewage. cell densities of these bacterial species dropped slowly in nonsterile sewage, and more cells of these three organisms than of the other test organisms remained in nonsterile lake water. rhizobium leguminosarum was moderately resistant to starvation because its numbers fell slowly in buffer and sterile lake water and did not change appreciably in sterile sewage. the abundance of micrococcus flavus added to buffer and sterile lake water did not change, but the density of m. flavus declined in nonsterile lake water. the abundance of r. leguminosarum fell  in nonsterile lake water and nonsterile sewage. streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, an asporogenous strain of bacillus subtilis, and streptococcus sp. were susceptible to starvation because their populations were markedly reduced in buffer. populations of the last three species declined rapidly in nonsterile and sterile samples of lake water and sewage. s. faecalis declined rapidly when added to nonsterile lake water and sewage and sterile lake  water but not when added to sterile sewage, the persistence in the last instance  probably being associated with the availability of organic nutrients.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in tonsils of children with recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == tonsils were obtained from 50 children suffering from recurrent tonsillitis. patients' ages ranged from 2.5 to 17 years (mean 6 years); 29 were males and 21 females. the tonsils were sectioned in half after heat searing of the surface and the core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained in all patients, yielding an average of  7.8 isolates (4.1 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes) per specimen. there were 207 anaerobes isolated. the predominant isolates were 101 bacteroides sp (including 10 b fragilis group, and 47 b melaninogenicus group), 29 fusobacterium sp, 34 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (25 peptococcus sp and 9 peptostreptococcus sp) and 16 veillonella sp. there were 185 aerobic isolates. the predominant isolates were 41 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 24 staphylococcus aureus, 19 beta-hemolytic streptococci (11 group a, 4 group b, and 2 each group c and f), 14 haemophilus sp (including 12 h influenzae type b) and 5 h parainfluenzae. beta-lactamase production was noted in 56 isolates recovered from 37 tonsils. these were all isolates of s aureus (24) and b fragilis (10), 15 of 47 b melaninogenicus (32%),  5 of the 12 b oralis (42%), and 2 of 12 h influenzae type b (17%). our findings indicate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of deep tonsillar flora in children with recurrent tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in 74% of the patients.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of burns in children.
AB  == aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of burn sites in 180 children were monitored. specimens were obtained twice a week; each patient had between one and 21 cultures taken (mean 2.4). a total of 392 specimens were collected over 2 years, of which 319 were positive. aerobic bacteria alone were present in 225 specimens (71%) and anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 26 (8%). mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were present in 68 burn specimens (21%). a total of 580 isolates (448 aerobes and 132 anaerobes) were recovered, accounting for 1.8 isolates per specimen (1.4 aerobes and 0.4 anaerobes). the predominant aerobic isolates were s. epidermidis, s. aureus, alpha hemolytic streptococcus, pseudomonas sp., and group d streptococcus. the predominant anaerobic isolates were: p. acnes, anaerobic gram-positive cocci, and bacteroides sp. blood cultures were drawn from 45 children: four showed bacterial growth of one of each of the following isolates: s. aureus, e. coli, peptococcus asaccharolyticus, and b. fragilis. the numbers of isolates per specimen were higher in the oral and anal area (3.2 and 2.8) than in the extremities and trunk (1.8 and 0.9). gram-negative enteric rods and group d streptococci were more frequently recovered from the anal area. s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and p. acnes were more frequently recovered from extremities. bacteroides sp. and fusobacterium nucleatum were more frequently recovered from the anal and oral areas. all children were treated with local application of silver sulfadiazine, and antimicrobial therapy was used in 128 children. statistical analysis showed no correlation between the bacteria isolated and use of antimicrobial agents. these data suggest a role for anaerobic bacteria in the colonization of burns in children, especially in burns of the anal and oral areas.

TI  == controlled cell disruption: a comparison of the forces required to disrupt different micro-organisms.
AB  == a cell disrupter has been developed which can measure the forces required to disrupt both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. it operates a continuous process and will disrupt both large and small volumes. shear forces are set up when a suspension under laminar flow conditions is released under high pressure through  a short orifice. if the applied pressure is altered, the shear forces are simultaneously changed so that the amount of cell disruption can be compared under different known and repeatable conditions. the disrupter is now manufactured and supplied by stansted fluid power limited, stansted, england. phase-contrast microscopy has shown that the disrupter will break a variety of organisms including chlorella, aspergillus fumigatis, fusarium sp., saccharomyces cerevisiae, escherichia coli, lactobacillus casei, bacillus subtilis, clostridium perfringens, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus zooepidermicus and staphylococcus aureus. the cells are not all broken at one pressure but a certain pressure must be applied before disruption starts which will then increase rapidly as the applied pressure is increased. the applied pressure required to disrupt half the population in a culture is different from one species to another, rods being disrupted more easily than spheres. the case of disruption seems to be related to the shape and chemical composition of the cell wall. furthermore, the disrupting process, in an unsynchronized culture is not random and may be related to the statistical size distribution of the cells.

TI  == [behavior of some microorganisms cultivated in the presence of irradiated maize starch].
AB  == the bactericidal effect of water soluble radiolysis products of maize starch on escherichia coli cultures declines when the initial population grows. this toxicity varies with the culture environment and the bacterial species: bacillus  subtilis, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus faecalis, enterobacter sp. moreover, for the eucaryote cell saccharomyces cerevisiae, wild strain or muting  "small colonies", only the generating time is altered by the active parts of radiolysis products. the results are analysed with regard to the hypothesis that  the hydrogen peroxide is responsible for this toxicity.

TI  == bacteremia after upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.
AB  == during 24 months, 200 upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed on 193 patients. blood cultures were obtained before and five and 30 minutes after the procedure using thiol (50 ml) and trypticase soy broth (100 ml) media. the mean endoscopic time was 34 minutes. sixteen patients developed bacteremia (8%). twelve groups of microorganisms were detected in positive blood cultures: streptococcus (5 species), lactobacillus sp, veillonella alcalescens, staphylococcus aureus, staph epidermidis, propioni-bacterium acnes, corynebacterium acnes, and bacillus subtilis. seven patients had positive blood cultures at five and 30 minutes, eight at five minutes, and one at 30 minutes only. there was no clear correlation of bacteremia with the age or previous history of the patient, biopsy, active bleeding, endoscopic time, or findings. a  follow-up study of all patients for six months to two years indicated no complications related to endoscopy and/or bacteremia.

TI  == a simplified method using commercial milk powder for hand-rearing of the caesarean-derived infant rabbits (author's transl).
AB  == an efficient and simplified method for hand-rearing of caesarean-derived infant rabbits under gnotobiotic condition was devised. the caesarean-derived infant dutch or japanese-white rabbits and their hybrids (f1; japanese-white female x dutch male) were reared in sterilized vinyl-isolators by hand-feeding with two kinds of milk diets, a and b, consisted mainly ofa commercial milk powder for dogs and cats (esbilac) supplemented with several minor components (table 2) and  administered intragastrically once a day through a nelaton's catheter. bacteriological examinations revealed that feces and urine were sterile for the first three days. on the third day, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus, and bacteroides sp. were given with milk diet and the infant rabbits were reared until 10 to 12 weeks of age. the weaning rate at 5 weeks of age and the raising rate at 3 months of age were approximately 78% and 77%, respectively (table 3), indicating that feeding once-a-day with a milk diet mainly composed of esbilac is suitable for the hand-rearing of infant rabbits. there was, however, no significant difference milk diet a and b on the weaning rate.

TI  == biological values of the infant, juvenile, and adult agouti (dasyprocta sp) with  emphasis on microbial flora.
AB  == normal values for intestinal flora were determined on four adult, two juvenile, and four infant agoutis (dasyprocta sp) maintained at our institution. serologic, hematologic, biochemical, and histologic observations were also made on these same agoutis, and serologic, microbiologic, and endoparasitic tests were made on  serum and fecal samples from agoutis maintained at other institutions. streptococci, lactobacilli and nonenteropathogenic escherichia coli were isolated from cecal contents of all age groups. gaffkya tetragena and bacillus sp were recovered from infant agoutis, proteus mirabilis from juvenile agoutis, and proteus mirabilis and micrococcus sp from adult agoutis. infant agoutis showed marginal antibody titers to reovirus type 3 and toolan's h-1 viruses, and theiler's gdvii antibodies were detected in juvenile agoutis, but no antibody titers to murine viruses were found in the adult agoutis maintained at our institution. hematologic, biochemical, and histologic data for these agoutis were comparable to those of other hystricomorph rodents. serologic tests of the agoutis maintained at other institutions disclosed antibodies for gdvii virus in  all of 17 animals tested, while marginal titers were found for sendai virus in four and for reovirus type 3 in eight of the 17 animals. only low incidences of pathogenic bacteria (salmonella, pseudomonas, and citrobacter) were isolated from the agoutis maintained elsewhere. the endoparasites found in these agoutis were ascaris, toxascaris, strongyloides, trichuris, and trichomonas.

TI  == [kinetics of setting up of a human fecal flora in germ free mice and trial of decontamination of antibiotherapy (author's transl)].
AB  == we have tried in this study to reproduce in germfree mice a bacterial equilibrium observed previously in the gastrointestinal tract of child "l.n.", reared in a plastic isolator. eight bacterial strains were studied. seven had been fortuitously introduced: acinetobacter lwoffi ln1, staphylococcus epidermidis ln2, clostridium perfringens ln3, plectridium anatum ln4, streptococcus bovis ln5, enterobacter cloacae ln6, corynebacterium sp ln7. the eighth strain was purposely administered to the child in order to take advantage of an antagonism between this strain and spontaneously acquired flora. this strain is bacillus licheniformis fd1. the gnotoxenic mice proved to be a good experimental model because we found their bacterial equilibrium comparable to that observed in child l.n. in addition, we studied the decontamination procedures of the gastrointestinal tract of mice by observing both the antagonism of b. licheniformis with bacitracin, and the action of a suitable mixture of antibiotics. conditions for the realization of this decontamination are discussed in this study.

TI  == formation of methyl mercury by bacteria.
AB  == twenty-three hg2+-resistant cultures were isolated from sediment of the savannah  river in georgia; of these, 14 were gram-negative short rods belonging to the genera escherichia and enterobacter, six were gram-positive cocci (three staphylococcus sp. and three streptococcus sp.) and three were bacillus sp. all the escherichia, enterobacter, and the bacillus strain were more resistant to hg2+ than the strains of staphylococci and streptococci. adaptation using serial  dilutions and concentration gradient agar plate techniques showed that it was possible to select a hg2+-resistant strain from a parent culture identified as enterobacter aerogenes. this culture resisted 1,200 mug of hg2+ per ml of medium  and produced methyl mercury from hgcl2, but was unable to convert hg2+ to volatile elemental mercury (hg0). under constant aeration (i.e., submerged culture), slightly more methyl mercury was formed than in the absence of aeration. production of methyl mercury was cyclic in nature and slightly decreased if dl-homocysteine was present in media, but increased with methylcobalamine. it is concluded that the bacterial production of methyl mercury may be a means of resistance and detoxification against mercurials in which inorganic hg2+ is converted to organic form and secreted into the environment.

TI  == bactericidal properties of the concentrated artificial kidney bath solution.
AB  == this study was undertaken to investigate the ability of a 30 times concentrated dialysate fluid to support or inhibit growth of bacteria, and to evaluate its shelf life. the solution was inoculated with the following organisms in the logarithmic-growth phase: escherichia coli, coagulase-positive staphylococcus aureus, enteric streptococcus sp., pseudomonas sp., klebsiella-aerobacter sp., proteus sp., and bacillus subtilis. inoculated concentrate held at 37 c showed an exponential decrease in organisms for all species except b. subtilis, with no organisms recoverable at 24 hr. to determine the effects of temperature, solution inoculated with e. coli and s. aureus was kept at 4 and 20 c. lesser rates of bacterial decline were found at the lower temperatures, with some organisms surviving for 146 hr at 4 c. for the evaluation of shelf life, 2 liters of the solution was kept at room temperature in screw-cap bottles for 8 months; no bacterial growth occurred. the self-sterilizing property of this solution is important practically, since it removes another source of contamination from patients with reduced resistance to infection due to chronic renal disease or immunosuppressive therapy for renal homotransplantation.
