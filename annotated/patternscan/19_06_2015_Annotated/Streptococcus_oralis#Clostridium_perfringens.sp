TI  == clostridium perfringens liver abscess after pancreatic resection.
AB  == background: liver abscess is a rare complication after pancreatectomy. clostridium perfingens is a rare cause of intrahepatic infections. case report: a 65-year-old woman with pancreatic cancer underwent explorative laparotomy, during which encasement of the hepatic artery by the tumor was found. neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy with capecitabine was started, which caused tumor regression, and duodenopancreatectomy was performed. the portal vein was occluded and infiltrated by cancer and therefore was resected and not reconstructed. after a slow recovery, the patient developed hemorrhage at the gastrojejunal anastomosis, which was controlled by fibrin injection. within a few days, she presented with signs of sepsis, and blood cultures yielded clostridium perfringens, streptococcus oralis, staphylococcus aureus, and candida albicans. the source of  the sepsis proved to be a 9-cm liver abscess, which was drained; cultures grew c. perfringens, hafnia alvei, and enterobacter cloacae. despite antibiotic treatment, the patient died from sepsis and multiorgan failure 27 days after pancreatic surgery. conclusion: such rare infections can follow pancreatic resection with neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. clostridium perfringens-associated  liver abscess maintains a high mortality rate.
