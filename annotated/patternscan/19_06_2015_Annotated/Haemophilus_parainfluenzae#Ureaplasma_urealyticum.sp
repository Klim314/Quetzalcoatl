TI  == [diagnosis of urethritis in men. a 3-year review].
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study is to know the prevalence and tendency of microorganisms producing urethritis, in men, in the city centre of madrid. methods: cross-sectional study. the urethral samples of 1.248 men were analyzed,  for 3 years. the samples were studied for: gram stain, when secretion exists; culture in habitual plates; detection of c. trachomatis, u. urealyticum and m. hominis, when there was suspicious, study of t. vaginalis and when suspicious injuries exist, study of virus herpes simplex. results: the percentage of positive samples was 22.60%. the isolated microorganisms were: u. urealyticum 7.61%, n. gonorrhoeae 6.33%, c. trachomatis 4.81%, m. hominis 0.24%, h. parainfluenzae 1.76%, h. influenzae 1.12%, candida spp 0.48%, s. pyogenes 0.16% and herpes virus simplex (2) 0.08%. two or more microorganisms were isolated in 1.68%. the percentage of positive samples in 2003 was 17.41% and n. gonorrhoeae the most frequent microorganism (6.22%). in 2004 was 25.57% and the most frequent u. urealyticum (10.18%). in 2005 the 24.50% of the samples were positive and u. urealyticum the most frequent (7.92%). the 79.41% of n. gonorrhoeae were susceptible to all antibiotics tested. it is not found resistance to ceftriaxone, claritromicine and amoxicilline/clavulanic acid. the 11.76% were betalactamase- producing. the 26.47% of haemophilus spp. were betalactamase- producing and all strains were susceptible to cefotaxime. conclusions: the isolated microorganisms  most frequently were: u. urealyticum, n. gonorrhoeae and c. trachomatis. there is an increase of 7% of prevalence between the years 2003 and 2005. ceftriaxone, claritromicine and amoxicilline/clavulanic acid were susceptible to all the strains studied and cefotaxime to all haemophilus spp.

TI  == clinical and microbiologic features of urethritis in men in toulouse, france.
AB  == on hundred twenty-six men who attended a hospital microbiology laboratory and 99  men who attended a private laboratory in toulouse, france, for symptoms of urethritis were examined during 1988, for evidence of urethral pathogens. the following incidences were found: neisseria gonorrhoeae: 24 (10.7%); chlamydia trachomatis: 58 (25.8%); ureaplasma urealyticum: 46 (20.4%); gardnerella vaginalis: 21 (9.3%); haemophilus parainfluenzae: 21 (9.3%); streptococcus agalactiae: 15 (6.7%); candida albicans: 10 (4.4%); and trichomonas vaginalis: 4  (1.8%). the prevalence of these microorganisms was similar in the two groups of patients. no pathogen was isolated from 71 patients (31.6%). mixed infections with at least two pathogens were found in 49 men (21.8%). another goal of this study was to determine the relative prevalence of urethral pathogens in relation  to clinical findings. n. gonorrhoeae was isolated significantly more often in patients who had a urethral discharge (p less than .05) that contained five or more polymorphonuclear cells per high-power field (pmn/hpf) (p less than .001). g. vaginalis was isolated significantly more often in patients who did not have an urethral discharge (p less than .05) and in men with less than five pmn/hpf (p less than .05). isolation of c. albicans was significantly associated with pruritus (p less than .05) and balanitis (p less than .001). like the clinical features, the gram-stained urethral smear was of limited value in diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making regarding non-gonococcal urethritis. in contrast, this study underlines the importance of full identification of urethral isolates  in the management of urethritis in men.
