TI  - Bacterial 16S sequence analysis of severe caries in young permanent teeth.
AB  - Previous studies have confirmed the association of the acid producers Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus spp. with childhood caries, but they also suggested these microorganisms are not sufficient to explain all cases of caries. In addition, health-associated bacterial community profiles are not well understood, including the importance of base production and acid catabolism in pH homeostasis. The bacterial community composition in health and in severe caries of the young permanent dentition was compared using Sanger sequencing of the ribosomal 16S rRNA genes. Lactobacillus species were dominant in severe caries, and levels rose significantly as caries progressed from initial to deep lesions. S. mutans was often observed at high levels in the early stages of caries but also in some healthy subjects and was not statistically significantly associated with caries progression in the overall model. Lactobacillus or S. mutans was found either at low levels or not present in several samples. Other potential acid producers observed at high levels in these subjects included strains of Selenomonas, Neisseria, and Streptococcus mitis. Propionibacterium FMA5 was significantly associated with caries progression but was not found at high levels. An overall loss of community diversity occurred as caries progressed, and species that significantly decreased included the Streptococcus mitis-S. pneumoniae-S. infantis group, Corynebacterium matruchotii, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus cristatus, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Eubacterium IR009, Campylobacter rectus, and Lachnospiraceae sp. C1. The relationship of acid-base metabolism to 16S rRNA gene-based species assignments appears to be complex, and metagenomic approaches that would allow functional profiling of entire genomes will be helpful in elucidating the microbial pathogenesis of caries.
TI  - Production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from Staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  - Staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. These strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of Staphylococcus aureus FDA209P. The frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. Strain IYS2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. IYS2 was identified to be S. aureus, based on its biological properties. The bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. Its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. The isoelectric point was 10.0. In amino acid composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. The bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. The bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. An analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that Streptococcus salivarius, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium parvulum, and Actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacterionema matruchotii, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. The majority of S. aureus tested were susceptible, and all Staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.
