TI  - Effect of commercial starter cultures on volatile compound profile and sensory characteristics of dry-cured foal sausage.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present work deals with the evaluation of the effect of three different commercial starter cultures (Chr. Hansen, Horsholm, Denmark) on the volatile compound profile and sensory properties, as well as some important physicochemical parameters, of dry-fermented foal sausages at the end of ripening in order to select the most suitable starter culture for this elaboration. The sausage batches were named as follows: CO (non-inoculated control), FS (Lactobacillus sakei + Staphylococcus carnosus), SM (L. sakei + S. carnosus + Staphylococcus xylosus + Pediococcus pentosaceus + Debaryomyces hansenii) and TR (L. sakei + S. carnosus +S. xylosus). RESULTS: The pH values differed significantly among batches, with the highest values corresponding to CO followed by TR, SM and FS. The highest amounts of volatile compounds were found in FS batch. Hexanal was the most abundant compound, especially in FS and SM batches. These batches also showed higher levels of compounds derived from carbohydrate fermentation and amino acid catabolism. Sensory results showed that acid taste was significantly lower in CO batch than in inoculated batches. CONCLUSION: According to most parameters, batches inoculated with FS and SM starters showed marked acidity compared with TR and CO batches, as expected from the manufacturer's indications. Therefore the most suitable starter culture for use in the manufacture of foal sausages in Mediterranean countries such as Spain with a preference for low-acidity products was found to be TR culture.

TI  - Effect of lactic acid fermentation of lupine wholemeal on acrylamide content and  quality characteristics of wheat-lupine bread.
AB  - The effect of supplementing wheat flour at a level of 15% with lupine (Lupinus angustifolius L.) wholemeal fermented by different lactic acid bacteria on acrylamide content in bread crumb as well as on bread texture and sensory characteristics was analysed. The use of fermented lupine resulted in a lower specific volume and crumb porosity of bread on an average by 14.1% and 10.5%, respectively, while untreated lupine lowered the latter parameters at a higher level (30.8% and 20.7%, respectively). The addition of lupine resulted in a higher by 43.3% acrylamide content compared to wheat bread (19.4 microg/kg dry weight (d.w.)). Results showed that acrylamide was significantly reduced using proteolytic Lactobacillus sakei and Pediococcus pentosaceus 10 strains for lupine fermentation. Although the bread supplemented with lupine spontaneous sourdough had the lowest level of acrylamide (15.6 microg/kg d.w.), it had the malodorous flavour and was unacceptable to the consumers. The lactofermentation could increase the potential use of lupine as a food ingredient while reducing acrylamide formation and enriching bread with high quality proteins.
TI  - Identification and characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from mixed pasture of timothy and orchardgrass, and its badly preserved silage.
AB  - In order to understand the relationship between lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species and silage fermentation, a total of 65 LAB strains isolated from mixed pasture of timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), and its badly preserved silages were subjected to phenotypic and genetic analysis. According to these analyses, the isolates were divided into 13 groups, including Enterococcus gallinarum, Lactobacillus acidipiscis, L. coryniformis subsp. coryniformis, L. coryniformis subsp. torquens, L. curvatus, L. paraplantarum, L. plantarum subsp. argentoratensis, L. plantarum subsp. plantarum, L. sakei subsp. carnosus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Pediococcus acidilactici, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Weissella hellenica, Weissella paramesenteroides and Carnobacterium divergens. This is the first report to document that C. divergens, L. acidipiscis, L. sakei subsp. carnosus, L. garvieae, phenotypically novel L. lactis subsp. cremoris, E. gallinarum and W. hellenica are present in vegetative forage crops. L. plantarum group strains were most frequently isolated from the badly preserved silages. Some isolates showed a wide range of growth preferences for carbohydrate utilization, optimal growth pH and temperature in vitro, indicating that they have a high growth potential. These results are useful in understanding the diversity of LAB associated with decayed silage of timothy and orchardgrass.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria isolated from rye sourdoughs produce bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances active against Bacillus subtilis and fungi.
AB  - AIM: To screen five strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from rye sourdoughs for the potential production of antimicrobial substances. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lactobacillus sakei KTU05-06, Pediococcus acidilactici KTU05-7, Pediococcus pentosaceus KTU05-8, KTU05-9 and KTU05-10 isolated from rye sourdoughs were investigated for the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS). The supernatants of analysed LAB inhibited growth of up to 15 out of 25 indicator bacteria strains as well as up to 25 out of 56 LAB strains isolated from rye sourdoughs. Moreover, these five LAB were active against ropes-producing Bacillus subtilis and the main bread mould spoilage causing fungi -Aspergillus, Fusarium, Mucor and Penicillium. Lactobacillus sakei KTU05-6 demonstrated the best antibacterial properties and is resistant towards heat treatment even at 100 degrees C for 60 min. CONCLUSIONS: The use of LAB-producing antibacterial substances may be a good choice as a co-starter culture to ensure the stability of sourdoughs and to avoid the bacterial and fungi spoilage of the end product. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The antimicrobial compounds designated as sakacin KTU05-6, pediocin KTU05-8 KTU05-9, KTU05-10 and AcKTU05-67 were not identical to any other known BLIS, and this finding leads up to the assumption that they might be the novel.
TI  - In vitro testing of commercial and potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. The objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of selected commercial and potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria using common in vitro screening assays such as transit tolerance in the upper human gastrointestinal tract, adhesion capacity to human intestinal cell lines and effect on epithelial barrier function. The selected bacteria include strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactobacillus farciminis, Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus reuteri and Pediococcus pentosaceus. Viable counts after simulated gastric transit tolerance showed that L. reuteri strains and P. pentosaceus tolerate gastric juice well, with no reduction of viability, whereas L. pentosus, L. farciminis and L. sakei strains lost viability over 180min. All strains tested tolerate the simulated small intestinal juice well. The bacterial adhesion capacity to human intestinal cells revealed major species and strain differences. Overall, L. plantarum MF1298 and three L. reuteri strains had a significant higher adhesion capacity compared to the other strains tested. All strains, both living and UV-inactivated, had little effect on the epithelial barrier function. However, living L. reuteri strains revealed a tendency to increase the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) from 6 to 24h. This work demonstrates the diversity of 18 potential probiotic bacteria, with major species and strain specific effects in the in vitro screening assays applied. Overall, L. reuteri strains reveal some interesting characteristics compared to the other strains investigated.
TI  - The characterisation of lactic acid bacteria during the fermentation of an artisan Serbian sausage (Petrovska Klobasa).
AB  - Petrovska Klobasa is an artisan Serbian sausage made only from meat and spices without any additives or starter cultures. In order to characterise lactic acid bacteria (LAB) microflora, a total number of 404 LAB strains were isolated from 15 samples collected during 90 days of the fermentation and 120 days of storage of one batch of Petrovska Klobasa. The isolates were preliminarily identified by phenotypic tests and subjected to (GTG)(5)-PCR fingerprinting. Representatives of each group were identified by 16S rDNA sequencing. The results showed that among the isolates, Lactobacillus sakei and Leuconostoc mesenteroides predominate with 36.4% and 37.1% of total LAB strains, respectively. Pediococcus pentosaceus was also isolated in high proportion (18.4%) whereas Enterococcus durans and Enterococcus caseliflavus made only 1% and 6% of the total isolates, correspondingly. The analysis of vacuum packed and modified atmosphere packed (MAP) samples showed higher presence of L. mesenteroides and L. sakei in the total microflora.
TI  - Biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in spontaneously-fermented buckwheat and teff sourdoughs.
AB  - In this study, four different laboratory scale gluten-free (GF) sourdoughs were developed from buckwheat or teff flours. The fermentations were initiated by the spontaneous biota of the flours and developed under two technological conditions (A and B). Sourdoughs were propagated by continuous back-slopping until the stability was reached. The composition of the stable biota occurring in each sourdough was assessed using both culture-dependent and -independent techniques. Overall, a broad spectrum of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts species, belonging mainly to the genera Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, Kazachstania and Candida, were identified in the stable sourdoughs. Buckwheat and teff sourdoughs were dominated mainly by obligate or facultative heterofermentative LAB, which are commonly associated with traditional wheat or rye sourdoughs. However, the spontaneous fermentation of the GF flours resulted also in the selection of species which are not consider endemic to traditional sourdoughs, i.e. Pediococcus pentosaceus, Leuconostoc holzapfelii, Lactobacillus gallinarum, Lactobacillus vaginalis, Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus graminis and Weissella cibaria. In general, the composition of the stable biota was strongly affected by the fermentation conditions, whilst Lactobacillus plantarum dominated in all buckwheat sourdoughs. Lactobacillus pontis is described for the first time as dominant species in teff sourdough. Among yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida glabrata dominated teff sourdoughs, whereas the solely Kazachstania barnetti was isolated in buckwheat sourdough developed under condition A. This study allowed the identification and isolation of LAB and yeasts species which are highly competitive during fermentation of buckwheat or teff flours. Representatives of these species can be selected as starters for the production of sourdough destined to GF bread production.
TI  - Evaluation of different starter cultures (Staphylococci plus Lactic Acid Bacteria) in semi-ripened Salami stuffed in swine gut.
AB  - The ripening properties were evaluated in semi-ripened pork Salami started by different cultures: CXP (Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus xylosus and Staphylococcus carnosus); RAP (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, S. xylosus and S. carnosus); and GY2 (L. sakei, S. xylosus and S. carnosus). These starters were chosen by their technological activities: CXP (rapid acidifying); RAP (medium acidifying); and GY2 (slow acidifying plus intense reddening-flavouring). Salami was enhanced with Ponceau 4R red and sodium glutamate, stuffed in pig gut and aged for 12 days at 15 degrees C/65-85%RH. Dehydration, reddening, proteolysis, fat acidity and lipid oxidation were hardly affected by the starters. Acidification by LAB strongly influenced the flavour. L. sakei plus L. plantarum provided a better flavouring than a low dose of L. sakei, and, especially, than over-acidifying P. pentosaceus. A final pH of 5 seems to be suitable for preventing aroma and taste defects in semi-ripened Salami. Spontaneous lactic microflora showed great acidifying potential.
TI  - Evaluation of lactic acid bacteria for sourdough fermentation of amaranth.
AB  - Spontaneous fermented sourdoughs prepared from five amaranth flours were investigated for the presence of lactic acid bacteria predominating the autochthonous microbiota and thus may be suitable as starter cultures. The doughs were fermented with daily back-slopping on a laboratory scale at 30 degrees C for 10 days. Each day, pH-values and total titratable acidity degrees were determined and samples were analyzed for lactic acid bacteria and yeasts by cultural methods. The identity of the strains was tracked with randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR during fermentation. Taxonomic identity of the strains was revealed by sequence analysis of 16S rDNA. Sugar and organic acid profiles of fermented doughs were determined with HPLC. The strains Lactobacillus plantarum RTa12, L. sakei RTa14, and Pediococcus pentosaceus RTa11 were selected and applied as starters in laboratory scale fermentations. All strains were predominant in repeated experiments, both as single strains and in combination, regardless of the amaranth flour used. The competitiveness of the strains L. plantarum RTa12 and P. pentosaceus RTa11 was characterized in further growth experiments. Both strains facilitated fast declines of pH-values, overgrew the autochthonous microbiota, and allowed stable fermentation characteristics at different temperatures. Thus, the characterized strains may be considered as candidates for amaranth sourdough starter cultures.
TI  - Polyphasic taxonomic studies of lactic acid bacteria associated with Tunisian fermented meat based on the heterogeneity of the 16S-23S rRNA gene intergenic spacer region.
AB  - The objective of this work was to investigate the structure and diversity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) communities in traditionally fermented meat collected from different areas of Tunisia. A polyphasic study, which involves phenotypic tests and ribosomal DNA-based techniques, was used to identify Gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates. PCR amplification of the 16S-23S rDNA ISR of 102 isolates and other reference LAB strains gave (1) one type of rrn operon (M-ISR) for lactococci, (2) two types of rrn operon (S-ISR and M-ISR) for enterococci, (3) two types of rrn operon (S-ISR and L-ISR) for Lactobacilli, and (4) three PCR amplicons (S-ISR, M-ISR, and L-ISR) obtained for Pediococcus spp. and Weissella genus. The clustering and comparison of ISR-RFLP profiles given by the isolates with those given by reference LAB strains, allowed their identification as Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus sanguinicola, Enterococcus hawaiiensis, Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus alimentarius, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and Weissella confusa. Combined 16S-23S rDNA ISR and RFLP patterns can be considered as a good potential target for a rapid and reliable differentiation between isolates of LAB and provided further information on the organization of their rrn operons.
TI  - Biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in French wheat sourdough as determined by molecular characterization using species-specific PCR.
AB  - The lactic acid microflora of nine traditional wheat sourdoughs from the Midi-Pyrenees area (South western France) was previously isolated and preliminary characterized using conventional morphological and biochemical analysis. However, such phenotypic methods alone are not always reliable and have a low taxonomic resolution for identification of lactic acid bacteria species. In the present study, a total of 290 LAB isolates were identified by PCR amplification using different sets of specific primers in order to provide a thorough characterization of the lactic flora from these traditional French sourdoughs. Overall, the LAB isolates belonged to 6 genera: Lactobacillus (39%, 8 species), Pediococcus (38%, 1 species), Leuconostoc (17%, 2 species), Weissella (4%, 2 species), Lactococcus (1%, 1 species) and Enterococcus (<1%, 1 species) and 15 different species were detected: L. plantarum, L. curvatus, L. paracasei, L. sanfranciscensis, L. pentosus, L. paraplantarum, L. sakei, L. brevis, P. pentosaceus, L. mesenteroides, L. citreum, W. cibaria, W. confusa, L. lactis and E. hirae. Facultative heterofermentative LAB represent more than 76% of the total isolates, the main species isolated herein correspond to L. plantarum and P. pentosaceus. Obligate heterofermentative lactobacilli (L. sanfranciscencis, L. brevis) represent less than 3% of the total isolates whereas Leuconostoc and Weissella species represent 21% of the total isolates and have been detected in eight of the nine samples. Detection of some LAB species was preferentially observed depending on the isolation culture medium. The number of different species within a sourdough varies from 3 to 7 and original associations of hetero- and homofermentative LAB species have been revealed. Results from this study clearly confirm the diversity encountered in the microbial community of traditional sourdough and highlight the importance of LAB cocci in the sourdough ecosystem, along with lactobacilli.
TI  - Phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from "Alheira", a traditional fermented sausage produced in Portugal.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from "Alheira", a fermented sausage produced in Portugal. LAB were identified to genus and species level by phenotypic characteristics, using genus or species-specific primers and sequencing of the gene encoding 16S rRNA. Two-hundred and eighty-three isolates were grouped into 14 species. Lactobacillus plantarum was isolated from all sausages and Enterococcusfaecalis from most of the samples. Low numbers of Lactobacillus paraplantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus zeae, Lactobacillus paracasei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Pediococcus acidilactici, Weissella cibaria, Weissella viridescens and Enterococcus faecium were recorded. The genetic heterogeneity of L. plantarum and E. faecalis strains were determined by numerical analysis of DNA banding patterns obtained by RAPD-PCR. Strains of L. plantarum and E. faecalis were different from different producers. This study forms the basis from which starter cultures could be selected for production of "Alheira".
TI  - Molecular and technological characterization of lactic acid bacteria from traditional fermented sausages of Basilicata region (Southern Italy).
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from traditional fermented sausages of the Basilicata  region were investigated by ARDRA-PCR and RAPD-PCR for taxonomic identification at species and strain level and characterized on the basis of the growth and acidification at different temperatures, incubation times, levels of NaCl and KNO(2), hydrolysis of sarcoplasmatic and myofibrillar proteins and antimicrobial, peptide/amino acid release and nitrate reductase activities. Lactobacillus sakei was the predominant species (67%) followed by Pediococcus pentosaceus (16%), Leuconostoc carnosum (8%), Lactobacillus plantarum (4%), Lactobacillus brevis (2%) and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (2%). The technological characterization revealed that most of the isolates had good acidifying and proteolytic properties. Moreover, Lb. sakei strains showed antimicrobial ability, while Leuconostoc strains the highest reduction of nitrates. This work was a preliminary study in the formulation of autochthonous starter cultures in order to standardize the production process of sausages, to preserve their typical organoleptic and sensory characteristics and to improve the quality of final product.
TI  - Method for reliable isolation of Lactobacillus sakei strains originating from Tunisian seafood and meat products.
AB  - In Tunisia, several food products derived from meat or seafood are naturally processed, without any addition of bacterial starters. Such fermented, dried-cured, salted, or marinated products, as well as the raw meat or fish may thus provide a source to isolate the natural microflora colonizing such environments. We isolated lactic acid bacteria from a representative range of flesh-foods sold or manufactured in different parts of Tunisia, and selectively searched for Lactobacillus sakei, a lactic acid bacterium potentially useful as starter or protective culture. Eighty six (86) strains were isolated from various seafood (anchovy, sardine, sole, mullet, and octopus), or meat (pork, veal, beef, sheep, chicken, and turkey) products that were either fresh, or transformed by different traditional processes. Several methods were used in order to develop a rapid and reliable protocol for the direct identification of L. sakei. Amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) classified the various isolates into 9 distinct groups. Search for the presence of the L. sakei specific katA gene indicated that all positive isolates were grouped in the same ARDRA group. Sequencing of 16S rDNA confirmed those isolates as L. sakei. Those 22 different L. sakei strains represent 25.6% of the total isolates, while other isolates found in the different ARDRA groups were tentatively ascribed to Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis/garviae, Enterococcus avium, Streptococcus parauberis, Hafnia alvei, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and Lactobacillus curvatus through 16S rDNA sequencing. A fast and reliable method to isolate and discriminate L. sakei from complex food environments is proposed.
TI  - Data mining and characterization of a novel pediocin-like bacteriocin system from the genome of Pediococcus pentosaceus ATCC 25745.
AB  - The genome of Pediococcus pentosaceus ATCC 25745 contains a gene cluster that resembles a regulated bacteriocin system. The gene cluster has an operon-like structure consisting of a putative pediocin-like bacteriocin gene (termed penA) and a potential immunity gene (termed peiA). Genetic determinants involved in bacteriocin transport and regulation are also found in proximity to penA and peiA but the so-called accessory gene involved in transport and the inducer gene involved in regulation are missing. Consequently, this bacterium is a poor bacteriocin producer. To analyse the potency of the putative bacteriocin operon, the two genes penA-peiA were heterologously expressed in a Lactobacillus sakei host that contains the complete apparatus for gene activation, maturation and externalization of bacteriocins. It was demonstrated that the heterologous host expressing penA and peiA produced a strong bacteriocin activity; in addition, the host became immune to its own bacteriocin, identifying the gene pair penA-peiA as a potent bacteriocin system. The novel pediocin-like bacteriocin, termed penocin A, has an isotopic mass [M+H]+ of 4684.6 Da as determined by mass spectrometry; this value corresponds well to the expected size of the mature 42 aa peptide containing a disulfide bridge. The bacteriocin is heat-stable but protease-sensitive and has a calculated pI of 9.45. Penocin A has a relatively broad inhibition spectrum, including pathogenic Listeria and Clostridium species. Immediately upstream of the regulatory genes reside some features that resemble remnants of a disrupted inducer gene. This degenerate gene was restored and shown to encode a double-glycine leader-containing peptide. Furthermore, expression of the restored gene triggered high bacteriocin production in P. pentosaceus ATCC 25745, thus confirming its role as an inducer in the pen regulon.
TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. From the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. RESULTS: A novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. Each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called cscA, cscB, cscC and cscD. Clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and Bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of L. lactis ssp cremoris, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillius brevis, Oenococcus oeni, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Bacillus thuringiensis. These genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the Lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. All encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the Sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel WxL domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. Transcriptome analysis in L. plantarum shows that the cscA-D genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. Many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpA-mutant derivative of L. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. This is supported by the presence of predicted CRE-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated cscA-D gene clusters. CONCLUSION: We propose that the CscA, CscB, CscC and CscD proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. Primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.
TI  - Use of hydrolysates from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) viscera as a complex nitrogen source for lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Hydrolysates of cod viscera were tested as an alternative to commonly used complex nitrogen sources (peptones and/or extracts) for the type strains of the lactic acid bacteria Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus sakei and Pediococcus pentosaceus. Comparative studies with MRS-like media containing different nitrogen sources showed that all the fish hydrolysates performed equally well or better than commercial extracts/peptones for all selected lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Population dynamics of the constitutive biota of French dry sausages in a pilot-scale ripening chamber.
AB  - The population dynamic of constitutive biota on 84 samples belonging to two different types of French fermented dry sausages during the ripening process in a pilot-scale ripening chamber was investigated. Samples were analyzed in three steps of their production: fresh product, first drying stage, and finished product. In addition, 180 strains of lactic acid bacteria were identified using a miniaturized biochemical procedure of characterization. In general, the number of lactic acid bacteria that evolved during the ripening process of French dry sausages increased during the first days of the process after which the number of these organisms remained constant at approximately 8 log CFU/g. Lactobacillus sakei and Pediococcus pentosaceus, bacteria added as starter, were the dominant species. Pediococcus urinaeequi, Pediococcus acidilactici, and particularly Lactobacillus curvatus were also present. Finally, we have to take into account that the controlled conditions of the pilot plant generally contribute to the homogenization of the behavior of the starter biota.
TI  - Microbiological characterization and probiotic potential of koko and koko sour water, African spontaneously fermented millet porridge and drink.
AB  - AIMS: To identify and examine the diversity of predominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in koko and koko sour water (KSW) from different Ghanaian production sites with regard to pattern of fermentation (API 50 CHL), genotype, antimicrobial activity, and resistance to low pH and bile salts. METHODS AND RESULTS: In total 215 LAB were isolated from koko and KSW. The isolates were identified using intergenic transcribed spacers (ITS)-PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), API 50 CHL, restriction enzyme analysis with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (REA-PFGE) and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The dominating micro-organisms in koko was found to be Weisella confusa and Lactobacillus fermentum, followed by Lact. salivarius and Pediococcus spp. Chemometric data analysis were used to link the LAB species to the different production stages and production sites. At intra-species level the isolates were found to have a great diversity. The isolates were investigated for antimicrobial activity using agar diffusion assays, and acid and bile tolerance. Most isolates showed low levels of antimicrobial activity towards the indicator strain Listeria innocua, but not towards the bacteriocin-sensitive Lact. sakei. Growth of all LAB isolates was unaffected by the presence of 0.3% (v/v) oxgall bile. The isolates were able to survive, but were not able to grow in growth medium adjusted to pH 2.5. CONCLUSIONS: The dominating LAB of koko and KSW were W. confusa and Lact. fermentum showing a pronounced taxonomic biodiversity at sub-species level between stages within the production as well as between production sites. Other species observed in KSW were Lact. salivarius, Ped. pentosaceus, Ped. acidilactici and Lact. paraplantarum. They occurred in levels of 108 CFU ml-1 in fresh KSW and showed uniform antimicrobial activity, and acid and bile tolerance. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The present study gives a detailed picture of the taxonomy and diversity of LAB in an African-fermented millet product that may have potential as a probiotic product for the local population. The chemometric tools Principal Component Analysis and anova Partial Least Squares Regression were proven to be useful in the analysis of microbial groupings and associations with specific sites and stages in the production of koko and KSW.
TI  - Characterisation of IS153, an IS3-family insertion sequence isolated from Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  - An insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis DSM 20451T as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. The sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfA and orfB, from which three putative proteins are produced. OrfAB is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf A and orf B that is presumed to be the transposase. The large orfAB of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the IS3 family. In L. sanfranciscensis type strain DSM 20451T multiple truncated IS elements were identified. Inverse PCR was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly AT rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. Moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. Multiple copies of IS153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of L. sanfranciscensis. Resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16S rDNA. With a PCR based approach IS153 or highly similar sequences were detected in L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. malefermentans, L. plantarum, L. hilgardii, L. collinoides L. farciminis L. sakei and L. salivarius, L. reuteri as well as in Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus acidilactici and P. pentosaceus.
TI  - Effect of starter culture and storage temperature on the content of biogenic amines in dry fermented sausage polican.
AB  - Water activity, pH, microbial counts (total counts/TCM/, coliforms, Enterobacter, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Escherichia and Lactobacillus spp., respectively), and seven biogenic amines (BA) were determined in dry fermented sausage 'polican' produced using starter culture A (Lactobacillus sakei, Staphylococcus carnosus, S. xylosus) or B (L. sakei, S. carnosus, Pediococcus pentosaceus), ripened 42 days, and subsequently stored at 8 or 22 degrees C 60 days. Counts of lactobacilli were higher and TCM lower in the A-sausage when ripening was finished. Tyramine (quantitatively most important BA) content was not different (P>0.05) in A- (90 mg/kg of dry matter, DM) or B-sausage (91 mg/kg DM) at the end of ripening. The effect of the storage temperature on BA content was not significant (P>0.05) in the case of either tyramine or any other tested BA. The increase of total BA content during ripening was not different (P>0.05) between A- and B-sausages (final value 190 and 222 mg/kg DM, respectively). However, sum of BA was significantly higher (P<0.05) in B-sausage as compared with A-sausage at the end of either refrigerated storage (304 and 236 mg/kg DM) or room temperature storage (468 and 206 mg/kg DM, respectively). It is concluded that legislative limits should be established for tyramine and total BA content in dry fermented meat products.
TI  - Phenotypic diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from fermented sausages produced in Basilicata (Southern Italy).
AB  - AIMS: to evaluate the evolution of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) populations in traditional fermented sausages (salsiccia and soppressata) produced in artisanal and industrial plants in Basilicata (Southern Italy). METHODS AND RESULTS: Four hundred and fourteen lactic acid bacteria (LAB) cultures were isolated from samples of sausages at different stages of ripening. A phenotypic characterization of the isolates was carried out using a set of 28 tests, and 34 clusters were identified at the 80% similarity level using hierarchical cluster analysis. Of the isolates 50% were identified as Lactobacillus sakei (with several biotypes), 22% as Pediococcus spp. (mainly Ped. pentosaceus), 7% as Leuconostoc (Leuc. carnosum, Leuc. gelidum, Leuc. pseudomesenteroides), 6% as Lact. plantarum, 1% as Lact. curvatus. Other lactobacilli, including unidentified species, were present in lower numbers. CONCLUSION: The phenotypic diversity and composition of the LAB flora varied as a function of the production plant, product type and ripening time. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OT THE STUDY: A new procedure based on bootstrapping and Multidimensional Scaling was successfully used to obtain a graphical representation of the evolution of the LAB populations.
TI  - Detection of Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, and Weissella species in human feces by using group-specific PCR primers and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of DNA fragments generated by PCR  with 16S ribosomal DNA-targeted group-specific primers was used to detect lactic acid bacteria (LAB) of the genera Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, and Weissella in human feces. Analysis of fecal samples of four subjects revealed individual profiles of DNA fragments originating not only from species that have been described as intestinal inhabitants but also from characteristically food-associated bacteria such as Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus curvatus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Pediococcus pentosaceus. Comparison of PCR-DGGE results with those of bacteriological culture showed that the food-associated species could not be cultured from the fecal samples by plating on Rogosa agar. On the other hand, all of the LAB species cultured from feces were detected in the DGGE profile. We also detected changes in the types of LAB present in human feces during consumption of a milk product containing the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus DR20. The analysis of fecal samples from two subjects taken before, during, and after administration of the probiotic revealed that L. rhamnosus was detectable by PCR-DGGE during the test period in the feces of both subjects, whereas it was detectable by culture in only one of the subjects.
TI  - Isolation and identification of tetracycline resistant lactic acid bacteria from  pre-packed sliced meat products.
AB  - In recent years, the food chain has been recognised as one of the main routes for transmission of antibiotic resistant bacteria between the animal and human population. In this regard, the current study aimed to investigate if tetracycline resistant (tetR) lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are present in ready-to-eat modified atmosphere packed (MAP) sliced meat products including fermented dry sausage, cooked chicken breast meat and cooked ham. From population graphs based on doubling tetracycline concentrations between 0 and 256 microg ml(-1), only fermented dry sausage was shown to contain a high-level retR LAB population (5.10(1) - 2,23.10(4) CFU/g), and this in four out of ten examined sausages. From these four positive sausages, a total of 100 strains were isolated on de Man, Rogosa and Sharpe-sorbic acid (MRS-S) agar without tetracycline (n = 45) and on MRS-S agar supplemented with a tetracycline breakpoint concentration of 64 microg ml(-1) (n = 55). Using resistance histograms derived from the disc diffusion method, all these strains were grouped as sensitive to rifampicin, erythromycin and ampicillin. All strains from the tetracycline-containing MRS-S plates were resistant to tetracycline. Identification with whole-cell protein profiling revealed that the total strain set represented four different species: Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei subsp. carnosus and Lactobacillus curvatus. All species are commonly associated with fermented dry sausage, either as starter culture or as natural contaminants. The latter three species were found to comprise all tetracycline resistant strains. To our knowledge, this is the first report providing evidence for the presence of tetR LAB in final ready-to-eat pre-packed fermented dry sausages.
