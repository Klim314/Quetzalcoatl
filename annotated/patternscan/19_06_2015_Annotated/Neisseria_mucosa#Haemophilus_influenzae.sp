TI  == internalization and trafficking of nontypeable haemophilus influenzae in human respiratory epithelial cells and roles of iga1 proteases for optimal invasion and persistence.
AB  == nontypeable haemophilus influenzae (nthi) is a leading cause of opportunistic infections of the respiratory tract in children and adults. although considered an extracellular pathogen, nthi has been observed repeatedly within and between cells of the human respiratory tract, and these observations have been correlated to symptomatic infection. these findings are intriguing in light of the knowledge that nthi persists in the respiratory tract despite antibiotic therapy and the development of bactericidal antibodies. we hypothesized that intracellular nthi avoids, escapes, or neutralizes the endolysosomal pathway and persists within human respiratory epithelial cells and that human iga1 proteases are required for optimal internalization and persistence of nthi. virtually all strains encode a human iga1 protease gene, igaa, and we previously characterized a novel human iga1 protease gene, igab, that is associated with disease-causing strains and is  homologous to the iga1 protease that is unique to pathogenic neisseria spp. here, we show that nthi invades human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro in a lipid raft-independent manner, is subsequently trafficked via the endolysosomal pathway, and is killed in lysosomes after variable durations of persistence. igaa is required for optimal invasion. igab appears to play little or no role in adherence or invasion but is required for optimal intracellular persistence of nthi. igab cleaves lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (lamp1) at phs characteristic of the plasma membrane, early endosome, late endosome, and lysosome. however, neither iga1 protease inhibits acidification of intracellular  vesicles containing nthi. nthi iga1 proteases play important but different roles  in nthi invasion and trafficking in respiratory epithelial cells.

TI  == epithelial control of the human pdc response to extracellular bacteria.
AB  == plasmacytoid pre-dendritic cells (pdcs) are specialized in responding to nucleic  acids, and link innate with adaptive immunity. although the response of pdcs to viruses is well established, whether pdcs can respond to extracellular bacteria remains controversial. here, we demonstrate that extracellular bacteria such as neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus activate pdcs to produce ifn-alpha, tnf-alpha, il-6, and to upregulate cd86 expression. we observed that pdcs were present within tonsillar crypts and oro-nasopharyngeal epithelium, where they may contact extracellular bacteria, in  situ. tonsil epithelium-conditioned supernatants inhibited ifn-alpha, tnf-alpha,  and il-6 triggered by the direct contact of n. meningitidis or s. aureus with pdcs. however, pdc priming of naive t cells was not affected, suggesting that tonsil epithelium micro-environment limits local inflammation while preserving adaptive immunity in response to extracellular bacteria. our results reveal an important and novel function of pdcs in the initiation of the mucosal innate and  adaptive immunity to extracellular bacteria.

TI  == toll-like receptor 2 induces mucosal homing receptor expression and iga production by human b cells.
AB  == there is a need for developing vaccines that elicit mucosal immunity. although oral or nasal vaccination methods would be ideal, current strategies have yielded mixed success. toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) ligands are effective adjuvants and are currently used in the haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine. induction of humoral immunity in the mucosa is critical for effective vaccination; thus, we sought to determine the effects of tlr2 ligands on human mucosal b cell differentiation. we demonstrate that tlr2 ligands induce ccr9 and ccr10 expression by circulating b cells and increased chemotaxis to cognate chemokines  ccl25 and ccl28 suggesting that tlr2 induces b cell homing to the gastrointestinal tract. tlr2 stimulation of b cells also induced j chain and iga  production demonstrating the induction of mucosal-like antibody secreting cells.  these observations suggest that vaccines containing tlr2-ligands as adjuvants could induce mucosal b cell immunity even when delivered in a non-mucosal manner.

TI  == ceacam1 recognition by bacterial pathogens is species-specific.
AB  == background: carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (ceacam1),  an immunoglobulin (ig)-related glycoprotein, serves as cellular receptor for a variety of gram-negative bacterial pathogens associated with the human mucosa. in particular, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae possess well-characterized ceacam1-binding adhesins. ceacam1 is typically involved in cell-cell attachment, epithelial differentiation, neovascularisation and regulation of t-cell proliferation, and is one of the few ceacam family members with homologues in different mammalian lineages. however, it is unknown whether bacterial adhesins of human pathogens can recognize ceacam1 orthologues from other mammals. results: sequence comparisons of the amino-terminal ig-variable-like domain of ceacam1 reveal that  the highest sequence divergence between human, murine, canine and bovine orthologues is found in the beta-strands comprising the bacteria-binding cc'fg-face of the ig-fold. using gfp-tagged, soluble amino-terminal domains of ceacam1, we demonstrate that bacterial pathogens selectively associate with human, but not other mammalian ceacam1 orthologues. whereas full-length human ceacam1 can mediate internalization of neisseria gonorrhoeae in transfected cells, murine ceacam1 fails to support bacterial internalization, demonstrating that the sequence divergence of ceacam1 orthologues has functional consequences with regard to bacterial recognition and cellular invasion. conclusions: our results establish the selective interaction of several human-restricted bacterial pathogens with human ceacam1 and suggest that co-evolution of microbial adhesins  with their corresponding receptors on mammalian cells contributes to the limited  host range of these highly adapted infectious agents.

TI  == booster vaccinations: can immunologic memory outpace disease pathogenesis?
AB  == almost all current vaccines work by the induction of antibodies in serum or on the mucosa to block adherence of pathogens to epithelial cells or interfere with  microbial invasion of the bloodstream. however, antibody levels usually decline after vaccination to undetectable amounts if further vaccination does not occur.  persistence of vaccine-induced antibodies usually goes well beyond the time when  they should have decayed to undetectable levels because of ongoing "natural" boosting or other immunologic mechanisms. the production of memory b and t cells  is of clear importance, but the likelihood that a memory response will be fast enough in the absence of a protective circulating antibody level likely depends on the pace of pathogenesis of a specific organism. this concept is discussed with regard to haemophilus influenzae type b, streptococcus pneumoniae, and neisseria meningitidis; hepatitis a and b; diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis; polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella; rotavirus; and human papilloma virus. with infectious diseases for which the pace of pathogenesis is less rapid, some individuals will contract infection before the memory response is fully activated and implemented. with infectious diseases for which the pace of pathogenesis is slow, immune memory should be sufficient to prevent disease.

TI  == nasal carriage of pathogenic bacteria in medical students: effects of clinic exposure on prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of community-acquired and nosocomial infections worldwide. one important source of this pathogen for nosocomial infections is the nasal carriage of s. aureus among hospital personnel. there are only a few studies investigating the carriage of s. aureus in a community of medical students. oral and nasal flora of 179 medical students with varying clinical exposures were determined. oral cultures revealed no nosocomial pathogen and nasal cultures showed an increasing rate of s. aureus carriage with increasing clinical exposure. methicillin resistance also demonstrated a tendency toward increasing with increasing clinical exposure.

TI  == [relationship between indigenous microflora of posterior pharyngeal wall and pharyngitis].
AB  == objective: to investigate the relationship between the abundance and density of the normal flora in the mucous membrane of posterior pharyngeal wall and pharyngitis. methods: a total of 410 samples of posterior pharyngeal wall were received from patients with acute and chronic pharyngitis and normal persons living in hohhot area, inner mongolia, from september 2000 to april 2001. locational, qualitative, and quantitative analyses of the micro-flora were made.  results: there were 6-9 species of bacteria, belonging to 4-5 genuses, in normal  persons' pharyngeal wall. alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria, corynebacterium, staphylococcus, streptococcus anaerobius, and fusiform bacillus  accounted for 40%-60%, 20%-30%, 5%-10%, 4%-8%, and 0%-40% respectively of the cultured microorganisms. hemophilus influenzae accounted for 65% of the pathogenic bacteria in acute pharyngitis. there is a close relationship between the succession of the invading organisms and indigenous micro-flora and the occurrence and development of acute pharyngitis. conclusion: the internal disorder of the proper microflora in the mucous membrane of posterior pharyngeal  wall is a characteristic indicator of chronic inflammation of pharynx.

TI  == carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (ceacam)-binding recombinant polypeptide confers protection against infection by respiratory and urogenital pathogens.
AB  == the human-specific pathogens neisseria meningitidis, n. gonorrhoea, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis share the property of targeting the carcinoembryonic antigen (cea)-related cell adhesion molecules (ceacams) expressed on human epithelia. ceacams are signalling receptors implicated in cell adhesion and regulation of several physiological functions. their targeting by pathogens can lead to tissue invasion. although the ceacam-binding ligands of the bacteria are structurally diverse, they target a common site on the receptor. we  have generated a recombinant polypeptide that blocks the interactions of the mucosal pathogens with human epithelial cells and antibodies against it inhibit m. catarrhalis interactions with the receptor. as such, it is a potential antimicrobial agent to prevent infection via a strategy unlikely to promote bacterial resistance and a vaccine candidate against m. catarrhalis. in addition, it could serve more widely as a novel research tool and as a potential therapeutic agent in ceacam-based physiological disorders.

TI  == nasopharyngeal aerobic bacterial flora and staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage in deaf children.
AB  == objective: to determine the nasopharyngeal aerobic bacterial flora and staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage in deaf children and the role of flora in deafness. study design: a prospective, controlled study. methods: nasopharyngeal  and nasal swabs were collected from 87 deaf children with acquired etiology at zonguldak primary school for the deaf and 56 healthy children. the children with  genetic base (syndromic or nonsyndromic, familial or sporadic, ad, ar or x-linked recessive), and also with the history of drug exposure, head trauma, birth trauma, prematurity, hyperbilirubinemia and the viral diseases with high fever (like mumps and measles) were excluded from the study. swabs were inoculated on to a variety of bacteriological culture media, which were then incubated in an appropriate atmosphere. colonisation of group a beta hemolytic streptococcus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria menengitidis, moraxella catarrhalis and s. aureus in upper respiratory tract were investigated. antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolates were determined according to national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) guidelines. results: although, the rates of colonization of the nasopharyngeal aerobic bacteria and nasal s. aureus did not differ significantly between deaf children and normal healthy subjects, less colonization rates were found in deaf children than normal healthy subjects. s. aureus was isolated from 18 (20.7%) deaf children. all s. aureus isolates from deaf children were susceptible to oxacillin. penicillin susceptibility rate was 22.2%. conclusion: it is considered that nasopharyngeal and nasal colonizations of deaf children with potentially pathogenic aerobic bacterial flora is not a significant risk factor for acquired infections when compared with healthy children.

TI  == protozoan predation, diversifying selection, and the evolution of antigenic diversity in salmonella.
AB  == extensive population-level genetic variability at the salmonella rfb locus, which encodes enzymes responsible for synthesis of the o-antigen polysaccharide, is thought to have arisen through frequency-dependent selection (fds) by means of exposure of this pathogen to host immune systems. the fds hypothesis works well for pathogens such as haemophilus influenzae and neisseria meningitis, which alter the composition of their o-antigens during the course of bloodborne infections. in contrast, salmonella remains resident in epithelial cells or macrophages during infection and does not have phase variability in its o-antigen. more importantly, salmonella shows host-serovar specificity, whereby strains bearing certain o-antigens cause disease primarily in specific hosts; this behavior is inconsistent with fds providing selection for the origin or maintenance of extensive polymorphism at the rfb locus. alternatively, selective  pressure may originate from the host intestinal environment itself, wherein diversifying selection mediated by protozoan predation allows for the continued existence of salmonella able to avoid consumption by host-specific protozoa. this selective pressure would result in high population-level diversity at the salmonella rfb locus without phase variation. we show here that intestinal protozoa recognize antigenically diverse salmonella with different efficiencies and demonstrate that differences solely in the o-antigen are sufficient to allow  for prey discrimination. combined with observations of the differential distributions of both serotypes of bacterial species and their protozoan predators among environments, our data provides a framework for the evolution of  high genetic diversity at the rfb locus and host-specific pathogenicity in salmonella.

TI  == identification of the conjugative mef gene in clinical acinetobacter junii and neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates.
AB  == the mef gene, originally described for gram-positive organisms and coding for an  efflux pump, has been identified in clinical isolates of acinetobacter junii and  neisseria gonorrhoeae. these strains could transfer the mef gene at frequencies ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-9) into one or more of the following recipients: gram-negative moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria perflava/sicca and neisseria mucosa and gram-positive enterococcus faecalis. three streptococcus pneumoniae strains could transfer the mef gene into eikenella corrodens, haemophilus influenzae, kingella denitrificans, m. catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis, n. perflava/sicca, and n. mucosa at similar frequencies. the mef gene can thus be transferred to and expressed in a variety of gram-negative recipients.

TI  == carcinoembryonic antigens are targeted by diverse strains of typable and non-typable haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae (hi), a commensal of the human respiratory mucosa, is an important cause of localized and systemic infections. we show that distinct strains belonging to typable (thi) and non-typable (nthi) h. influenzae target human carcinoembryonic antigens (the membrane associated cea family of cell adhesion molecules, are now termed ceacams). all strains of h. influenzae biogroup aegyptius (hi-aeg) and more than 70% of thi and nthi strains tested specifically recognize ceacami-fc soluble constructs. furthermore, transfection of chinese hamster ovary cells with human ceacam1 cdna alone was sufficient for promoting hi interactions with the transfected cells. the majority of the hi-aeg  strains tested interacted with soluble constructs containing only the n-terminal  domain. in contrast, several thi and nthi strains reacted with soluble constructs only when additional extracellular a and b domains of the receptor were present.  the use of monoclonal antibodies confirmed that thi and nthi strains also interact primarily at the n-domain. we used site-directed mutants of ceacam1 that contained substitutions at surface exposed amino acids and a molecular model of the n-domain to identify the residues involved in interactions with hi ligands. the studies show that a common region exposed at the cfg face of the molecule is  targeted by diverse hi strains. however, mutation at distinct sites within this area affected the interactions of distinct strains signifying the potential for tissue tropism via this receptor. analyses of the molecular basis of interaction  with human cell lines and purified cea show that hi strains, especially those belonging to hi-aeg, interact with multiple ceacams. because neisseria meningitidis (nm) strains are also known to bind at the cfg face of the receptor, we used nm and hi strains in co-infection experiments and demonstrate competition between these mucosal pathogens in colonization of target cells via ceacams.

TI  == phosphorylcholine decoration of lipopolysaccharide differentiates commensal neisseriae from pathogenic strains: identification of lica-type genes in commensal neisseriae.
AB  == phosphorylcholine (chop) is a potential candidate for a plurispecific vaccine, because it is present on surface components of many mucosal organisms, including  haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in addition, chop has been detected on pili of neisseria meningitidis and neisseria  gonorrhoeae. in this study, we demonstrate the presence of the phosphorylcholine  epitope on the lipopolysaccharides (lpss) of several species of commensal neisseriae (cn), a property that differentiates commensal from the pathogenic strains of neisseriae. in an extended survey of 78 strains, we confirmed the exclusive expression of the chop epitope on pili of pathogenic neisseriae. despite the presence of pili on cn, which are homologous to class ii pili of n. meningitidis, they did not react with anti-chop antibody. this observation was further supported by the fact that 14c-labelled choline was incorporated only in  the lpss of cn. analysis of the lps of n. lactamica strain nl4 revealed two distinct and interconvertible molecular species of lps with high and low levels of reactivity with anti-chop antibody. in addition, on/off phase variation gave rise to frequent modulation in the levels of antibody reactivity. a concurrent modulation was also observed in the binding of c-reactive protein, crp, a chop-binding reactant that is implicated in bacterial clearance. genetic analysis showed the presence of a gene in several cn spp. with significant sequence identity to h. influenzae lica. this gene encodes choline kinase and is also involved in phase variation of the lps-associated chop in h. influenzae. in contrast, lica-like genes were not identified in the pathogenic neisseria strains tested. they are absent from n. meningitidis strain z2491 genome database. these  data suggest that the genetic basis for chop incorporation in cn lps resembles that in h. influenzae spp. and may be distinct from that generating the chop epitope on pili of pathogenic neisseriae. further, the modulation of chop expression on cn lps, and corresponding modulation of crp binding, has the potential to confer the property of immune avoidance and thus of persistence on mucosa.

TI  == the effect of cigarette smoke on adherence of respiratory pathogens to buccal epithelial cells.
AB  == smoking is associated with an increased risk of respiratory tract infection in adults. in children, exposure to cigarette smoke is a risk factor for respiratory tract infection and bacterial meningitis: active smoking and passive exposure to  cigarette smoke is also associated with carriage of some potentially pathogenic species of bacteria in both adults and children. the aims of the study were to determine the effect of active smoking on: (1) bacterial binding to epithelial cells; (2) expression of host cell antigens that act as receptors for some species; and (3) the effects of passive exposure to water-soluble components of cigarette smoke on bacterial binding. flow cytometry was used to assess binding to buccal epithelial cells of the following species labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate: neisseria meningitidis, neisseria lactamica, streptococcus pneumoniae, bordetella pertussis, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis,  staphylococcus aureus. flow cytometry was also used to assess expression of host  cell antigens which have been identified as bacterial receptors. for each species, binding to cells of smokers was significantly higher than to cells of non-smokers; however, expression of host cell antigens was similar on epithelial  cells of both groups. non-dilute cigarette smoke extract reduced binding of bacteria to epithelial cells, but dilutions between 1 in 10 and 1 in 320 enhanced binding. we conclude that smokers might be more densely colonised by a variety of potentially pathogenic bacteria. the enhanced bacterial binding to epithelial cells of smokers is not related to enhanced expression of host cell antigens that can act as receptors for some species, but possibly to components in the smoke that alter charge or other properties of the epithelial cell surface. passive coating of mucosal surfaces with components of cigarette smoke might enhance binding of potentially pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == [characteristics of fauces microflora in children treated in intensive care units].
AB  == characteristic features of fauces aerobic microflora in children treated in intensive care units (icu) were analysed. for comparison fauces microflora in children outpatients and in children patients from general surgical units was investigated. a retrospective analysis of all the smears without exception for 2  years (a total of 2120) revealed a direct dependence of the changes in the fauces microflora composition on the patient condition and the antibiotic load. it was shown that the fauces indigenic microflora in icu patients was more often replaced by enterococci, gramnegative enteric bacteria and nonfermenting bacteria which are not usual under the normal conditions. the flora in such cases was represented by monoculture. thus, microorganisms natural for the fauces i.e. haemophilus influenzae and neisseria spp. were not practically detected in the fauces of the icu patients (0.5 and 0.4 per cent, respectively). grampositive cocci in the children of the surgical units and in the outpatients included alpha-hemolytic streptococci in association with beta-hemolytic or nonhemolytic streptococci. no such bacteria were isolated from the icu newborns. the associations of gramnegative organisms from the icu patients included 40 variants. seventy-eight association variants of pseudomonas aeruginosa were mainly represented by the combinations with serratia spp. and klebsiella spp. as  well as with coagulase negative staphylococci or enterococci, especially in the icu newborns. the results of the study demonstrated that the target-aimed antibiotic therapy providing eradication of p.aeruginosa in the icu patients was  not always justified because of possible superinfection practically due to any organism from the association. massive antibiotic therapy with pressing on gramnegative flora in the icu patients induced selective contamination of the mucosa by polyresistant enterococci thus increasing their potential role in the development of hospital infections.

TI  == the role of humoral mucosal immunity in the induction and maintenance of chronic  airway infections.
AB  == the respiratory mucosa is protected primarily by a secretory immune system that is under complex and only partly understood immunoregulatory control. secretory immunoglobulins (siga and sigm) protect the mucosal surface by immune exclusion of antigens. however, the fact that most iga produced in the respiratory tract belongs to the iga1 subclass renders siga in this region susceptible to iga-specific proteases produced by haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumonia, and neisseria meningitidis. immunoglobulin g can also perform immune exclusion at respiratory surfaces but, like ige, it reaches the secretions merely by passive diffusion. the phlogistic properties of antibodies belonging to these  classes explain their potential involvement in maintaining mucosal inflammation.  in patients with selective iga deficiency, siga is lacking and is not regularly compensated for satisfactorily by sigm. in such patients unexplained immunoregulatory mechanisms, perhaps involving the local microbiota, give rise to a large number of igd-producing cells in the upper respiratory tract. immunoglobulin d cannot act as a secretory antibody and might block the protective properties of igg; this could explain why these patients are particularly prone to recurrent infections. our observations show that there are  large individual variations in the mucosal immune system with regard to humoral immunity in the upper respiratory tract.

TI  == binding of mannan-binding protein to various bacterial pathogens of meningitis.
AB  == mannan-binding protein (mbp), a calcium-dependent plasma lectin, may play a role  in the innate defence against microorganisms. after binding to carbohydrate structures at the bacterial surface, mbp activates the classical pathway of the complement system. to investigate the binding capacity of mbp to various bacteria associated with meningitis, an assay was developed to study the binding of mbp to bacteria grown in a semisynthetic fluid culture medium. salmonella montevideo (containing a mannose-rich lipopolysaccharide (lps)), used as a positive control  strain, showed binding of radiolabelled mbp at a level of 80% compared with binding of mbp to zymosan. binding of labelled mbp to salm. montevideo was time-dependent, temperature-dependent and saturable. the binding was inhibited by unlabelled mbp, by mannose and by n-acetyl-d-glucosamine. among bacterial pathogens often found to cause meningitis, a wide range of mbp binding capacities could be determined. the encapsulated neisseria meningitidis (representatives from 11 serogroups other than group a were included: n = 22), n. mucosa (n = 1),  haemophilus influenzae type b (n = 10) and streptococcus agalactiae (n = 5) had a low mbp binding capacity of 21.7% (95% confidence interval (ci) 3.3-40.1%). escherichia coli k1 (n = 11), strep. suis (n = 5), strep. pneumoniae (n = 10) and n. meningitidis serogroup a (n = 2) showed intermediate mbp binding capacity of 58.4% (95% ci 40.0-76.8%). a third group consisting of non-encapsulated listeria  monocytogenes (n = 11), non-encapsulated h. influenzae (n = 2), non-encapsulated  n. meningitidis (n = 2), n. cinera (n = 1) and n. subflava (n = 1) strains had a  high mbp binding capacity of 87.5% (95% ci 62.5-112.5%). the majority of encapsulated pathogens causing bacterial meningitis seem to have a rather low mbp binding capacity.

TI  == humoral immune response patterns of human mucosae: induction and relation to bacterial respiratory tract infections.
AB  == immunoglobulin-producing cells in mucosal tissues, quantitatively the body's most important humoral immune system, synthesize mainly dimers and larger polymers of  iga (poly-iga) with incorporated j (joining) chain. poly-iga is actively transported to exocrine secretions by a transmembrane epithelial glycoprotein called secretory component. enhancing secretory immunity by oral vaccination is an interesting possibility, but mucosal antigen uptake and local immune regulation are complex and only partly understood. immunoglobulin isotype response patterns in the upper respiratory mucosa and distal gut are strikingly different. the preferential production of iga1 in nasal and bronchial mucosae is  intriguing in view of the frequent synthesis of iga1-specific proteases by haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and neisseria meningitidis. a relationship of proneness to produce invasive disease and enzymatically induced deterioration of secretory immunity has been proposed. differences in mucosal immune response patterns among patients with selective iga deficiency or igg subclass deficiencies also suggest that local humoral immunity is an important variable in resistance to infections.

TI  == levels of rifampin and ciprofloxacin in nasal secretions: correlation with mic90  and eradication of nasopharyngeal carriage of bacteria.
AB  == to predict the efficacy of antibiotics in eliminating nasopharyngeal carriage of  organisms such as neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), a novel approach for measuring drug concentrations in nasal secretions was developed. five healthy individuals received four doses of rifampin and then, at a later date, ciprofloxacin. at 2, 5, and 8 h after the last dose, serum, saliva, and cold-stimulated nasal secretion samples were collected, and drug levels were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. nasopharyngeal levels of rifampin reached but did not substantially exceed 90% of the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic90) for h. influenzae, exceeded the mic90 for n. meningitidis,  and were well above that for mrsa. ciprofloxacin levels in nasal secretions far exceeded the mic90 for meningococci and haemophilus organisms but were below that for mrsa. these findings are consistent with the clinical studies showing that rifampin eliminates, in most instances, the nasal carriage of n. meningitidis and to a lesser extent h. influenzae. a single dose of ciprofloxacin has been shown to eradicate meningococci, yet a long course of treatment with this drug is not adequate for mrsa. on the basis of these results, clinical trials with ciprofloxacin to eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of h. influenzae appear to be  warranted.

TI  == parasite-directed endocytosis.
AB  == following the attachment of gonococci to human fallopian tube mucosa in organ culture, the gonococci are endocytosed by specialized low columnar epithelial cells, are transported to the base of the epithelial cells, and are subsequently  exocytosed into the subepithelial tissues. this transepithelial transport process by which "invasion" of the host occurs appears to be dependent on microbial factors is designated parasite-directed endocytosis to distinguish it from host-directed endocytosis by cells such as macrophages that eventually degrade the parasites. "invasion" of the host by a number of human pathogens--bacteria (e.g., neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, and listeria monocytogenes), viruses, or protozoa--appears to be accomplished by parasite-directed endocytosis.
