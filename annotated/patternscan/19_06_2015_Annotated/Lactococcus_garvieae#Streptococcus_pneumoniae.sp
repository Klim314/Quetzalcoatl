TI  == chemical synthesis of bacterial lipoteichoic acids: an insight on its biological  significance.
AB  == during infections caused by gram-negative bacteria, lipopolysaccharide (lps, endotoxin) has a dominant role leading to fulminant pro-inflammatory reactions in the host. as there is no lps in gram-positive bacteria, other microbial cell wall components have been identified to be the causative agent for the pro-inflammatory activity since also gram-positive bacterial infections lead to comparable clinical symptoms and reactions. on search for the "gram-positive endotoxin" a widely accepted hypothesis has been raised in that the lipoteichoic  acids (ltas) serve as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps) during gram-positive sepsis, although the amount necessary for a pro-inflammatory in vitro response is several orders of magnitude higher than that for lps. therefore, lta cannot be considered to be "the (endo)toxin of gram-positive bacteria". although lps and lta show structural relatedness (amphiphilic, negatively charged glycophospholipids), they are structurally quite different from each other and one might expect that they are also recognized by different receptors of the innate immune system, the so called toll-like receptors 4 and 2  (tlr4 and tlr2), respectively. based on their chemical structure, the ltas were classified into four types (type i-iv) of which we have carefully investigated the lta of staphylococcus aureus (type i), lactococcus garvieae (type ii) and streptococcus pneumoniae (type iv). hence, these ltas have been synthesized in our group and biologically evaluated with respect to their potency to activate cytokines in transiently tlr2/cd14-transfected human endothelial kidney cells (hek 293) or human macrophages and whole blood cells. although lta of type i and  iv are structurally quite different, especially in their hydrophilic moiety, they originally were believed to interact with the same receptor (tlr2). hence, the chemical syntheses leading to structurally defined, non-contaminated stimuli have a major impact on the outcome and interpretation of these biological studies of the innate immune system. with this material, it became evident that synthetic lta from s. aureus and s. pneumoniae are not recognized by tlr2. instead, another receptor of the innate immune system, the lectin pathway of the complement, known since many years to interact with lta in quite a specific way, has gained increasing attractivity. with the help of synthetic lta we obtained first evidences that this receptor is indeed the pathogen recognition receptor (prr) for lta.

TI  == analysis of the genome content of lactococcus garvieae by genomic interspecies microarray hybridization.
AB  == background: lactococcus garvieae is a bacterial pathogen that affects different animal species in addition to humans. despite the widespread distribution and emerging clinical significance of l. garvieae in both veterinary and human medicine, there is almost a complete lack of knowledge about the genetic content  of this microorganism. in the present study, the genomic content of l. garvieae cect 4531 was analysed using bioinformatics tools and microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (cgh) experiments. lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis il1403 and streptococcus pneumoniae tigr4 were used as reference microorganisms. results: the combination and integration of in silico analyses and in vitro cgh experiments, performed in comparison with the reference microorganisms, allowed establishment of an inter-species hybridization framework with a detection threshold based on a sequence similarity of >or= 70%. with this  threshold value, 267 genes were identified as having an analogue in l. garvieae,  most of which (n = 258) have been documented for the first time in this pathogen. most of the genes are related to ribosomal, sugar metabolism or energy conversion systems. some of the identified genes, such as als and myca, could be involved in the pathogenesis of l. garvieae infections. conclusions: in this study, we identified 267 genes that were potentially present in l. garvieae cect 4531. some of the identified genes could be involved in the pathogenesis of l. garvieae infections. these results provide the first insight into the genome content of l. garvieae.
