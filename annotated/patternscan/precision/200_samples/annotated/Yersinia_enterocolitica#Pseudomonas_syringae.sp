TI == the xaxab genes encoding a new apoptotic toxin from the insect pathogen xenorhabdus nematophila are present in plant and human pathogens.
AB == xenorhabdus nematophila, a member of the enterobacteriaceae, kills many species of insects by strongly depressing the immune system and colonizing the entire body. a peptide cytotoxin has been purified from x. nematophila broth growth, and the cytolytic effect on insect immunocytes and hemolytic effect on mammalian red blood cells of this toxin have been described (ribeiro, c., vignes, m., and brehelin, m. (2003) j. biol. chem. 278, 3030-3039). we show here that this toxin, xenorhabdus alpha-xenorhabdolysin (xax), triggers apoptosis in both insect and mammalian cells. we also report the cloning and sequencing of two genes, xaxab, encoding this toxin in x. nematophila. the expression of both genes in recombinant escherichia coli led to the production of active cytotoxin/hemolysin. however, hemolytic activity was observed only if the two peptides were added in the appropriate order. furthermore, we report here that inactivation of xaxab genes in x. nematophila abolished the major cytotoxic activity present in broth growth, called c1. we also show that these genes are present in various entomopathogenic bacteria of the genera xenorhabdus and photorhabdus, in pseudomonas entomophila, in the human pathogens yersinia enterocolitica and proteus mirabilis, and in the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae. this toxin cannot be classified in any known family of cytotoxins on the basis of amino acid sequences, locus organization, and activity features. it is, therefore, probably the prototype of a new family of binary toxins.

TI == antimicrobial activity of extracts of chemical races of the lichen pseudevernia furfuracea and their physodic acid, chloroatranorin, atranorin, and olivetoric acid constituents.
AB == the antimicrobial activity and the mic values of the ethanol, chloroform, diethyl ether, and acetone extracts of the chemical races of pseudevernia furfuracea (var. furfuracea and var. ceratea) and their physodic acid, chloroatranorin, atranorin, and olivetoric acid constituents have been investigated against some microorganisms. nearly all extracts of both chemical races showed antimicrobial activity against aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, listeria monocytogenes, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, yersinia enterocolitica, candida albicans, candida glabrata, alternaria alternata, ascochyta rabiei, aspergillus niger, fusarium culmorum, fusarium moniliforme, fusarium oxysporum, fusarium solani, and penicillium notatum. there was no antimicrobial activity of the extracts against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas syringae, salmonella typhimurium, alternaria citri, alternaria tenuissima, and gaeumannomyces graminis. chloroatranorin and olivetoric acid were active against the same microorganisms with few exceptions. physodic acid was active against about the same bacteria and yeasts and inactive against all of the filamentous fungi tested. also no activity of atranorin against the filamentous fungi was observed.

TI == hrpz(psph) from the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola binds to lipid bilayers and forms an ion-conducting pore in vitro.
AB == the hrp gene clusters of plant pathogenic bacteria control pathogenicity on their host plants and ability to elicit the hypersensitive reaction in resistant plants. some hrp gene products constitute elements of the type iii secretion system, by which effector proteins are exported and delivered into plant cells. here, we show that the hrpz gene product from the bean halo-blight pathogen, pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola (hrpz(psph)), is secreted in an hrp-dependent manner in p. syringae pv. phaseolicola and exported by the type iii secretion system in the mammalian pathogen yersinia enterocolitica. hrpz(psph) was found to associate stably with liposomes and synthetic bilayer membranes. under symmetric ionic conditions, addition of 2 nm of purified recombinant hrpz(psph) to the cis compartment of planar lipid bilayers provoked an ion current with a large unitary conductivity of 207 ps. hrpz(psph)-related proteins from p. syringae pv. tomato or syringae triggered ion currents similar to those stimulated by hrpz(psph). the hrpz(psph)-mediated ion-conducting pore was permeable for cations but did not mediate fluxes of cl-. such pore-forming activity may allow nutrient release and/or delivery of virulence factors during bacterial colonization of host plants.

TI == pseudomonas syringae hrp type iii secretion system and effector proteins.
AB == pseudomonas syringae is a member of an important group of gram-negative bacterial pathogens of plants and animals that depend on a type iii secretion system to inject virulence effector proteins into host cells. in p. syringae, hrp/hrc genes encode the hrp (type iii secretion) system, and avirulence (avr) and hrp-dependent outer protein (hop) genes encode effector proteins. the hrp/hrc genes of p. syringae pv syringae 61, p. syringae pv syringae b728a, and p. syringae pv tomato dc3000 are flanked by an exchangeable effector locus and a conserved effector locus in a tripartite mosaic hrp pathogenicity island (pai) that is linked to a trna(leu) gene found also in pseudomonas aeruginosa but without linkage to hrp system genes. cosmid phir11 carries a portion of the strain 61 hrp pathogenicity island that is sufficient to direct escherichia coli and pseudomonas fluorescens to inject hoppsya into tobacco cells, thereby eliciting a hypersensitive response normally triggered only by plant pathogens. large deletions in strain dc3000 revealed that the conserved effector locus is essential for pathogenicity but the exchangeable effector locus has only a minor role in growth in tomato. p. syringae secretes hoppsya and avrpto in culture in a hrp-dependent manner at ph and temperature conditions associated with pathogenesis. avrpto is also secreted by yersinia enterocolitica. the secretion of avrpto depends on the first 15 codons, which are also sufficient to direct the secretion of an npt reporter from y. enterocolitica, indicating that a universal targeting signal is recognized by the type iii secretion systems of both plant and animal pathogens.

TI == yscu, a yersinia enterocolitica inner membrane protein involved in yop secretion.
AB == pathogenic yersiniae secrete antihost yop proteins by a recently discovered secretion pathway which is also encountered in several animal and plant pathogens. the components of the export machinery are encoded by the vira (lcra), virb (lcrb), and virc (lcrc) loci of the 70-kb pyv plasmid. in the present paper we describe yscu, the last gene of the virb locus. we determined the dna sequence and mutated the gene on the pyv plasmid. after inactivation of yscu, the mutant strain was unable to secrete yop proteins. the topology of yscu was investigated by the analysis of yscu-phoa translational fusions generated by tnphoa transposition. this showed that the 40.3-kda yscu product contains four transmembrane segments anchoring a large cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domain to the inner membrane. yscu is related to spa40 from shigella flexneri, to spas from salmonella typhimurium, to flhb from bacillus subtilis, and to hrpn from pseudomonas solanacearum.

TI == homology between the hrpo protein of pseudomonas solanacearum and bacterial proteins implicated in a signal peptide-independent secretion mechanism.
AB == a region of approximately 22 kb of dna defines the large hrp gene cluster of strain gmi1000 of pseudomonas solanacearum. the majority of mutants that map to this region have lost the ability to induce disease symptoms on tomato plants and are no longer able to elicit a hypersensitive reaction (hr) on tobacco, a non-host plant. in this study we present the complementation analysis and nucleotide sequence of a 4772 bp region of this hrp gene cluster. three complete open reading frames (orfs) are predicted within this region. the corresponding putative proteins, hrpn, hrpo and hpap, have predicted sizes of 357, 690 and 197 amino acids, respectively, and predicted molecular weights of 38,607, 73,990 and 21,959 dalton, respectively. hrpn and hrpo are both predicted to be hydrophobic proteins with potential membrane-spanning domains and hpap is rich in proline residues. a mutation in hpap (for hrp associated) does not affect the hr on tobacco or the disease on tomato plants. none of the proteins is predicted to have an n-terminal signal sequence, which would have indicated that the proteins are exported. considerable sequence similarities were found between hrpo and eight known or predicted prokaryotic proteins: lcrd of yersinia pestis and y. enterocolitica, flbf of caulobacter crescentus, flha of bacillus subtilis, mxia and virh of shigella flexneri, inva of salmonella typhimurium and hrpc2 of xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria. these homologies suggest that certain hrp genes of phytopathogenic bacteria code for components of a secretory system, which is related to the systems for secretion of flagellar proteins, ipa proteins of shigella flexneri and the yersinia yop proteins. furthermore, these homologous proteins have the common feature of being implicated in a distinct secretory mechanism, which does not require the cleavage of a signal peptide. the sequence similarity between hrpo and hrpc2 is particularly high (66% identity and 81% similarity) and the amino acid sequence comparison between these two proteins presented here reveals the first such sequence similarity to be shown between hrp proteins of p. solanacearum and x. campestris. an efflux of plant electrolytes was found to be associated with the interactions between p. solanacearum and both tomato and tobacco leaves. this phenomenon may be part of the mechanism by which hrp gene products control and determine plant-bacterial interactions, since hrpo mutants induced levels of leakage which were significantly lower than those induced by the wild type on each plant.

TI == the pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61 hrph product, an envelope protein required for elicitation of the hypersensitive response in plants.
AB == pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61 contains a 25-kb cluster of hrp genes that are required for elicitation of the hypersensitive response (hr) in tobacco. tnphoa mutagenesis of cosmid phir11, which contains the hrp cluster, revealed two genes encoding exported or inner-membrane-spanning proteins (h.-c. huang, s. w. hutcheson, and a. collmer, mol. plant-microbe interact. 4:469-476, 1991). the gene in complementation group x, designated hrph, was subcloned on a 3.1-kb sali fragment into pcpp30, a broad-host-range, mobilizable vector. the subclone restored the ability of hrph mutant p. syringae pv. syringae 61-2089 to elicit the hr in tobacco. dna sequence analysis of the 3.1-kb sali fragment revealed a single open reading frame encoding an 81,956-da preprotein with a typical amino-terminal signal peptide and no likely inner-membrane-spanning hydrophobic regions. hrph was expressed in the presence of [35s]methionine by using the t7 rna polymerase-promoter system and vector pt7-3 in escherichia coli and was shown to encode a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 83,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. the hrph protein in e. coli was located in the membrane fraction and was absent from the periplasm and cytoplasm. the hrph protein possessed similarity with several outer membrane proteins that are known to be involved in protein or phage secretion, including the klebsiella oxytoca puld protein, the yersinia enterocolitica yscc protein, and the piv protein of filamentous coliphages. all of these proteins possess a possible secretion motif, gg(x)12vp(l/f)lxxipxigxl(f/l), near the carboxyl terminus, and they lack a carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine, in contrast to other outer membrane proteins with no known secretion function. these results suggest that the p. syringae pv. syringae hrph protein is involved in the secretion of a proteinaceous hr elicitor.

TI == evidence that the hrpb gene encodes a positive regulator of pathogenicity genes from pseudomonas solanacearum.
AB == the hrp gene cluster of pseudomonas solanacearum gmi1000 strain encodes functions that are essential for pathogenicity on tomato and for the elicitation of the hypersensitive response on tobacco. in this study, we present the nucleotide sequence of one of the hrp genes (hrpb) located at the left-hand end of the cluster and we show that hrpb encodes a positive regulator controlling the expression of hrp genes. hrpb has a coding capacity for a 477-amino-acid polypeptide, which shows significant similarity to several prokaryotic transcriptional activators including the arac protein of escherichia coli, the xyls protein of pseudomonas putida and the virf protein of yersinia enterocolitica. the predicted hrpb gene product belongs to a family of bacterial regulators different from the previously described hrps protein of the hrp gene cluster of pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola. genetic evidence demonstrates that the hrpb gene product acts as a positive regulator of the expression in minimal medium of all but one of the putative transcription units of the hrp gene cluster and also controls the expression of genes located outside this cluster. we also show in this paper that the transcription of hrpb is induced in minimal medium and is partly autoregulated.
