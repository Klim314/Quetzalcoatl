TI  == screening of lactobacillus strains of domestic goose origin against bacterial poultry pathogens for use as probiotics.
AB  == lactobacilli are natural inhabitants of human and animal mucous membranes, including the avian gastrointestinal tract. recently, increasing attention has been given to their probiotic, health-promoting capacities, among which their antagonistic potential against pathogens plays a key role. a study was conducted  to evaluate probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from feces or  cloacae of domestic geese. among the 104 examined isolates, previously identified to the species level by whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and analysis of 16s-23s regions of rdna, dominated lactobacillus salivarius (35%), followed by lactobacillus johnsonii (18%) and lactobacillus ingluviei (11%). all lactobacilli were screened for antimicrobial activity toward salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, pasteurella multocida, and riemerella anatipestifer using the agar slab method and the well diffusion method. lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus plantarum exhibited particularly strong antagonism toward all of the indicator strains. in the agar slab method, the highest sensitivity to lactobacillus was observed in r. anatipestifer and p. multocida, and the lowest in e. coli and s. aureus. the ability to produce h(2)o(2)was exhibited by 92% of isolates, but there was no correlation between the rate of production of this reactive oxygen species and the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus sp. all lactobacilli showed resistance to ph 3.0 and 3.5 and to 2% bile. the data demonstrate that lactobacillus isolates from geese may have probiotic potential in reducing bacterial infections. the antibacterial activity of the selected lactobacilli is  mainly due to lactic acid production by these bacteria. the selected lactobacillus strains that strongly inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria,  and were also resistant to low ph and bile salts, can potentially restore the balance of intestinal microflora in geese and could offer an alternative to antibiotic therapy.

TI  == bacterial diversity of darfiyeh, a lebanese artisanal raw goat's milk cheese.
AB  == in order to contribute to the preservation of the lebanese dairy heritage, the aim of this study was to characterize the darfiyeh cheese, a traditional variety  made from raw goat's milk and ripened in goat's skin. three independent batches of darfiyeh production were analyzed after 20, 40 and 60 days of ripening. mesophilic lactobacilli, thermophilic coccal-shaped lactic acid bacteria (lab) and thermophilic lactobacilli were enumerated. in order to explore the darfiyeh natural ecosystem, a combination of phenotypical and molecular approaches was applied. the latter included polymerase chain reaction-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (pcr-ttge), classical pcr and quantitative pcr. these methods revealed the presence of streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus malodoratus, group d streptococcus sp., lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and l. lactis subsp. cremoris, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus curvatus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, clostridium sp./eubacterium tenue. real-time pcr  enabled quantification of e. faecium, with a detection of 10(7)-10(9) cfu g(-1) of product. the present molecular approaches combined with phenotypic method allowed describing the complex natural ecosystem of darfiyeh, giving useful information for the preservation of lebanese artisanal dairy products.

TI  == antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
AB  == aim: to develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. methods and results: the antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lactobacillus plantarum 299v and lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium lactis bb12, bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). bacterial  fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. pyelonephritic escherichia coli was highly suppressed by gg and both bifidobacteria strains. lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and me-3 were the most  effective against salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while me-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. the highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for lact. fermentum me-3 (p < 0.05). no efficient antagonist against clostridium difficile was found. the positive correlations between the ph, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics  were assessed. conclusions: developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of lactobacillus and/or bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. significance and impact of the study: screening lactobacillus and bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy  studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.

TI  == lactic acid bacterial diversity in the traditional mexican fermented dough pozol  as determined by 16s rdna sequence analysis.
AB  == the lactic acid bacteria diversity of pozol, a mexican fermented maize dough, was studied using a total dna extraction and purification procedure and pcr amplification of 16s rdna for gram-positive and related bacterial groups. thirty-six clones were obtained and sequenced to 650 nucleotides. these partial sequences were identified by submission to the non-redundant nucleotide database  of ncbi. the identified sequences were aligned with reference sequences of the closest related organisms. this analysis indicated that only 14 sequences were unique clones and these were identified as lactococcus lactis, streptococcus suis, lactobacillus plantarum, lact. casei, lact. alimentarium, and lact. delbruekii and clostridium sp. two non-ribosomal sequences were also detected. unlike other environments analyzed with this molecular approach where many unidentified microorganisms are found, the identity of most sequences could be established as lactic acid bacteria, indicating that this is the main group among the gram-positive bacteria in pozol. use of this molecular method permitted detection of lactic acid bacteria different from those previously isolated and identified by culture techniques

TI  == the effect of probiotic strains on the microbiota of the simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (shime).
AB  == the aim of the present work was to study five potential probiotic strains (lactobacillus plantarum, two strains of l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. rhamnosus and bifidobacterium sp.) comparatively in the simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (shime) in vitro model, and to evaluate this model as a tool in the screening and selection of probiotic bacteria. the impact of the strains on the composition of microbiota and its metabolic activities (production of lactic acid and short-chain fatty acids) was studied. changes in composition of the microbiota become apparent as a result of probiotic treatment. a marked, but temporary, increase was noted in the number of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria. the profiles of d(-) and l(+) isomers of lactic acid detected in  the shime after addition of probiotic strains corresponded well to those that are produced in pure culture conditions. the numbers of enterobacteriaceae decreased  markedly and those of clostridia detectably during the intervention, while the enterococci tended to increase after the treatment. this pattern was similar in the reactors representing both the small and large intestine in the model. the changes in short-chain fatty acids were small, and no definite trend was observed.

TI  == the reduction of n-hydroxy-4-acetylaminobiphenyl by the intestinal microflora of  the rat.
AB  == the role of the intestinal flora in the conversion of n-hydroxy-4-acetyl-aminobiphenyl (n-oh-aabp) to 4-acetylaminobiphenyl has been examined. this reaction, which reverses the metabolic activation of the parent carcinogen, can be demonstrated in cultures of some bacteria indigenous to the intestinal microflora. these include cultures of clostridium sp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus productus i, and bacteroides fragilis ss. thetaiotaomicron and ss. vulgatus. in contrast, cultures of lactobacillus plantarum and escherichia coli show little or no capacity for this reaction. the  reduction of n-oh-aabp is also carried out by homogenates of liver, kidney, and brain. on a weight basis, the cecal flora is considerably more active in reducing n-oh-aabp than are homogenates of tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. the cecal flora also has a greater activity for reducing n-oh-aabp than the stomach flora, an observation which may relate to the induction of tumors in the forestomach but not in the cecum of rats fed this compound. the products of the metabolism of n-oh-aabp have been compared in germ-free and conventional animals. glucuronide conjugates of n-oh-aabp are found in the cecal contents and feces only of the germ-free rats, while 4-acetylaminobiphenyl is found in the feces only of conventional rats. these results suggest that the flora, by hydrolyzing glucuronides and reducing n-oh-aabp, may influence the level of metabolities of 4-acetylaminobiphenyl which are critical for carcinogenesis.

TI  == the relationship between nitro group reduction and the intestinal microflora.
AB  == the capacity of rats to reduce a 25-mg dose of p-nitrobenzoic acid (pnba) was measured by quantifying the amount of this compound recovered in the urine as p-aminobenzoic acid (paba) and its conjugates. it was found that germfree rats converted approximately 1% of pnba to paba; in conventional rats the conversion was approximately 25%. various bacteria isolated from the rat cecum were selectively associated with germfree rats and it was demonstrated that these bacteria colonized their gastrointestinal tracts. in assoication with lactobacillus plantarum, the conversion of pnba to paba increased to 3.9%. when these rats were further associated with clostridium sp. and streptoccocus faecalis, the conversion increased to approximately 12%. a general correlation was found between the capacity of constituents of the microflora to reduce pnba in vitro and when associated with the germfree rat. cecectomy, which removes a substantial portion of the microflora of the rat, decreases the capacity of the conventional rat to reduce pnba. similar experiments with p-nitrobenzenesulfonamide indicate that this compound is also largely reduced by  the flora. evidence that the reduction of the nitro group in these compounds is carried out by the intestinal microflora explains previous observations in which  the reduction of these compounds in rats did not correlate with the activity of liver enzymes putative for these reactions.
