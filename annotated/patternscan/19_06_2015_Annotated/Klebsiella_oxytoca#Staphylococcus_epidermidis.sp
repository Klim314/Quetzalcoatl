TI  == [prevalence and features of pathogenic bacteria in the department of hematology without bone marrow transplantation in peking union medical college hospital from 2010 to 2012].
AB  == objective: to investigate the incidence, pathogens, and clinical features of infection in consecutive cases from 2010 to 2012 in peking union medical college  hospital. method: the incidence, pathogen, treatment, and outcomes of patients with hematological diseases who had positive findings of bacterium in their samples from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. results: there were 449  positive samples (5.8%) from 4 890 patients during this period, among which 388 were proved to be with pathogenic bacteria. samples separated from patients with  community-aquired infections accounted for 8.4% of all positive samples. most community-aquired infections were caused by gram-negative bacteria (75%), although no multidrug-resistant bacteria was observed. samples separated from patients with nosocomial infections accounted for 91.6% of all positive samples.  respiratory tract (49.4%) and peripheral blood (32.6%) were the most common samples with positive results. skin soft tissues (10.4%), and urine (3.7%) were less common samples. most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infections were gram-negative (66.9%). the most common gram-negative bacteria included escherichia coli (13.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), and klebsiella pneumonia (12.1%), while staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), enterococcus faecium (7.0%), and staphylococcus epidermidis (5.1%) were the most common gram-positive  bacteria. gram-negative bacteria consisted of most of sputum samples and peripheral blood samples. samples from the surface of skin wound and anal swab were composed largely by gram-positive bacteria (63.8%). the detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumonia/klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis were 24.0%, 87.9% and 38.4%, respectively. the resistance to acinetobacter baumannii was serious. multidrug-resistant, extensive drug resistant and pan drug resistant a. baumannii acountted for 74% of all a. baumannii infections. stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed low resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, levofloxacin and minocycline. also, 22 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 9 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis were detected, which were only sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. all patients were treated in the haematology wards and most of them were under agranulocytosis or immunosuppression. finally, 22 patients reached clinical recovery through anti-infective therapy, whereas 49 patients died. among those deaths, 42 patients attributed to severe infections and infection-associated complications. fourteen  of all the deaths might be infected with drug-resistance bacteria. there were 61  samples proved to be bacteria colonization. nonfermenters such as acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia made up for a large amount of bacteria colonization. conclusions: the pathogens of nosocomial infections in the hematology ward are mainly gram-negative bacteria. the incidences and pathogens vary from different infection sites. nosocomial infection still has a higher mortality rate. once nonfermenters are detected positive, the pathogenic or colonial bacteria should be distinguished.

TI  == effect of algae and plant lectins on planktonic growth and biofilm formation in clinically relevant bacteria and yeasts.
AB  == this study aimed to evaluate the abilities of plant and algae lectins to inhibit  planktonic growth and biofilm formation in bacteria and yeasts. initially, ten lectins were tested on staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, and c. tropicalis at concentrations of 31.25 to 250 mu g/ml. the lectins from cratylia floribunda (cfl), vatairea macrocarpa (vml), bauhinia bauhinioides (bbl), bryothamnion seaforthii (bsl), and hypnea musciformis (hml) showed activities against at least one microorganism. biofilm formation in the presence of the lectins was also evaluated; after 24 h of incubation with the lectins, the biofilms were analyzed  by quantifying the biomass (by crystal violet staining) and by enumerating the viable cells (colony-forming units). the lectins reduced the biofilm biomass and/or the number of viable cells to differing degrees depending on the microorganism tested, demonstrating the different characteristics of the lectins. these findings indicate that the lectins tested in this study may be natural alternative antimicrobial agents; however, further studies are required to better elucidate the functional use of these proteins.

TI  == evaluation of a rapid colorimetric assay for detection of bacterial contamination in apheresis and pooled random-donor platelet units.
AB  == background: despite existing strategies, bacterial contamination of platelets (plts) remains a problem, and reliable testing near the time of use is needed. we evaluated the bactx assay (immunetics, inc.), a rapid colorimetric assay for detection of bacterial peptidoglycan, for this purpose. study design and methods: apheresis- and whole blood-derived plt units, the latter tested in 6-unit pools,  inoculated with 10 representative bacterial species (eight aerobic, two anaerobic), were tested with the bactx assay at two sites to determine analytic sensitivity and time to detection. specificity on sterile plts and reproducibility across different plt units and assay kit lots was also determined. results: analytical sensitivity for the 10 bacterial species ranged from 6.3 x 10(2) to 7.6 x 10(4) colony-forming units (cfus)/ml. in time-to-detection studies after inoculation of plts with 0.7 to 5.3 cfus/ml, 10 replicates of all eight aerobic species were positive when bacterial titers were  above the analytic sensitivity detection limit, which occurred at 48 hours for 60 plt units and at 72 hours for the remaining 4 units, as well as at 7 days for all units. specificity was 99.8% and reproducibility was 100%. conclusions: the bactx assay had an analytical sensitivity below the 10(5) cfus/ml threshold of clinical significance, detected all eight aerobic bacterial species 48 to 72 hours after inoculation as well as at 7 days, and had high specificity and reproducibility. these findings suggest that the bactx assay will be a valuable test for detection of clinically relevant levels of bacterial contaminants in plt units and pools near time of use.

TI  == duodenal-mucosal bacteria associated with celiac disease in children.
AB  == celiac disease (cd) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion  of cereal gluten proteins. this disorder is associated with imbalances in the gut microbiota composition that could be involved in the pathogenesis of cd. the aim  of this study was to characterize the composition and diversity of the cultivable duodenal mucosa-associated bacteria of cd patients and control children. duodenal biopsy specimens from patients with active disease on a gluten-containing diet (n = 32), patients with nonactive disease after adherence to a gluten-free diet (n = 17), and controls (n = 8) were homogenized and plated on plate count agar, wilkins-chalgren agar, brain heart agar, or yeast, casitone, and fatty acid agar. the isolates were identified by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. renyi diversity profiles showed the highest diversity values for active cd patients, followed by  nonactive cd patients and control individuals. members of the phylum proteobacteria were more abundant in patients with active cd than in the other child groups, while those of the phylum firmicutes were less abundant. members of the families enterobacteriaceae and staphylococcaceae, particularly the species klebsiella oxytoca, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus pasteuri, were more abundant in patients with active disease than in controls. in contrast, members of the family streptococcaceae were less abundant in patients with active cd than in controls. furthermore, isolates of the streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus mutans groups were more abundant in controls than in both cd patient groups, regardless of inflammatory status. the findings indicated that the disease is associated with the overgrowth of possible pathobionts that exclude symbionts or commensals that are characteristic of the healthy small intestinal microbiota.

TI  == influence of tnf-alpha blockers on the oral prevalence of opportunistic microorganisms in ankylosing spondylitis patients.
AB  == objectives: to compare the oral prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of candida spp., staphylococci, enterobacteriaceae, and pseudomonas spp. from ankylosing spondylitis (as) patients receiving conventional and anti-tnf-alpha therapy. methods: the study included 70 as patients, diagnosed according to the modified new york criteria (1984). the volunteers were divided into 2 groups: a biological group (as biog) (n=35) (on anti-tnf-alpha therapy) and a conventional  group (as convg) (n=35). the control group (contg) (n=70) was made up of healthy  individuals matched for age, gender, and oral conditions. after clinical examination, oral rinse samples were collected and plated in specific culture media. the number of colony-forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) was obtained, and isolates were identified using the api system. antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed according to the nccls guidelines. prevalence and counts of  microorganisms were statistically compared between the 3 groups, using the mann-whitney and chi-square tests. significance level was set at 5%. results: in  both the as biog and the as convg, staphylococci counts were higher than that in  the contg (p<0.0001). candida albicans and staphylococcus epidermidis were the most commonly found species in all the groups. serratia marcescens and klebsiella oxytoca were more prevalent in the as biog and the as convg, respectively. two candida isolates (2.8%) from the as biog and 5 (10.8%) from the as convg were resistant to amphotericin b and 5-fluorocytosine. a low percentage of staphylococci isolates was resistant to amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and doxycycline. conclusions: higher counts of staphylococci were observed in both as groups, regardless of the current therapy, age, sex, and oral conditions. anti-tnf-alpha therapy could not be correlated with increased counts of microorganisms.

TI  == comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. by use of a sensitive enrichment broth, gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the referral clinic in eritrea and at a german university hospital. in the german cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus (n=8; mrsa (n=2)), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). in comparison, the  eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. among the  identified species were s. aureus (n=2), s. epidermidis (n=13), streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and gram-negative rods including klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), escherichia coli (n=2), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). noteworthy, none of the eritrean patients were  positive for mrsa. in both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. however, we observed in two subjects of the eritrean cohort co-colonization with s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus. the occurrence of gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the german cohort, whereas in the eritrean cohort gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. continued surveillance  of s. aureus and gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.

TI  == staphylococcus spp., enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonadaceae oral isolates from brazilian hiv-positive patients. correlation with cd4 cell counts and viral load.
AB  == the aim was to evaluate the presence of staphylococcus spp., enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonadaceae in the oral cavities of hiv-positive patients. forty-five individuals diagnosed as hiv-positive by elisa and western-blot, and under anti-retroviral therapy for at least 1 year, were included in the study. the control group constituted 45 systemically healthy individuals matched to the hiv  patients to gender, age and oral conditions. oral rinses were collected and isolates were identified by api system. counts of microorganisms from hiv and control groups were compared statistically by a mann-whitney test (alpha=5%). the percentages of individuals positive for staphylococci were similar between the groups (p=0.764), whereas for gram-negative rods, a higher percentage was observed amongst hiv-positive (p=0.001). there was no difference in staphylococcus counts between hiv and control groups (p=0.1008). counts were lower in the oral cavities of patients with low viral load (p=0.021), and no difference was observed in relation to cd4 counts (p=0.929). staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated species in hiv group, and staphylococcus  epidermidis was the prevalent species in the control group. significantly higher  numbers of enteric bacteria and pseudomonas were detected in the oral cavities of the hiv group than in the control (p=0.0001). enterobacter cloacae was the most frequently isolated species in both groups. counts of enteric bacteria and pseudomonas were significantly lower in patients with low cd4 counts (p=0.011); however, there was no difference relating to viral load. it may be concluded that hiv group showed greater species diversity and a higher prevalence of enterobacteriaceae/pseudomonadaceae.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals in 2009.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline and comparative agents were determined for a collection of the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens from hospital-associated patients across canada in 2009 as part of the ongoing canward surveillance study. in total, 4,546 isolates from 15 sentinel canadian hospital laboratories were tested using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method. compared with other cephalosporins, including  ceftobiprole, cefepime, and ceftriaxone, ceftaroline exhibited the greatest potency against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), with a mic(9)(0) of 0.25 mug/ml. ceftaroline also demonstrated greater potency than ceftobiprole against community-associated methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa)  (mic(9)(0), 0.5 mug/ml) and health care-associated mrsa (mic(9)(0), 1 mug/ml) and was at least 4-fold more active than other cephalosporins against staphylococcus  epidermidis; all isolates of mssa and mrsa tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (mic, </=1 mug/ml). against streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline mics (mic(9)(0), </=0.03 mug/ml) were comparable to those of ceftobiprole; however, against penicillin-nonsusceptible, macrolide-nonsusceptible, and multidrug-nonsusceptible isolates of s. pneumoniae, ceftaroline demonstrated 2- to 4-fold and 4- to 16-fold more potent activities than those of ceftobiprole and ceftriaxone, respectively. all isolates of s. pneumoniae tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (mic, </=0.25 mug/ml). among gram-negative isolates, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity (mic(9)(0), </=0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli (92.2% of isolates were susceptible), klebsiella pneumoniae (94.1% of isolates were susceptible), proteus mirabilis (97.7% of isolates were susceptible), and haemophilus influenzae (100% of isolates were susceptible). ceftaroline demonstrated less potent activity (mic(9)(0), >/=4 mug/ml) against enterobacter spp., acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. overall, ceftaroline demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a recent collection of the most frequently encountered gram-positive and gram-negative isolates from patients attending hospitals across canada in 2009.

TI  == bacterial growth kinetics in acd-a apheresis platelets: comparison of plasma and  pas iii storage.
AB  == background: our objective was to determine the growth kinetics of bacteria in leukoreduced apheresis platelets (lr-ap) in a platelet (plt) additive solution (pas; intersol, fenwal, inc.) compared to lr-ap stored in plasma. study design and methods: hyperconcentrated, double-dose lr-ap were collected from healthy donors with a separator (amicus, fenwal, inc.). lr-ap were evenly divided, intersol was added to half (65% intersol:35% plasma [pas]), and plts in autologous plasma were used for a paired control (pl). bacteria were inoculated into each lr-ap pas/pl pair (0.5-1.6 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml), and bacterial growth was followed for up to 7 days. time to the end of the lag phase, doubling times, maximum concentration (conc-max), and time to maximum concentration (time-max) were estimated. results: streptococcus viridans did not  grow to detectable levels in either pas or pl units. the other bacteria had no significant overall difference in the conc-max (p = 0.47) or time-max (p = 0.7) between pl and pas lr-ap; pl had a 0.14 hours faster doubling rate (p = 0.023); and pas had a 4.7 hours shorter lag time (p = 0.016). conclusion: we observed that five index organisms will grow in lr-ap stored in a 35%:65% ratio of plasma  to intersol where initial bacterial concentrations are 0.5 to 1.6 cfus/ml. the more rapid initiation of log-phase growth for bacteria within a pas storage environment resulted in a bacterial concentration up to 4 logs higher in the pas  units compared to the plasma units at 24 hours, but with no difference in the conc-max. this may present an early bacterial detection advantage for pas-stored  plts.

TI  == maggot excretions inhibit biofilm formation on biomaterials.
AB  == background: biofilm-associated infections in trauma surgery are difficult to treat with conventional therapies. therefore, it is important to develop new treatment modalities. maggots in captured bags, which are permeable for larval excretions/secretions, aid in healing severe, infected wounds, suspect for biofilm formation. therefore we presumed maggot excretions/secretions would reduce biofilm formation. questions/purposes: we studied biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella oxytoca, enterococcus faecalis, and enterobacter cloacae on polyethylene, titanium, and stainless steel. we compared the quantities of biofilm formation between the bacterial species on the various biomaterials and the quantity of biofilm formation after various incubation times. maggot excretions/secretions were added to existing biofilms to examine their effect. methods: comb-like models of the biomaterials, made to fit in a 96-well microtiter plate, were incubated with bacterial suspension. the formed biofilms were stained in crystal violet, which was eluted in ethanol. the optical density (at 595 nm) of the eluate was determined to quantify biofilm formation. maggot excretions/secretions were pipetted in different concentrations to (nonstained) 7-day-old biofilms, incubated 24 hours, and finally measured. results: the strongest biofilms were formed by s. aureus and s. epidermidis on polyethylene and the weakest on titanium. the highest quantity of biofilm formation was reached within 7 days for both bacteria. the presence of excretions/secretions reduced biofilm formation on all biomaterials. a maximum of 92% of biofilm reduction was measured. conclusions: our observations suggest maggot excretions/secretions decrease biofilm formation and could provide a new treatment for biofilm formation on infected biomaterials.

AB  == we investigated the microbiological and toxicological effects of three perla black bean extracts on the growth and culture of selected pathogenic microorganisms, the toxicity over vero cell lines and an in vivo rat model. three different solvents were used to obtain perla black bean extracts. all three perla black bean extracts were tested for antibacterial and antiparasitic activity and  further analysed for intrinsic cytotoxicity (ic(50)). methanol perla black bean extract was used for acute toxicity test in rats, with the up-and-down doping method. all perla black bean extracts inhibited bacterial growth. pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and listeria monocytogenes showed inhibition, while escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes did not. acidified water and acetic acid perla black bean extract were tested in parasites. the best ic(50) was observed for giardia lamblia, while higher concentrations were active against entamoeba histolytica and trichomonas vaginalis. the vero cells toxicity levels (ic(50)) for methanol, acidified water  and acetic acid perla black bean extract were [mean +/- s.d. (95% ci)]: 275 +/- 6.2 (267.9-282.0), 390 +/- 4.6 (384.8-395.2) and 209 +/- 3.39 (205.6-212.4) microg/ml, respectively. in vivo acute toxicity assays did not show changes in absolute organ weights, gross and histological examinations of selected tissues or functional tests. the acetic acid and methanol perla black bean extract proved to exhibit strong antibacterial activity and the acidified water perla black bean extract exerted parasiticidal effects against giardia lamblia, entamoeba hystolitica and trichomonas vaginalis. the three perla black bean extracts assayed over vero cells showed very low toxicity and the methanol perla black bean extract in vivo did not cause toxicity.

TI  == monitoring and identification of bacteria associated with safety concerns in the  manufacture of sao jorge, a portuguese traditional cheese from raw cow's milk.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the hygienic quality of raw milk used in the  manufacture of sao jorge, a protected denomination of origin portuguese semihard  cheese, as well as to ascertain the sanitary conditions prevailing during its processing. viable counts of enterobacteriaceae and micrococcaceae were accordingly obtained, pertaining to 21 independent batches (including samples of  raw milk, curd, and cheeses after 1, 3, and 4 months of ripening), from 7 dairy farms. standard plate counts (log cfu per milliliter or per gram) ranged from 6.1 to 8.6 in raw milk, whereas they ranged from 7.0 to 8.0 in 4-month-old cheeses. viable counts of enterobacteriaceae ranged between 5.9 and 7.0 in raw milk and between 0.0 and 1.3 in 4-month-old cheeses. species identified within this family encompassed klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sakazakii, and escherichia coli; klebsiella ornithinolytica, klebsiella terrigena, and serratia odorifera were detected only in raw milk. no salmonella whatsoever could be detected in any of the samples. viable counts of micrococcaceae ranged between 4.7 and 5.9 and between 1.3 and 3.3 in raw milk and 4-month-old cheeses, respectively. species identified within this family encompassed staphylococcus sciuri, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus (which was found mainly in ripened cheeses), and staphylococcus aureus (which was not detected in 4-month-old cheeses). accompanying physicochemical analyses included determination of moisture, salt, and ph. statistical analyses revealed a negative correlation between salt content and viable numbers of enterobacteriaceae in cheese, whereas in the case of micrococcaceae, a more negative correlation was found between viable numbers and  moisture content than between viable numbers and ph. the results of our study indicate, in general, poor milk handling conditions in all farms, given that the  indicators total mesophile and enterobacteriaceae counts were high, between 100-  and 1,000-fold those enforced by international standards pertaining to the matrices in question. however, by the time of regular consumption (i.e., after 4  months of ripening), sao jorge cheeses exhibit low levels of contamination by enterobacteriaceae and s. aureus, as well as absence of salmonella.

TI  == medical-grade honey kills antibiotic-resistant bacteria in vitro and eradicates skin colonization.
AB  == background: antibiotic resistance among microbes urgently necessitates the development of novel antimicrobial agents. since ancient times, honey has been used successfully for treatment of infected wounds, because of its antibacterial  activity. however, large variations in the in vitro antibacterial activity of various honeys have been reported and hamper its acceptance in modern medicine. methods: we assessed the in vitro bactericidal activity of revamil (bfactory), a  medical-grade honey produced under controlled conditions, and assessed its efficacy for reduction of forearm skin colonization in healthy volunteers in a within-subject-controlled trial. results: with bacillus subtilis as a test strain, we demonstrated that the variation in bactericidal activity of 11 batches of medical-grade honey was <2-fold. antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant isolates of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, and klebsiella oxytoca were killed within 24 h by 10%-40% (vol/vol) honey. after 2 days of application of honey, the extent of forearm skin colonization in healthy  volunteers was reduced 100-fold (p < .001), and the numbers of positive skin cultures were reduced by 76% (p < .001). conclusions: revamil is a promising topical antimicrobial agent for prevention or treatment of infections, including  those caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == surgical treatment of chronic otitis media with temporomandibular joint involvement.
AB  == we report a case of chronic otitis media with spread of the infection into the temporomandibular joint (tmj), causing displacement of the joint and malocclusion. chemotherapy of the malignant disease caused activation of the chronic ear infection with a temporomandibular joint involvement. the patient was operated twice to eradicate the infection from the mastoid, middle ear and temporomandibular joint. a radical cavity with musculoperiosteal flap obliteration was created. the joint was isolated from the radical cavity with a thin vascularized temporomyofascial flap. no restriction in the movements of the  temporomandibular joint could be noted in the follow-up. after the surgeries chemotherapy could continue without signs of inflammation in the temporomandibular joint or mastoid region. prompt surgical intervention is indicated when temporomandibular joint symptoms arise in cases of chronic otitis  media.

TI  == [surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2003].
AB  == for the post-marketing surveillance of cefmetazole (cmz, cefmetazon), mics of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including cmz against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 574 isolates of 13 species were tested, 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002, and 654 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the third surveillance from april 2002 to march 2003. no remarkable changes in the activity of cmz were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. the activity of cmz in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before cefmetazon was launched. this result suggests that cmz still maintains potent activity. changes in percent resistance of each species to cmz (mic of cmz > or = 32 microg/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa, 0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 72.9% --> 87.2% --> 88.7%), staphylococcus epidermidis (18.5% --> 31.6% --> 14.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (cns, 13.3% --> 18.2% --> 21.4%), escherichia coli (3.6% -->  0.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 3.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella oxytoca (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), proteus mirabilis (2.3% --> 2.1% --> 0.0%), proteus vulgaris (13.6% --> 6.7% --> 0.0%), morganella morganii (7.3% --> 0.0% --> 14.0%), providencia spp. (12.5% --> 0.0% --> 18.2%), peptostreptococcus spp.  (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), bacteroides fragilis (10.3% --> 10.8% --> 17.1%), bacteroides spp. (78.6% --> 87.5% --> 62.5%). the change in percent resistance of mrsa, other cns, and b. flagiris tended to increase. it is necessary to pay much  attention to trends observed in these species. compared to other drugs tested, against mssa, the activity of cmz was inferior to that of cez, ctm, and fmox and  superior to that sbt/cpz. against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and cns, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and inferior to that of fmox. against b. flagiris and other bacteroides spp., the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and comparable to or inferior to that of sbt/cpz and fmox.

TI  == role of pencillin binding proteins in pencillin allergy.
AB  == all beta-lactam sensitive bacteria contain enzymatic penicillin binding proteins  (pbps), which are membrane-bound enzymes and targets of beta-lactam antibiotics.  in this work evaluation of the significance of pbps in immune response to benzylpenicillin was presented. 35 patients with allergic reactions to penicillin and 17 subjects without penicillin allergy, but exposed, were studied. proliferative t-cell responses to benzylpenicillin, penicillin and pbps conjugates (pc-pbps) from e. coli, k. oxytoca, s. aureus, s. epidermidis or serum protein (pc-s) were measured. although each allergic individual responds to pc-pbps in several different ways, specific proliferation of t lymphocytes with pc-pbps from bacterial membranes was significant higher than with pc or pc-s. this observation gives us a real insight into the causes of the drug allergy: individual allergic reaction and susceptibility to the drug is in strict correlation with bacterial infection. it seems likely that acylation of pbps could be the trigger for primary immune response to the hapten benzylpenicillin.

TI  == influence of blood prestorage conditions and white blood cell filtration on the bacterial load of blood deliberately inoculated with gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens.
AB  == background and objectives: currently, the bacterial contamination of blood constitutes one of the major infectious risks of transfusion. the aim of this study was to evaluate the bactericidal effect of blood on various bacterial species and to determine the influence of prestorage conditions and white blood cell (wbc) filtration on the reduction of the bacterial load in isolated red blood cells (rbcs). materials and methods: the growth kinetics of eight different species of bacteria were studied at 20 degrees c in deliberately contaminated rbc units. further experiments evaluated the effect of prestorage conditions and wbc  filtration on the viability of two model bacteria (klebsiella oxytoca and staphylococcus epidermidis) in comparison to previous results obtained with yersinia enterocolitica. results: for bacteria susceptible to the bactericidal effect of blood (mainly gram-negative rods), a reduction of the bacterial load was obtained within 2 h of prestorage at 20 degrees c. when the prestorage period was prolonged beyond 3 h at 20 degrees c, rapid growth was observed with some enterobacteriaceae. whereas wbc filtration reduced dramatically the viability of  y. enterocolitica, it had only a minimal effect on the viability of s. epidermidis and k. oxytoca. however, the two latter species of bacteria did not survive prolonged storage at 4 degrees c. conclusions: experiments conducted under realistic conditions are needed to determine whether it would be worthwhile recommending the rapid storage of rbcs at 4 degrees c after wbc reduction of the  blood product.

TI  == [prostate histopathology of nih category iv prostatitis detected by sextant prostate needle biopsy from the patients with high prostatic specific antigen].
AB  == asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category iv in nih classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). no report concerning this category has been present. we investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (psa) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between january, 1996 and december,  2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as nih category iv prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). we observed all pathological specimens stained with hematoxylin-eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by true et al. (1999). we also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as psa values, psa density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. in the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88)  in stromal. no relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. however, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate  cancers, later. pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). isolated bacteria were 4 strains of enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. gram positive rod, and candida sp. no relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. these results indicated that the incidence of niii category iv prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. however, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.

AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

AB  == purpose: to assess the level of contamination of full-thickness skin grafts stored with or without an antibiotic cover. methods: full-thickness skin grafts were harvested from 40 bilateral upper lid blepharoplasties. before surgery the face was sterilised, the head of the patient was packed with sterile, single-use  surgical drapes and the whole face was left exposed. the harvested full-thickness skin grafts were conserved in sterile containers at 4 degrees c for 6 days, rolled in gauze moistened with either 4 ml of sterile saline solution (group i) or with 4 ml of gentamicin solution (2 mg/ml) (group ii). the degree of contamination, expressed in colony forming units (cfu), was evaluated on days 2,  3, 4, 5 and 6. identification of the microorganisms was done to species level following standard procedures and commercial methods. results: in group i 2 grafts (5%) were negative during the whole observation period while the other 38  grafts (95%) presented a degree of contamination ranging from 10(2) to 10(4) cfu. microorganisms isolated were: staphylococcus epidermidis (24 cases), staphylococcus aureus (5 cases), staphylococcus saprophyticus (2 cases), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4 cases), serratia liquefaciens (1 case) and klebsiella oxytoca (2 cases). in group ii, 26 grafts (65%) were negative during the whole observation time while in 14 cases (35%) a few colonies (3 to 6) of candida albicans were isolated on day 2 and remained constant in number for the whole observation time. conclusions: the storage of full-thickness skin graft with an antibiotic cover is more reliable than the storage of full-thickness skin graft without an antibiotic cover.

TI  == total nutrient admixtures appear safer than lipid emulsion alone as regards microbial contamination: growth properties of microbial pathogens at room temperature.
AB  == background: the extraordinary growth properties of most microorganisms in 10% and 20% lipid emulsions has led to the centers for disease control and prevention recommendation that if lipids are given through an i.v. line, the administration  set should be replaced every 24 hours rather than the usual 72-hour interval used for crystalloid solutions, including those used for conventional total parenteral nutrition. for nearly 15 years, parenteral alimentation has been given as a total nutrient admixture (tna), with the glucose, amino acids, and lipid mixed within the same bag and infused continuously over 24 hours. methods: we prospectively studied in a representative tna (17.6% glucose, 5% amino acids, 4% lipid; ph 5.6, osmolality 1778) and in a control solution, 5% dextrose-in-water (d5%/w), the growth properties at 4, 25, and 35 degrees c of three isolates each of staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, flavobacterium spp, and candida albicans, and two isolates of staphylococcus saprophyticus, the species that are most likely to contaminate tna during preparation or administration and that have been implicated in >95% of all outbreaks and sporadic cases of nosocomial bloodstream infections traced to contaminated parenteral admixtures reported in the world literature. results: growth in tna at 25 and 35 degrees c occurred with only two species, c. albicans  and s. saprophyticus, and only after 24 to 48 hours; d5%/w allowed growth at 25 degrees c of two gram-negative species, s. marcescens and b. cepacia. conclusions: we conclude that tna is a poor growth medium for most nosocomial pathogens and is no better than d5%/w. the need to replace administration sets every 24 hours with tna should be reconsidered and ideally be studied in a prospective randomized trial.

TI  == reconstituted recombinant factor viii can be safely infused continuously for at least three days: it is a poor microbial growth medium.
AB  == reconstituted recombinant factor viii (fviiirec) loses little biologic activity at room temperature for up to seven days and continuous infusion is convenient, effective hemostatically and requires less fviiirec concentrate than treatment by conventional bolus injections. however, the potential for bacterial contamination, with proliferation to high levels that can cause bacteremia, is a  concern with continuous infusion. we studied the growth properties at 4, 25 and 35 degrees c in reconstituted fviiirec (kogenate) and at 25 degrees c in 5% dextrose in water (d5%w) of three isolates each of staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, flavobacterium spp. and candida albicans, species most likely to contaminate infusate during preparation or administration and which have been implicated in more than 95% of all outbreaks and sporadic cases of nosocomial bloodstream infection traced to contaminated admixtures, biologic agents or medications administered parenterally. reconstituted fviiirec allowed growth of only three species at 25 degrees c and 35 degrees c: s. marcescens, s. maltophilia and p. aeruginosa; logarithmic growth appeared only after 24-48 h. d5%w allowed growth of two gram-negative species, s. marcescens and b. cepacia. we conclude that reconstituted fviiirec (kogenate) is  a poor growth medium for most nosocomial pathogens, comparable with d5%w. if reconstituted aseptically, continuous infusion of reconstituted fviiirec should be safe, and it should not be necessary to replace the container or tubing more frequently than every 3 days, an administration schedule that can provide effective hemostasis at lower cost.

TI  == hydrocortisone 17-butyrate degradation in the presence of micro-organisms.
AB  == objective: this study compared the degradation of hydrocortisone 17-butyrate (h17b) in the presence of six different bacteria, commonly found on psoriatic skin. method: h17b and its degradation products (hydrocortisone and hydrocortisone 21-butyrate (h21b)) were assayed by hplc. results: in the absence  of micro-organisms, we observed 16.6 +/- 7.1% degradation. in the presence of micro-organisms and otherwise similar conditions, we noted that h17b degradation  was not modified by cocci (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae). three bacilli increased degradation, escherichia coli  59.1 +/- 19.4%, klebsiella oxytoca 62.1 +/- 6.7% and pseudomonas aeruginosa 56.0  +/- 17.9%. conclusion: the degradation of h17b into hydrortisone and h21b may produce a loss of therapeutic activity.

TI  == controlled clinical comparison of two lysis-based blood culture systems, isolator and septi-chek release, for detection of bloodstream infections.
AB  == a controlled clinical comparison was made of the isolator (wampole laboratories,  cranbury, n.j.) and the septi-chek release bottle (roche diagnostics, nutley, n.j.). from 6,345 blood culture sets fulfilling minimum criteria for volume of blood cultured, 840 strains were isolated, of which only 691 (82%) were considered to be representative of bloodstream infection according to centers for disease control definitions. statistically significant differences were found between the systems for the following organisms, which were all detected more frequently in the isolator system: staphylococcus aureus (p = 0.0001), alcaligenes xylosoxidans (p = 0.008), klebsiella pneumoniae (p = 0.05), salmonella spp. (p = 0.03), and candida albicans (p = 0.02). the septi-chek release system required a longer period of time than the isolator system for detection of the following organisms:s. aureus (p = 0.0001), enterococcus spp. (p = 0.0001), enterobacter cloacae (p = 0.03), escherichia coli (p = 0.0001), klebsiella oxytoca (p = 0.03), k. pneumoniae (p = 0.02), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p = 0.002), and c. albicans (p = 0.005). there were 430 episodes of bloodstream  infections identified in the study; of these episodes, only those due to s. aureus were detected significantly more frequently (p = 0.0001) by the isolator system than by the septi-chek release system. however, episodes of bloodstream infections due to s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus spp., and e. coli were detected significantly faster by the isolator system.

TI  == development of cutaneous microflora in premature neonates.
AB  == coagulase-negative staphylococci (c-ns) are a frequent cause of bacteraemia in premature neonates. it is likely that the strains of c-ns causing bacterial sepsis in premature neonates have their origin on the patient's skin surface. we  have studied the quantitative development of the skin microflora at eight sites on premature neonates. a swab wash method was used to sample and enumerate the cutaneous microflora of premature neonates admitted to an intensive care unit with respiratory distress syndrome. the numbers of bacteria present on the skin increased rapidly by 100-fold in the first week of life. the species of c-ns found on neonatal skin were similar to those found on adult skin. however, the bacterial population was 10(3) lower by comparison. there was considerable variation in numbers of bacteria and in the proportion resistant to antibiotics from day to day. there appeared to be no association between antibiotic usage and the proportion of isolates resistant to antibiotics, although the resident bacteria were in many cases resistant to a variety of antibiotics. c-ns were isolated from 92% of samples from which bacteria were isolated. staphylococcus epidermidis was found at all sites and accounted for 82% of each colonial type of staphylococcus isolated. other organisms isolated included propionibacterium sp,  alpha-haemolytic streptococci, aerobic spore-bearing bacilli, aerobic coryneforms, candida albicans, klebsiella oxytoca, pityrosporum sp, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli. the results of this study suggest that the skin of premature neonates is colonised with antibiotic resistant c-ns during the first week of life and that the chance of contamination of an intravascular catheter at insertion increases during this period.

TI  == non-ige-dependent bacteria-induced histamine release from human lung and tonsillar mast cells.
AB  == a wide spectrum of formalin-killed bacteria have been tested for their ability to release histamine from human dispersed lung and tonsillar mast cells. escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca and k. pneumoniae were the most effective histamine releasers. further studies on tonsillar mast cells showed that e. coli-induced histamine release differed from ige-dependent release with respect to its kinetics, temperature and ph profiles and its sensitivity to calcium deprivation and metabolic inhibitors. a lectin-mediated mechanism may operate, but other non-immunological mechanisms might also be involved in the release. escherichia coli and anti-ige did not synergize in inducing histamine release. the production of pgd2 and the failure to detect lactate dehydrogenase following incubation of mast cells with e. coli suggests that histamine release is not due to cytotoxicity.

TI  == [bone infections: treatment by ofloxacin. apropos of 10 cases].
AB  == because of its pharmacokinetic, broad spectrum and oral administration, ofloxacin can be used in the treatment of chronic bone infections. a clinical trial was performed in 10 patients with subacute or chronic osteitis (5 staphylococcus aureus, 1 staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 klebsiella oxytoca, 1 escherichia coli, 1 serratia marcescens, 1 pseudomonas aeruginosa). patients were given orally 200 mg 12 hourly. treatment duration went on from 2 to 6 months. in this trial, the evaluation was successful in the 10 cases with a delay of 2 to 13 months (m 8,9)  after the end of the treatment. prosthetic material has been taken off in 1 case  out of 4 patients (prosthetic hip) because of persistaet free bacteria outflow. for one patient, a superinfection with a pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to ofloxacin was noticed at the second month. bone levels (microbiological method) were between 1,3 and 9,7 mg/l and always higher to the mic of the bacteria. biological tolerance was satisfactory in spite of a rise of transaminase level, a transient renal disfunction whom relationship to the treatment was difficult. 3 transient photosensitivities were also noticed.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new penem, cgp 31608.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cgp 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. cgp 31608  inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, and salmonella, shigella, aeromonas, and yersinia spp. with mics for 50% of the strains (mic50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and mic90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem mics of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. mic90s were 8 micrograms/ml for enterobacter species and c. freundii, for which other agents had mics of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. the mic90 for proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, and providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. the mic for p. cepacia, p. fluorescens, and p. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for p. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. hemolytic streptococci a, b, c, g, and f were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the mic for streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. mics for staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant s. epidermidis. bacteroides fragilis and clostridium species and fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. cgp 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, pse-1, oxa-2, pse-4, or by s. aureus. chromosomal beta-lactamases of type ia in enterobacter cloacae p99 and morganella morganii, ic in p. vulgaris, k-1 in k. oxytoca, and id in p. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze cgp 31608. it inhibited tem-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the p99 enzyme. cgp 31608 induced beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, c. freundii and providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in mics for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. synergy of cgp 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% p. aeruginosa, 60% enterobacter cloacae, and 50% serratia marcescens strains. no synergy was found with rifampin. a postantibiotic effect was found against e. coli.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new difluoro oxacephem, 6315-s.
AB  == 6315-s, a novel difluoromethyl thioacetamido oxacephem, had in vitro activity comparable to that of cefotaxime and moxalactam against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, salmonella spp., and shigella spp., inhibiting 90% at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. it inhibited piperacillin- and cefoperazone-resistant isolates in these species. 6315-s did not inhibit cefotaxime- or moxalactam-resistant citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, or enterobacter cloacae (mics for 90% of the strains tested were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml). proteus vulgaris resistant to cefotaxime was inhibited. pseudomonas species and acinetobacter species were resistant (mics greater than 64 micrograms/ml). mics for 90% of the staphylococcus aureus and s.  epidermidis isolates were 4 micrograms/ml. 6315-s was highly active against anaerobic species of clostridium, fusobacterium, bacteroides, and peptostreptococci and was superior to other agents against these organisms. 6315-s was not hydrolyzed by the major plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases, but it induced chromosomal beta-lactamases in enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.

TI  == superinfections in herpes simplex keratitis.
AB  == we reviewed 15 cases of culture-proven corneal superinfections in 15 patients (eight men and seven women ranging in age from 41 to 86 years) with recurrent herpes simplex keratitis. the factors that appeared to increase the risk of superinfection were the presence of an epithelial defect (found in all 15 cases), a history of recurrent herpetic keratouveitis (found in ten cases), and the use of topical corticosteroids (found in 13 cases). eight of the 15 patients were taking antibiotics at the time the superinfections were diagnosed, indicating that topical antibiotics do not provide sufficient protection. gram-negative rods were found in six cases (proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and achromobacter sp.). gram-positive organisms, often in association with another infecting agent, were  found in six cases (staphylococcus epidermidis, three cases; s. aureus, two cases; and streptococcus sp., two cases). fungal superinfections were found in three cases (cephalosporium acremonium, candida albicans, and aspergillus fumigatus, one case each). mycobacterium cheloni was found in two cases.
