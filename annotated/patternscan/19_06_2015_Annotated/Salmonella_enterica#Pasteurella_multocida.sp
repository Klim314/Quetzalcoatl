TI  == conjunctival flora of clinically normal and diseased turtles and tortoises.
AB  == background: in captive breed turtles and tortoises conjunctival disease is common. our aim was to investigate the bacterial and fungal flora present in the  eyes of healthy and pathological chelonians and to compare findings in turtles with those in tortoises. results: samples were taken from the conjunctival sacs of 34, diseased and healthy, chelonians (18 tortoises and 16 turtles) and submitted to bacterial and fungal investigation. all samples showed bacterial growth. thirteen animals (38%), harboured a single bacterial species as sole isolate and twenty-one animals (62%) harboured more than one species. detection of multiple bacterial infection was clearly greater in tortoises compared to turtles. most frequently isolated bacterial species were bacillus spp. (13 isolates), staphylococcus xylosus (10 isolates), sphingomonas paucimobilis (6 isolates), staphylococcus sciuri and aeromonas hydrophila/caviae (each 5 isolates), ochrobactrum anthropi (3 isolates), citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas luteola (each 2 isolates). only one isolate of kocuria varians/rosea, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus auricularis, staphylococcus  haemolyticus, staphylococcus lentus, morganella morganii, pasteurella multocida,  pasteurella pneumotropica/haemolytica, proteus spp., pseudomonas putida, salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and vibrio parahaemolyticus was evidenced. the presence in 8 animals of mycoplasma spp. and  in 1 animal with severe conjunctivitis of chlamydia spp. was detected by pcr. candida spp. was also isolated from two healthy animals. conclusions: a clear predominance of gram positive isolates in tortoises and gram negative isolates in turtles was found. however, we cannot ascribe the observed difference to the diversity of animal species, as other factors, including especially different characteristics of the living environments, may play a role. almost all bacterial species isolated may have clinical significance, mostly as opportunistic pathogens, both for humans and animals. that chelonians are often carrier of bacteria with zoonotic potential is a well-known fact, in particular with regard  to salmonella spp. therefore, it is not surprising the detection of a strain of salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae in the eye of one of the animals tested. worthy of note is the finding of chlamydia spp. in a severe case of conjunctivitis, though we cannot epidemiologically assess a cause-effect relationship between presence of chlamydia and disease.

TI  == development of colloidal gold immunochromatographic strips for detection of riemerella anatipestifer.
AB  == riemerella anatipestifer is one of the most important bacterial pathogen of ducks and causes a contagious septicemia. r. anatipestifer infection causes serositis syndromes similar to other bacterial infections in ducks, including infection by  escherichia coli, salmonella enterica and pasteurella multocida. clinically differentiating r. anatipestifer infections from other bacterial pathogen infections is usually difficult. in this study, mab 1g2f10, a monoclonal antibody against r. anatipestifer groel, was used to develop a colloidal gold immunochromatographic strip. colloidal gold particles were prepared by chemical synthesis to an average diameter of 20 +/- 5.26 nm by transmission electron microscope imaging. mab 1g2f10 was conjugated to colloidal gold particles and the formation of antibody-colloidal gold conjugates was monitored by uv/vis spectroscopy. immunochromatographic strips were assembled in regular sequence through different accessories sticked on pvc plate. strips specifically detected  r. anatipestifer within 10 min, but did not detect e. coli, s. enterica and p. multocida. the detection limit for r. anatipestifer was 1 x 10(6) colony forming  units, which was 500 times higher than a conventional agglutination test. accuracy was 100% match to multiplex pcr. assay stability and reproducibility were excellent after storage at 4 degrees c for 6 months. the immunochromatographic strips prepared in this study offer a specific, sensitive,  and rapid detection method for r. anatipestifer, which is of great importance for the prevention and control of r. anatipestifer infections.

TI  == potential probiotic attributes of a new strain of bacillus coagulans cgmcc 9951 isolated from healthy piglet feces.
AB  == a new strain of bacillus coagulans cgmcc 9551, which has a broad range of antibacterial activities against six main pathogenic bacteria including escherichia coli o8, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar enteritidis, streptococcus suis, listeria monocytogenes and pasteurella multocida, was isolated from healthy piglet feces. in adhesion assay, the isolate exhibited a stronger adhesion to pig intestinal mucus than that of b. subtilis jt143 and l. acidophilus ly24 respectively isolated from bioplus((r))2b and florafit((r)) probiotics (p < 0.05). the adhesion activity reached 44.5 +/- 3.2,  48.9 +/- 2.6, 42.6 +/- 3.3 and 37.6 +/- 2.4 % to jejunum, ileum, transverse colon and sigmoid colon, separately. the survival rate of b. coagulans cgmcc 9551 was reduced by only 20 % at 4 h exposure under 0.9 % w/v bile salt. the strain was fully resistant to ph 2 for 2 h with 90.1 +/- 3.5 % survival and susceptible to 15 antibiotics commonly used in veterinary medicine. additionally, the bacteria showed amylase, protease and cellulase activities. the safety assessment demonstrated the lack of toxicity potential in b. coagulans cgmcc 9551 by ligated rabbit ileal loop assay, acute and subchronic toxicity test. these results implied that that the new strain of b. coagulans cgmcc 9951 isolated from healthy piglet feces has promising probiotic characteristics and offers desirable opportunities for its successful commercialization as one excellent candidate probiotic.

TI  == generation of an attenuated salmonella-delivery strains expressing adhesin and toxin antigens for progressive atrophic rhinitis, and evaluation of its immune responses in a murine model.
AB  == an expression/secretion plasmid containing genes encoding the fima, cp39, ptfa, toxa and f1p2 antigens associated with porcine pneumonic pasteurellosis and progressive atrophic rhinitis (par) was constructed and harbored in an attenuated salmonella typhimurium, which was used as the vaccine candidate. the immune responses induced by this delivery strain were investigated in a murine model. each antigen secreted from the delivery strain was confirmed by western blot analysis. thirty balb/c mice were divided equally into two groups; group a were intranasally inoculated with the mixture of the five delivery strains, and group  b were inoculated with sterile pbs. in group a, all antigen-specific serum igg were significantly increased compared to those of group b from the 2nd week post-inoculation (wpi) till the 8th wpi. all antigen-specific mucosal iga in group a were also significantly greater than those of group b. in addition, the significant splenic lymphocyte proliferative responses, the elevations of cd3(+)cd4(+), cd3(+)cd8(+) and b-cell populations, and the induction of ifn-gamma expression in group a were observed. in conclusion, the mixture of five delivery  strains expressing specific antigen for these diseases was found to be capable of inducing significant humoral and cellular immune responses.

TI  == development and application of a multiplex pcr assay for rapid detection of 4 major bacterial pathogens in ducks.
AB  == infections with pasteurella multocida, salmonella enterica, riemerella anatipestifer, and escherichia coli result in high morbidity and mortality, which cause significant economic loss in the poultry industry. it can be difficult to distinguish these pathogens based on clinical signs because these pathogens can cause similar clinical signs and coinfections can occur. thus, rapid and sensitive detection of these 4 major bacterial pathogens are important in ducks.  the aim of this study was to develop a multiplex pcr (mpcr) assay for simultaneously detecting and identifying these 4 pathogenic bacteria in a single  tube reaction. the target genes used were kmt1 of p. multocida, the invasion protein gene of s. enterica, 16s rdna of r. anatipestifer, and the alkaline phosphatase gene of e. coli. the detection limit of the assay for all bacterial dna was 10 pg. the mpcr did not produce any nonspecific amplification products when tested against other related pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, clostridium perfringens, mycoplasma gallinarum, mycoplasma synoviae, and mycoplasma gallisepticum, which can also infect ducks. we applied mpcr to field samples, and the results were the same as the single pcr results. these results suggest that mpcr for the 4 bacteria is a useful and rapid technique to apply to field samples.

TI  == functional analysis and induction of four novel goose (anser cygnoides) avian beta-defensins in response to salmonella enteritidis infection.
AB  == in the current study, four novel avian beta-defensins (avbds) (avbd2, 5, 9, and 10) were identified in tissues from the chinese goose (anser cygnoides). the antibacterial activity of the avbds showed that all of these avbds exhibited antibacterial activity against most of the bacteria investigated (p<0.01). in addition, antibacterial activity of all of the avbds against staphylococcus aureus and pasteurella multocida decreased significantly or was completely abolished at 150mm nacl (p<0.01). none of the avbds showed hemolytic activity. avbd2 and avbd10 were expressed widely, whereas avbd5 and avbd9 mrnas were expressed in a limited number of geese tissues. avbd9 was significantly induced in some immune tissues from geese after salmonella enteritidis infection. the others were significantly upregulated in small intestine and some immune tissues  of the geese (p<0.01). the present results suggest that the avbds are part of the host defense mechanism of the goose.

TI  == microbiological identification and analysis of swine tonsils collected from carcasses at slaughter.
AB  == the primary objective of this 7-month study was to determine the prevalence of porcine pathogens of the tonsil of the soft palate of swine at slaughter. additional objectives were to determine if sampling the carcasses of normal or abnormal hogs provided different microbiological profiles and if the slaughter plant provides a feasible sampling frame and environment for detecting and monitoring important pathogens in tonsils that have health implications for both  swine and humans. a total of 395 samples were collected from 264 farms. of these, 180 tonsils were collected from normal carcasses and 215 tonsils were collected from carcasses that were diverted to the hold rail. laboratory testing included bacteriological culture and identification as well as real time-polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) testing for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (pprsv) and immunohistochemistry (ihc) for porcine circovirus-2 (pcv-2). the most commonly isolated bacteria included: streptococcus suis (53.7%), arcanobacterium  pyogenes (29.9%), pasteurella multocida (27.3%), and streptococcus porcinus (19.5%). virus screening revealed evidence of prrsv and pcv-2 in 22.0% and 11.9%  of the samples, respectively. salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica  were isolated in 0.5% and 1.8% of the samples, respectively. tonsils collected from the hold rail were more likely to be positive for staphylococcus hyicus [odds ratio (or) = 7.51, confidence interval (ci) = 2.89 to 19.54], streptococcus porcinus (or = 9.93, ci = 4.27 to 23.10), and streptococcus suis (or = 2.16, ci = 1.45 to 3.24). tonsils collected from abnormal carcasses were less likely to be positive for staphylococcus aureus (or = 0.05, ci = 0.005 to 0.482).

TI  == loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay targeting the ompa gene for rapid detection of riemerella anatipestifer.
AB  == a novel loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) assay was developed and evaluated for the detection of riemerella anatipestifer (ra) infection. the lamp  assay exhibited a higher sensitivity than conventional polymerase chain reaction  (pcr) and microbial isolation. the specificity of the assay was determined by restriction enzyme digestion of the lamp products and detection of escherichia coli, salmonella enterica and pasteurella multocida. the lamp assay was able to detect ra effectively in samples of the reference strains, isolated strains and infected duck brains. this assay is a useful tool for the diagnosis of ra infection in the clinical setting.

TI  == [construction and characterization of recombinant salmonella enterica serovar choleraesuis vaccine strain expressing heterologous antigen of pasteurella multocida toxin].
AB  == objective: this study was aimed to construct and characterize salmonella vaccine  strain c500 expressing the recombinant pasteurella multocida toxin (pmt) antigen  by the asd+ balanced-lethal host-vector system. methods and results: the dna fragment encoding c terminal of pmt was cloned downstream from the beta-lactamase signal sequence in the multicopy asd+ pya3493 vector to create pya-pmtc. fermentation patterns, serotype, and mean generation time of the vaccine strain c500 harboring pya-pmtc (named with c501 (pya-pmtc)) were identical to those of the parent strain c500. the recombinant pya-pmtc plasmid was very stable in c501  (pya-f1p2), which expressed secretorily a large amount of the recombinant pmt antigen (named with rpmtc). the virulence of c501 (pya-pmtc) with ld50 of 8.5 x 10(6) cfu was a little lower than c500 with ld50 of 4.4 x 10(6) cfu based on the  method of reed and muench. all piglets inoculated with c501 (pya-pmtc) or c500 survived, and had no signs of disease during the entire experimental period. no significant differences were found between these two groups. conclusion: the recombinant vaccine strain c501 (pya-pmtc) had a series of biological characteristics silimar to the parent vaccine strain c500. it is likely that c501 (pya-pmtc) could be adapted to develop multivalent recombinant salmonella vaccine against both infections with s. enterica serovar choleraesuis and toxigenic p. multocida.

TI  == mhc haplotype and susceptibility to experimental infections (salmonella enteritidis, pasteurella multocida or ascaridia galli) in a commercial and an indigenous chicken breed.
AB  == in three independent experimental infection studies, the susceptibility and course of infection of three pathogens considered of importance in most poultry production systems, ascaridia galli, salmonella enteritidis and pasteurella multocida were compared in two chicken breeds, the indigenous vietnamese ri and the commercial luong phuong. furthermore, the association of the major histocompatibility complex (mhc) with disease-related parameters was evaluated, using alleles of the lei0258 microsatellite as markers for mhc haplotypes. the ri chickens were found to be more resistant to a. galli and s. enteritidis than commercial luong phuong chickens. in contrast, the ri chickens were more susceptible to p. multocida, although production parameters were more affected in the luong phuong chickens. furthermore, it was shown that the individual variations observed in response to the infections were influenced by the mhc. using marker alleles of the microsatellite lei0258, which is located within the mhc region, several mhc haplotypes were identified as being associated with infection intensity of a. galli. an association of the mhc with the specific antibody response to s. enteritidis was also found where four mhc haplotypes were shown to be associated with high specific antibody response. finally, one mhc haplotype was identified as being associated with pathological lesions and mortality in the p. multocida experiment. although not statistically significant, our analysis suggested that this haplotype might be associated with resistance. these results demonstrate the presence of local genetic resources in vietnamese chickens, which could be utilized in breeding programmes aiming at improving disease resistance.

TI  == pattern classification of phylogeny signals.
AB  == in this paper we propose the minimum entropy clustering (mec) method for clustering genes based on their phylogenetic signals. this entropy based method will cluster two genes together when their concatenation can decrease the entropy. an integral feature of mec is that it chooses the number of clusters automatically, which is a major advantage over the other methods. our simulation  results show that this method is quite successful in clustering genes with a common phylogeny.

TI  == terpenoid compositions, and antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of the rhizome essential oils of different hedychium species.
AB  == a phytochemical study of the rhizome essential oils of four different hedychium species was performed by means of gc and gc/ms analyses. h. ellipticum mainly contained 1,8-cineole, sabinene, and terpin-4-ol, while h. aurantiacum possessed  terpin-4-ol, para-cymene, and bornyl acetate as the major entities. similarly, trans-meta-mentha-2,8-diene and linalool were noticed in h. coronarium. three different collections (i-iii) of h. spicatum showed amazing differences in the relative contents of their essential oils, 1,8-cineole and 10-epi-gamma-eudesmol  being identified as markers for samples i and ii, terpin-4-ol and sabinene being  the major compounds in sample iii. the rhizome essential oils of the above species were studied for their antioxidant activities by different methods, including their effect on the chelating properties of fe(2+), dpph radical-scavenging activity, and reducing power. antimicrobial screenings of the  oils by the paper-disc method were performed against staphylococcus aureus, shigella flexneri, pasteurella multocida, escherichia coli, and salmonella enterica enterica, and the respective minimum-inhibitory-concentration (mic) values were determined. the rhizome essential oils from all hedychium species exhibited moderate-to-good fe(2+) chelating activity. h. spicatum from collection site iii showed a completely different dpph radical-scavenging profile than the samples from the other collection sites.

TI  == nucleoside analogues are activated by bacterial deoxyribonucleoside kinases in a  species-specific manner.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the bactericidal activity of antiviral and anticancer  nucleoside analogues against a variety of pathogenic bacteria and characterize the activating enzymes, deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dnks). methods: several fda-approved nucleoside analogue drugs were screened for their potential bactericidal activity against several clinical bacterial isolates and type strains. we identified and subcloned the genes coding for putative deoxyribonucleoside kinases in escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, salmonella enterica, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and listeria monocytogenes. these genes were tested for their ability to increase the susceptibility of a dnk-deficient e. coli strain to various analogues. we overexpressed, purified and characterized the substrate specificity and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzymes from s. enterica and b. cereus. results: the tested gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (azt) in the concentration range 0.032-31.6 microm except for a single e. coli isolate and two pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates which were resistant to the tested azt concentrations. purified recombinant s. enterica thymidine kinase phosphorylated azt efficiently with a km of 73.3 microm and k(cat)/km of 6.6 x 10(4) s(-1) m(-1) and is the activator of this drug in vivo. 2',2'-difluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (gemcitabine) was a potent antibiotic against gram-positive bacteria in the concentration range between 0.001 and 1.0 microm. the b. cereus deoxyadenosine kinase had a km for gemcitabine of 33.5 microm and k(cat)/km of 5.1 x 10(3) s(-1) m(-1) and activates gemcitabine in vivo. s. enterica and b. cereus are now amongst the first bacteria with a completely characterized set of dnk enzymes. conclusions: bacterial dnks efficiently activate nucleoside analogues in a species-specific manner. therefore, nucleoside analogues have a potential to be employed as antibiotics in the fight against emerging multiresistant bacteria.

TI  == unexpected functional diversity among fadr fatty acid transcriptional regulatory  proteins.
AB  == the fadr protein of escherichia coli has been shown to play a dual role in transcription of the genes of bacterial fatty acid metabolism. the protein acts as a repressor of beta-oxidation and an activator of unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. fadr dna binding is antagonized by long chain acyl-coas, and thus fadr acts as a sensor of fatty acid availability in the environment. when viewed from  a genomic viewpoint, fadr proteins are unusual in that the dna binding domain is  very highly conserved among fadr-containing bacteria, whereas the c-terminal acyl-coa binding domain shows only weak conservation. to further our understanding of the role of fadr in bacterial lipid metabolism we have examined  the in vivo and in vitro properties of a diverse set of fadr proteins expressed in e. coli. in addition to e. coli fadr the proteins examined were those of salmonella enterica, vibrio cholerae, pasteurella multocida, and haemophilus influenzae. these fadr proteins were found to differ markedly in their effects on repression and induction of beta-oxidation in e. coli and in their acyl-coa binding abilities as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry. the e. coli and s. enterica proteins were the most similar, although they differed in their effects on utilization of oleic acid and acyl-coa binding affinities, whereas the p. multocida and h. influenzae proteins showed only weak repression and poor acyl-coa binding affinities. the v. cholerae fadr was strikingly superior to the  other proteins in the amplitude of its regulatory response, and it bound long chain acyl-coas appreciably more strongly than the e. coli and s. enterica proteins. the significance of these findings is discussed in view of the protein  sequences and the physiological niches occupied by these organisms.

TI  == an annotated checklist of pathogenic microorganisms associated with migratory birds.
AB  == the potential for transport and dissemination of certain pathogenic microorganisms by migratory birds is of concern. migratory birds might be involved in dispersal of microorganisms as their biological carriers, mechanical  carriers, or as carriers of infected hematophagous ecto-parasites (e.g., ixodid ticks). many species of microorganisms pathogenic to homeothermic vertebrates including humans have been associated with free-living migratory birds. migratory birds of diverse species can play significant roles in the ecology and circulation of some arboviruses (e.g., eastern and western equine encephalomyelitis and sindbis alphaviruses, west nile and st. louis encephalitis  flaviviruses), influenza a virus, newcastle disease virus, duck plague herpes-virus, chlamydophila psittaci, anaplasma phagocytophilum, borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, campylobacter jejuni, salmonella enterica, pasteurella multocida, mycobacterium avium, candida spp., and avian hematozoans. the efficiency of dispersal of pathogenic microorganisms depends on a wide variety of biotic and abiotic factors affecting the survival of the agent in, or disappearance from, a habitat or ecosystem in a new geographic area.

TI  == bacterial flora of free-living double-crested cormorant (phalacrocorax auritus) chicks on prince edward island, canada, with reference to enteric bacteria and antibiotic resistance.
AB  == cloacal and pharyngeal swabs from 100 tree-nesting double-crested cormorant (dcc) chicks were examined by culture for commensal and potentially pathogenic bacteria. no salmonella or erysipelothrix were isolated from the cloacal swabs. twenty-two cloacal swabs were positive for campylobacter, of which 14 were c. jejuni, c. coli, and 1 c. lari. none belonged to common serotypes isolated from humans or animals in recent years in canada. tests for antimicrobial drug resistance among 187 commensal escherichia coli isolates from the cloacal swabs indicated that < or =5% were resistant to any of the 12 antibiotics tested. this  contrasts with the frequently high resistance rates among e. coli isolates from poultry. pharyngeal swabs from dcc were negative for pasteurella multocida. culture of cloacal swabs from 100 ground-nesting dcc chicks resulted in the recovery of 19 salmonella isolates, all of which were s. enterica serotype typhimurium. none of these isolates were resistant to any of the 12 antibiotics tested. altogether, these findings suggest that dcc from this region are not being colonized with commensal or potentially pathogenic enteric bacteria from agricultural or human sources and that enteric bacteria isolated from these birds are unlikely to contribute to a gene pool of antimicrobial drug resistance.

TI  == pnuc and the utilization of the nicotinamide riboside analog 3-aminopyridine in haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == the utilization pathway for the uptake of nad and nicotinamide riboside was previously characterized for haemophilus influenzae. we now report on the cellular location, topology, and substrate specificity of pnuc. pnuc of h. influenzae is only distantly related to pnuc of escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. when e. coli pnuc was expressed in an h. influenzae pnuc mutant, it was able to take up only nicotinamide riboside and not nicotinamide mononucleotide. therefore, we postulated that pnuc transporters in general possess specificity for nicotinamide riboside. earlier studies showed that 3-aminopyridine derivatives (e.g., 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide) are inhibitory for h. influenzae growth. by testing characterized strains with mutations in the nad utilization pathway, we show that 3-aminopyridine riboside is inhibitory to h. influenzae and is taken up by the nad-processing and nicotinamide riboside route. 3-aminopyridine riboside is utilized effectively in  a pnuc+ background. in addition, we demonstrate that 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide resynthesis is produced by nadr. 3-aminopyridine riboside-resistant  h. influenzae isolates were characterized, and mutations in nadr could be detected. we also tested other species of the family pasteurellaceae, pasteurella multocida and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and found that 3-aminopyridine riboside does not act as a growth inhibitor; hence, 3-aminopyridine riboside represents an anti-infective agent with a very narrow host range.

TI  == molecular characterization of plasmids with antimicrobial resistant genes in avian isolates of pasteurella multocida.
AB  == the complete nucleotide sequences of two plasmids from avian isolates of pasteurella multocida that caused outbreaks of fowl cholera in taiwan were determined. the entire sequences of the two plasmids, designated as pjr1 and pjr2, were 6792 bp and 5252 bp. sequence analysis showed that the plasmid pjr1 contained six major genes: the first gene (sulii) encoded a type ii sulfonamide resistant dihydropteroate synthase, the second gene (tetg) encoded a tetracycline resistance protein, the third gene (catb2) encoded a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, the fourth gene (rep) encoded a replication protein, and the fifth and sixth genes (mbecy and deltambeay) encoded proteins involved in the mobilization of plasmid. the plasmid pjr2 contained five major genes: the first gene (deltainti1) encoded a truncated form of a type i integrase, the second gene (aada1) encoded an aminoglycoside adenylyltransferase that confers resistance to  streptomycin and spectinomycin, the third gene (blap1) encoded a beta-lactamase that confers resistance to ampicillin and carbenicillin, and the fourth and fifth genes might encode proteins involved in the plasmid replication or segregation. sequence comparisons showed that the antibiotic resistance genes found in pjr1 and pjr2 exhibited a high degree of sequence homology to the corresponding genes  found in a great variety of gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica typhimurium dt104, psedomonas spp., p. multocida, mannheimia  spp., and actinobacills pleuropneumoniae, which suggests that these resistance genes were disseminated in these bacteria. although sulii and tetg genes were found previously in p. multocida or mannheimia spp., this is the first report on  the presence of catb2, aada1, and blap1 genes in bacteria of the family pasturellaceae. moreover, the aada1 and blap1 genes found in pjr2 were organized  into an integron structure, which is a site-specific recombination system capable of capturing and mobilizing antibiotic resistance genes. this is also the first report on the presence of an integron in bacteria of the family pasteurellaceae.  the presence of a p. multocida integron might facilitate the spreading of antibiotic resistance genes between p. multocida and other gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == immunologic reactivity of a lipopolysaccharide-protein complex of type a pasteurella multocida in mice.
AB  == the immunologic reactivity of a lipopolysaccharide (lps)-protein complex isolated from a potassium thiocyanate extract of a pasteurella multocida (capsular type a  and somatic type 3) strain was evaluated in mice. the lps-protein complex provided 100% protection in mice against a challenge with the homologous strain.  however, when the complex was fractionated into lps and protein moieties by phenol-water treatment, both components lacked immunogenicity. the complex and extracted components were mitogenic for mouse b lymphocytes with the protein moiety the most active. although immune serum against the lps-protein complex protected mice against challenge thereby indicating a role for humoral immunity,  the lps-protein complex of p. multocida was also found to induce cell-mediated immunity. this cell-mediated immunity was demonstrated in mice immunized with the complex by: (1). mitogenic responses of t lymphocytes, (2). induction of delayed  type hypersensitivity reaction in the hind footpads, and (3). enhanced resistance to challenge infection with salmonella enteritidis.

TI  == antigenic relationships within the genus salmonella as revealed by anti-salmonella enteritidis monoclonal antibodies.
AB  == a panel of 38 monoclonal antibodies (mabs) that react with outer membrane proteins (omps) of salmonella enteritidis was produced. on the basis of their binding pattern in elisa, the mabs were divided into three groups. the first group, consisting of 15 mabs, was found to be salmonella-specific as they did not cross-react with escherichia coli or pasteurella multocida. the second group of 15 mabs cross-reacted with e. coli but not with p. multocida, reflecting the closer antigenic relationship of e. coli with salmonella. the third group of 8 mabs cross-reacted with both e. coli and p. multocida, indicating that the antigenic determinants identified by these mabs are conserved in all the three genera. the antigenic relationship of the salmonella serovars (s. enteritidis, s. gallinarum, s. typhimurium, s. dublin, s. agona, s. indiana and s. choleraesuis)  was studied using omps prepared from them and the anti-s. enteritidis mabs. three mabs appeared to be specific for s. enteritidis as they did not cross-react with  any of the other salmonella serovars. twelve of the 38 mabs cross-reacted with all the serovars tested. six of these were specific to the salmonella genus as they did not cross-react with any of the other gram-negative bacteria tested. the reactivity pattern of the other mabs indicated that s. gallinarum was antigenically close to s. enteritidis, followed in order by s. dublin, s. agona,  s. typhimurium and s. indiana, whereas s. choleraesuis seemed to be antigenically quite distant from s. enteritidis.

TI  == bacteremia associated with naturally occuring acute coliform mastitis in dairy cows.
AB  == objective: to determine the incidence of bacteremia in dairy cows with naturally  occurring acute coliform mastitis (acm) with a wide range of disease severity. design: cohort study. animals: 144 dairy cows with acm from 6 herds. procedure: cows were examined at time of identification of acm (time 0) and classified as having mild, moderate, or severe mastitis on the basis of rectal temperature, hydration status, rumen contraction rate, and attitude. cows were reexamined at 24 or 48 hours. bacteriologic culturing of milk and blood (30 ml), cbc, and serum biochemical analysis were performed at each time point. appropriate samples were  obtained at a single point from herdmates without mastitis (controls) that were closely matched for lactation number and days since parturition. blood culture results were compared among severity groups and controls by use of chi2 tests, as was outcome of an acm episode for cows grouped by blood bacterial isolates. results: bacteria were isolated from 52 blood samples from 46 of 144 (32%) cows with acm, which was significantly more than control cows (11/156; 7.1%). group-1  isolates (escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter agglomerans, and salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium) were identified in 20 of 144 (14%) cows with acm and 0 of 156 control cows. group-1 isolates were identified in 4.3, 9.1, and 42% of cows classified as having mild, moderate, and severe acm, respectively. escherichia coli and k pneumoniae milk and blood isolates obtained from the same cow were of  the same genotype. bacillus spp were identified in 21 of 144 (15%) cows with acm, which was significantly more than control cows (3/156; 1.9%). thirty-five percent of cows with a group-1 isolate died during the mastitis episode. conclusions and  clinical relevance: results suggest that bacteremia develops in a substantial proportion of cows with acm. classification of severity of disease is important for establishment of effective treatment protocols; parenteral antimicrobial treatment may be indicated in cows with acm.

TI  == role of pasteurella multocida, pasteurella haemolytica and salmonella typhimurium porins on inducible nitric oxide release by murine macrophages.
AB  == the aim of this study was to verify whether pasteurella haemolytica, p. multocida and salmonella typhimurium porins could affect the inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) expression and nitric oxide (no) release by murine resident peritoneal macrophages in vitro. we also compared their effect with that elicited by p. haemolytica, p. multocida and s. typhimurium lipopolysaccharide (lps) whose biological activity is well known. variations in no release and inos mrna expression due to variable concentrations of porins were recorded and compared. we also investigated the synergism between bacterial products and interferon gamma (ifn-gamma). with this aim cells were incubated with porins together with murine rifn-gamma prior to assessing the presence of no in the supernatant and mrna analysis. porins in themselves were not able to induce no release by resident peritoneal macrophages. incubation of macrophages with ifn-gamma in the  presence of porins increased no release, whereas incubation in the presence of the arginine analog n(g)-monomethyl-l-arginine (nma) inhibited no release. the greatest no release was obtained using porins at a concentration of 5 microg/ml.  porins, together with ifn-gamma, were also able to upregulate the mrna expression of inos. our findings suggest that gram-negative porins are able to modulate inflammatory and immunological responses by affecting the release of no and the expression of inos gene in activated macrophages.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of chicken and turkey heterophil peptides chp1, chp2, thp1, and thp3.
AB  == four avian heterophil antimicrobial cationic peptides (chicken heterophil peptides 1 and 2, and turkey heterophil peptides 1 and 3) were evaluated for in vitro microbicidal activity against selected avian pathogens and human pathogens  which are harbored by birds. at concentrations of 16-2 micrograms/ml, all four avian peptides effected a greater than 90% reduction in the survival of candida albicans, salmonella enteriditis, and campylobacter jejuni. none of the peptides, including the known antimicrobial peptide protamine (used as a positive control), were able to reduce the survival of pasteurella multocida by 90% at the maximum peptide concentration (16 micrograms/ml) tested. at 16 micrograms/ml, the turkey  peptide thp3 did not effect a 90% reduction in survival of bordetella avium, escherichia coli, or salmonella typhimurium, while all of the other peptides tested were effective at this concentration or less. this peptide, thp3, does not share the same homologous amino acid sequence shared by the other three peptides. under our experimental conditions, none of the peptides neutralized infectious bronchitis virus, an enveloped coronavirus of chickens.

TI  == some aspects of the epidemiology and control of salmonella typhimurium infection  in outwintered suckler cows.
AB  == two outbreaks of salmonella typhimurium infections affected outwintered, spring-calving suckler cows in late pregnancy. the infections spread rapidly both within and between groups of stock on the affected farms, with morbidity in the infected groups varying from 14.5 per cent to over 60 per cent, and mortality in  adult cattle varying from 0 to 14.3 per cent. prophylactic measures included the  use of antibiotics and killed vaccines against escherichia coli, salmonella dublin, s typhimurium, and pasteurella multocida. in one outbreak, use was also made of a polyvalent serovaccine and hyperimmune serum against e coli, s typhimurium, and s dublin. in both outbreaks no new cases were reported in the affected groups after the administration of the second dose of vaccine, and there was no resurgence of disease on the affected farms within 18 months of the primary outbreaks.

TI  == in vitro activity of flumequine in comparison with several other antimicrobial agents against five pathogens isolated in calves in the netherlands.
AB  == the in vitro activity of flumequine in comparison with several other drugs was tested against 17 p. multocida, 16 p. haemolytica, 21 s. dublin, 21 s. typhimurium and 21 e. coli strains, isolated in (veal) calves in the netherlands. the mic50 of flumequine for the respective pasteurellas was 0.25 and 1 microgram/ml, for the salmonellas and e. coli 0.5 micrograms/ml. in comparison with flumequine, enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin showed higher in vitro activity,  with mic50 less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. decreased susceptibility of the pasteurellas was found for kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and doxycycline. the mic50 of minocycline for p. multocida was 0.5 micrograms/ml and there was no cross resistance with the other tetracyclines. p. multocida was very susceptible to ampicillin (mic50 less than or equal to 0.03 micrograms/ml), p. haemolytica, however, was 100% resistant to this drug. both pasteurellas were susceptible to cephalothin and approximately 50% of the strains of both bacteria were resistant  to chloramphenicol. the mic50 of either spiramycin or tylosin was greater than or equal to their respective breakpoint-mic values. both pasteurellas were susceptible to the combination of trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole. however, for p. multocida, the addition of sulphamethoxazole to trimethoprim had no synergistic effect on its mic. in comparison with trimethorpim, aditoprim was less potent. therefore only p. multocida was susceptible to aditoprim.

TI  == introduction and reisolation of selected gram-negative bacteria from fermented edible wastes.
AB  == a lactobacillus fermentation process, using edible food wastes, was tested for its ability to eliminate selected bacterial pathogens. this fermentation process  converts food wastes into a feed ingredient for animal consumption. six gram-negative bacterial pathogens of potential zoonotic importance were tested. these experimental organisms were: salmonella enteritidis serovar typhimurium, s  enteritidis serovar anatum, s cholerae-suis, yersinia enterocolitica, y pseudotuberculosis, and pasteurella multocida. each organism was introduced into  ground waste that had been previously inoculated with l acidophilus, and was mixed. this mixture was divided among 8 containers, and was incubated in duplicate at 5 c, 10 c, 20 c, and 30 c for 96 hours. the temperature of the reactant containers, reduction-oxidation potential, and ph were monitored. waste  samples were obtained initially and subsequently at 24-hour periods for 96 hours. qualitative and quantitative recovery attempts from each sample were made for the introduced gram-negative bacteria. pasteurella multocida and the s enteritidis serovars typhimurium and anatum survived the fermentation at 5 c and 10 c, but were killed after 48 hours at 20 c and 30 c. salmonella cholerae-suis survived at 5 c, but was destroyed by 72 hours at the remaining temperatures. yersinia enterocolitica was viable through 70 hours, but was killed by 96 hours. yersinia  pseudotuberculosis was not reisolated at any temperature.

TI  == shipping fever pasteurellosis and salmonellosis prophylaxis.
AB  == a water-in-oil emulsion adjuvanted combination shipping fever bacterin containing pasteurella multocida, p hemolytica, salmonella typhimurium and certain other species was effective in field use as a prophylactic agent against shipping fever pasteurellosis and salmonellosis. in trials using ranch calves it produced a greater antibody response than a comparable aluminum hydroxide adjuvanted bacterin. in critical 30-hour postvaccination challenge mouse tests it was superior to the conventional type bacterin and induced rapid and remarkable protection.

TI  == isolation of pathogens other than yersinia pestis during plague investigations.
AB  == from 1975 to 1978, 37 isolates of pasteurella multocida, 1 of salmonella enteriditis, and 5 of francisella tularensis were recovered from 42 mammalian specimens and 1 flea pool submitted for examination for evidence of infection with yersinia pestis. most of the specimens were collected during investigations  of either a human plague infection or a reported epizootic among rodent populations. all specimens were of species regularly or occasionally involved in  plague or tularemia cycles in nature and most were collected in areas of known plague or tularemia activity.

TI  == immunogenicity of r factor-carrying salmonella.
AB  == an increased frequency of rough cultures with associated reductions in mouse virulence was detected after r-factor transmission into strains of salmonella choleraesuis var. kunzendorf and s. typhimurium. all rough strains tested, with or without r factors, conferred protective immunity against challenge with homologous or heterologous species of salmonella, some of which contained r factors. although slight protection was afforded against challenge with staphylococcus aureus, the immunity was specific to the extent that immunized mice were fully susceptible to infections with klebsiella pneumoniae and pasteurella multocida.
