TI  == clostridium aestuarii sp. nov., from tidal flat sediment.
AB  == a strictly anaerobic, halophilic, motile, endospore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain hy-45-18(t), was isolated from a sediment sample of  a tidal flat in korea. the isolate produced butyric acid, propionic acid, glycerol and h(2) as fermentation end products from glucose. strain hy-45-18(t) is halophilic as it was unable to grow in the absence of sea salts. a 16s rrna gene sequence analysis clearly indicated that the tidal flat isolate is a member  of cluster i of the order clostridiales, which contains the type species of clostridium, clostridium butyricum. the closest phylogenetic neighbour of strain  hy-45-18(t) was clostridium ganghwense kctc 5146(t) (96.5 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity). several phenotypic characteristics can be readily used to differentiate the isolate from phylogenetically related clostridia. therefore, strain hy-45-18(t) represents a novel species of the genus clostridium, for which the name clostridium aestuarii sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is hy-45-18(t) (=imsnu 40129(t)=kctc 5147(t)=jcm 13194(t)).
