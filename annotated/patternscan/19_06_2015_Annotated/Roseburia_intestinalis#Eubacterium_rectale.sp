TI  == diets high in resistant starch and arabinoxylan modulate digestion processes and  scfa pool size in the large intestine and faecal microbial composition in pigs.
AB  == the effects of a high level of dietary fibre (df) either as arabinoxylan (ax) or  resistant starch (rs) on digestion processes, scfa concentration and pool size in various intestinal segments and on the microbial composition in the faeces were studied in a model experiment with pigs. a total of thirty female pigs (body weight 63.1 (sem 4.4) kg) were fed a low-df, high-fat western-style control diet  (wsd), an ax-rich diet (axd) or a rs-rich diet (rsd) for 3 weeks. diet significantly affected the digestibility of dm, protein, fat, nsp and nsp components, and the arabinose:xylose ratio, as well as the disappearance of nsp and ax in the large intestine. rs was mainly digested in the caecum. ax was digested at a slower rate than rs. the digesta from axd-fed pigs passed from the  ileum to the distal colon more than twice as fast as those from wsd-fed pigs, with those from rsd-fed pigs being intermediate (p< 0.001). axd feeding resulted  in a higher number of faecalibacterium prausnitzii, roseburia intestinalis, blautia coccoides-eubacterium rectale, bifidobacterium spp. and lactobacillus spp. in the faeces sampled at week 3 of the experimental period (p< 0.05). in the caecum, proximal and mid colon, axd feeding resulted in a 3- to 5-fold higher pool size of butyrate compared with wsd feeding, with the rsd being intermediate  (p <0.001). in conclusion, the rsd and axd differently affected digestion processes compared with the wsd, and the axd most efficiently shifted the microbial composition towards butyrogenic species in the faeces and increased the large-intestinal butyrate pool size.

TI  == senior thai fecal microbiota comparison between vegetarians and non-vegetarians using pcr-dgge and real-time pcr.
AB  == the fecal microbiotas were investigated in 13 healthy thai subjects using polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). among the 186 dna bands detected on the polyacrylamide gel, 37 bands were identified as representing 11 species: bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides  ovatus, bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides vulgatus, clostridium colicanis, eubacterium eligenes, e. rectale, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, megamonas funiformis, prevotella copri, and roseburia intestinalis, belonging mainly to the groups of bacteroides, prevotella, clostridium, and f. prausnitzii. a dendrogram  of the pcr-dgge divided the subjects; vegetarians and non-vegetarians. the fecal  microbiotas were also analyzed using a quantitative real-time pcr focused on bacteroides, bifidobacterium, enterobacteriaceae, clostrium coccoides-eubacterium rectale, c. leptum, lactobacillus, and prevotella. the nonvegetarian and vegetarian subjects were found to have significant differences in the high abundance of the bacteroides and prevotella genera, respectively. no significant  differences were found in the counts of bifidabacterium, enterobacteriaceae, c. coccoides-e. rectale group, c. leptum group, and lactobacillus. therefore, these  findings on the microbiota of healthy thais consuming different diets could provide helpful data for predicting the health of south east asians with similar  diets.

TI  == butyrate-producing clostridium cluster xiva species specifically colonize mucins  in an in vitro gut model.
AB  == the human gut is colonized by a complex microbiota with multiple benefits. although the surface-attached, mucosal microbiota has a unique composition and potential to influence human health, it remains difficult to study in vivo. therefore, we performed an in-depth microbial characterization (human intestinal  tract chip (hitchip)) of a recently developed dynamic in vitro gut model, which simulates both luminal and mucosal gut microbes (mucosal-simulator of human intestinal microbial ecosystem (m-shime)). inter-individual differences among human subjects were confirmed and microbial patterns unique for each individual were preserved in vitro. furthermore, in correspondence with in vivo studies, bacteroidetes and proteobacteria were enriched in the luminal content while firmicutes rather colonized the mucin layer, with clostridium cluster xiva accounting for almost 60% of the mucin-adhered microbiota. of the many acetate and/or lactate-converting butyrate producers within this cluster, roseburia intestinalis and eubacterium rectale most specifically colonized mucins. these 16s rrna gene-based results were confirmed at a functional level as butyryl-coa:acetate-coa transferase gene sequences belonged to different species  in the luminal as opposed to the mucin-adhered microbiota, with roseburia species governing the mucosal butyrate production. correspondingly, the simulated mucosal environment induced a shift from acetate towards butyrate. as not only inter-individual differences were preserved but also because compared with conventional models, washout of relevant mucin-adhered microbes was avoided, simulating the mucosal gut microbiota represents a breakthrough in modeling and mechanistically studying the human intestinal microbiome in health and disease. finally, as mucosal butyrate producers produce butyrate close to the epithelium,  they may enhance butyrate bioavailability, which could be useful in treating diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  == gut microbiome composition is linked to whole grain-induced immunological improvements.
AB  == the involvement of the gut microbiota in metabolic disorders, and the ability of  whole grains to affect both host metabolism and gut microbial ecology, suggest that some benefits of whole grains are mediated through their effects on the gut  microbiome. nutritional studies that assess the effect of whole grains on both the gut microbiome and human physiology are needed. we conducted a randomized cross-over trial with four-week treatments in which 28 healthy humans consumed a  daily dose of 60 g of whole-grain barley (wgb), brown rice (br), or an equal mixture of the two (br+wgb), and characterized their impact on fecal microbial ecology and blood markers of inflammation, glucose and lipid metabolism. all treatments increased microbial diversity, the firmicutes/bacteroidetes ratio, and the abundance of the genus blautia in fecal samples. the inclusion of wgb enriched the genera roseburia, bifidobacterium and dialister, and the species eubacterium rectale, roseburia faecis and roseburia intestinalis. whole grains, and especially the br+wgb treatment, reduced plasma interleukin-6 (il-6) and peak postprandial glucose. shifts in the abundance of eubacterium rectale were associated with changes in the glucose and insulin postprandial response. interestingly, subjects with greater improvements in il-6 levels harbored significantly higher proportions of dialister and lower abundance of coriobacteriaceae. in conclusion, this study revealed that a short-term intake of whole grains induced compositional alterations of the gut microbiota that coincided with improvements in host physiological measures related to metabolic dysfunctions in humans.

TI  == arabinoxylans and inulin differentially modulate the mucosal and luminal gut microbiota and mucin-degradation in humanized rats.
AB  == the endogenous gut microbiota affects the host in many ways. prebiotics should favour beneficial intestinal microbes and thus improve host health. in this study, we investigated how a novel class of potential prebiotic long-chain arabinoxylans (lc-ax) and the well-established prebiotic inulin (in) modulate the gut microbiota of humanized rats. six weeks after axenic rats were inoculated with a human faecal microbiota, their colonic microbiota was similar to this inoculum ( approximately 70%), whereas their caecal microbiota was enriched with  verrucomicrobia and firmicutes concomitant with lower abundance of bacteroidetes. moreover, different bifidobacterium species colonized the lumen (b. adolescentis) and mucus (b. longum and b. bifidum). both lc-ax and in increased scfa levels and induced a shift from acetate towards health-promoting propionate and butyrate respectively. by applying a high-resolution phylogenetic micro-array (hitchip) at the site of fermentation (caecum), in and lc-ax were shown to stimulate bacterial groups with known butyrate-producers (roseburia intestinalis, eubacterium rectale, anaerostipes caccae) and bifidobacteria (b. longum) respectively. prebiotic administration also resulted in lower caecal abundances of the mucin-degrading akkermansia muciniphila and potentially more mucin production by  the host. both factors might explain the increased caecal mucin levels for lc-ax  (threefold) and in (sixfold). these mucins were degraded along the colon, resulting in high faecal abundances of akkermansia muciniphila for lc-ax and especially in-treated rats. finally, the microbial changes caused an adaptation period for the host with less weight gain, after which the host fine-tuned the interaction with this altered microbiota. our results demonstrate that next to in, lc-ax are promising prebiotic compounds by stimulating production of health-promoting metabolites by specific microbes in the proximal regions. further, prebiotic supplementation shifted mucin degradation to distal regions, where mucin-degraders may produce beneficial metabolites (e.g. propionate by akkermansia muciniphila), so that prebiotics may potentially improve gut health along the entire length of the intestine.

TI  == detection of possible ai-2-mediated quorum sensing system in commensal intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the vibrio harveyi strain bb170-autoinducer bioassay was used to detect possible  quorum sensing autoinducer-2 molecule (ai-2) in culture fluids of commensal intestinal bacteria. culture fluids of bacteroides vulgatus, clostridium proteoclasticum, escherichia coli, eubacterium rectale, lachnospira multipara, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, roseburia intestinalis, ruminococcus albus and ruminococcus flavefaciens contained ai-2-like molecules. the pcr bands from some  of the tested strains could be also amplified using primers designed for the luxs gene. these findings suggest that ai-2 is present in the gastrointestinal tract;  however, it has not yet been proved whether it is used for bacterial cell-to-cell communication.

TI  == studies on the effect of system retention time on bacterial populations colonizing a three-stage continuous culture model of the human large gut using fish techniques.
AB  == fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to quantitate bacteria growing in a three-stage continuous culture system inoculated with human faeces, operated at two system retention times (60 and 20 h). twenty-three different 16s rrna gene oligonucleotide probes of varying specificities were used to detect bacteria. organisms belonging to genera bacteroides and bifidobacterium, together with the  eubacterium rectale/clostridium coccoides group, the atopobium, faecalibacterium  prausnitzii and eubacterium cylindroides groups, as well as the segmented filamentous bacteria, the roseburia intestinalis group and lactic acid bacteria,  were all present in high numbers in the continuous culture system. other groups and species such as ruminococci and enterobacteria also persisted in the model, though not always at levels that allowed reliable quantitation. some organisms such as streptococci and corynebacteria, present in the faecal inoculum, did not  colonize the system. other probes specific for eubacterium lentum and for members of the genus desulfovibrio did not detect these organisms at any time. short chain fatty acid production was always highest in vessel i of the continuous culture system, however, a marked increase in acetate formation and a reduction in butyrate production occurred when system retention time was reduced to 20 h, which correlated with reductions in the numbers of butyrate-producing roseburia.

TI  == lactate-utilizing bacteria, isolated from human feces, that produce butyrate as a major fermentation product.
AB  == the microbial community of the human colon contains many bacteria that produce lactic acid, but lactate is normally detected only at low concentrations (<5 mm)  in feces from healthy individuals. it is not clear, however, which bacteria are mainly responsible for lactate utilization in the human colon. here, bacteria able to utilize lactate and produce butyrate were identified among isolates obtained from 10(-8) dilutions of fecal samples from five different subjects. out of nine such strains identified, four were found to be related to eubacterium hallii and two to anaerostipes caccae, while the remaining three represent a new  species within clostridial cluster xiva based on their 16s rrna sequences. significant ability to utilize lactate was not detected in the butyrate-producing species roseburia intestinalis, eubacterium rectale, or faecalibacterium prausnitzii. whereas e. hallii and a. caccae strains used both d- and l-lactate,  the remaining strains used only the d form. addition of glucose to batch cultures prevented lactate utilization until the glucose became exhausted. however, when two e. hallii strains and one a. caccae strain were grown in separate cocultures  with a starch-utilizing bifidobacterium adolescentis isolate, with starch as the  carbohydrate energy source, the l-lactate produced by b. adolescentis became undetectable and butyrate was formed. such cross-feeding may help to explain the  reported butyrogenic effect of certain dietary substrates, including resistant starch. the abundance of e. hallii in particular in the colonic ecosystem suggests that these bacteria play important roles in preventing lactate accumulation.

TI  == effects of alternative dietary substrates on competition between human colonic bacteria in an anaerobic fermentor system.
AB  == duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different carbohydrate energy sources. a panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16s rrna sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii, ruminococcus flavefaciens-ruminococcus bromii, eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides, and eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of  bacteria related to r. flavefaciens-r. bromii and e. cylindroides. the ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. the roseburia-related strain a2-183(f) was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex  carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by  cross-feeding. in contrast, roseburia intestinalis l1-82(r) and eubacterium sp. strain a2-194(r) survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that a2-194(r) was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. these results suggest that many low-g+c-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics  from their effects in vitro.

TI  == roseburia intestinalis sp. nov., a novel saccharolytic, butyrate-producing bacterium from human faeces.
AB  == five strains of butyrate-producing, anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria were isolated from human faecal material. these strains were slightly curved rods that showed motility by means of multiple subterminal flagella. the dna g + c content  of the strains was 29-31 mol%. a detailed investigation of the phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics of the strains revealed that they represent a novel  species of anaerobic, low-g+c-content, butyrate-producing bacterium that shows net acetate utilization during growth on media containing carbohydrates and short-chain fatty acids. the 16s rrna gene sequences of the five isolates were determined and they confirmed that these strains were closely related to each other. phylogenetic analysis indicated that the most closely related species are  eubacterium rectale, eubacterium oxidoreducens and roseburia cecicola, members of cluster xiva of the clostridium subphylum of gram-positive bacteria, although they share less than 95% sequence identity with the novel strains. it is proposed that a novel species, roseburia intestinalis sp. nov., be created, with strain l1-82t (= dsm 14610t = ncimb 13810t) as the type strain.
