TI  == reduction of ferredoxin or oxygen by flavin-based electron bifurcation in megasphaera elsdenii.
AB  == over 50 years ago, it was reported that, in the anaerobic rumen bacterium megasphaera elsdenii, the reduction of crotonyl-coa to butyryl-coa by nadh involved an electron transferring flavoprotein (etf) as mediator [baldwin rl, milligan lp (1964) biochim biophys acta 92, 421-432]. purification and spectroscopic characterization revealed that this etf contained 2 fad, whereas, in the etfs from aerobic and facultative bacteria, one fad is replaced by amp. recently we detected a similar system in the related anaerobe acidaminococcus fermentans that differed in the requirement of additional ferredoxin as electron  acceptor. the whole process was established as flavin-based electron bifurcation  in which the exergonic reduction of crotonyl-coa by nadh mediated by etf + butyryl-coa dehydrogenase (bcd) was coupled to the endergonic reduction of ferredoxin also by nadh. in the present study, we demonstrate that, under anaerobic conditions, etf + bcd from m. elsdenii bifurcate as efficiently as etf  + bcd from a. fermentans. under the aerobic conditions used in the study by baldwin and milligan and in the presence of catalytic amounts of crotonyl-coa or  butyryl-coa, however, etf + bcd act as nadh oxidase producing superoxide and h2 o2 , whereas ferredoxin is not required. we hypothesize that, during bifurcation, oxygen replaces ferredoxin to yield superoxide. in addition, the formed butyryl-coa is re-oxidized by a second oxygen molecule to crotonyl-coa, resulting in a stoichiometry of 2 nadh consumed and 2 h2 o2 formed. as a result of the production of reactive oxygen species, electron bifurcation can be regarded as an achilles' heel of anaerobes when exposed to air.

TI  == diet influences the ecology of lactic acid bacteria and escherichia coli along the digestive tract of cattle: neural networks and 16s rdna.
AB  == in this manuscript, the authors have sought to gain a better understanding of the interactions between escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from rogossa mrs agar along the digestive tract of grain- and forage-fed cattle.  e. coli from cattle receiving a high-grain diet were more numerous (p<0.05) than  from the high-forage diet and the highest numbers were in the faeces. isolates on rogossa mrs agar were always greater in the high-grain diet (p<0.05) and contained a significant number of lab. a random set of rogossa mrs agar colonies  was selected and artificial neural networks were used to develop a relationship between colony description and species which was validated using sequence analysis (16s rdna). the neural networks correctly predicted species in more than 80 % of cases and was composed, primarily, of lactobacillus vitulinus, lactobacillus ruminis, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus bovis, acidaminococcus fermentans and megasphaera elsdenii. in conjunction with statistical diversity indices, it was demonstrated that diversity in the high-fibre diet was always lower and was a consequence of the dominance of str. bovis. in contrast, the diversity in the high-grain diet was greater (p<0.05) and was a consequence of the decline in str. bovis. these data demonstrate that there is a positive relationship between coliform and lab isolates throughout the digestive tract of cattle, and diet is the major factor regulating bacterial composition.

TI  == rapid diagnosis of anaerobic gram-positive cocci by salt tolerance.
AB  == the maximum salt tolerance was 2.5% in cases of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptococcus prevotii, 3% in ruminococcus albus, 4% in acidaminococcus fermentans, peptococcus niger and megasphaera elsdenii and 5% in peptococcus magnus. the biochemical tests being largely inactive and time consuming the findings of salt  tolerance if combined with those of morphological data provide clue to the rapid  identification of gram-positive anaerobic cocci.

TI  == susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria isolated from animals with ovine foot rot  to 28 antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the agar dilution method was used to determine the inhibitory activities of 28 antimicrobial agents against 35 strains of the genus peptostreptococcus, 4 strains of the species peptococcus niger, 20 strains of the species megasphaera elsdenii, 7 strains from the species acidaminococcus fermentans, 8 strains of the genus clostridium, 11 strains of the genus eubacterium, and 1 strain of the species propionibacterium acidipropionici, all of which were isolated from 125 clinical cases of ovine foot rot between january 1987 and december 1988. the three unreidopenicillins studied proved to be the most active antimicrobial agents, with a high percentage of strains being susceptible at a concentration of 64 micrograms/ml. penicillin g, ampicillin, and the three cephalosporins studied  also had good activity. fosfomycin showed a high degree of activity among the 116 anaerobic bacteria tested.

TI  == isolation of acidaminococcus fermentans and megasphaera elsdenii from normal human feces.
AB  == fecal bacterial cultures from 40 normal humans yielded megasphaera elsdenii from  four individuals and acidaminococcus fermentans from 10 individuals, with two individuals having both organisms.
